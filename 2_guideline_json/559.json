Since 2013 ENISA started providing  training activities to the European CERT community. While these efforts were widely used and  appreciated by the CERTs and other communities, the challenges and circumstances have changed  and are evolving rapidly. Since ENISA started its training and support activities, the importance of  managing information security incidents has grown to become a top priority for companies,  government institutions, universities, schools, and EU Member States. CERTs have emerged in all  sectors and countries, and the number of national and governmental CERTs is continuing to grow. As  ENISA and numerous CERTs provide trainings to provide constant influx of new information security  professionals, and to enhance the skills of existing team members, the effect of training needs to be  long-lasting. Furthermore the field of CERT operations is highly specialised, and not widely covered by  trainings. To fill in the gap community frequently organises workshops where experts “from the field”  are asked to educate other members. Therefore the “Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies”  was created to provide guidance on how to create, organise and conduct trainings that would be  remembered, valued, and have long-lasting effect.  It is important to note that the contents of the good practice guide originate from the knowledgebase  and experience of the authors, reviewers, and contributors who have created, organised, and  conducted trainings to CERT community and also to the wider audience.  3 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/transits-training  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events  5 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/transits-training https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  2  2 Introduction  Training is everything. The peach was once a bitter almond; cauliflower is nothing, but  cabbage with a college education. [Mark Twain, 1835-1910]  Why write a guide about training methodologies when there are so many resources and theories on  “trainings” and “trainers” already?  There are two reasons. Firstly, to bring the \"field experience\" of being a trainer6  to the target audience  (see below), coming from highly experienced trainers who are both experts in information security  and well versed in the concept of “training” itself.  Secondly, to condense this experience and knowledge in a guide, which will help trainers in the field  to expand their skills and raise their awareness of the processes of teaching and learning.  The goal is to guide both novice and experienced trainers to design and deliver trainings of any size or  type, and to make these trainings more successful, more “fun” and with better and longer lasting  results. This practical guidance is backed up by the presentation of essential theories and research in  this area, including references. This will enable trainers to learn and study these topics in-depth.  2.1 Target audience  The target audience includes all those in the information security and CERT area who design or deliver  “trainings” in the broadest sense of the word. Training includes a process where knowledge or skills  are being purposefully taught, shown or transferred live7  to one or more people, who are receiving  the training. Trainings include lectures, teaching, instruction, practice sessions, presentations, hands- on trainings, guided discussion, directed exercises, etc.  The guide has been written bearing in mind fairly traditional “classroom type” trainings, as these are  still the most common ones in use – however without any limitation to specific types of delivery  methods. Also, the principles described can effortlessly be extended to all types of “trainings” as  indicated above.  Thus whenever the word “training” is used in this guide, it needs to be appreciated and applied in the  broadest sense of the word.  Examples given in the guide will in most cases be relevant for the primary target audience, however  those too can be easily generalized by a creative reader, and used to his/her own benefit.  Finally: ENISA’s scope is the EU, especially the national and governmental levels. Therefore this guide  is written with that in mind. However, like many of ENISA’s good practice guides, the usefulness of  this guide is in no way limited to that constituency only.  2.2 How to use this guide  We recommend reading this guide from beginning to end, the first time. After which, you may wish to  use the guide as a reference and skip to specific items/topics. If you are in a hurry (like preparing for  a training) you can just read the short introductions to chapters three and four and then continue with  the chapters after that. Make sure to come back to these two chapters later though, as we guarantee  they will give you food for thought that will help to make you a better trainer.  6It is important to note that scope is not limited to “information security trainer”.  7 Live can be in person as well as through videoconference or chat. The limitation to live trainings does not mean that the learnings from  this guide would not be applicable to e.g. more advanced online trainings (using more communication vectors than just an image of the  trainer), or “written” courses. Many of them will be applicable, one way or the other. However, advanced online and written c ourses are so  different in many ways, and such challenging themes onto themselves, that we cannot and will not pretend to cover them here “on the fly”.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  3  3 Learning and teaching strategies  People are different: they learn, take in information and communicate in different ways. Not everyone  thinks like you do. Knowing this will enable you to become a better trainer. [Jim Buddin, The GÉANT  Association, Training Coordinator] 8  In this chapter we provide you with essential ideas on how people learn in different ways, and how  you should cater for those different needs in your training sessions. We will start with a theoretical  framework (Kolb), which is the introduction to the 4MAT system that you can readily apply in all your  trainings, presentations and training materials.  3.1 Learning by doing  David A. Kolb pioneered the idea of experiential learning, which is learning by reflection on doing9 .  Experiential learning’s focus is the individual learning process.  Note that Kolb suggests that learning is a circular process, and that the best learning is achieved when  going through the whole circle repeatedly. Experiential learning is powerful, but does require self- initiative, the intention to learn and be an active participant in learning, so it is not just theory.  Kolb further introduced four learning styles on top of his experiential learning diagram, suggesting  that there are four types of learners: divergers, assimilators, convergers and accommodators. We  provide you with a diagram here that explains this concept well10:  8 The book “Design For How People Learn” by Julie Dirksen is a highly recommended read in this area  9 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_learning offers a good introduction. On David Kolb’s commercial  website there is a useful set of references in http://learningfromexperience.com/research/  10 For more information see e.g. http://www.simplypsychology.org/learning-kolb.html  Figure 1: Experiential Learning (Kolb)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_learning http://learningfromexperience.com/research/ http://www.simplypsychology.org/learning-kolb.html  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  4  Note that the texts in orange colour (why, what, etc.) are not part of Kolb’s theory but point ahead to  McCarthy’s 4MAT model, which will be described in the next paragraph.  3.2 The 4MAT Model  The ideas of Kolb and others are interesting and insightful but not so easy to apply in real life. Credits  go to Bernice McCarthy who further developed these concepts into the 4MAT model that you as a  trainer can easily implement and that will get you results 11. We highly recommend that you use 4MAT,  and that is why we present it not only here, but also later in this guide to explain how you can use the  model in real life.  McCarthy proposes four types of learners, and her characterisation is based on Kolb’s:  11  An easily accessible presentation of 4MAT is found on McCarthy’s commercial website under  http://www.aboutlearning.com/what-is-4mat . The original book is “About Learning Inc.; 1st Ed. edition (May  1996)” by Bernice McCarthy. Other useful references found at http://www.4mat.eu/theory-studies- research.aspx .  Figure 2: Learning Styles (Kolb)  http://www.aboutlearning.com/what-is-4mat http://www.4mat.eu/theory-studies-research.aspx http://www.4mat.eu/theory-studies-research.aspx  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  5  The four types of learners are labelled as WHY, WHAT, HOW and WHAT IF people. The percentages in  the diagram indicate how what percentages of people fall into those categories, according to  McCarthy. These percentages show that you can expect a fair percentage of your students to be in  each of the four categories, which means you must cater your trainings for all four types of learners.  It is important to remember that any model is just that – a model, and not reality. People are not  bound by the 4MAT model and can therefore never simply be classified and told “you are a WHY  person!”. It is about learning preferences – most of us fall into more than one category, sometimes  even all four. But it is also true that most of us do prefer one of these four over the others.  Exercise, most useful in a trainer’s training: Explain the 4MAT model to your trainees. Assign the four  categories to corners of the training room – a WHY corner, WHAT corner, etc. Tell your trainees to go  to the corner that most expresses their learning style – and to discuss with one another how they  understand and perceive that style. You may find typical things, like in the WHY corner people may ask  “but WHY are we doing this?”, whereas in the HOW corner the process of discussion usually flows quite  easily. Finally, while leaving all of the trainees in their corners, have a plenary discussion about the four  categories. Stress that the “map is not the territory” and that these categories are useful concepts but  that no man is bound to just one category!  An important concept in the application of the 4MAT model is that as a trainer you need to serve the  four categories in a specific order: WHY first, then WHAT, next HOW and finally WHAT IF. There are  good reasons for this which you can find in detail in the references provided. In essence, you will “lose”  the WHY people if you don’t start out by explaining WHY they are there listening to you. The WHAT  and HOW people are used to being more patient, and to first explain the theory (WHAT) and then the  process of application (HOW) is natural. The WHAT IF naturally includes questions and thus is best  placed at the end.  You can apply 4MAT to most training, education or presentation, including your five minute high level  presentation to the Board of Directors! It’s a very useful way to logically organise the content you  Figure 3: The 4MAT System (McCarthy)  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  6  want to present, at the same time reach as many types of learners as you possibly can, while doing  that in the most effective order.  For extended trainings, you need to organise the content in more topics. Then you can have an overall  4MAT applied to the whole training, starting with the WHY. And then per topic you can apply 4MAT  again. If you present a model which has a bigger number of subtopics, and each one of these needs to  be practiced – then you can adapt the 4MAT system in a way as to do WHY, then a short overview  WHAT, next a WHAT and HOW for each of the subtopics, concluding with the overall WHAT IF.  3.3 VARK Model  Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) models human communication and provides techniques which  help improve the effectiveness of communication at all levels (not just words.) and also provides  therapeutic applications, mostly for achieving behavioural changes12 . A result of NLP is the idea that  people have a “preferred” sense among the five senses – in most cases visual, auditory or kinaesthetic  (feeling via the body) – one that they also engage in learning. The suggestion is that people who prefer  visual, need especially visual cues for learning. The same goes for people with an auditory and  kinesthetic (feeling) preference. And a fourth category is added for those who prefer internal dialogue  and words. The teacher can accommodate all categories by including in a training not only auditory  and word elements (the traditional lecture: listening to the professor and reading a book), but also  visuals (whiteboard, flipcharts, videos) and kinesthetic elements (learning by doing, feeling, trying it  out). Any good training should be a mix of these four. For learning purposes this was synthesized by  Neil Fleming in the VARK model13.  Figure 4: Learning Preferences: (VARK Model)  12 Most NLP references are commercial. A good introduction to NLP is “Introducing NLP: Psychological Skills for  Understanding and Influencing People”, by Joseph O'Connor and John Seymour (Conari Press, revised edition  2011).  13  See e.g. http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=categories for the VARK model and for Fleming  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_D._Fleming  http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=categories https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_D._Fleming  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  7  3.4 10,000 hours  K. Anders Ericsson performed research among kids playing the violin since early childhood, which  indicated that the highest forms of competency is reached mainly as a result of many hours of study.  What he found was that around 10,000 hours of study before the age of twenty led to the highest  forms of competence14.  Subsequent generalisation and popularisation (by Malcolm Gladwell et al.) of Ericsson’s research  findings into a 10,000 hours “rule” has led to much heated debate and seems to be questionable.  However you will find it no surprise that practice, practice and more practice yields the master. This  applies to you as a trainer as well.  4 Training methods  Train, don’t strain. [Arthur Lydiar, 1917-2004, professional athlete and coach]  In this chapter you will learn that old style lectures, only talking from front to “class”, are not effective  and that instead you need to give your trainees a variety of training methods. That way you can  optimize the chance of keeping their attention, and thus increase learning.  4.1 Span of attention  Old style lectures whereby a professor just talks and talks in front of his students are almost extinct  nowadays. And that’s a good thing, as the span of attention for the learning style “just sit there and  listen” lasts less than half an hour. The following diagram is an illustration of that15:  Figure 5: Effectiveness of Traditional Lecture  4.2 Training Methods  It is recommended to use a variety of training methods to reach your students, and make sure to do  that in a diverse manner. Make sure there is enough to do, write, see and hear – in that order! The  14 http://www.psy.fsu.edu/faculty/ericsson/ericsson.exp.perf.html  15 See e.g. McKeachie’s Teaching Tips, Wilbert McKeachie, 14th edition (2013). This kind of research has been  repeated many times over, the results are approximately the same.  http://www.psy.fsu.edu/faculty/ericsson/ericsson.exp.perf.html  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  8  number of methods you can adopt is actually quite high. See the following diagram containing some  suggestions in this regard:  Figure 6: Training Methods  4.3 The Learning Pyramid  The ineffectiveness of the traditional lecture style, but also of just “reading a book”, is apparent in the  learning pyramid16 , presented below. The pyramid shows that a training which combines “hearing”  16 The learning pyramid is widely attributed to the US National Training Laboratories (NTL) – this seems to be an  urban legend however. The idea for the pyramid probably comes from Edgar Dale in his book Audio-Visual  Methods in Teaching, Dryden Press (1954) – but it’s unclear where the percentages come from, though the NTL  seems to claim they are based on their research – only they can’t find that research. See  http://homepages.gold.ac.uk/polovina/learnpyramid/about.htm which also contains the image that we  presented. As the plausibility of the diagram is mostly undisputed, we decided to present it here as it does  contain valuable ideas.  http://homepages.gold.ac.uk/polovina/learnpyramid/about.htm  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  9  and “seeing” already achieves much better results, but that the most effective training methods  include “seeing and writing” as in workshops, and “doing” as in going through the steps one by one.  Looking at the learning pyramid, you can see that seeing is fairly effective, but doing and teaching are  the best vehicles for learning and remembering. In the medical world the “adagium” See One – Do  One – Teach One is often used as an application of this17. The idea is simple: first see how something  is done. Then do it yourself. And finally teach it to others. This method has proven to be very effective  for example in medical educations. There is some critique on it saying that See One and Do One are  not enough to gain sufficient learning to be able to teach one. This will be correct for learning complex  matters or techniques, but just leads to a small attenuation of the “adagium”: See Many – Do Many –  Teach One. The essential idea stays the same.  As CERT community touches wide range of areas, consisting of legal, operational, and technical  challenges, it is highly recommended that trainers seeks to touch the very bottom of the learning  pyramid where the effectiveness is the highest. As practice is often the most time consuming part, the  trainer should consider the available time, and cover less topics more in depth.  17 See e.g. http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2003/12/ccas3-0312.html  Figure 7: Learning Pyramid  http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2003/12/ccas3-0312.html  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  10  5 How to be a trainer  Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or  excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do.  Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit. [Aristotle, 384-322 BCE]  Before asking how to become a trainer, we should ask, “why be a trainer?”  5.1 Motivation  The basic motivation of any trainer should be to want to share experience and knowledge with their  trainees. This applies both to a professional trainer, as well as to ad hoc trainers18 . Motivation for  ENISA to support the trainings is to ensure that every EU member state has well-functioning national  and governmental CERT. In 2012 a roadmap was created to provide more proactive and efficient CERT  training19.  The reasons why a trainer wants to share his experience and knowledge can be one or more of the  following:  - The lack of well-trained people in a specific area and the trainer seeks to address this (an  example is the CERT community: as it is rare to find dedicated CERT education in schools or universities  to cover the full range of CERT services in depth20, the CERTs themselves organise trainings to fill this  gap).  - Specific/specialised skills need to be fostered e.g. inside an organisation or team (for example  in IT forensics skills).  - The need for greater understanding of terminology, concepts, and ideas: this will benefit the  effectiveness of future communication, operations etc.  - Gauging his own skills and experience, and learning new things in the process: training people  confronts the trainer with his own understanding and grasp of a topic. Ideally a trainer will be two  logical/experience “levels” or higher above that of their audience21. However, a trainer who is not that  advanced, can still be a very good trainer as long as he communicates well with his students and  realizes his limitations. Also, some of the most knowledgeable experts are not the best trainers in their  area of expertise. It is preferable to be a good and enthusiastic trainer to knowing “the last bit of  everything”.  - Having a new idea of great potential and wanting to share it with others; in that case  excellence as a trainer is less of an issue; enthusiasm and vision are compensating the lack of training  skills.  18 If you think you are only a trainer because your supervisor assigned you to the task and you don’t feel self- motivated, then read this guide carefully and put the recommendations into practice. Practice and be well  prepared. And you may or may not find that training people is great fun. Give yourself time to observe and enjoy  the process, and you will surprise yourself.  19  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise/roadmap-to-provide-more-proactive-and- efficient-cert-training/at_download/fullReport  20 http://www.cert.org/incident-management/services.cfm  21 Being a few levels higher than your students is a well-known qualitative concept. We will not endeavour an  exact definition here. Use your gut feeling, as in the following: when you don’t know something you are at level  0. When you learn it for the first time, you reach level one. When you have worked and struggled with it long  enough, you reach level 2. When you see the structure behind it and understand both that and the details, and  can explain it in simple terms, you are at level 3 or higher.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise/roadmap-to-provide-more-proactive-and-efficient-cert-training/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise/roadmap-to-provide-more-proactive-and-efficient-cert-training/at_download/fullReport  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  11  Would you rather be a professional full-time trainer, or an ad hoc one? Remember that \"sharing\" is  basic to being a trainer. Of course a professional trainer will have considerable training and content  wisdom to share, however the ad hoc trainer, who 90% of the time practices what he teaches,  sometimes has an advantage when it comes to real-life experience. And real-life experience is  probably THE most effective way to gain credibility with trainees. We invite you to tell tales of real  events – and just notice how comfortable it is to apply the 4MAT system to such stories.  There are plenty of good reasons to be a trainer. Yet even when you may not see yourself as an  excellent trainer, remember that being in front of an audience does not mean that you have to know  the answers to all possible questions. You are simply the one standing in front of the audience sharing  your learning, experience and events you have witnessed from close by. Being able to talk about your  experiences in plain language is a great opportunity for information sharing. And by doing it more  often, and acquiring trainer skills, you will grow from consciously competent to both consciously and  unconsciously competent over time22.  5.2 Education & training  There is no clearly defined education or training path to become a great trainer in IT Security. There  are all sorts of content-oriented training paths (like CISSP, or CISM), there are specialised subject  matter trainings (like TRANSITS I and II, or classes in topics as forensics, etc.), but when you ask \"how  do I become a trainer\", there is often no easy answer.23 Additionally the goal of certified knowledge  serves a purpose of ensuring, that the holder of certificate has passed the minimum requirements  required in the certification process. Specialised trainings on the other hand most commonly lead the  participant into the depths of a narrow field of expertise showing best practices on how could the best  results be achieved.  If you already are experienced and knowledgeable in your area of expertise, and you are motivated to  become a trainer, then you are recommended to:  - read, understand, and practice, a training guide like this one24;  - read more about training and communication (this guide will give you plenty of references);  - learn from successful trainers by talking with them, as they enjoy to share the experience with  like-minded people.  If you are in Europe and work with the CERT community, then we can also suggest that you may want  to follow a TRANSITS training to \"see how it is done\", and attend a TRANSITS Train-the-trainer course.  You may even want to become a TRANSITS25  trainer afterwards and make your experience available  to a wider audience!  22 About the “Four stages of competence” see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence  23 Most universities offer a professional development scheme for their employees, which will most likely  including a trainer’s training. Outside this, a good commercial trainer training is e.g.  http://shop.cipd.co.uk/shop/cipd-training/courses-qualifications/learning-talent/training-delivery/foundation- course-for-trainers ; another excellent training is http://www.nlpcoaching.com/nlp-trainers-training/ , however  this requires prior qualification as NLP Practitioner  24 Another take on how to become an excellent presenter is found in the recommended book: “Presenting  Magically: Transforming Your Stage Presence with NLP”, by Tad James and David Shephard (Crown House  Publishing, 2001)  25 For TRANSITS trainings see http://www.terena.org/activities/transits/  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence http://shop.cipd.co.uk/shop/cipd-training/courses-qualifications/learning-talent/training-delivery/foundation-course-for-trainers http://shop.cipd.co.uk/shop/cipd-training/courses-qualifications/learning-talent/training-delivery/foundation-course-for-trainers http://www.nlpcoaching.com/nlp-trainers-training/ http://www.terena.org/activities/transits/  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  12  5.3 Communication during the training  Body language, tone of voice and language (the words you speak) are vital to the success of your  training. Surprisingly enough for many, research indicates that the success of communication depends  for 55% on body language, 38% on tone of voice and only 7% on the actual words spoken26.  Body language includes how you stand, walk, sit, and wave your hands. An upright stance, chin up (not  talking to the floor but to your audience), back straight but relaxed conveys confidence in yourself. It  also opens up your lungs for the kind of good breathing that you need to carry your voice and to keep  doing that for maybe even hours. Face it: if you don't show confidence in your posture, then who's  going to believe you? Body position is an unconscious process that you need to bring into your  awareness at first to learn and use your body language.27  In the pictures you see an example of very  uninspiring language, and the opposite, a relaxed and good stance.  Tone of voice is almost as important to the success of your communication. Within the natural range  of your voice, experiment with variations in pitch (higher or lower), loudness and speed. Discover that  loudness and speed should also depend on the venue you are in, whether you use amplification  (microphone) and if you train people in their own language or not. If you are not experienced in  hearing how you \"sound\" in a room, then ask someone else to sit there and give feedback. Above all  a successful trainer sounds confident yet approachable and inviting. There is no clear cut recipe how  to achieve this. Preparing well certainly helps you feel confident and sound confident. Listen to other  speakers and trainers you will soon start noticing the differences.  Finally, words may only be 7% of the success of communication, but to convey meaning as a trainer  you cannot do without them. If you are the expert and give training in your own language, then the  words will usually flow. However, if your audience is multilingual, you need to take this into account.  Make sure they can follow you and make very sure that you do not go too fast. Imagine being among  26 See e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Mehrabian for these percentages, which of course vary per  research – but the trend remains the same. Credits go to the pioneering work of Ray Birdwhistell, see e.g.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Birdwhistell .  27 There are various beneficial techniques which help you make better and more healthy use of your body – and  improve your body language at the same time. A proven one is the Alexander technique, which can be adopted  in a few sessions with an Alexander trainer – see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_technique . It’s  not difficult when you want to learn and the results are usually excellent.  Figure 8: body language is important  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Mehrabian https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Birdwhistell https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_technique  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  13  them and listening to someone speaking a very strange accent – imagine how it makes you feel to  have to struggle to understand. Slow down your pace. Cut down on content if you must. It is better  that your audience understands most of your topics well, then get through everything and leave the  audience comprehending little.  Encourage your trainees to speak and ask questions. Literally encourage them, give them courage to  do so. Start with this right from the start. Ask them questions. When you do this from the start they  will start trusting both you and their own capacity to speak up. And you will have a much better  training going on.  If you are not speaking your mother tongue during a training, make sure your command of the  language is sufficient to make the training a success.  As quite a lot of international trainings are presented and conducted in English, it is often assumed  that native English speaking trainers have an advantage. But based on feedback from people from the  audience who are not native speakers, it follows that in some cases native speakers are quite hard to  follow, due to various reasons. The speed of talking is in some cases very high, what makes it hard for  non-native speakers to follow. Specific dialects (and e.g. the UK and USA have a lot of those) make it  hard to grasp the meaning of all the words and the sentences. So native speakers: slow down! Seek to  speak English as you hopefully had to during language classes in school. Avoid slang. Avoid figures of  speech. Also stay away from local references, the kind of topic or TV program or actor or musician that  everyone in your town or country may know – but the people in your training room have probably  never heard of. If it’s a great metaphor, by all means use it – but then you will need to explain. Also,  as native speaker you have plenty of time to process information as you speak calmly. Use this time  to be aware of the body language of your trainees. When you do that, you will know it when you are  not getting through.  Non-native speakers who do have good control over a language like English need to pay attention too.  Some of them use a rich and unusual vocabulary that may be quite hard to understand as they use  expressions that are uncommon or rarely used. One of the authors has read a lot of Shakespeare, and  sometimes uses ancient words or word orders that even some native speakers fail to process – nice  as this may sound, it’s of no use to your students. Keep your senses open and you will know when you  are talking “gibberish”.  The English language is used here as an example. The principles apply to all language and it takes a lot  of practicing to speak fluently and in a way that would be acceptable to most if not all audiences.  Four important hints to conclude here. The most important one is to \"be yourself\". You can play with  body language, tone of voice and words as much as you like (as long as it works for the audience), but  stay true to yourself. Don't try to emulate someone else, because unless you are a brilliant actor, it  won't work. People who are not themselves, run the risk of being perceived as \"fake\" by the audience.  That's a showstopper. Be yourself, and tell your own story. It’s ok to sometimes use other’s stories,  but you will convince more when you share from your own experiences.  Second, while being yourself, adapt to your audience enough to be effective. This is about the words  you chose to convey your message, and the body language and tone of voice to support that. If your  audience is highly educated, this will be different than when you address a class of ten year olds. If  your audience is accountants, or doctors, or military men, will make a difference for how and what  you communicate. Gauge, observe your audience to see if your approach works. Adapt if needed.  Thirdly, adopt a style that fits who you are. If you are not good with humour, then it’s no use trying to  crack jokes. Maybe you like to challenge – then challenge, with due respect for your trainees. Maybe  you like understatement – feel free to use it, but do look around to see if it works, which may be hard  with an international audience. Be flexible and adapt to circumstances.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  14  The fourth recommendation is to record your presentation with video and audio - and replay them  later. Most often you won't like it at first but it is worth to overcome this, and then you will learn a lot.  Do accept that to others you sound different than to yourself, that's always so. Another idea is to ask  a non-native speaker to watch you train and then give you personal feedback (in private).  5.4 Previous experience  A contributor to this document said that speaking on the radio had helped him a lot to develop his  skills as a trainer. In a radio broadcast, as in a podcast, you need to be entertaining and flexible:  qualities that are very useful for a trainer. Fear is a perfectly natural reaction when you are not used  to a big audience. By exposing yourself to it, you will get over the fears to be on stage. Experience tells  that stage anxiety becomes a non-issue in time. It takes about one year of going out and training  people for a trainer to become really fluent in front of an audience. If you want to speed this up,  expose yourself more – e.g. take a stand-up comedy training (which sounds a bit extreme, but is a  perfect training for spontaneous reaction)! After a year or less, what's then left of what once was stage  fear, becomes in fact an aid to keep you alert and perceptive as presenter, and thus becomes a friend  who helps you deliver the best quality.  5.5 Appearance while giving a training  This topic is not easy to approach as every person is unique. Nevertheless there are some general  recommendations for \"appearance\" when presenting or training on stage. The basic idea is simple do  not over dress and do not under dress. And stay with your own ideas of what is stylish, unless those  are too outrageous of course.  Do not under dress: as trainer you are the role model, everyone looks at you, so you want to look  properly groomed and wearing proper quality, decent clothes. You can adjust to local habits (make  sure that you know them), but avoid excess or things not suited to you: e.g. as someone from Europe,  you are not going to present in a traditional dress of India or Saudi Arabia. If dress codes do apply,  know what these mean: smart casual, business attire, etc. – check with your local host what they will  be wearing, as the definition of dress codes varies across the planet, and may even be different  between two similar companies in the same country.  Do not over dress: you want the trainees to be attentive to what you communicate, not stare at your  clothes or make-up. So if you like people to look at you, that's fine but when you train people, be  somewhat laid back and relaxed. What you definitely need to avoid is some special untested makeup  or tanning right before the training. Also protect yourself against the environment (climate, sun)  within reason. One of the authors has experienced first-hand how a running nose (from a neglected  cold) or blazing red skin from too much sun make it so much harder to maintain that professional  appearance expected of you as the trainer.  I once assumed my normal dress code for international meetings (a suit and tie), forgetting that the  audience would consist of network operators in t-shirts. Fortunately I spotted that 100+ people had  simultaneously folded their arms when I entered the stage. Describing my own account of a  professional challenge that they had all experienced themselves too, got most of them to relax and  listen. But it was a narrow escape… [Andrew Cormack, Chief Regulatory Adviser, Janet, UK]  This story illustrates that audiences have expectations of how a “leader” in their field looks like. If you  fit that image, then you have a good starting point. For instance, an audience of ethical hackers does  not have any issue with trainers with tattoos or piercings. If you train them in a business suit however,  you may be the best of experts, but you will need to work harder to convince your audience. Still, do  not dress beyond the limit of your own comfort. If you are a great hacker and you feel best wearing a  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  15  tie, wear a tie by all means. Maybe you want to crack a joke about your ties with the audience to break  the ice. Be perceptive and creative and you will solve such challenges while enjoying doing so.  5.6 Cultural differences  In some cases the audience is composed of people with different cultural backgrounds, beliefs and  experiences. That's a wonderful opportunity to share your experiences with a wide variety of people  from all over the world, and when you have a training with group exercises, also a very good vehicle  to increase the mutual understanding among your trainees. However as a trainer you do need to have  some basic idea of these differences in order to make all in the class feel welcome and respected. This  includes things like how to approach people, the distance to keep in a one-to-one chat, manners and  other relevant facts, like how to accept a business card that is being presented to you. If you have local  hosts in a culture you don't know, simply ask them beforehand if you are not sure about such local  habits. However as always stay true to yourself and your background: be respectful and welcoming,  yet keep your own style. It will not be appreciated if you \"copy\" their habits. When in doubt during a  training – simply ask respectfully.  When I was program chair for FIRST back in 1999 in Brisbane, a gentleman from Japan gave me his  business card. I was glad that I had heard about that event, because this was the first time I was party  in this protocol28. The card should have two sides, one in Japanese, and one in English. The card is  handed over held with two hands. When you receive it with two hands, in a similar manner, and  exchange courtesies, you will have done very well for a Westerner. Don’t worry about bowing – if you  have good rapport during the encounter, you will find it very hard to suppress a polite slight bow – I  know I automatically do it. Avoid overdoing this – this is part of a complex protocol, and you are not  expected to know this. I sure don’t, so I just follow my gut feeling and have had many courteous and  friendly exchanges and contacts with Japanese colleagues. [Don Stikvoort]  Figure 9: Business Card in two Languages (from one of the reviewers of this guide)  Gender differences (female/male) can pose a very similar challenge, depending on where you are.  Again, if you are for instance from Switzerland, do not assume that the way you can approach both  genders in your home country is the same as elsewhere. The difference can be very apparent in Islamic  countries – but not only there. In some cultures, women will not look a man directly into the eyes – if  you then keep trying to achieve eye contact this may be perceived as rudeness. Again, if you are in a  new environment – feel free to ask with respect. If necessary, one to one, and not in the classroom.  28 For more information see e.g. http://www.japanesebusinessresource.com  http://www.japanesebusinessresource.com/  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  16  5.7 What it takes to be a trainer  To be a trainer is like climbing a mountain. Inspiring but sometimes asking for more when you thought  you had nothing left. [Don Stikvoort]  Often your trainings simply go well, and there are no big surprises. Your trainees are doing well, and  you are happy as their trainer. But sometimes, “Murphy” strikes. You may be jetlagged or simply not  well. The air-conditioning is too hot or too cold. Your voice has taken a day off. There is a trainee from  hell who tries to sabotage your training. The projector, or the network breaks down. And the coffee is  awful. Every trainer will experience such things one day. That’s when the quote really applies. Your  trainees, especially on a paid training, expect you to be excellent. They are there to learn from you.  You set the example. So what do you do? You use your reserves and perform. It will take a lot of  energy, but you can do it.  The first and last thing to do as trainer is – stay on the positive side, stay on the cause side, where you  can cause solutions to happen. You can always ask for help and support. From the hotel or facility you  are training in. Even from your trainees as long as you clearly explain that there is a perfectly valid  reason for doing so.  As the trainer you set the example in all matters visible during the training. This also applies to arrival,  breaks and departure. So do not change style all of a sudden during a break. Of course you can have  relaxed, personal chats with trainees during the breaks. But remember that you are still the trainer,  both at a conscious and unconscious level. So you continue to set a good example. For instance, if you  expect your trainees to stick to the set break timing – and you should – then you need to stick to it  too. If all your trainees are back in time and you make them wait for five minutes, then they will be  late next time. Some trainers enjoy a little decorum for that reason – for instance they ask local staff  to prepare the room and only appear five minutes before starting time. They enjoy their break  separately. You can but don’t have to do this to be a good trainer. It is more important to decide your  own style and stay with it, at least during the training. Over time you will find what suits you and it  will become a natural style. Some trainers prefer to be close and involved – others like a bit more  distance. It’s up to you, but whatever your style, every good trainer is involved with and interested in  his trainees.  You may be reading all of this and thinking “but how do I ever get to be such a great trainer”? Well  that’s simple: like we all did! Practise, practise and practise! Don’t be afraid to get things wrong at  times. Learn from your mistakes. Apply a sense of humour – crack a joke about yourself at times  (without degrading yourself), it’s very refreshing and good for learning. Trainees don’t mind a mistake  at times, as long as you are open to correcting them. Know that you can always learn from your  students. Always accept and respect their feedback. Remember: perfection is the enemy of  excellence. The best trainers and performing artists, like in music or in acting, will tell you the same.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  17  6 Preparation for trainings  The 7 Ps:  Proper  Planning and  Preparation  Prevent  Pest  Poor  Performance  [Adapted from British Army training]  6.1 Planning  In many cases the training that you need to give already exists. All materials for preparation and  delivery are at your disposal. Suppose that is the case – then how long before the course do you need  to start preparing, and what do you need to prepare?  Let’s first look at simply familiarising yourself with the materials so that you feel confident you can  deliver an excellent training. How much time does this cost? We sent out two polls to experienced  trainers asking them two questions:  Basic level preparation:  Suppose you prepare for a training that is fairly basic in content and the exercises are not complex or  deeply technical. How many days of preparation do you think you will need per actual day of training?  Advanced level preparation:  Suppose you prepare for a training that is more complex in content or the exercises are complex or  need a more technical set-up. Imagine a classroom with PCs equipped with virtual machines. In that  case, assume that the VM is available to you as part of the materials, but as usual with VMs, you find  they all need some tweaks and updates to work properly. How many days of preparation do you think  you will now need per actual day of training?  More than 15 trainers replied to these two scenario questions. Based on their replies and the authors’  own experience, the basic level preparation takes around two to three days of preparation per training  day, with some responders planning up to ten days of preparation time. The advanced level of  preparation typically will take five to ten days of preparation, with some mentioning up to twenty  days.  This means that when you prepare for a basic two-day training, you need to reserve at least four days  to prepare. And if it’s advanced, at least ten days but maybe you will need twenty. Of course the length  of your preparation time will vary depending on your experience in the content and as a trainer. But  once you are an experienced trainer you will be able to make a good estimate of how much time you  need. The bottom line – start well in advance. To prepare well you need much more time than you  may think when you come new to the training business.  Is this all the planning you need to do? No, there is more. Right at the beginning of your preparations,  consider the following and write down your honest answers:  • Goal. What is the goal of the training? What do the trainees need to know and/or be able to  do after the training? How good should they be at knowing/doing that? Think about how you can  measure this after the training.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  18  • Target audience. Who is coming to your training, and how many? What is their background,  education or knowledge level, before they enter your classroom? If there is a wide variety in  knowledge level, how will that affect your training? Do you need to give extra help to people whose  knowledge level is relatively low – and if so, how are you going to pull that off? What language is the  training in, and what are the mother tongues of your trainees? Are there cultural and/or gender  differences that you need to take into account?  • Group size & training assistance. How many will attend your training? This does not only  influence the size of the training room, but also if you will need help on-site. Groups with up to ten  trainees, you can handle on your own, including logistics. If you can get logistics support, so much the  better, but consider this a luxury. For groups with more than ten people, aim at getting some form of  logistics support. For groups with up to twenty people you can take care of the training by yourself,  but beyond twenty trainees, you will need to consider getting training assistance. This can be in the  form of one or more assistants who take care of exercise or workshop elements, so that you can re- gain energy. You can also work with a co-trainer, performing the training together as a pair. It can be  very rewarding and inspiring to work with a co-trainer – one of the authors has done this himself  several times, witnessed it many times, and is enthusiastic about it. However, working with a co- trainer requires good preparation together, getting to know one another, and especially finding ways  to react to one another and take cues from each other naturally. All of these will facilitate a  spontaneous flow of ideas during the training. And important as preparation is, it is not enough: this  kind of collaboration really needs to be discovered while doing it. Training on the job, while you are  training others.  • Success/fail factors. Make a shortlist of factors that can make or break the success of your  training. You will find many of these in annex A. These factors can be anything from a failing air- conditioning in desert heat (this happened to one of the authors), or a broken projector, via a strike  in public transport, to you being ill, or one of the trainees sabotaging your training knowingly or  unconsciously. For each of the factors, think about the likelihood of that occurring, and your remedy  for when it would happen. For very unlikely factors on which you have little or no influence, you may  write down “Force Majore” and further ignore them29.  6.2 Planning and announcing  Marketing is a profession of its own and you can find many books and online information on the topic.  The authors are not marketing experts, though one has experience in doing actual marketing for more  than 15 years. We will just mention a few things that we consider essential for the marketing of  trainings:  • Planning. Plan well ahead of time. If your training is well known and respected, and you have  good communication channels for PR, even then you need to start advertising your course three to  four months in advance. If you can make a training calendar much earlier than that, so much the  better.  In case your training still needs to gain recognition then you need to start much earlier, up to a year  in advance. Because you will need to approach your target group, find the right channels to do so, sell  your course. If your training is a longer one, you may want to offer short workshops as appetizers for  your full trainings. If you offer a training path that way, take into account that one out of five is a very  decent turnover rate – that means that out of every five people that do your introductory workshop,  29 If you give the training in a country where legal liability is an important issue, you may want to exclude liability  for such “Force Majore”, by obliging trainees to sign a set of terms for your course either when subscribing to it,  or just before the course begins, in the classroom.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  19  one will do the full training. And out of every five that do the full training, one will subscribe to the  advance training. Always set goals for your marketing success and measure success.  • Goal, content and target audience. Make a clear description of what trainees will achieve by  taking this training. Will they receive a certificate, or be accredited or certified? Write down a  summary of the content – this can be as simple as a bulleted list. Describe what audience you want to  reach and also what level of knowledge or education they need to have in order to make a success of  your course. Communicate all of this clearly. Fuzziness does not make good PR. Do not hype your  training: trainees who get what they expected plus some more, and feel good about trainer and  training, are the best PR.  • Media. What media will be used to market your training? Traditional media are flyers and  catalogues, printed yellow pages, banners or billboards, newspapers, radio, TV and word-of-mouth30  of course. Articles in local, regional or national newspapers are usually good PR. TV is great, but to get  coverage you often need a really good story and some insider helping you. Flyers are good hand-outs  at gatherings like conferences, workshops and exhibitions.  The list of new media keeps growing. A web presence is the bare minimum these days – and if this is  an important marketing medium for you then strategies to get your site high in search engine results.  Media like LinkedIn and Facebook offer extra online presence. A more active approach can include a  blog or Twitter messages. Whatever you choose, make sure the information is correct and up to date.  If you do blog or tweet, do it regularly. Don’t waste your time on a blog updated once a year; no one  except your partner will read it.  6.3 Training material  Make sure that your materials are elaborate enough for students to be able to reproduce your story  when you are not around to help anymore. [Hans de Vries, CEO of a Dutch training company]  This quote may well contain the most important advice in regard your training materials: your training  is not a “one-man-show”, but is meant to bring lasting education to your trainees. Whatever your  training materials exist of, make sure to address the following issues:  • Effective structure. Choose a structure that enables as many trainees as possible to meet the  training goals. We specifically recommend to adopt the 4MAT system as explained in chapter two –  the 4MAT is just as powerful for a one hour presentation as it is for a ten-day course. This would apply  to your session planning and accompanying slide set especially. Remember: the 4MAT system  addresses the needs of all four different types of learners, and does so in the most effective order. All  it requires is that you chunk up your training topics in logical chunks or topics, and that for each one  of those topics you order your training as follows:  1. WHY. Make the trainees curious “why” they should want to pay attention to this part of the  training. Ask questions like “who wants to learn …” in such a way that they want to reply “yes, I do!”  The WHY takes 5-10% of your topic’s time.  2. WHAT. This is the content, the theory, the body of learning for this topic. Old style school and  university lectures did almost only the WHAT. Fills 20-70% of your time: some topics need more WHAT  and less HOW, with others it is the other way around.  30 For those in the CERT community – contact your local or national CERT and see if they want to work together  with you to spread the word. If this is in the interest of their constituency you may find them interested to do  so.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  20  3. HOW. This explains how you actually apply the theory. If there is a process with steps, it’s in  the HOW. A demo and exercise are also in the HOW. Again, this fills 20-70% of your topic’s time.  4. WHAT IF. Variations on the theme. Time for questions. The WHAT IF people learn by  wondering how to apply the learnings in different ways, under various circumstances. Plan for 5-10%  of available time.  Remember: for big topics with several sub-topics you can go for one WHY for the whole topic, followed  by a series of WHAT-HOW sequences sufficient to cover all sub-topics, concluded by one WHAT IF. In  such a case the WHY and WHAT IF may be shorter than 5% overall.  • Ability to understand. Keep your language straightforward and avoid complexity. Avoid long  sentences, many commas, and stay away from double negatives such as “do not forget to not …” as  these really confuse people. As a rule of thumb, even stay away from negatives when you can as the  unconscious does not process them. So instead of writing or saying, “don’t mess with the air  conditioning”, opt for “make sure the air conditioning is set well31”. Whether you are a native speaker  or not, have someone else review your materials for language and understandability. Together with  the reviewer also make sure the materials are as much as possible free of errors in spelling, language  and of course also content – too many errors will make your materials look really unprofessional, and  you will need to be a really brilliant trainer in person to compensate for that impression.  • Easy Reference. Make sure your trainees can easily find what they are looking for, 6 months  later. A good table of contents is a must. If your materials are extensive and you plan to re-use them  many times, consider making an index - this is worth more than the effort spent. If you have a set of  references, you will help your trainees a lot if you add a commented bibliography: that way they get  the quality assessment of the expert (you) for free.  • Readability. Both for projected slides as well as for printed hand-outs, make sure that  readability is prime. This means: big enough fonts and no distractions, and make sure that text and  background contrast in both colour and light/darkness. For a text slide this means that four or five  bullet points is much to be preferred over 7 or more – less is more where it comes to slides. For printed  materials, use black on white printing and choose a clear font. Font size: dependent on the font, but  usually at least size 12 – one of the authors uses only 14 with a font such as Calibri. Avoid distractions  – no backgrounds that make the texts hard(er) to read, and keep logos to a minimum. The pictures  below give examples of a bad, unreadable slide (a webpage with small font on this picture), and of the  opposite.  31 In the NLP model, “now, we wouldn’t want you to mess with the air conditioning” actually contains the  embedded command “mess with the air conditioning”. Thus, negative suggestions can actually reach the  opposite of what they literally contain. This works much better in speech than writing. Unless you are well versed  in such matters, we simply recommend you to steer away from the use of negatives.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  21  • Portability and security. Printed materials are still used a lot, but they are a lot of work to  produce, and “cost trees” as the saying goes, and so more and more trainings cut down on the amount  of paper. If your students fly in, they will also be thankful when you don’t provide them with several  kilograms of bulky binders. E-materials are increasingly popular. CDs are going out of fashion, USB  sticks are the most commonly used now. Whatever e-format you use, choose one that works on most  computers. PDF is most commonly used – avoid sharing PowerPoint or Word files. If you supply audio  or video materials, whether before or during the training – then it is wise to stick to mp3 for audio and  mp4 for video. No one will have trouble getting those to work on most systems, including smart  phones and portable media players. One word of care – make very sure you are not spreading malware  (computer viruses, worms etc.) with the USB sticks you hand out. And once handed out, do not plug  them into your own computer anymore, as the laptop of your trainee may have infected the USB stick  at first contact. 32  • Life cycle. When you finish any training document, or video, demo, or whatever part of your  training materials – make sure to set the expiry date at the same time. You don’t need to make that  explicit towards the trainees, what counts is that you know and that you have a system to follow up  on this. What does that mean? Well, say that you set a three year expiry time. Then after maybe two  and a half years, you make a renewal plan: who is going to do what, and when, to make sure that the  material will be updated, or completely renewed. So you plan a life cycle for all your materials.  Bearing the above in mind, we recommend you prepare the following materials for a traditional  classroom type training:  • Learning objectives. First things first: write down what you want your students to learn,  experience and achieve in the training. Learning objectives should be SMART – specific, measurable,  attainable, realistic and timely33. When you explain about Internet hacking techniques for instance,  32 You could opt for media that you can set read-only. This is rare for USB sticks. Flashcards as used in photo  cameras have a little switch for that. You could use such flashcards, switch them to read-only and tell your  students that if they switch it back to read-write they do so at their own peril. However, most devices cannot  read flash cards so you will need to provide your students with a little flash card reader with USB interface. These  can be found for under € 10.  33 See e.g. http://topachievement.com/smart.html  Figure 10: slides must be easy to read and digest  http://topachievement.com/smart.html  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  22  then “the students will learn about all hacking techniques” is clearly not a SMART goal. Whereas “after  the training the trainees are able to explain at least two ways in which DDoS34 attacks are done” is  much better. “Measurable” means you need to be able to ask your student a question afterwards –  and the answer should prove that the objective has been met (or not, in which case you need to  wonder what to do).  • Session plan. This is your timetable as trainer. It tells you what to do what and when, and how  long it will take. If you are an inexperienced trainer, make a detailed session plan and then see how it  works out during the training – adapt it if needed for next time. This will really help you become a  better trainer. Experienced trainers will make a more concise session plan, and be more liberal in  playing with the timings “going with the flow” of the training and the specific needs of that group of  trainees. However, for longer trainings (especially those over multiple days) all trainers, no matter  how experienced, need a good session plan. Also, for longer trainings, you should segment your  session plan and add learning objectives per segment. It’s a really good idea to check on the  achievement of these learning objectives at the end of each segment.  • Slide set. This is what you use as visible guide for both yourself and the trainees. Add images  to your slides where apt – these can be charts, illustrations of the content, or simply funny. Avoid  explaining funny images – they should speak for themselves. Keep slide animations down to a  minimum – these were fashionable once, but in fact can disturb your flow as a trainer and distract  your audience. An animation here and there can be both functional and part of the fun factor, which  helps to make the training digestible. A functional animation can for instance be if you are presenting  important topics via bullet items, and you want to have them appear one by one. But do not apply  that to each and every text slide.  • Tutor notes. These are there to help the trainer with explanations about e.g. the slides, and  with background information. Tutor notes can be added to the slide set, and be visible for the trainer  but not the trainees – however in that case the available space for information is usually very limited.  Plus, presentation laptops are sometimes quite small, and older trainers may need a microscope to  actually read the small font of the tutor notes on screen. Separate tutor notes are therefore  recommended. You can print them in font 14 or 16 for easy reading, so that you can even easily browse  them during training, without the students even noticing.  • Student notes and/or accompanying texts. A bunch of slides is not the same as full training  materials. As mentioned in the quote above, make sure that you provide the students with enough  materials so they can find the essence also when you are not there to help them anymore. You can do  this by adding notes that accompany the slides – supplemented with additional texts, readings,  articles, whatever is relevant and helpful. If a book is available, you may recommend this or even  include it as part of the training cost. It’s very nice to send the students home with not just a set of  materials but also a relevant book.  • Exercise hand-outs. When you do exercises make sure to have extremely clear instructions  and very explicit and clear hand-outs to go with it. If you run a new exercise for the first time, no  matter how well you think you have prepared it, half of your students will do something completely  different from what you ever planned they would do. Monitor the exercises closely, and improve the  hand-outs so that the surprise factor goes down. If less than 10% of your students “re-interpret” your  exercise, you have done very well.  For other types of trainings, e.g. hands-on computer trainings, various types of other materials will be  needed. We won’t go into these, as the variety is too wide to cover here. Just remember that whatever  34 DDoS: Distributed Denial of Service – a specific hacking technique  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  23  you do, you need to have it covered in your session plan. The various remarks about effective  structure, readability, understandability etc. always need to be taken into account.  6.4 Logistics Checklist  Training logistics is everything outside the training process itself that needs to be done before, during  and after the training to make the training a success. Logistics include all the boundary conditions for  a great training, from the availability of a well-equipped training room, coffee breaks and sandwiches,  to climate control, mailing lists and materials, all the way to the red carpet for the trainees to walk  over as they enter the training room35.  Many of these things have been and will be discussed in this  guide – but for your convenience we provide you with Annex A, a logistics checklist. The idea is that  you can use that checklist to prepare and execute trainings, marking each item once completed. This  checklist will be provided separately as an annex in pdf and word format, for your convenience: the  word file you can tailor to your own needs.  6.5 Preparation on-site (before the first day of training)  If you are doing a training for the first time in a certain site, go and check it out several days or even  weeks before. Make an appointment with the local contact responsible for supporting your training  and have them guide you around. Your appointment needs to be at a time where your intended  training room is free. Make sure to cover all the items listed below under “class set-up” – this way you  make sure everything is well prepared and you save time on the training day. Check whether your  guide is available on the days of training, and who are their back-ups and how you can quickly reach  them during training. Important: expect “things” (what, you never know) to change between this visit  and the actual first day of training. Be prepared for that.  6.6 Communication before training  In the many training evaluations that the authors have received and made, trainees often appreciate  the training, but critique communications in advance of the training. Pre-training communications is  often underestimated. Let’s look at some aspects to take into account:  • Communication plan. Have a communication plan. That plan will tell you what to tell, when  and to whom. Allow people enough time to digest what you send them, especially when it will take  some effort on their side. Tell them about your timeline – what information or tasks they can expect  and when. Stick to your timeline and plan. Doing what you write and say you will do is an easy way to  gain credibility with your trainees.  • Expectation management. Be very clear towards your trainees as to what you expect of them.  What are the pre-requisites for the training? How should they prepare? What should they bring with  them to the training? Is there a dress code? What can they expect in regard to food and beverages?  Should they bring a laptop – and if that is needed, does it need to carry a specific operating system?  Do they need to pre-install some software? Should they have root/administrator rights? Or,  alternatively, do you actively discourage the use of computer equipment during the training? Do you  have a policy about taking pictures, recording audio or video, tweeting or otherwise publically sharing  events during the training?  • Tasking. You can assign tasks in advance to encourage the trainees to already consider some  of the training elements. This is valuable, but bear in mind that trainees often have little spare time  left during or after their daily jobs. This lack of spare time is sometimes a reason to go to a formal  35 The red carpet is optional.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  24  training. Make sure that tasking is very clear in content and limited in the effort required of the future  trainees. It is better they spend one hour intensely on one or two topics or questions, than spending  two hours to cover ten topics superficially.  • Training schedule and travel tips. Make sure to send a clear training schedule and travel tips  one to two weeks before the training starts36. If you do it much earlier, your trainees may not pay  much attention to this information and forget about it. If you do it later, they will tell you that the  information was sent too late. The travel tips include how to get to the location by the most obvious  forms of transport (car, taxi, train, plane) and one or more relevant maps – include those maps and  do not only link to some mapping website: your trainees will be grateful that you save them time. The  distance that trainees are traveling to your course may alter the timing of travel-related  communications; those booking air tickets may need travel details further in advance of the course.  6.7 Class set-up  Arrive well in advance. At least half an hour before the training starts, for a bigger training one-two  hours on the first day. Do NOT expect that on the day of training everything will be as you saw it during  your preparation visit – especially hotels are good in changing everything when a client with more  money comes round. One of the authors once did not even get the training room that was shown to  him during preparations and that he paid for – the hotel had decided otherwise, and the new room  was not as good. Some refund was given later, but that didn’t help his students that day. Had the  author not arrived well in time so that he could adapt his planned set-up quickly, the students would  have noticed some annoyance and chaos – which is bad for building trust with your students and bad  PR.  Make sure to cover the following items:  • Local staff. Meet with the local logistics people. Who is responsible overall? Who is  responsible for the audio-visual facilities? What about coffee and lunch breaks, and where are they  held? Where are the fire-exits? Where the toilets? Any other things you need to know? Talk all of this  through.  • Room lay-out (U-shape or otherwise). Check this with local staff and make them do changes  to get it as you want it (and as you should have specified in advance). In general we recommend u- shape as it is a more personal setup than e.g. classroom style – all trainees are around the same table,  and you can get close to all of them. The u-shape is really like a version of the “round table” adapted  to a training situation. A good alternative is a set of small round tables, allowing four to six people  around them. This is especially useful if you switch a lot from plenary to group work.  • AV equipment and network. Check with local staff if the projector works, and any other AV  that you may need, like fixed or clip-on microphones. If you use microphones, you may want one or  two portable ones for questions too. Have all this ready and tested. Also check the network  connection, and if it is essential, have some back-up plan, like a 3G mobile hot spot or tethering using  your mobile phone.  • Environment. Is the room temperature okay, and is the air not too dry? How do you operate  the air-conditioning? Are there any windows that can open? What about the lighting, where are the  controls, and what is the best setting for your plenary sessions? Do you need other settings for group  work? (Temperature differences can often happen.)  36 If international/long travel is involved you clearly need to inform people much more ahead of time, or you can  give them a heads-up say 3 months in advance, so they can at least book their flight or long distance train.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  25  • Stage. Set up your stage. Place any posters or banners where you want them. Make sure there  is a clock somewhere that you can easily see during  training. If you use stage positions, practice where they  are so you won’t have to think about it during training.  You can use the stage in many ways37, but here we will  keep it simple and give you two positions to consider.  One is your neutral teaching position, as in the picture to  the right. The neutral position is one you need to be able  to maintain for a longer period of time. In the example of  the picture, the trainer has set himself up for a longer  training, as he has chosen to sit on a high chair instead of  standing – and he has arranged his materials to be in  front of him. Notice that the posture is relaxed yet  communicative.  The second position we suggest you think about is the  close to audience position, as in the picture to the left.  Remember that whenever you come close to your  audience, this is a powerful position, as you come  closer into their comfort zones. You can use that power  in a positive way by not staring your students down  with your eyes, but instead staying in trainer state and  peripheral vision. In the picture, the trainer was using  this position for doing a confession – some personal  experience which would not be in the slides or training  materials. The same position can also be used to tell a  story. When the close to audience position is used in  these ways, it becomes a way to connect more  personally with the trainees, which is inspirational  when done respectfully and as exception rather than as  rule.  The main thing to remember about stage positions is that when you decide to set them up and use  them, you need to use them in a consistent way, using the same locations and similar body language.  The reason for this is that a stage position is what is called an anchor, which triggers a reaction in your  trainees. The more you use the anchor, the more defined that reaction will be – there will be  recognition at an unconscious level: “ah now he is going to tell us some personal story!” for instance.  For an anchor to work well it needs to be precisely located and executed. Hence the specific location  and body language – and even specific tone of voice, like you would tell a personal story in a slightly  different tone of voice from your normal teaching voice. How – that is up to you.  37To talk about stage positions could easily take a day! See e.g.  http://www.speakingaboutpresenting.com/delivery/9-ways-space-presentation/ to get some ideas of what  you can do.  Figure 11: Teaching position  Figure 12: Teaching position  http://www.speakingaboutpresenting.com/delivery/9-ways-space-presentation/  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  26  • Materials. Any materials for the students, have them readily available – on their places, or in  a central area, e.g. next to the entrance. It is very convenient to have nametags and name boards for  your trainees. Nametags are useful during breaks and group exercises. The boards with their names  on them you ask them to place in front of them – that way you can see their name right away, which  helps you get acquainted with your group more easily, and avoids uncomfortable situations like “you  there, tell me …”.  • Finish your preparations before you allow the first students in. If students are early and you  are still busy, ask the reception to have them wait in a suitable waiting area, like the coffee area – not  inside the room. It’s not professional to let the trainees watch you prepare, and besides, some of them  will start a talk with you and you will be either very distracted or impolite as you brush them off. If you  have a co-trainer, then one can prepare the room while the other meets with the students already,  outside.  7 Execution of trainings  Better a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without. [Confucius]  As a trainer, strive for excellence – not for perfection. Perfect is the enemy of inspired. Be an inspired  trainer rather than one who is continuously looking to correct minor flaws. Trainees will remember  you for how you motivated them – not for where you put the commas in your sentences. As trainer  you are like a performing artist. The famous classical pianist Alfred Brendel once said that in his best  performances he made the most errors.  7.1 Training style  Find your own style in giving trainings – and then get comfortable with it. Make sure it works for your  trainings of course. Being respectful towards your trainees is always an essential element in any  training style – but also to be in charge in a non-arrogant, inviting way. Use your sense of humour, but  as we said before – be yourself. Avoid extremes – trainings are not supposed to be stage dramas.  Once you know your basic training style and are comfortable with it, stick with it. Predictability  towards your trainees is good, in general. Especially in more intense trainings, your students will be  outside their comfort zone, and they need some elements of stability. As you are the one guiding their  learning, it is excellent that you are that anchor as trainer.  However don’t be boringly predictable. The word boring says it all – that’s what you want to avoid in  your trainings. The one you all know to avoid for instance, is to read from the slides38. Surprises and  unexpected events coming from your side are quite welcome, if used sparingly and with purpose. You  can prepare some of such surprise moments – but always allow room for spontaneous ideas too.  Spontaneity is usually inspired by your students, by what they say or who they are – by the interaction  with the group. Allow that to happen, enjoy the element of surprise which that is also for you.  Your training style extends to all your behaviours in and around the training, visible or audible to the  trainees. So that includes the breaks. Maintain your style in the breaks. If you really need a personal  break, make sure to not be with the students, have a walk outside for instance, or use a trainer room  to retreat if available. If you work with a co-trainer, that makes everything easier as you can share the  workload. For most trainings it is beneficial when at least one of the trainers is around during breaks.  Some students will only ask you questions at such quiet moments.  38 Also know that every rule has an exception! If you have a complicated statement to explain, then it’s perfectly  fine to have it on a slide and read it out, even twice if needed, while adding explanations. Remember that this is  the exception to the rule.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  27  7.2 Timing  Start on time, stay on time, and end on time. If you adhere to that, you will be fine. Let’s examine  these briefly. First though, remember from the preparations – be aware of time, have a clock visible  for you.  Start on time. Usually that is up to you. Make sure that at the starting time, you are really ready to  start, e.g. the first slide is up already. Fighting with the projector at that moment and blaming  technology gets you off on the wrong foot. Instead of right away leading your trainees towards  meeting their expectations, for which they may have prepared a long time or travelled for hours, you  are distracting them with something which really can only be explained as a lack of preparation and  disrespect towards the trainees.  Sometimes your class is not full yet at starting time. This mostly depends on the culture/region you  are giving the training in – if you suspect that may be the case, then find out by asking. Sometimes it  can be due to external factors, like problems with the train system. Adapt as needed, but keep your  students informed and stick to what you say. If you say “as several students are still missing we will  wait for another five minutes” – then do start after those five minutes. In that first hour of any training,  you set the rules for the whole training. No matter what culture or region it is, and no matter how  busy the roads or trains may be – you set the rules of engagement. If needed, make this very explicit.  One of the authors sometimes gives trainings of six to twelwe days total. He then spends the first half  hour on setting the frames and expectations for all those days – and demands implicitly the  acceptance of the trainees, like in “as you sit here, you accept these rules, which are here to make you  all learn as effectively as possible, in an way that is agreeable for all of us”. Make sure that the trainees  stick to the rules you set, also after breaks and the following days – and make sure you stick to your  own rules as well.  When your training is part of a day program, insist that you can start on time. And if not, that  provisions are made so that you don’t have to rush because of others having been too late. If there is  no choice but to accept the shorter time available, consider leaving out part of your program, instead  of rushing it all. If you do, explain to your trainees what you leave out and why – and how they can  make up for this. Maybe you can give them the missing materials as hand-outs, and allow them to ask  questions by e-mail. Make the best of any given situation. If you genuinely feel that you cannot do  your work right – refuse to do it. This requires some strength of character and experience, but we  assure you – once you have done it once, you will know how to do it for the future but may find that  you won’t need it anymore39.  Stay on time. If you don’t, you will not get your materials done, or your end time may slip. Neither will  make you very popular with your students and it’s unprofessional. Adhere to the break times – its fine  to start five minutes later with a break, but do not shorten the break. Breaks are not there to give you  more time for teaching, they are there for the students and you to relax for a moment. When doing  exercises, stay on time too. It’s very easy to take longer for exercises. While this will usually happen a  few times when you give a training for the first time, be very aware of this, as it’s definitely a risk factor  towards your overall timing. Correct the timings for the future and stick to those.  Visible and audible cues, often called anchors, can help, especially during breaks and exercises. Some  trainers set up a timer during breaks which counts down to zero, indicating the end of the break. This  is very suggestive and cannot be mistaken. Other trainers use audible anchors. A straightforward one  39 You may not need it anymore as you will have learnt an unconscious behaviour that will make clear to future  hosts that you are really serious about wanting to do a good job and demanding that they give you the time  required for that.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  28  is for example in the concert hall or in a school, a buzz five minutes before the end of the break, and  one more when “class begins”. More imaginative is the use of music in the break, and a specific piece  of upbeat music which you always use in the last minutes of the break – this will become an auditory  anchor especially during longer trainings. When your students hear it they know even without thinking  that “break is over”. In exercises, the use of visual and audible anchors is recommended too, but keep  them simple. A visible timer and some articulate, preferably fun sound to mark different stages of the  exercise will do.  End on time. If you have done all of the above well, it will be easy to stick to the agreed end times.  Your students will be grateful, after a long day of learning. If you are done with your program, and still  have some time left, then be creative. Sometimes you may have an extra discussion, if events on the  day give cause for that. Other times you can just end the training early, and your students will often  even be more grateful, especially if that happens once or twice during a training that lasts for five days  or more. Do make clear to them that they deserved the free time for having been such excellent  students that day. Avoid going over the time limit. Inform the students when you do that and explain  why. Keep it as brief as possible. Inquire if anyone needs to catch a train or plane, and encourage those  to leave when they must, also make sure they have everything they need before they leave. If you can  compensate this the next day by ending early, then feel free to do so.  7.3 Speaking & visuals  7.3.1 Speaking  You don’t want to speak all day and your students certainly don’t want you to. We have explained in  previous chapters about the need for diversity as to cater for the different learning styles of students  and to ensure that they don’t fall asleep or lose focus. Be happy for that as most voices don’t last a  whole day. As an upper limit, you should not speak for longer than 30 minutes in one period and up  to seven of these speaking periods maximum per day. The rest of the time you should be using other  training methods. Group discussion is not speaking, exercises are not speaking, and breaks are not  speaking – though of course you will say things during those as well.  Use a microphone, especially if you have to speak a lot during the day. The ones that you attach over  the ears and that extend towards your mouth are generally the most flexible and rewarding ones. A  microphone that is fixed in place is only useful for shorter presentations, not for anything beyond one  hour, as it limits you too much and will make your training static.  One of the authors took singing lessons at the advice of an experienced speaker who started out his  career as opera singer. He had told the author that the lower and middle registers of his voice were  very good already, but that he would benefit from developing his upper register, plus learning some  general techniques for how to use your voice. This turned out to be excellent advice. The author is  now much more confident in using his voice in all tonalities – nor does he easily get tired anymore, as  he learnt to use his voice in a better way.  7.3.2 Visuals  Just as your voice needs to be heard clearly, the visuals that you provide need to be seen and  understood easily. Whether you write or draw on a flip-chart, whiteboard, and blackboard or use any  other visual aids, write or draw large enough to be seen from the back of the room. Just as in slides,  keep the number of words and details to a minimum. Use colours like black, dark blue or red as those  are easiest to see. If you use more colours in one sketch or text, then make sure you use those colours  in a consistent and meaningful way.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  29  7.4 Trainer state  Assume trainer state and maintain it throughout – only in trainer state you can achieve an excellence  and effectiveness as trainer that is completely outside the reach of trainers who just focus on their  slides, fingernails, whiteboard or the faces of one or two students. The third main elements of trainer  state can be most easily achieved in the following order, starting inside yourself and gradually going  out to your students:  7.4.1 Physical/emotional state of excellence  Practice this at home before a mirror. Achieve this state as follows  a. Stand up straight and relaxed as you place your body cylinders on top of one another. How to  do that? Imagine that your body consists of ten cylinders: two for each leg and arm, one for your main  body and one for your head. The arms can just hang relaxed down. Have the feet a little bit apart for  stability40. Stand in such a way that you place your six standing cylinders on top of one another without  any one of them wanting to break the order and tumble down. Have you ever made buildings out of  little wood cylinders as a kid? Just like that, gravity will tell you when the building of your body is stable  and relaxed.  b. Breathe relaxed – breathe in through your nose, using not only your chest but also your belly  area, and out of your mouth by talking41. If you give longer trainings this is very important. Good  breathing is a basis for feeling good and confident. This is not so easy to explain in a few words. If you  are not a natural at this, you may for instance take some yoga lessons – in yoga, breathing is very  important42.  c. Be relaxed yet attentive. You are opening up to the room and people around you.  d. Be confident. You know the training. You are well prepared. You have what it takes.  e. Be at cause. This is means that you are the cause of what happens around you 43. This is  essential for a trainer, because if you don’t cause your training to be a success and your students to  learn, then who will? You know that you can inspire and train your students. That’s what you prepared  for and what you are here for, in this training room. Also, have great trust in your students. Your  students can learn and actualise what you train them in. They may need some help from you and  that’s what you are there for44.  7.4.2 Peripheral vision  Central vision is when you focus your vision on something in particular, like a nice flower you are  looking at. The angle of view is very limited in that case. Peripheral vision is when you do not focus on  40 Always make sure it fits your personal style.  41 Some people don’t have enough air intake via the nose and need to use the mouth. When you have a cold this  may apply as well. Extending the stomach when breathing in, actually enables you to use your full lung capacity,  including the lower parts of the lungs.  42 See e.g. http://yogaforbeginners.com/breathing01.htm but better - follow some good yoga training and tell  the trainer what you want to focus on, like breathing and relaxation.  43 The opposite is to be at effect: this is the state where people feel they don’t influence what happens around  them or in their life. They are victims to circumstances, genetics, upbringing, education, the demands of their  job or marriage, in short: others are to “blame” for where they are in life and what they do.  44 A general principle of coaching and therapy – also forms of training – is that if you believe your client cannot  do something, then they probably cannot as part of the work you do with them. The more you unlimit yourself  in your beliefs as to what clients or students can achieve, the better you will be at helping them actualize  whatever it is they need to learn.  http://yogaforbeginners.com/breathing01.htm  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  30  anything in particular, but rather see everything that is happening in the room in front of you, without  this being any effort or trouble. Like in this picture:  Trainer state always involves peripheral vision, as this vision allows you to “be with your students”.  You will notice how they move, use their hands, even how they sigh or take a breath to (maybe) ask a  question45. Knowing all this does not distract you at all, it is in fact very simple to be giving a great  training while at the same time being aware of what is happening in the room. Experienced trainers  go into peripheral vision the very moment they start a training or presentation. If you are new to this,  30 this is an easy way to set up your peripheral vision:  1. Attach a coloured (or black) “dot” of about three cm in diameter to the wall at the end of the  training room, opposite of you, elevated at the height of a person. (If there is a similar focus point  already there, use that.)  2. A few minutes before starting the training, focus on that point, so that you only see that point.  You can do this sitting down, as not to attract the attention of your students just as yet.  3. Maintain that focus for just a few seconds, then allow your vision to wander out to both the  left and right, while loosely still looking at that point. Allow your vision to wander out all the way to  90 degrees left and 90 right, covering a full half circle. You can even go beyond a half circle, but in  most training rooms that will be all you need.  4. Get used to that peripheral vision for half a minute and notice how you can see everything  that happens in the room, even the smallest movements, while you are still loosely looking at that  point you attached at the end of the room.  5. Now you can look relaxed all through the room and see how the peripheral vision stays with  you46. You are now in peripheral vision. Maintain that vision, even when trainees ask you questions.  45 It is fair to say that in peripheral vision not just your visual sense is more aware, but at least also your auditory  sense. It’s a form of light trance that comes with heightened awareness of the senses.  46 As you learn peripheral vision you will notice that some students are easier to look at than others. We tend to  like most to look at responsive students, those that physically and positively respond to what we are doing. But  this is a trap as focusing too much on such students can lead you back into central vision, and you lose touch  Figure 13: peripheral versus central vision  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  31  Whenever you need, repeat this exercise (e.g. after a break) – soon you will find you won’t need it  anymore, though some trainers like to always have a “focus point” at the opposite wall, as a reminder  and confidence booster. This is completely up to you.  7.4.3 Be out there with your students  Having done all the above, your physical and emotional states are good and relaxed now, you are  confident and at cause, and peripheral vision allows you to notice all that is going on. Now as you train  your students, be out there with them, enjoy training them, have fun. When you are out there with  them, you will often notice that you go too fast or said something you need to repeat, without anyone  asking anything. You will just notice some stirring or uneasy movements. When there are questions,  you will usually know that there are before they are raised – this is very useful as it can allow you to  encourage shy students. One of the authors sometimes notices a yet unspoken question and then if  it’s a shy student, stops and encourages the person in question with “you may have a question, please  feel free to ask?” Yes, this is an advanced technique, but practicing and using trainer state will get you  there.  7.4.4 Stay in contact  Stay in contact with your students; do not ignore them. This may sound logical, but consider the  following – and see the photos:  • do not turn your back on your audience when you are writing on a flip-chart or whiteboard,  reading an important line from the screen, or using your laser pointer  • when you are sketching or writing something in response to a question, finish the sketch or  writing before continuing to talk again  with the rest of the group. So do not focus on any students, but just let your gaze wander through the room  whenever you feel like doing so, not favouring any specific student.  Figure 14: Stay in contact with your audience  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  32  7.5 Rapport & leadership  Rapport47  is a pleasant state of being between people where it becomes easy to unconsciously accept  the other’s communication. Rapport happens at the unconscious level and is completely natural as we  are social beings. Rapport between lovers is the most obvious and e.g. manifests itself by walking in  the exact same pace. Rapport with friends and good colleagues is easy too, and you can see it in a  group because most people have the same stance (arms crossed for instance, or fist under chin) at a  given moment, and have also adapted their use of voice to a generally agreeable level.  The background of why rapport works and why it is so important goes back to the fact that various  research indicates that the effectiveness of our communication is based for only some 10% on the  words we use – the rest is based on body language and voice48. This explains why your body language  (remember the trainer state) and use of voice are so very important towards the success of your  training.  As the trainer you want to be in rapport with your students, so that they feel relaxed and  unconsciously accept your authority as the trainer, as the one whose words are taken seriously on the  topic you are discussing. And likewise you will be relaxed when you are in rapport with your trainees.  It goes both ways.  How do you achieve rapport? First of all, we are all born with this talent, we can all do it and do it all  the time. Some are better at it than others though. In a room with students it’s different than one on  one49. The best you can do is to be in trainer state. When you do that right and including an unspoken  respect for your students, we guarantee you that you will stimulate rapport quickly50. You will notice  it as the initial tension that is usually in the air with a new group of students will ease off. You will see  random groups of students being in obvious rapport with one another (e.g. one group sitting with  arms crossed, another group with legs stretched out) and with you. When you are in trainer state you  will always be included in this spreading rapport, you are even an important cause of it.  As you are in trainer state, stimulate rapport and are the trainer and expert – leading becomes really  simple. But you got to accept your leadership role. It is your training, you are in charge – no one else.  You decide when training starts, and when the breaks are. You decide content, and exercises. You  decide when it’s ok to ask questions and when it is not. When you do this consistently you will find  that it happens naturally and there is no need whatsoever to act like an archetypal army drill sergeant.  In fact, in most professional groups such dominant macho behaviour could well break rapport and  render your training ineffective, as it will create a battlefield instead of collaborative learning  environment. Nonetheless, do use your authority when you feel you need to: when some trainee is  breaking the rules so much as to become a disturbance to the other trainees or the success of your  training, you must act decisively and timely.  7.6 Socialization  Before we go into the handling of groups and individuals, it is useful to shortly consider when it’s a  good idea to plan some socialization event like an icebreaker, before the training starts. If you don’t  47 See e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapport - rapport is taught in any decent NLP training and in many  presentation and communication trainings  48 See e.g. http://www.microdot.net/nlp/rapport/physiology-in-rapport.shtml  49 For gaining rapport one-on-one see e.g. http://teejay648.wordpress.com/2008/04/01/how-to-build-rapport- with-anyone-instantly/ or http://coachingleaders.emotional-climate.com/how-to-achieve-rapport/  or attend  any good NLP Practitioner training.  50 Unless some trainees do not want to be there but were forced to. You will notice a lack of rapport then and  this should alarm you enough to go and find the cause of this, and see if you can remedy it one way or the other.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapport http://www.microdot.net/nlp/rapport/physiology-in-rapport.shtml http://teejay648.wordpress.com/2008/04/01/how-to-build-rapport-with-anyone-instantly/ http://teejay648.wordpress.com/2008/04/01/how-to-build-rapport-with-anyone-instantly/ http://coachingleaders.emotional-climate.com/how-to-achieve-rapport/  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  33  do something like that, the first few hours of a training tend to be a bit uneasy. Your trainees don’t  know each other and they don’t know you. Most are silent, interaction is low. So for any training that’s  longer than just one day, it’s a good idea to gain some time and momentum by breaking the ice before  the training starts. The evening before is often a good option. One way of doing it is setting a time that  everyone will be in the bar, for instance. There you find a relatively quiet place (preparation), or you  ask the barmen to bring the music down for a moment. You welcome everyone, introduce yourself  and any other trainers or staff, roughly tell about the training days ahead, and end with any logistics  details worth mentioning. A free first round of drinks is really nice, if the budget allows that. The rest  of that meeting is just informal, talking with people. As trainer, go round and talk with some people.  Adopt your training style. Of course this is an informal event, so you can dress relaxed, but not too  relaxed – you are the trainer, you will be watched, your example sets the tone for the whole training51.  You can also be creative and organize some sort of game for the icebreaker session, with the intention  of people leaving their comfort zone and talking with trainees they do not know yet. Don’t overdo this  however. You may love this kind of game, but others don’t like them much and may feel pushed.  Whatever you do, let it be inviting and respectful.  The next stage of socialization happens in the training room, after you start. Do a round of  introductions. During introductions, position yourself in such a way that when a trainee talks about  himself and looks at you, he also looks at the other trainees. So be in the position of the trainees. Take  enough time for that, so that people can say a few personal things. Ask some questions to your  trainees in a relaxed way - no cross examination. If you can, lead them into some form of small group  exercise within the hour. Small group exercises work really well for people to get better acquainted  and thus break the ice.  If you had no opportunity for an icebreaker event, what was just said about breaking the ice in the  training room becomes extra important.  One other social aspect of the training that you will set the tone for is how much you allow your  students to be in contact with their e-life outside the training room. In this era, asking for 100%  attention all the time during is unlikely to succeed, and may feel overwhelming especially for younger  trainees. Consider telling your students that you expect a 10%/90% split – 90% is for the training, 10%  they can use to keep track of their e-life. It is reasonable to require that such e-life interactions are  done unobtrusively and subtly to avoid disturbing other students.  Socialization does not stop there. It continues during the whole event. Breaks need to be long enough  to allow people to talk and share. Intermediate breaks typically 30 minutes. Lunch break 60-90  minutes, dinner up to two hours. The timings also depend on the country where you are. In countries  like France and Italy for instance, 60 minutes is usually too short for lunch.  If there is time for a social event during the training, then grab the chance. A social event needs to be  fun, but also respectful and not pushy. Some trainers utilise the social event for their training goals,  but you don’t have to. The same as said above applies: no matter how nice the event is, and no matter  how good the wine and beer are – you are always the trainer and set the example.  7.7 Group dynamics  Every new group of trainees will be different from the previous one. Humans differ and their reaction  to trainings differs. Also any group that is newly formed has its own dynamics. This is part of the  challenge for you as trainer – for experienced trainers it is part of the fun of doing trainings. You could  51 E.g. drinking too much together with your students is something you must avoid at all cost. The authors would  not go out with their students, but that’s up for debate.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  34  of course follow trainings in group dynamics, though this is rarely done in the field of information  security. Any decent communication or trainer training will certainly touch on this topic and is in  general more recommendable.  If your group of trainees stays together for longer than just a day and have regular interaction, like  during exercises, then this group will follow the usual group dynamics path. If there are more  participants and you form fixed subgroups, the same applies to those. Barry Tuckman’s stages for  group development52 are a useful model to know. The following picture explains the stages that any  newly formed group goes through.  Figure 15: Group Development Stages (Tuckman)  It is useful to recognise these phases when they occur – phases can vary in length from almost absent  to quite long. Sometimes, a storming group can take a lot of time to storm. Depending on the goal of  your training, you may need to address this, as storming is a natural process but can also be a  distraction. If team building is part of your goals, then in general it is not wise to try and stop the  storming, unless it takes offensive forms. Men storm more than women on average – especially a  female trainer needs to recognise this and not get worried.  Groups create implicit functions for the group members, mostly unconsciously. There will be one or  two leaders. There will be a “scribe”, someone taking notes. There will be easy going members who  just cooperate. There will be a mostly silent member – and what you hope is that the group leaders  will stimulate this person to participate. And there may be the occasional mismatcher, who usually  does the opposite of what the group does53. Do what you can to ensure that as many group members  participate as possible. If for instance one person is the scribe, then during evaluation you could ask  another group member to use the scribe’s notes and verbalise them (in most cases you want to  announce this beforehand, or you will scare people).  7.8 Handling of individuals  Most of your trainees will be great people, and when you are respectful and inviting towards them,  entertain good rapport and do as you promise, then you will do just great towards them. A few words  of advice on the handling of those very rare individual trainees who cause grief:  52 See e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development  53 No need to worry about natural mismatchers – it’s no sabotage, just how they are. They are the people who  go left when everyone goes right. When it IS sabotage, e.g. by someone who does not want to be in your training,  then you will notice some form of venom which is absent with mismatchers.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  35  • In any training group you will find someone who wants to teach you, the trainer. They have  some reason to show off their own knowledge or experience, or they just love to go on about their  personal experiences even if they may not be too interesting to the group. Don’t become their pet.  You are in charge. Make clear when it is ok to ask questions or make remarks, and when it is not. If  the remarks made are not very relevant or have too much repetition, then kindly but clearly put an  end to this. You could say any variation of “thank you for your input – we will continue now”. You  could add “if you want to discuss this more, do it offline please” but you don’t have to, especially if  that is exactly what you do not want. Be friendly, respectful and kind – but also honest. Now these  people are easy to handle. However sometimes, rarely in the experience of the authors, you have  someone in your group who does not want to be there. They were sent by their boss or someone else  in authority, and they have decided not to like this and take it out on the world. That is: on you as  trainer especially, as you represent authority. Even if they could benefit from your training, it is not  going to happen, they will punish you. Now you make talk some sense into them, during a break, and  this needs to be done at the earliest possible stage. If they really want to punish their boss – with you  as proxy – then not much is going to help and you may even need to remove them from the class. This  is treated in the next bullet point.  • The one showstopper is when one or more group members become clearly offensive or  hurtful towards others. This is unacceptable and you as the trainer will need to stop this. Respect  between trainees is essential – and as we argued before you set the example in that. In such cases the  first thing to do is a one-on-one talk with who you believe to be the offender – be very aware though,  as things are not always what they seem: some people like to play the victim role and blame others.  There are usually psychological reasons for any kind of bully or victim behaviour, but you are not their  therapist. Tell them what you expect in regard their behaviour, make it crystal clear if needed. If they  persist in negative behaviour warn them a second time – and make clear that the third time you will  remove them from the training.  • Make sure beforehand that you know what authority you have with this group. Can you  remove someone from the group? If you are not sure, can someone else in a leadership position do  that for you? If so, make sure you know such people and that they know you. Be aware that removing  someone from your training is the last thing you want to do. But sometimes you have to, so be  prepared. In countries like the UK or the USA it is not unusual to have the trainees sign rules of  engagement on the spot, at the very beginning of the training. These rules invariably allow the trainer  to remove a student – usually without a refund of the training cost54. When you have to use that last  resort and remove someone from your training, you need to make sure to do this during a break,  preferable a longer one like the lunch break, or at the end of the training day – and you must do it  one-on-one. The other trainees do not want to hear an unpleasant discussion between you and the  person to be removed: it’s not functional and will only spoil the mood. When they return from a break  and see that the offender has gone, they will usually be pleased.  7.9 Structuring the training  The first thing to do to structure your training is to use what you learnt in chapter 5, where we told  you to use the 4MAT system to bring an order to your teaching that will result in effective learning.  Now of course you use the 4MAT that you prepared in your classes. So with specific chunks of learning  you go WHY - WHAT - HOW - WHAT IF, where the WHY and WHAT IF can be 5-10% of the time and  the WHAT and the HOW fill the rest of the time. Also remember that if you have a topic with specific  54 One of the authors once had to remove a trainee who was spoiling a training for all others. Half of the course  money was paid back. The main thing is to get it done, one way or the other, with a minimum level of disruption  for the other students!  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  36  subtopics that need to be practiced (i.e. they need a HOW), that you can also go WHY - WHAT (subtopic  A) - HOW (subtopic A) - WHAT (subtopic B) - HOW (subtopic B) - etc. - WHAT IF. Use this, practice it. It  even works for your five minutes of fame before the board of the organisation: in such cases, five  minutes is all you’ll ever get. You start with explaining in a few sentences WHY the board must listen  to you – and this had better be good and related to how the board thinks, or you are wasting your  time. Then you spend two minutes on the WHAT and two on the HOW, and always you stay high level  – the HOW for a board member is about money, laws and resources, not about technical difficulties.  And finally the WHAT IF is time for questions.  Equally important is that you take the lessons of chapter three to hear and avoid lecture fatigue. Don’t  talk for more than 30 minutes at a time, make sure to embed other teaching elements to cater for  variety and to reach all types of students. Discussions, exercises, working in groups, technical work,  breaks, challenges, etc. are all tools that you can use for this purpose. Use them consciously, make  sure this was in your session plan. You can always improvise a teaching element when the interaction  with the trainees gives cause for that, or when you are inspired to do so – but know what you do when  you do this and do it sparingly please, to avoid chaos. Chaos will never give students the feeling that  they were in a good training.  A teaching element you can always use is the metaphor. We use metaphor here in the sense of a story  that is meaningful in the context of the training. That can be consciously meaningful – the topic can  be the same or similar for example – or it can be unconsciously meaningful: a story about challenge  and learning for instance. Plan your metaphors and think about the goal they have in the context of  your training. Put them in your session plan and explain why there are there at that moment. Don’t  put too many purposes in one metaphor – use more metaphors if needed, and keep the purpose of  each metaphor clear in your own mind. Do not explain the purpose to your trainees. It’s great when  you can tell your own stories as they are usually the most gripping. Make sure to polish your stories in  such a way that they become a great metaphor for the trainees. If that means you need to rewrite  history a bit, feel free to do so: you are not giving a lecture on a historical topic. Do not use metaphors  to show off: that is not their purpose. If you use the stories of others, make them sound if they are  your own – a metaphor does not work when the storyteller is detached. You need to play out the  metaphor in your choice of words and use of voice. If you have kids and you read out to them, you  already know how it is – just go with it and enjoy telling the story.  Why do metaphors, meaningful, contextualised stories, work so well? That’s because we humans love  stories. Look at movies and books – all stories. Even the most serious business men or university  professors love stories deep down. The idea behind this is that stories engage both the conscious and  the unconscious mind. And as learning requires the participation of the unconscious, this is exactly the  kind of buy-in that you want to achieve. Do you ever remember ten years later how you learnt  something so well? No you don’t, as the learning became unconscious and only then was it really  useful and lasting.  Milton Erickson55 was a famous psychiatrist and therapist who pioneered the use of metaphors as  important therapeutic tools. The first thing he did with metaphors was that he opened one at the  beginning of a therapeutic session, but did not close it right away. He just stopped the story at a cliff- hanger. Then at the end of the session, he’d close the story. The idea behind this is that the  unconscious mind loves stories and wants to hear how they end. So this way he opened up not only  the conscious but also the unconscious mind, to ensure that the learning effects were maximised. Why  don’t you try that in your trainings, just see how it goes.  55 See e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_H._Erickson  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  37  Erickson also very carefully picked his metaphors for purpose, as we already argued above you should  do too. Now he even did one more thing, and we advise you to only try this out once you are sure  footed in using metaphors, because it requires some skill. Once you are you will find how great this  can work. What Erickson did was not just open ONE story A and not close it. He opened up to five  stories B, C, D and E in a row, and did not close any one of them! Then he did his therapy work. Then  he closed the metaphors in reverse order, so from E to A. This process is called “multiple embedded  metaphors”.  7.10 Feedback  To give constructive and useful feedback to your students is an important part of training. If the  feedback is felt as harsh – the student will only remember the harshness and not the content – and  he will probably reject and resent it. If the feedback is too long and detailed, the student will only  remember two to three things. If it’s too nice all over because you want to motivate him, then the  student may feel great about his own achievement, but if it really wasn’t any good, this kind of  feedback won’t make it any better. In general, a good way of giving feedback is using the so-called  feedback sandwich as you can see in the picture. You need to read this top-down. So first you start  with a thank you for trying and a few points that went really well. Then secondly, a few precise  observations of things to improve, and the way how to improve them: tell clearly to the students what  you expect of them. And thirdly, you wrap up with a positive, motivating conclusion. This way of giving  feedback can work quite well, but do remember to moderate your critique. If the student still has a  lot of improvements to make, limit your observations to a few main things that need improvement.  When a trainee does  something 90% well, then you  can go into the finer details.  Remember, here too “less is  more” applies. Another good  idea is that if the trainees have  done an assignment in a  group, to have one of the  other group members write  down a summary of the  feedback. That way the  student can listen to you  without worrying about  forgetting it. Another method  is to have the student repeat  the two to four (no more!)  suggestions that you made for  improvement.  Most importantly for feedback: give feedback in a respectful way and stay in rapport. Make a joke if  you are natural at that, but never ever at the expense of the student. Break the ice, make clear that  everyone is there to learn, and that you as trainer learn from each training too.  7.11 Be prepared for the worst  And just when you think you got everything under control and your training is well on its way – things  happen. The air-conditioning stops working and its blazing hot outside. One of your trainees becomes  Figure 16: Feedback sandwich  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  38  ill, or runs into an emotional state that needs attention. The hotel’s renovations have just started and  the drill does not sound quite right for your training. Your voice decides to take a day off.  All of this and much more can happen – and will happen someday, one way or the other. If you  prepared well, you can already meet a lot of challenges. Some are hard or impossible to prepare for  in terms of equipment or arrangements. For those you need to prepare mentally. Set yourself up so  that the training will be a success, no matter what. Then instead of panicking, or going passive, you  will find the best possible solution and go for it.  Often this means you need to take action or negotiate. Be prepared to pause the training to do that.  You can be open about this: “folks, this is one of these things you can’t plan for – I need to address  this problem right now or it will affect our training – twenty minute break, starting now – wish me  luck!”. If the hotel is “to blame” you may need to really escalate the problem. Hotel staff is in the  authors’ experience very good in saying “sorry Sir, nothing we can do about it”. Once one of us was  offered a refund – but that doesn’t help the trainees and is not acceptable as a solution. If necessary  one of the hotel management will need to come up with a satisfactory solution, and quick. Use all your  powers of persuasion.  Clearly it is ideal to not be on your own. When you have a co-trainer – or a logistics man, it becomes  much easier to deal with such issues, as at least you can keep focusing on the training, as best as can  be done under the circumstances. Be flexible. If there is a lot of noise, then you could possibly go into  a small group exercise.  Let’s look at technical trainings for a moment. There you almost always have to prepare for challenges  occurring. Some estimates from real life experience:  • If the training involves a number of technical devices which are supplied to the trainees to  work with, then you can safely assume that around 20% of these devices will not work properly.  • If the trainees use their own devices, such as laptops, and you e.g. provide them with virtual  images to install, then the percentage of problems will usually exceed 20%, no matter how well you  thought you prepared everything.  • If you do a technical training for the first time and it involves hands-on technical work, then  estimate the time needed for that hands-on work, and at least double it. That figure will be a better  estimate.  Sometimes your trainees give you a hard time. Remember: you are in charge, therefore stay calm,  maintain trainer state, and stay in charge. In the worst case you may need to ask a trainee to leave  the training. Never allow to be engaged in discussions about the set-up and format of the training,  and make sure that classroom discussions don’t touch topics like politics or religion. It is always you  as trainer who decides what to discuss and for how long. Be worthy, respectful and predictable in your  intentions and behaviour.  8 Closing of trainings  I never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn. [Albert  Einstein]  When you have done as Einstein suggested, and provided the right conditions for learning, then the  closing of the training will simply be the next natural step in the process. Closing the training should  be much more than just saying “thank you and goodbye”, in fact it should be part of the learning  process, not the end of it. In this chapter we explore some closing tactics that you can adopt.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  39  8.1 How to properly wrap up a training?  Wrapping up a training is an opening, not a closure. It opens the way for the trainees to actually use  what they have learnt. And possibly they will opt for further learning. So the use of your training does  not stop when it ends: that’s the time that it really begins. Once you understand this fully, you can  devise a sensible wrap-up. We give two suggestions here:  • Check during the training and during wrap-up if the learning objectives have been met. This  requires that you have clear, achievable learning objectives – we already advised you to have such. If  they are clear, you can ask simple questions and find out. It definitely has to be more than “ok, we’re  done, is all clear to you now?”  • If the topic allows this, you can send the trainees away with some additional materials, printed  and/or electronic, around the theme “now this is what you can do when you get home”. So this would  typically be checklists, including suggestions for application of the knowledge and how to achieve  further learning. The idea is to make sure that the trainees never get stuck in working what they just  learnt.  8.2 Testing & tasking  Your training may include a test near the end – oral, written, or computerized. Whatever test you do,  make sure that it supports the learning objectives. See the test as part of the learning process, not as  a punishment for the trainees for behaving so well during the course. Ideally, make the test results  known before the training ends. If passing the test is a requirement, and someone does not pass –  then communicate this in private, discuss available options (Take the test again later? Take the course  again? At extra cost?) and suggest clearly what the trainee needs to do and prepare to pass the test  next time.  In rare cases, you can task the trainees when they leave the training. This means – give them a task  that they need to fulfil within a given timeframe, and provide you with satisfactory feedback. This will  only work when they have agreed to this in advance, or when their management supports it. When it  happens, make the tasking very clear: they need to exactly know what to do, as you won’t be around  for asking questions. The timeframe also needs to be set. And finally, the feedback to you needs to be  clearly defined, or else you will just get a mail which says “I did it”. Say for instance they need to  prepare a demo – then ask them to make a video of that demo while they give it, and send you that  video.  8.3 Evaluation  The worst way of evaluating the course is not evaluating it at all, but just say “that’s about it, thanks  guys, safe travels home and good luck!” You may have been brilliant as a trainer, but how are you ever  going to know? How are you going to improve the training materials and your own performance? In  short, it is useful to do a proper evaluation.  The method most used is usually no good either, because poorly implemented: the written evaluation  form that you fill out at the end of the training. They are usually filled in hastily, remark fields (which  are the most useful to your growth as a trainer) get ignored and if you ask people to rate on a scale of  one to five then one and five will hardly be used and you end up with bland results. If you do choose  to use this kind of evaluation then pre-frame it before you hand over the forms. Tell them you will  absolutely pay attention to what they fill out, to use the full scale for rating, and to please, please  write down some remarks, as those are really helpful.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  40  Probably the most useful kind of evaluation during the training is done orally. You do this all the time  – especially in breaks. This kind of evaluation is veiled – you don’t ask your trainee “how was that last  session and was I any good?” but you might ask “do you think you can apply now what we just  discussed? Did you miss any insights or learnings?”  Additionally, you can ask an experienced tutor to attend your training and write down comments and  suggestions for you to use afterwards, to improve the materials and your teaching. Also ask them for  a verbal debriefing. The evaluator is ideally a fellow tutor, but can really be anyone with a critical mind  and open eye: but make sure he is independent and brave enough to criticize you. If an evaluator is  assigned to a training then do make sure that the trainer knows this well in advance, and that evaluator  and trainer have a chance to meet before the training starts. You don’t want the trainer to feel  ambushed – this might well affect the quality of the training in a negative way.  Another option is a follow-up interview one month later. Your trainees need to agree with this in  advance. You can explain them that this has a dual purpose – for you to find out how successful the  training was and how it might be improved – and for the trainee as an opportunity to ask additional  questions a month later. In 2012 ENISA conducted a survey asking the average perceived value of  various trainings, and the results are presented in the Roadmap to provide more proactive and  efficient Computer Emergency Response Team training56  In case there is an opportunity and need to test the effectiveness of a training one very good way  might be to organise an exercise where previously taught skills are exercised individually. The results  need to be addressed with caution though, because it is nearly impossible to correctly evaluate a skill  not taking into account the previous experience and many other factors.  8.4 Acknowledgements  As formal acknowledgement that the trainees have successfully done the training, you can do a  number of things:  • A nice certificate on paper, with their name on it, a characterisation of the training content,  the number of hours they spent in preparing and following the training57 , the names of the trainers,  and a signature by the lead trainer and/or some other relevant figure of authority. The authors  recommend to always make such a certificate.  • A letter to the trainee, repeating much of the same which should be on the paper certificate,  and again signed by the lead trainer. It’s useful if they receive this letter as a pdf attached to an e-mail  sent to them, because that way they can easily send the pdf to their management, to accreditation  instances, etc.  • Accreditation points. If you can register your training with some accreditation body (like CISSP  in information security for instance), then your training can be rated with a certain number of points  in their education system. This is very helpful for trainees who are a member of such programs, as  they need to continuously collect such points to remain in good standing.  56  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise/roadmap-to-provide-more-proactive-and- efficient-cert-training/at_download/fullReport  57 The specification of the number of hours spent can help the trainees gathering “points” for professional  education programmes or accreditations they participate in.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise/roadmap-to-provide-more-proactive-and-efficient-cert-training/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise/roadmap-to-provide-more-proactive-and-efficient-cert-training/at_download/fullReport  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  41  8.5 Stay in touch  It depends on the kind of training and environment you work in, but sometimes it’s useful to have a  way of staying in touch with your ex-trainees. We suggest the following options:  • Encourage the trainees to exchange contact details – you should have those already,  otherwise, make sure you do.  • Create a mailing list containing you and the trainees. If you do, then use it. If you don’t use it,  it will be dead and forgotten within three months. Typically such a list is only for the participants of  one training.  • Create a web presence for this purpose and give the trainees access. If you do you had better  make it really inviting and useful, or else no one will ever use it more than once. A web presence can  work for the participants of all trainings on that topic.  • One option could be an interview after one month as an option to consider. A comeback event  is another option – this will be a rare possibility, but if it is possible, go for it. This event will typically  be a few hours or half day. Do it around threeto six months later. Annual comeback events are a real  luxury if you can afford them, but can be great for ongoing learning – both for the trainees and yourself  as trainer. Such events are clearly meant for sharing the learnings – so it should not be just you talking.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  42  9 ANNEX A: Logistics checklist.  Use this checklist to prepare a successful training. The suggested timeline given is just an example to  help to think ahead. The checklist is written assuming you cover all items on the list on your own as a  trainer, in case you have help in the form of logistics person, or co-trainer, then divide the work, but  make sure that everything in the checklist will be covered – as the a trainer you are responsible of the  process!

Following  an overview with recommendations is presented.  10.1 Existing international CERT Training Initiatives  We offer a list of international CSIRT training initiatives here, with a regional focus on Europe:   TRANSITS: http://www.terena.org/activities/transits/  TRANSITS offers a two-day introductory course for CSIRT members (TRANSITS I) and a three-day  course with advanced topics (TRANSITS II: forensics, netflow and human communication).  TRANSITS’ aim is to foster the education of CERT professionals and keep the threshold (including  the cost) for that as low as is feasible. The programme is run  not-for-profit and was set up in  Europe by the European research network community (TERENA). ENISA supports TRANSITS.  TRANSITS is given all over the world, also thanks to cooperation with FIRST.  TRANSITS also offers a train-the-trainer course, to get experienced CERT professionals up-and- running as TRANSITS trainers – the body of trainers exists of volunteers.   ENISA exercises: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  ENISA offers a set of more than 30 exercises for CERTs which anyone can use for free. The topics  range from organisational, via legal and law enforcement oriented, towards highly technical. You  can run the exercises “off the shelf” as all materials (including VM images for some technical  exercises) are included.  TRANSITS uses some of the ENISA exercises in their trainings.  On request, ENISA can offer guided exercises and related trainings – get in touch with cert- relations@enisa.europa.eu .   CERT/CC training courses: http://cert.org/training/  The CERT Coordination Center was the first CERT on the planet and still is one of the most eminent  organisations in the field. They have trainings in the areas if incident handling, network security  and risk assessment & insider threat. Their trainings are commercial and take place in the USA.  Their incident handling courses are also offered in Germany on request: http://www.pre- secure.com/ir/courses/index.html   SANS training courses: http://www.sans.org/courses/  SANS offer a great variety of commercial security courses. Many are relevant to CERTs, to name  just a few:  o Incident Response Team Management  o Hacker Techniques, Exploits & Incident Handling  o Advanced Computer Forensic Analysis and Incident Response  All courses are offered in the USA – some also in other regions of the world. You can get SANS to  come to you and offer trainings, at a price.   FIRST Education Committee: http://www.first.org/about/organization/committees#edc  Not a training per se but an international group of CERT experts working together on education  issues. You can join them or get in touch with them.  The Education Committee supports the  TRANSITS framework and as such also organizes train-the-trainer training in cooperation with  TRANSITS.  http://www.terena.org/activities/transits/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise mailto:cert-relations@enisa.europa.eu mailto:cert-relations@enisa.europa.eu http://cert.org/training/ http://www.pre-secure.com/ir/courses/index.html http://www.pre-secure.com/ir/courses/index.html http://www.sans.org/courses/ http://www.first.org/about/organization/committees#edc  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  45  10.2 National & Local CERT Training Initiatives  Many bigger CSIRTs organize their own trainings locally – sometimes also inviting the members of  other teams, usually in the same country. Some use their own materials for these courses, others use  e.g. TRANSITS What speaks for these trainings is that they are given by experienced professionals.  We advise you to get in touch with a well respected CERT in your country, e.g. the national or  government team, and ask them if they offer trainings or can recommend trainings for your team. The  most up-to-date list of European CERTs (including national and governmental ones) is found at  https://www.trusted-introducer.org/directory/country_LICSA.html . A world directory at  http://www.first.org/members/map .  Commercial security training companies are only now starting to offer CERT related trainings. One  example is an “Incident Response Practitoner” training offered in The Netherlands by the Security  Academy. 59  We have no overview of such courses, nor hands-on experience with them. Ask  experienced CERTs in your countries if they can recommend such courses.  10.3 Synergy  In the following are suggestions that can improve the CERT training field and its coherence:   ENISA’s “Roadmap to provide more proactive and efficient CERT training” has already been  partially implemented. The following recommendations still apply in the context of “synergy” here  and are highly recommend to follow up on:  o Run ENISA CERT exercises at universities. This way students can participate in training that  will teach them about the CERT area, but at the same time the cooperation with university  teachers will prove beneficial for engaging universities more in the CERT area.  o “Fire Drills” for the CERT community. Get CERTs to do “fire drill” exercises together. This  is a very effective educational tool. Make sure that very experienced CERT members are  the mentors of the drill.  o ENISA CERT Training Hubs (ECTH). The idea here is to accredit existing CERTs or  commercial security training providers as providers of CERT related trainings. This will help  emerging CERTs pick the best educations for their staff, and it will encourage existing  training providers to improve their trainings to meet a minimum set of requirements.  o Certification paths. This is again about working together with universities, but also with  ECTHs (see above), to define education paths for (future) members of the CSIRT  community – and to add the element of certification to that. Ideally, this certification  would become an internationally recognised quality seal. Such a programme would be  very helpful for improving the education of (future) team members.   We recommend that each country make a list of available CERT related trainings in their country.  This could be an initiative of the national or governmental CERT. Ideally, some quality seal or  minimum set of requirements would apply to trainings listed in that way, but this may still be a  bridge too far in most countries. We recommend any party who sets up such a listing, to get in  59 No link offered as this is just one arbitrary example.  https://www.trusted-introducer.org/directory/country_LICSA.html http://www.first.org/members/map https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise/roadmap-to-provide-more-proactive-and-efficient-cert-training/at_download/fullReport  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  46  touch with ENISA first to look for synergy, as ENISA is aware of most ongoing developments in this  area.   We recommend that existing regional CERT meetings like e.g. TF-CSIRT in Europe (see  http://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/ ) add an element of education to their meetings, as in  an extra day before or after the meetings. To start with, such regional fora could ask existing  training providers such as TRANSITS, or indeed ENISA or experienced CERTs who have their own  training programmes, to come and fill such “training days”. Another option is to do a “fire drill” at  such days, as recommended above. This recommendation is a cost effective and relatively easy  way to organize trainings for a big number of CERTs. As a side effect, it will increase the standing  and reputation of such fora as TF-CSIRT.   We recommend that FIRST (e.g. by means of the Educational Committee) and/or ENISA set up a  dialogue between the various training providers, most notably including ENISA, FIRST, TRANSITS,  CERT/CC and SANS. Such a dialogue should include topics like certification paths in time. It is in  the interest of all to define education standards for the CERT area. Those responsible for  programmes like CISSP and CISM should be included at some stage, so that educations in the CERT  area could give “points” for the ongoing accreditation process involved in such programmes as  CISSP and CISM.   We recommend that a train-the-trainer programme is set up for future trainers in the CERT area,  but also to improve the skills of existing trainers, who are often great technical experts but less  experienced as a trainer. TRANSITS is well suited to set this up as they already have offered several  of such trainings, run by one of the authors and one of the reviewers of this guide. It is  recommended that this is set-up in cooperation with ENISA. Collaboration with the FIRST  Educational Committee is recommended.  http://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  47  11 ANNEX C: Bibliography  1.

Since 2013 ENISA started providing  training activities to the European CERT community. While these efforts were widely used and  appreciated by the CERTs and other communities, the challenges and circumstances have changed  and are evolving rapidly. Since ENISA started its training and support activities, the importance of  managing information security incidents has grown to become a top priority for companies,  government institutions, universities, schools, and EU Member States. CERTs have emerged in all  sectors and countries, and the number of national and governmental CERTs is continuing to grow. As  ENISA and numerous CERTs provide trainings to provide constant influx of new information security  professionals, and to enhance the skills of existing team members, the effect of training needs to be  long-lasting. Furthermore the field of CERT operations is highly specialised, and not widely covered by  trainings. To fill in the gap community frequently organises workshops where experts “from the field”  are asked to educate other members. Therefore the “Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies”  was created to provide guidance on how to create, organise and conduct trainings that would be  remembered, valued, and have long-lasting effect.  It is important to note that the contents of the good practice guide originate from the knowledgebase  and experience of the authors, reviewers, and contributors who have created, organised, and  conducted trainings to CERT community and also to the wider audience.  3 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/transits-training  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events  5 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/transits-training https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  2  2 Introduction  Training is everything. The peach was once a bitter almond; cauliflower is nothing, but  cabbage with a college education. [Mark Twain, 1835-1910]  Why write a guide about training methodologies when there are so many resources and theories on  “trainings” and “trainers” already?  There are two reasons. Firstly, to bring the \"field experience\" of being a trainer6  to the target audience  (see below), coming from highly experienced trainers who are both experts in information security  and well versed in the concept of “training” itself.  Secondly, to condense this experience and knowledge in a guide, which will help trainers in the field  to expand their skills and raise their awareness of the processes of teaching and learning.  The goal is to guide both novice and experienced trainers to design and deliver trainings of any size or  type, and to make these trainings more successful, more “fun” and with better and longer lasting  results. This practical guidance is backed up by the presentation of essential theories and research in  this area, including references. This will enable trainers to learn and study these topics in-depth.  2.1 Target audience  The target audience includes all those in the information security and CERT area who design or deliver  “trainings” in the broadest sense of the word. Training includes a process where knowledge or skills  are being purposefully taught, shown or transferred live7  to one or more people, who are receiving  the training. Trainings include lectures, teaching, instruction, practice sessions, presentations, hands- on trainings, guided discussion, directed exercises, etc.  The guide has been written bearing in mind fairly traditional “classroom type” trainings, as these are  still the most common ones in use – however without any limitation to specific types of delivery  methods. Also, the principles described can effortlessly be extended to all types of “trainings” as  indicated above.  Thus whenever the word “training” is used in this guide, it needs to be appreciated and applied in the  broadest sense of the word.  Examples given in the guide will in most cases be relevant for the primary target audience, however  those too can be easily generalized by a creative reader, and used to his/her own benefit.  Finally: ENISA’s scope is the EU, especially the national and governmental levels. Therefore this guide  is written with that in mind. However, like many of ENISA’s good practice guides, the usefulness of  this guide is in no way limited to that constituency only.  2.2 How to use this guide  We recommend reading this guide from beginning to end, the first time. After which, you may wish to  use the guide as a reference and skip to specific items/topics. If you are in a hurry (like preparing for  a training) you can just read the short introductions to chapters three and four and then continue with  the chapters after that. Make sure to come back to these two chapters later though, as we guarantee  they will give you food for thought that will help to make you a better trainer.  6It is important to note that scope is not limited to “information security trainer”.  7 Live can be in person as well as through videoconference or chat. The limitation to live trainings does not mean that the learnings from  this guide would not be applicable to e.g. more advanced online trainings (using more communication vectors than just an image of the  trainer), or “written” courses. Many of them will be applicable, one way or the other. However, advanced online and written c ourses are so  different in many ways, and such challenging themes onto themselves, that we cannot and will not pretend to cover them here “on the fly”.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  3  3 Learning and teaching strategies  People are different: they learn, take in information and communicate in different ways. Not everyone  thinks like you do. Knowing this will enable you to become a better trainer. [Jim Buddin, The GÉANT  Association, Training Coordinator] 8  In this chapter we provide you with essential ideas on how people learn in different ways, and how  you should cater for those different needs in your training sessions. We will start with a theoretical  framework (Kolb), which is the introduction to the 4MAT system that you can readily apply in all your  trainings, presentations and training materials.  3.1 Learning by doing  David A. Kolb pioneered the idea of experiential learning, which is learning by reflection on doing9 .  Experiential learning’s focus is the individual learning process.  Note that Kolb suggests that learning is a circular process, and that the best learning is achieved when  going through the whole circle repeatedly. Experiential learning is powerful, but does require self- initiative, the intention to learn and be an active participant in learning, so it is not just theory.  Kolb further introduced four learning styles on top of his experiential learning diagram, suggesting  that there are four types of learners: divergers, assimilators, convergers and accommodators. We  provide you with a diagram here that explains this concept well10:  8 The book “Design For How People Learn” by Julie Dirksen is a highly recommended read in this area  9 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_learning offers a good introduction. On David Kolb’s commercial  website there is a useful set of references in http://learningfromexperience.com/research/  10 For more information see e.g. http://www.simplypsychology.org/learning-kolb.html  Figure 1: Experiential Learning (Kolb)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_learning http://learningfromexperience.com/research/ http://www.simplypsychology.org/learning-kolb.html  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  4  Note that the texts in orange colour (why, what, etc.) are not part of Kolb’s theory but point ahead to  McCarthy’s 4MAT model, which will be described in the next paragraph.  3.2 The 4MAT Model  The ideas of Kolb and others are interesting and insightful but not so easy to apply in real life. Credits  go to Bernice McCarthy who further developed these concepts into the 4MAT model that you as a  trainer can easily implement and that will get you results 11. We highly recommend that you use 4MAT,  and that is why we present it not only here, but also later in this guide to explain how you can use the  model in real life.  McCarthy proposes four types of learners, and her characterisation is based on Kolb’s:  11  An easily accessible presentation of 4MAT is found on McCarthy’s commercial website under  http://www.aboutlearning.com/what-is-4mat . The original book is “About Learning Inc.; 1st Ed. edition (May  1996)” by Bernice McCarthy. Other useful references found at http://www.4mat.eu/theory-studies- research.aspx .  Figure 2: Learning Styles (Kolb)  http://www.aboutlearning.com/what-is-4mat http://www.4mat.eu/theory-studies-research.aspx http://www.4mat.eu/theory-studies-research.aspx  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  5  The four types of learners are labelled as WHY, WHAT, HOW and WHAT IF people. The percentages in  the diagram indicate how what percentages of people fall into those categories, according to  McCarthy. These percentages show that you can expect a fair percentage of your students to be in  each of the four categories, which means you must cater your trainings for all four types of learners.  It is important to remember that any model is just that – a model, and not reality. People are not  bound by the 4MAT model and can therefore never simply be classified and told “you are a WHY  person!”. It is about learning preferences – most of us fall into more than one category, sometimes  even all four. But it is also true that most of us do prefer one of these four over the others.  Exercise, most useful in a trainer’s training: Explain the 4MAT model to your trainees. Assign the four  categories to corners of the training room – a WHY corner, WHAT corner, etc. Tell your trainees to go  to the corner that most expresses their learning style – and to discuss with one another how they  understand and perceive that style. You may find typical things, like in the WHY corner people may ask  “but WHY are we doing this?”, whereas in the HOW corner the process of discussion usually flows quite  easily. Finally, while leaving all of the trainees in their corners, have a plenary discussion about the four  categories. Stress that the “map is not the territory” and that these categories are useful concepts but  that no man is bound to just one category!  An important concept in the application of the 4MAT model is that as a trainer you need to serve the  four categories in a specific order: WHY first, then WHAT, next HOW and finally WHAT IF. There are  good reasons for this which you can find in detail in the references provided. In essence, you will “lose”  the WHY people if you don’t start out by explaining WHY they are there listening to you. The WHAT  and HOW people are used to being more patient, and to first explain the theory (WHAT) and then the  process of application (HOW) is natural. The WHAT IF naturally includes questions and thus is best  placed at the end.  You can apply 4MAT to most training, education or presentation, including your five minute high level  presentation to the Board of Directors! It’s a very useful way to logically organise the content you  Figure 3: The 4MAT System (McCarthy)  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  6  want to present, at the same time reach as many types of learners as you possibly can, while doing  that in the most effective order.  For extended trainings, you need to organise the content in more topics. Then you can have an overall  4MAT applied to the whole training, starting with the WHY. And then per topic you can apply 4MAT  again. If you present a model which has a bigger number of subtopics, and each one of these needs to  be practiced – then you can adapt the 4MAT system in a way as to do WHY, then a short overview  WHAT, next a WHAT and HOW for each of the subtopics, concluding with the overall WHAT IF.  3.3 VARK Model  Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) models human communication and provides techniques which  help improve the effectiveness of communication at all levels (not just words.) and also provides  therapeutic applications, mostly for achieving behavioural changes12 . A result of NLP is the idea that  people have a “preferred” sense among the five senses – in most cases visual, auditory or kinaesthetic  (feeling via the body) – one that they also engage in learning. The suggestion is that people who prefer  visual, need especially visual cues for learning. The same goes for people with an auditory and  kinesthetic (feeling) preference. And a fourth category is added for those who prefer internal dialogue  and words. The teacher can accommodate all categories by including in a training not only auditory  and word elements (the traditional lecture: listening to the professor and reading a book), but also  visuals (whiteboard, flipcharts, videos) and kinesthetic elements (learning by doing, feeling, trying it  out). Any good training should be a mix of these four. For learning purposes this was synthesized by  Neil Fleming in the VARK model13.  Figure 4: Learning Preferences: (VARK Model)  12 Most NLP references are commercial. A good introduction to NLP is “Introducing NLP: Psychological Skills for  Understanding and Influencing People”, by Joseph O'Connor and John Seymour (Conari Press, revised edition  2011).  13  See e.g. http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=categories for the VARK model and for Fleming  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_D._Fleming  http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=categories https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_D._Fleming  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  7  3.4 10,000 hours  K. Anders Ericsson performed research among kids playing the violin since early childhood, which  indicated that the highest forms of competency is reached mainly as a result of many hours of study.  What he found was that around 10,000 hours of study before the age of twenty led to the highest  forms of competence14.  Subsequent generalisation and popularisation (by Malcolm Gladwell et al.) of Ericsson’s research  findings into a 10,000 hours “rule” has led to much heated debate and seems to be questionable.  However you will find it no surprise that practice, practice and more practice yields the master. This  applies to you as a trainer as well.  4 Training methods  Train, don’t strain. [Arthur Lydiar, 1917-2004, professional athlete and coach]  In this chapter you will learn that old style lectures, only talking from front to “class”, are not effective  and that instead you need to give your trainees a variety of training methods. That way you can  optimize the chance of keeping their attention, and thus increase learning.  4.1 Span of attention  Old style lectures whereby a professor just talks and talks in front of his students are almost extinct  nowadays. And that’s a good thing, as the span of attention for the learning style “just sit there and  listen” lasts less than half an hour. The following diagram is an illustration of that15:  Figure 5: Effectiveness of Traditional Lecture  4.2 Training Methods  It is recommended to use a variety of training methods to reach your students, and make sure to do  that in a diverse manner. Make sure there is enough to do, write, see and hear – in that order! The  14 http://www.psy.fsu.edu/faculty/ericsson/ericsson.exp.perf.html  15 See e.g. McKeachie’s Teaching Tips, Wilbert McKeachie, 14th edition (2013). This kind of research has been  repeated many times over, the results are approximately the same.  http://www.psy.fsu.edu/faculty/ericsson/ericsson.exp.perf.html  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  8  number of methods you can adopt is actually quite high. See the following diagram containing some  suggestions in this regard:  Figure 6: Training Methods  4.3 The Learning Pyramid  The ineffectiveness of the traditional lecture style, but also of just “reading a book”, is apparent in the  learning pyramid16 , presented below. The pyramid shows that a training which combines “hearing”  16 The learning pyramid is widely attributed to the US National Training Laboratories (NTL) – this seems to be an  urban legend however. The idea for the pyramid probably comes from Edgar Dale in his book Audio-Visual  Methods in Teaching, Dryden Press (1954) – but it’s unclear where the percentages come from, though the NTL  seems to claim they are based on their research – only they can’t find that research. See  http://homepages.gold.ac.uk/polovina/learnpyramid/about.htm which also contains the image that we  presented. As the plausibility of the diagram is mostly undisputed, we decided to present it here as it does  contain valuable ideas.  http://homepages.gold.ac.uk/polovina/learnpyramid/about.htm  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  9  and “seeing” already achieves much better results, but that the most effective training methods  include “seeing and writing” as in workshops, and “doing” as in going through the steps one by one.  Looking at the learning pyramid, you can see that seeing is fairly effective, but doing and teaching are  the best vehicles for learning and remembering. In the medical world the “adagium” See One – Do  One – Teach One is often used as an application of this17. The idea is simple: first see how something  is done. Then do it yourself. And finally teach it to others. This method has proven to be very effective  for example in medical educations. There is some critique on it saying that See One and Do One are  not enough to gain sufficient learning to be able to teach one. This will be correct for learning complex  matters or techniques, but just leads to a small attenuation of the “adagium”: See Many – Do Many –  Teach One. The essential idea stays the same.  As CERT community touches wide range of areas, consisting of legal, operational, and technical  challenges, it is highly recommended that trainers seeks to touch the very bottom of the learning  pyramid where the effectiveness is the highest. As practice is often the most time consuming part, the  trainer should consider the available time, and cover less topics more in depth.  17 See e.g. http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2003/12/ccas3-0312.html  Figure 7: Learning Pyramid  http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2003/12/ccas3-0312.html  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  10  5 How to be a trainer  Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or  excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do.  Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit. [Aristotle, 384-322 BCE]  Before asking how to become a trainer, we should ask, “why be a trainer?”  5.1 Motivation  The basic motivation of any trainer should be to want to share experience and knowledge with their  trainees. This applies both to a professional trainer, as well as to ad hoc trainers18 . Motivation for  ENISA to support the trainings is to ensure that every EU member state has well-functioning national  and governmental CERT. In 2012 a roadmap was created to provide more proactive and efficient CERT  training19.  The reasons why a trainer wants to share his experience and knowledge can be one or more of the  following:  - The lack of well-trained people in a specific area and the trainer seeks to address this (an  example is the CERT community: as it is rare to find dedicated CERT education in schools or universities  to cover the full range of CERT services in depth20, the CERTs themselves organise trainings to fill this  gap).  - Specific/specialised skills need to be fostered e.g. inside an organisation or team (for example  in IT forensics skills).  - The need for greater understanding of terminology, concepts, and ideas: this will benefit the  effectiveness of future communication, operations etc.  - Gauging his own skills and experience, and learning new things in the process: training people  confronts the trainer with his own understanding and grasp of a topic. Ideally a trainer will be two  logical/experience “levels” or higher above that of their audience21. However, a trainer who is not that  advanced, can still be a very good trainer as long as he communicates well with his students and  realizes his limitations. Also, some of the most knowledgeable experts are not the best trainers in their  area of expertise. It is preferable to be a good and enthusiastic trainer to knowing “the last bit of  everything”.  - Having a new idea of great potential and wanting to share it with others; in that case  excellence as a trainer is less of an issue; enthusiasm and vision are compensating the lack of training  skills.  18 If you think you are only a trainer because your supervisor assigned you to the task and you don’t feel self- motivated, then read this guide carefully and put the recommendations into practice. Practice and be well  prepared. And you may or may not find that training people is great fun. Give yourself time to observe and enjoy  the process, and you will surprise yourself.  19  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise/roadmap-to-provide-more-proactive-and- efficient-cert-training/at_download/fullReport  20 http://www.cert.org/incident-management/services.cfm  21 Being a few levels higher than your students is a well-known qualitative concept. We will not endeavour an  exact definition here. Use your gut feeling, as in the following: when you don’t know something you are at level  0. When you learn it for the first time, you reach level one. When you have worked and struggled with it long  enough, you reach level 2. When you see the structure behind it and understand both that and the details, and  can explain it in simple terms, you are at level 3 or higher.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise/roadmap-to-provide-more-proactive-and-efficient-cert-training/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise/roadmap-to-provide-more-proactive-and-efficient-cert-training/at_download/fullReport  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  11  Would you rather be a professional full-time trainer, or an ad hoc one? Remember that \"sharing\" is  basic to being a trainer. Of course a professional trainer will have considerable training and content  wisdom to share, however the ad hoc trainer, who 90% of the time practices what he teaches,  sometimes has an advantage when it comes to real-life experience. And real-life experience is  probably THE most effective way to gain credibility with trainees. We invite you to tell tales of real  events – and just notice how comfortable it is to apply the 4MAT system to such stories.  There are plenty of good reasons to be a trainer. Yet even when you may not see yourself as an  excellent trainer, remember that being in front of an audience does not mean that you have to know  the answers to all possible questions. You are simply the one standing in front of the audience sharing  your learning, experience and events you have witnessed from close by. Being able to talk about your  experiences in plain language is a great opportunity for information sharing. And by doing it more  often, and acquiring trainer skills, you will grow from consciously competent to both consciously and  unconsciously competent over time22.  5.2 Education & training  There is no clearly defined education or training path to become a great trainer in IT Security. There  are all sorts of content-oriented training paths (like CISSP, or CISM), there are specialised subject  matter trainings (like TRANSITS I and II, or classes in topics as forensics, etc.), but when you ask \"how  do I become a trainer\", there is often no easy answer.23 Additionally the goal of certified knowledge  serves a purpose of ensuring, that the holder of certificate has passed the minimum requirements  required in the certification process. Specialised trainings on the other hand most commonly lead the  participant into the depths of a narrow field of expertise showing best practices on how could the best  results be achieved.  If you already are experienced and knowledgeable in your area of expertise, and you are motivated to  become a trainer, then you are recommended to:  - read, understand, and practice, a training guide like this one24;  - read more about training and communication (this guide will give you plenty of references);  - learn from successful trainers by talking with them, as they enjoy to share the experience with  like-minded people.  If you are in Europe and work with the CERT community, then we can also suggest that you may want  to follow a TRANSITS training to \"see how it is done\", and attend a TRANSITS Train-the-trainer course.  You may even want to become a TRANSITS25  trainer afterwards and make your experience available  to a wider audience!  22 About the “Four stages of competence” see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence  23 Most universities offer a professional development scheme for their employees, which will most likely  including a trainer’s training. Outside this, a good commercial trainer training is e.g.  http://shop.cipd.co.uk/shop/cipd-training/courses-qualifications/learning-talent/training-delivery/foundation- course-for-trainers ; another excellent training is http://www.nlpcoaching.com/nlp-trainers-training/ , however  this requires prior qualification as NLP Practitioner  24 Another take on how to become an excellent presenter is found in the recommended book: “Presenting  Magically: Transforming Your Stage Presence with NLP”, by Tad James and David Shephard (Crown House  Publishing, 2001)  25 For TRANSITS trainings see http://www.terena.org/activities/transits/  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence http://shop.cipd.co.uk/shop/cipd-training/courses-qualifications/learning-talent/training-delivery/foundation-course-for-trainers http://shop.cipd.co.uk/shop/cipd-training/courses-qualifications/learning-talent/training-delivery/foundation-course-for-trainers http://www.nlpcoaching.com/nlp-trainers-training/ http://www.terena.org/activities/transits/  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  12  5.3 Communication during the training  Body language, tone of voice and language (the words you speak) are vital to the success of your  training. Surprisingly enough for many, research indicates that the success of communication depends  for 55% on body language, 38% on tone of voice and only 7% on the actual words spoken26.  Body language includes how you stand, walk, sit, and wave your hands. An upright stance, chin up (not  talking to the floor but to your audience), back straight but relaxed conveys confidence in yourself. It  also opens up your lungs for the kind of good breathing that you need to carry your voice and to keep  doing that for maybe even hours. Face it: if you don't show confidence in your posture, then who's  going to believe you? Body position is an unconscious process that you need to bring into your  awareness at first to learn and use your body language.27  In the pictures you see an example of very  uninspiring language, and the opposite, a relaxed and good stance.  Tone of voice is almost as important to the success of your communication. Within the natural range  of your voice, experiment with variations in pitch (higher or lower), loudness and speed. Discover that  loudness and speed should also depend on the venue you are in, whether you use amplification  (microphone) and if you train people in their own language or not. If you are not experienced in  hearing how you \"sound\" in a room, then ask someone else to sit there and give feedback. Above all  a successful trainer sounds confident yet approachable and inviting. There is no clear cut recipe how  to achieve this. Preparing well certainly helps you feel confident and sound confident. Listen to other  speakers and trainers you will soon start noticing the differences.  Finally, words may only be 7% of the success of communication, but to convey meaning as a trainer  you cannot do without them. If you are the expert and give training in your own language, then the  words will usually flow. However, if your audience is multilingual, you need to take this into account.  Make sure they can follow you and make very sure that you do not go too fast. Imagine being among  26 See e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Mehrabian for these percentages, which of course vary per  research – but the trend remains the same. Credits go to the pioneering work of Ray Birdwhistell, see e.g.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Birdwhistell .  27 There are various beneficial techniques which help you make better and more healthy use of your body – and  improve your body language at the same time. A proven one is the Alexander technique, which can be adopted  in a few sessions with an Alexander trainer – see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_technique . It’s  not difficult when you want to learn and the results are usually excellent.  Figure 8: body language is important  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Mehrabian https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Birdwhistell https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_technique  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  13  them and listening to someone speaking a very strange accent – imagine how it makes you feel to  have to struggle to understand. Slow down your pace. Cut down on content if you must. It is better  that your audience understands most of your topics well, then get through everything and leave the  audience comprehending little.  Encourage your trainees to speak and ask questions. Literally encourage them, give them courage to  do so. Start with this right from the start. Ask them questions. When you do this from the start they  will start trusting both you and their own capacity to speak up. And you will have a much better  training going on.  If you are not speaking your mother tongue during a training, make sure your command of the  language is sufficient to make the training a success.  As quite a lot of international trainings are presented and conducted in English, it is often assumed  that native English speaking trainers have an advantage. But based on feedback from people from the  audience who are not native speakers, it follows that in some cases native speakers are quite hard to  follow, due to various reasons. The speed of talking is in some cases very high, what makes it hard for  non-native speakers to follow. Specific dialects (and e.g. the UK and USA have a lot of those) make it  hard to grasp the meaning of all the words and the sentences. So native speakers: slow down! Seek to  speak English as you hopefully had to during language classes in school. Avoid slang. Avoid figures of  speech. Also stay away from local references, the kind of topic or TV program or actor or musician that  everyone in your town or country may know – but the people in your training room have probably  never heard of. If it’s a great metaphor, by all means use it – but then you will need to explain. Also,  as native speaker you have plenty of time to process information as you speak calmly. Use this time  to be aware of the body language of your trainees. When you do that, you will know it when you are  not getting through.  Non-native speakers who do have good control over a language like English need to pay attention too.  Some of them use a rich and unusual vocabulary that may be quite hard to understand as they use  expressions that are uncommon or rarely used. One of the authors has read a lot of Shakespeare, and  sometimes uses ancient words or word orders that even some native speakers fail to process – nice  as this may sound, it’s of no use to your students. Keep your senses open and you will know when you  are talking “gibberish”.  The English language is used here as an example. The principles apply to all language and it takes a lot  of practicing to speak fluently and in a way that would be acceptable to most if not all audiences.  Four important hints to conclude here. The most important one is to \"be yourself\". You can play with  body language, tone of voice and words as much as you like (as long as it works for the audience), but  stay true to yourself. Don't try to emulate someone else, because unless you are a brilliant actor, it  won't work. People who are not themselves, run the risk of being perceived as \"fake\" by the audience.  That's a showstopper. Be yourself, and tell your own story. It’s ok to sometimes use other’s stories,  but you will convince more when you share from your own experiences.  Second, while being yourself, adapt to your audience enough to be effective. This is about the words  you chose to convey your message, and the body language and tone of voice to support that. If your  audience is highly educated, this will be different than when you address a class of ten year olds. If  your audience is accountants, or doctors, or military men, will make a difference for how and what  you communicate. Gauge, observe your audience to see if your approach works. Adapt if needed.  Thirdly, adopt a style that fits who you are. If you are not good with humour, then it’s no use trying to  crack jokes. Maybe you like to challenge – then challenge, with due respect for your trainees. Maybe  you like understatement – feel free to use it, but do look around to see if it works, which may be hard  with an international audience. Be flexible and adapt to circumstances.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  14  The fourth recommendation is to record your presentation with video and audio - and replay them  later. Most often you won't like it at first but it is worth to overcome this, and then you will learn a lot.  Do accept that to others you sound different than to yourself, that's always so. Another idea is to ask  a non-native speaker to watch you train and then give you personal feedback (in private).  5.4 Previous experience  A contributor to this document said that speaking on the radio had helped him a lot to develop his  skills as a trainer. In a radio broadcast, as in a podcast, you need to be entertaining and flexible:  qualities that are very useful for a trainer. Fear is a perfectly natural reaction when you are not used  to a big audience. By exposing yourself to it, you will get over the fears to be on stage. Experience tells  that stage anxiety becomes a non-issue in time. It takes about one year of going out and training  people for a trainer to become really fluent in front of an audience. If you want to speed this up,  expose yourself more – e.g. take a stand-up comedy training (which sounds a bit extreme, but is a  perfect training for spontaneous reaction)! After a year or less, what's then left of what once was stage  fear, becomes in fact an aid to keep you alert and perceptive as presenter, and thus becomes a friend  who helps you deliver the best quality.  5.5 Appearance while giving a training  This topic is not easy to approach as every person is unique. Nevertheless there are some general  recommendations for \"appearance\" when presenting or training on stage. The basic idea is simple do  not over dress and do not under dress. And stay with your own ideas of what is stylish, unless those  are too outrageous of course.  Do not under dress: as trainer you are the role model, everyone looks at you, so you want to look  properly groomed and wearing proper quality, decent clothes. You can adjust to local habits (make  sure that you know them), but avoid excess or things not suited to you: e.g. as someone from Europe,  you are not going to present in a traditional dress of India or Saudi Arabia. If dress codes do apply,  know what these mean: smart casual, business attire, etc. – check with your local host what they will  be wearing, as the definition of dress codes varies across the planet, and may even be different  between two similar companies in the same country.  Do not over dress: you want the trainees to be attentive to what you communicate, not stare at your  clothes or make-up. So if you like people to look at you, that's fine but when you train people, be  somewhat laid back and relaxed. What you definitely need to avoid is some special untested makeup  or tanning right before the training. Also protect yourself against the environment (climate, sun)  within reason. One of the authors has experienced first-hand how a running nose (from a neglected  cold) or blazing red skin from too much sun make it so much harder to maintain that professional  appearance expected of you as the trainer.  I once assumed my normal dress code for international meetings (a suit and tie), forgetting that the  audience would consist of network operators in t-shirts. Fortunately I spotted that 100+ people had  simultaneously folded their arms when I entered the stage. Describing my own account of a  professional challenge that they had all experienced themselves too, got most of them to relax and  listen. But it was a narrow escape… [Andrew Cormack, Chief Regulatory Adviser, Janet, UK]  This story illustrates that audiences have expectations of how a “leader” in their field looks like. If you  fit that image, then you have a good starting point. For instance, an audience of ethical hackers does  not have any issue with trainers with tattoos or piercings. If you train them in a business suit however,  you may be the best of experts, but you will need to work harder to convince your audience. Still, do  not dress beyond the limit of your own comfort. If you are a great hacker and you feel best wearing a  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  15  tie, wear a tie by all means. Maybe you want to crack a joke about your ties with the audience to break  the ice. Be perceptive and creative and you will solve such challenges while enjoying doing so.  5.6 Cultural differences  In some cases the audience is composed of people with different cultural backgrounds, beliefs and  experiences. That's a wonderful opportunity to share your experiences with a wide variety of people  from all over the world, and when you have a training with group exercises, also a very good vehicle  to increase the mutual understanding among your trainees. However as a trainer you do need to have  some basic idea of these differences in order to make all in the class feel welcome and respected. This  includes things like how to approach people, the distance to keep in a one-to-one chat, manners and  other relevant facts, like how to accept a business card that is being presented to you. If you have local  hosts in a culture you don't know, simply ask them beforehand if you are not sure about such local  habits. However as always stay true to yourself and your background: be respectful and welcoming,  yet keep your own style. It will not be appreciated if you \"copy\" their habits. When in doubt during a  training – simply ask respectfully.  When I was program chair for FIRST back in 1999 in Brisbane, a gentleman from Japan gave me his  business card. I was glad that I had heard about that event, because this was the first time I was party  in this protocol28. The card should have two sides, one in Japanese, and one in English. The card is  handed over held with two hands. When you receive it with two hands, in a similar manner, and  exchange courtesies, you will have done very well for a Westerner. Don’t worry about bowing – if you  have good rapport during the encounter, you will find it very hard to suppress a polite slight bow – I  know I automatically do it. Avoid overdoing this – this is part of a complex protocol, and you are not  expected to know this. I sure don’t, so I just follow my gut feeling and have had many courteous and  friendly exchanges and contacts with Japanese colleagues. [Don Stikvoort]  Figure 9: Business Card in two Languages (from one of the reviewers of this guide)  Gender differences (female/male) can pose a very similar challenge, depending on where you are.  Again, if you are for instance from Switzerland, do not assume that the way you can approach both  genders in your home country is the same as elsewhere. The difference can be very apparent in Islamic  countries – but not only there. In some cultures, women will not look a man directly into the eyes – if  you then keep trying to achieve eye contact this may be perceived as rudeness. Again, if you are in a  new environment – feel free to ask with respect. If necessary, one to one, and not in the classroom.  28 For more information see e.g. http://www.japanesebusinessresource.com  http://www.japanesebusinessresource.com/  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  16  5.7 What it takes to be a trainer  To be a trainer is like climbing a mountain. Inspiring but sometimes asking for more when you thought  you had nothing left. [Don Stikvoort]  Often your trainings simply go well, and there are no big surprises. Your trainees are doing well, and  you are happy as their trainer. But sometimes, “Murphy” strikes. You may be jetlagged or simply not  well. The air-conditioning is too hot or too cold. Your voice has taken a day off. There is a trainee from  hell who tries to sabotage your training. The projector, or the network breaks down. And the coffee is  awful. Every trainer will experience such things one day. That’s when the quote really applies. Your  trainees, especially on a paid training, expect you to be excellent. They are there to learn from you.  You set the example. So what do you do? You use your reserves and perform. It will take a lot of  energy, but you can do it.  The first and last thing to do as trainer is – stay on the positive side, stay on the cause side, where you  can cause solutions to happen. You can always ask for help and support. From the hotel or facility you  are training in. Even from your trainees as long as you clearly explain that there is a perfectly valid  reason for doing so.  As the trainer you set the example in all matters visible during the training. This also applies to arrival,  breaks and departure. So do not change style all of a sudden during a break. Of course you can have  relaxed, personal chats with trainees during the breaks. But remember that you are still the trainer,  both at a conscious and unconscious level. So you continue to set a good example. For instance, if you  expect your trainees to stick to the set break timing – and you should – then you need to stick to it  too. If all your trainees are back in time and you make them wait for five minutes, then they will be  late next time. Some trainers enjoy a little decorum for that reason – for instance they ask local staff  to prepare the room and only appear five minutes before starting time. They enjoy their break  separately. You can but don’t have to do this to be a good trainer. It is more important to decide your  own style and stay with it, at least during the training. Over time you will find what suits you and it  will become a natural style. Some trainers prefer to be close and involved – others like a bit more  distance. It’s up to you, but whatever your style, every good trainer is involved with and interested in  his trainees.  You may be reading all of this and thinking “but how do I ever get to be such a great trainer”? Well  that’s simple: like we all did! Practise, practise and practise! Don’t be afraid to get things wrong at  times. Learn from your mistakes. Apply a sense of humour – crack a joke about yourself at times  (without degrading yourself), it’s very refreshing and good for learning. Trainees don’t mind a mistake  at times, as long as you are open to correcting them. Know that you can always learn from your  students. Always accept and respect their feedback. Remember: perfection is the enemy of  excellence. The best trainers and performing artists, like in music or in acting, will tell you the same.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  17  6 Preparation for trainings  The 7 Ps:  Proper  Planning and  Preparation  Prevent  Pest  Poor  Performance  [Adapted from British Army training]  6.1 Planning  In many cases the training that you need to give already exists. All materials for preparation and  delivery are at your disposal. Suppose that is the case – then how long before the course do you need  to start preparing, and what do you need to prepare?  Let’s first look at simply familiarising yourself with the materials so that you feel confident you can  deliver an excellent training. How much time does this cost? We sent out two polls to experienced  trainers asking them two questions:  Basic level preparation:  Suppose you prepare for a training that is fairly basic in content and the exercises are not complex or  deeply technical. How many days of preparation do you think you will need per actual day of training?  Advanced level preparation:  Suppose you prepare for a training that is more complex in content or the exercises are complex or  need a more technical set-up. Imagine a classroom with PCs equipped with virtual machines. In that  case, assume that the VM is available to you as part of the materials, but as usual with VMs, you find  they all need some tweaks and updates to work properly. How many days of preparation do you think  you will now need per actual day of training?  More than 15 trainers replied to these two scenario questions. Based on their replies and the authors’  own experience, the basic level preparation takes around two to three days of preparation per training  day, with some responders planning up to ten days of preparation time. The advanced level of  preparation typically will take five to ten days of preparation, with some mentioning up to twenty  days.  This means that when you prepare for a basic two-day training, you need to reserve at least four days  to prepare. And if it’s advanced, at least ten days but maybe you will need twenty. Of course the length  of your preparation time will vary depending on your experience in the content and as a trainer. But  once you are an experienced trainer you will be able to make a good estimate of how much time you  need. The bottom line – start well in advance. To prepare well you need much more time than you  may think when you come new to the training business.  Is this all the planning you need to do? No, there is more. Right at the beginning of your preparations,  consider the following and write down your honest answers:  • Goal. What is the goal of the training? What do the trainees need to know and/or be able to  do after the training? How good should they be at knowing/doing that? Think about how you can  measure this after the training.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  18  • Target audience. Who is coming to your training, and how many? What is their background,  education or knowledge level, before they enter your classroom? If there is a wide variety in  knowledge level, how will that affect your training? Do you need to give extra help to people whose  knowledge level is relatively low – and if so, how are you going to pull that off? What language is the  training in, and what are the mother tongues of your trainees? Are there cultural and/or gender  differences that you need to take into account?  • Group size & training assistance. How many will attend your training? This does not only  influence the size of the training room, but also if you will need help on-site. Groups with up to ten  trainees, you can handle on your own, including logistics. If you can get logistics support, so much the  better, but consider this a luxury. For groups with more than ten people, aim at getting some form of  logistics support. For groups with up to twenty people you can take care of the training by yourself,  but beyond twenty trainees, you will need to consider getting training assistance. This can be in the  form of one or more assistants who take care of exercise or workshop elements, so that you can re- gain energy. You can also work with a co-trainer, performing the training together as a pair. It can be  very rewarding and inspiring to work with a co-trainer – one of the authors has done this himself  several times, witnessed it many times, and is enthusiastic about it. However, working with a co- trainer requires good preparation together, getting to know one another, and especially finding ways  to react to one another and take cues from each other naturally. All of these will facilitate a  spontaneous flow of ideas during the training. And important as preparation is, it is not enough: this  kind of collaboration really needs to be discovered while doing it. Training on the job, while you are  training others.  • Success/fail factors. Make a shortlist of factors that can make or break the success of your  training. You will find many of these in annex A. These factors can be anything from a failing air- conditioning in desert heat (this happened to one of the authors), or a broken projector, via a strike  in public transport, to you being ill, or one of the trainees sabotaging your training knowingly or  unconsciously. For each of the factors, think about the likelihood of that occurring, and your remedy  for when it would happen. For very unlikely factors on which you have little or no influence, you may  write down “Force Majore” and further ignore them29.  6.2 Planning and announcing  Marketing is a profession of its own and you can find many books and online information on the topic.  The authors are not marketing experts, though one has experience in doing actual marketing for more  than 15 years. We will just mention a few things that we consider essential for the marketing of  trainings:  • Planning. Plan well ahead of time. If your training is well known and respected, and you have  good communication channels for PR, even then you need to start advertising your course three to  four months in advance. If you can make a training calendar much earlier than that, so much the  better.  In case your training still needs to gain recognition then you need to start much earlier, up to a year  in advance. Because you will need to approach your target group, find the right channels to do so, sell  your course. If your training is a longer one, you may want to offer short workshops as appetizers for  your full trainings. If you offer a training path that way, take into account that one out of five is a very  decent turnover rate – that means that out of every five people that do your introductory workshop,  29 If you give the training in a country where legal liability is an important issue, you may want to exclude liability  for such “Force Majore”, by obliging trainees to sign a set of terms for your course either when subscribing to it,  or just before the course begins, in the classroom.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  19  one will do the full training. And out of every five that do the full training, one will subscribe to the  advance training. Always set goals for your marketing success and measure success.  • Goal, content and target audience. Make a clear description of what trainees will achieve by  taking this training. Will they receive a certificate, or be accredited or certified? Write down a  summary of the content – this can be as simple as a bulleted list. Describe what audience you want to  reach and also what level of knowledge or education they need to have in order to make a success of  your course. Communicate all of this clearly. Fuzziness does not make good PR. Do not hype your  training: trainees who get what they expected plus some more, and feel good about trainer and  training, are the best PR.  • Media. What media will be used to market your training? Traditional media are flyers and  catalogues, printed yellow pages, banners or billboards, newspapers, radio, TV and word-of-mouth30  of course. Articles in local, regional or national newspapers are usually good PR. TV is great, but to get  coverage you often need a really good story and some insider helping you. Flyers are good hand-outs  at gatherings like conferences, workshops and exhibitions.  The list of new media keeps growing. A web presence is the bare minimum these days – and if this is  an important marketing medium for you then strategies to get your site high in search engine results.  Media like LinkedIn and Facebook offer extra online presence. A more active approach can include a  blog or Twitter messages. Whatever you choose, make sure the information is correct and up to date.  If you do blog or tweet, do it regularly. Don’t waste your time on a blog updated once a year; no one  except your partner will read it.  6.3 Training material  Make sure that your materials are elaborate enough for students to be able to reproduce your story  when you are not around to help anymore. [Hans de Vries, CEO of a Dutch training company]  This quote may well contain the most important advice in regard your training materials: your training  is not a “one-man-show”, but is meant to bring lasting education to your trainees. Whatever your  training materials exist of, make sure to address the following issues:  • Effective structure. Choose a structure that enables as many trainees as possible to meet the  training goals. We specifically recommend to adopt the 4MAT system as explained in chapter two –  the 4MAT is just as powerful for a one hour presentation as it is for a ten-day course. This would apply  to your session planning and accompanying slide set especially. Remember: the 4MAT system  addresses the needs of all four different types of learners, and does so in the most effective order. All  it requires is that you chunk up your training topics in logical chunks or topics, and that for each one  of those topics you order your training as follows:  1. WHY. Make the trainees curious “why” they should want to pay attention to this part of the  training. Ask questions like “who wants to learn …” in such a way that they want to reply “yes, I do!”  The WHY takes 5-10% of your topic’s time.  2. WHAT. This is the content, the theory, the body of learning for this topic. Old style school and  university lectures did almost only the WHAT. Fills 20-70% of your time: some topics need more WHAT  and less HOW, with others it is the other way around.  30 For those in the CERT community – contact your local or national CERT and see if they want to work together  with you to spread the word. If this is in the interest of their constituency you may find them interested to do  so.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  20  3. HOW. This explains how you actually apply the theory. If there is a process with steps, it’s in  the HOW. A demo and exercise are also in the HOW. Again, this fills 20-70% of your topic’s time.  4. WHAT IF. Variations on the theme. Time for questions. The WHAT IF people learn by  wondering how to apply the learnings in different ways, under various circumstances. Plan for 5-10%  of available time.  Remember: for big topics with several sub-topics you can go for one WHY for the whole topic, followed  by a series of WHAT-HOW sequences sufficient to cover all sub-topics, concluded by one WHAT IF. In  such a case the WHY and WHAT IF may be shorter than 5% overall.  • Ability to understand. Keep your language straightforward and avoid complexity. Avoid long  sentences, many commas, and stay away from double negatives such as “do not forget to not …” as  these really confuse people. As a rule of thumb, even stay away from negatives when you can as the  unconscious does not process them. So instead of writing or saying, “don’t mess with the air  conditioning”, opt for “make sure the air conditioning is set well31”. Whether you are a native speaker  or not, have someone else review your materials for language and understandability. Together with  the reviewer also make sure the materials are as much as possible free of errors in spelling, language  and of course also content – too many errors will make your materials look really unprofessional, and  you will need to be a really brilliant trainer in person to compensate for that impression.  • Easy Reference. Make sure your trainees can easily find what they are looking for, 6 months  later. A good table of contents is a must. If your materials are extensive and you plan to re-use them  many times, consider making an index - this is worth more than the effort spent. If you have a set of  references, you will help your trainees a lot if you add a commented bibliography: that way they get  the quality assessment of the expert (you) for free.  • Readability. Both for projected slides as well as for printed hand-outs, make sure that  readability is prime. This means: big enough fonts and no distractions, and make sure that text and  background contrast in both colour and light/darkness. For a text slide this means that four or five  bullet points is much to be preferred over 7 or more – less is more where it comes to slides. For printed  materials, use black on white printing and choose a clear font. Font size: dependent on the font, but  usually at least size 12 – one of the authors uses only 14 with a font such as Calibri. Avoid distractions  – no backgrounds that make the texts hard(er) to read, and keep logos to a minimum. The pictures  below give examples of a bad, unreadable slide (a webpage with small font on this picture), and of the  opposite.  31 In the NLP model, “now, we wouldn’t want you to mess with the air conditioning” actually contains the  embedded command “mess with the air conditioning”. Thus, negative suggestions can actually reach the  opposite of what they literally contain. This works much better in speech than writing. Unless you are well versed  in such matters, we simply recommend you to steer away from the use of negatives.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  21  • Portability and security. Printed materials are still used a lot, but they are a lot of work to  produce, and “cost trees” as the saying goes, and so more and more trainings cut down on the amount  of paper. If your students fly in, they will also be thankful when you don’t provide them with several  kilograms of bulky binders. E-materials are increasingly popular. CDs are going out of fashion, USB  sticks are the most commonly used now. Whatever e-format you use, choose one that works on most  computers. PDF is most commonly used – avoid sharing PowerPoint or Word files. If you supply audio  or video materials, whether before or during the training – then it is wise to stick to mp3 for audio and  mp4 for video. No one will have trouble getting those to work on most systems, including smart  phones and portable media players. One word of care – make very sure you are not spreading malware  (computer viruses, worms etc.) with the USB sticks you hand out. And once handed out, do not plug  them into your own computer anymore, as the laptop of your trainee may have infected the USB stick  at first contact. 32  • Life cycle. When you finish any training document, or video, demo, or whatever part of your  training materials – make sure to set the expiry date at the same time. You don’t need to make that  explicit towards the trainees, what counts is that you know and that you have a system to follow up  on this. What does that mean? Well, say that you set a three year expiry time. Then after maybe two  and a half years, you make a renewal plan: who is going to do what, and when, to make sure that the  material will be updated, or completely renewed. So you plan a life cycle for all your materials.  Bearing the above in mind, we recommend you prepare the following materials for a traditional  classroom type training:  • Learning objectives. First things first: write down what you want your students to learn,  experience and achieve in the training. Learning objectives should be SMART – specific, measurable,  attainable, realistic and timely33. When you explain about Internet hacking techniques for instance,  32 You could opt for media that you can set read-only. This is rare for USB sticks. Flashcards as used in photo  cameras have a little switch for that. You could use such flashcards, switch them to read-only and tell your  students that if they switch it back to read-write they do so at their own peril. However, most devices cannot  read flash cards so you will need to provide your students with a little flash card reader with USB interface. These  can be found for under € 10.  33 See e.g. http://topachievement.com/smart.html  Figure 10: slides must be easy to read and digest  http://topachievement.com/smart.html  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  22  then “the students will learn about all hacking techniques” is clearly not a SMART goal. Whereas “after  the training the trainees are able to explain at least two ways in which DDoS34 attacks are done” is  much better. “Measurable” means you need to be able to ask your student a question afterwards –  and the answer should prove that the objective has been met (or not, in which case you need to  wonder what to do).  • Session plan. This is your timetable as trainer. It tells you what to do what and when, and how  long it will take. If you are an inexperienced trainer, make a detailed session plan and then see how it  works out during the training – adapt it if needed for next time. This will really help you become a  better trainer. Experienced trainers will make a more concise session plan, and be more liberal in  playing with the timings “going with the flow” of the training and the specific needs of that group of  trainees. However, for longer trainings (especially those over multiple days) all trainers, no matter  how experienced, need a good session plan. Also, for longer trainings, you should segment your  session plan and add learning objectives per segment. It’s a really good idea to check on the  achievement of these learning objectives at the end of each segment.  • Slide set. This is what you use as visible guide for both yourself and the trainees. Add images  to your slides where apt – these can be charts, illustrations of the content, or simply funny. Avoid  explaining funny images – they should speak for themselves. Keep slide animations down to a  minimum – these were fashionable once, but in fact can disturb your flow as a trainer and distract  your audience. An animation here and there can be both functional and part of the fun factor, which  helps to make the training digestible. A functional animation can for instance be if you are presenting  important topics via bullet items, and you want to have them appear one by one. But do not apply  that to each and every text slide.  • Tutor notes. These are there to help the trainer with explanations about e.g. the slides, and  with background information. Tutor notes can be added to the slide set, and be visible for the trainer  but not the trainees – however in that case the available space for information is usually very limited.  Plus, presentation laptops are sometimes quite small, and older trainers may need a microscope to  actually read the small font of the tutor notes on screen. Separate tutor notes are therefore  recommended. You can print them in font 14 or 16 for easy reading, so that you can even easily browse  them during training, without the students even noticing.  • Student notes and/or accompanying texts. A bunch of slides is not the same as full training  materials. As mentioned in the quote above, make sure that you provide the students with enough  materials so they can find the essence also when you are not there to help them anymore. You can do  this by adding notes that accompany the slides – supplemented with additional texts, readings,  articles, whatever is relevant and helpful. If a book is available, you may recommend this or even  include it as part of the training cost. It’s very nice to send the students home with not just a set of  materials but also a relevant book.  • Exercise hand-outs. When you do exercises make sure to have extremely clear instructions  and very explicit and clear hand-outs to go with it. If you run a new exercise for the first time, no  matter how well you think you have prepared it, half of your students will do something completely  different from what you ever planned they would do. Monitor the exercises closely, and improve the  hand-outs so that the surprise factor goes down. If less than 10% of your students “re-interpret” your  exercise, you have done very well.  For other types of trainings, e.g. hands-on computer trainings, various types of other materials will be  needed. We won’t go into these, as the variety is too wide to cover here. Just remember that whatever  34 DDoS: Distributed Denial of Service – a specific hacking technique  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  23  you do, you need to have it covered in your session plan. The various remarks about effective  structure, readability, understandability etc. always need to be taken into account.  6.4 Logistics Checklist  Training logistics is everything outside the training process itself that needs to be done before, during  and after the training to make the training a success. Logistics include all the boundary conditions for  a great training, from the availability of a well-equipped training room, coffee breaks and sandwiches,  to climate control, mailing lists and materials, all the way to the red carpet for the trainees to walk  over as they enter the training room35.  Many of these things have been and will be discussed in this  guide – but for your convenience we provide you with Annex A, a logistics checklist. The idea is that  you can use that checklist to prepare and execute trainings, marking each item once completed. This  checklist will be provided separately as an annex in pdf and word format, for your convenience: the  word file you can tailor to your own needs.  6.5 Preparation on-site (before the first day of training)  If you are doing a training for the first time in a certain site, go and check it out several days or even  weeks before. Make an appointment with the local contact responsible for supporting your training  and have them guide you around. Your appointment needs to be at a time where your intended  training room is free. Make sure to cover all the items listed below under “class set-up” – this way you  make sure everything is well prepared and you save time on the training day. Check whether your  guide is available on the days of training, and who are their back-ups and how you can quickly reach  them during training. Important: expect “things” (what, you never know) to change between this visit  and the actual first day of training. Be prepared for that.  6.6 Communication before training  In the many training evaluations that the authors have received and made, trainees often appreciate  the training, but critique communications in advance of the training. Pre-training communications is  often underestimated. Let’s look at some aspects to take into account:  • Communication plan. Have a communication plan. That plan will tell you what to tell, when  and to whom. Allow people enough time to digest what you send them, especially when it will take  some effort on their side. Tell them about your timeline – what information or tasks they can expect  and when. Stick to your timeline and plan. Doing what you write and say you will do is an easy way to  gain credibility with your trainees.  • Expectation management. Be very clear towards your trainees as to what you expect of them.  What are the pre-requisites for the training? How should they prepare? What should they bring with  them to the training? Is there a dress code? What can they expect in regard to food and beverages?  Should they bring a laptop – and if that is needed, does it need to carry a specific operating system?  Do they need to pre-install some software? Should they have root/administrator rights? Or,  alternatively, do you actively discourage the use of computer equipment during the training? Do you  have a policy about taking pictures, recording audio or video, tweeting or otherwise publically sharing  events during the training?  • Tasking. You can assign tasks in advance to encourage the trainees to already consider some  of the training elements. This is valuable, but bear in mind that trainees often have little spare time  left during or after their daily jobs. This lack of spare time is sometimes a reason to go to a formal  35 The red carpet is optional.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  24  training. Make sure that tasking is very clear in content and limited in the effort required of the future  trainees. It is better they spend one hour intensely on one or two topics or questions, than spending  two hours to cover ten topics superficially.  • Training schedule and travel tips. Make sure to send a clear training schedule and travel tips  one to two weeks before the training starts36. If you do it much earlier, your trainees may not pay  much attention to this information and forget about it. If you do it later, they will tell you that the  information was sent too late. The travel tips include how to get to the location by the most obvious  forms of transport (car, taxi, train, plane) and one or more relevant maps – include those maps and  do not only link to some mapping website: your trainees will be grateful that you save them time. The  distance that trainees are traveling to your course may alter the timing of travel-related  communications; those booking air tickets may need travel details further in advance of the course.  6.7 Class set-up  Arrive well in advance. At least half an hour before the training starts, for a bigger training one-two  hours on the first day. Do NOT expect that on the day of training everything will be as you saw it during  your preparation visit – especially hotels are good in changing everything when a client with more  money comes round. One of the authors once did not even get the training room that was shown to  him during preparations and that he paid for – the hotel had decided otherwise, and the new room  was not as good. Some refund was given later, but that didn’t help his students that day. Had the  author not arrived well in time so that he could adapt his planned set-up quickly, the students would  have noticed some annoyance and chaos – which is bad for building trust with your students and bad  PR.  Make sure to cover the following items:  • Local staff. Meet with the local logistics people. Who is responsible overall? Who is  responsible for the audio-visual facilities? What about coffee and lunch breaks, and where are they  held? Where are the fire-exits? Where the toilets? Any other things you need to know? Talk all of this  through.  • Room lay-out (U-shape or otherwise). Check this with local staff and make them do changes  to get it as you want it (and as you should have specified in advance). In general we recommend u- shape as it is a more personal setup than e.g. classroom style – all trainees are around the same table,  and you can get close to all of them. The u-shape is really like a version of the “round table” adapted  to a training situation. A good alternative is a set of small round tables, allowing four to six people  around them. This is especially useful if you switch a lot from plenary to group work.  • AV equipment and network. Check with local staff if the projector works, and any other AV  that you may need, like fixed or clip-on microphones. If you use microphones, you may want one or  two portable ones for questions too. Have all this ready and tested. Also check the network  connection, and if it is essential, have some back-up plan, like a 3G mobile hot spot or tethering using  your mobile phone.  • Environment. Is the room temperature okay, and is the air not too dry? How do you operate  the air-conditioning? Are there any windows that can open? What about the lighting, where are the  controls, and what is the best setting for your plenary sessions? Do you need other settings for group  work? (Temperature differences can often happen.)  36 If international/long travel is involved you clearly need to inform people much more ahead of time, or you can  give them a heads-up say 3 months in advance, so they can at least book their flight or long distance train.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  25  • Stage. Set up your stage. Place any posters or banners where you want them. Make sure there  is a clock somewhere that you can easily see during  training. If you use stage positions, practice where they  are so you won’t have to think about it during training.  You can use the stage in many ways37, but here we will  keep it simple and give you two positions to consider.  One is your neutral teaching position, as in the picture to  the right. The neutral position is one you need to be able  to maintain for a longer period of time. In the example of  the picture, the trainer has set himself up for a longer  training, as he has chosen to sit on a high chair instead of  standing – and he has arranged his materials to be in  front of him. Notice that the posture is relaxed yet  communicative.  The second position we suggest you think about is the  close to audience position, as in the picture to the left.  Remember that whenever you come close to your  audience, this is a powerful position, as you come  closer into their comfort zones. You can use that power  in a positive way by not staring your students down  with your eyes, but instead staying in trainer state and  peripheral vision. In the picture, the trainer was using  this position for doing a confession – some personal  experience which would not be in the slides or training  materials. The same position can also be used to tell a  story. When the close to audience position is used in  these ways, it becomes a way to connect more  personally with the trainees, which is inspirational  when done respectfully and as exception rather than as  rule.  The main thing to remember about stage positions is that when you decide to set them up and use  them, you need to use them in a consistent way, using the same locations and similar body language.  The reason for this is that a stage position is what is called an anchor, which triggers a reaction in your  trainees. The more you use the anchor, the more defined that reaction will be – there will be  recognition at an unconscious level: “ah now he is going to tell us some personal story!” for instance.  For an anchor to work well it needs to be precisely located and executed. Hence the specific location  and body language – and even specific tone of voice, like you would tell a personal story in a slightly  different tone of voice from your normal teaching voice. How – that is up to you.  37To talk about stage positions could easily take a day! See e.g.  http://www.speakingaboutpresenting.com/delivery/9-ways-space-presentation/ to get some ideas of what  you can do.  Figure 11: Teaching position  Figure 12: Teaching position  http://www.speakingaboutpresenting.com/delivery/9-ways-space-presentation/  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  26  • Materials. Any materials for the students, have them readily available – on their places, or in  a central area, e.g. next to the entrance. It is very convenient to have nametags and name boards for  your trainees. Nametags are useful during breaks and group exercises. The boards with their names  on them you ask them to place in front of them – that way you can see their name right away, which  helps you get acquainted with your group more easily, and avoids uncomfortable situations like “you  there, tell me …”.  • Finish your preparations before you allow the first students in. If students are early and you  are still busy, ask the reception to have them wait in a suitable waiting area, like the coffee area – not  inside the room. It’s not professional to let the trainees watch you prepare, and besides, some of them  will start a talk with you and you will be either very distracted or impolite as you brush them off. If you  have a co-trainer, then one can prepare the room while the other meets with the students already,  outside.  7 Execution of trainings  Better a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without. [Confucius]  As a trainer, strive for excellence – not for perfection. Perfect is the enemy of inspired. Be an inspired  trainer rather than one who is continuously looking to correct minor flaws. Trainees will remember  you for how you motivated them – not for where you put the commas in your sentences. As trainer  you are like a performing artist. The famous classical pianist Alfred Brendel once said that in his best  performances he made the most errors.  7.1 Training style  Find your own style in giving trainings – and then get comfortable with it. Make sure it works for your  trainings of course. Being respectful towards your trainees is always an essential element in any  training style – but also to be in charge in a non-arrogant, inviting way. Use your sense of humour, but  as we said before – be yourself. Avoid extremes – trainings are not supposed to be stage dramas.  Once you know your basic training style and are comfortable with it, stick with it. Predictability  towards your trainees is good, in general. Especially in more intense trainings, your students will be  outside their comfort zone, and they need some elements of stability. As you are the one guiding their  learning, it is excellent that you are that anchor as trainer.  However don’t be boringly predictable. The word boring says it all – that’s what you want to avoid in  your trainings. The one you all know to avoid for instance, is to read from the slides38. Surprises and  unexpected events coming from your side are quite welcome, if used sparingly and with purpose. You  can prepare some of such surprise moments – but always allow room for spontaneous ideas too.  Spontaneity is usually inspired by your students, by what they say or who they are – by the interaction  with the group. Allow that to happen, enjoy the element of surprise which that is also for you.  Your training style extends to all your behaviours in and around the training, visible or audible to the  trainees. So that includes the breaks. Maintain your style in the breaks. If you really need a personal  break, make sure to not be with the students, have a walk outside for instance, or use a trainer room  to retreat if available. If you work with a co-trainer, that makes everything easier as you can share the  workload. For most trainings it is beneficial when at least one of the trainers is around during breaks.  Some students will only ask you questions at such quiet moments.  38 Also know that every rule has an exception! If you have a complicated statement to explain, then it’s perfectly  fine to have it on a slide and read it out, even twice if needed, while adding explanations. Remember that this is  the exception to the rule.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  27  7.2 Timing  Start on time, stay on time, and end on time. If you adhere to that, you will be fine. Let’s examine  these briefly. First though, remember from the preparations – be aware of time, have a clock visible  for you.  Start on time. Usually that is up to you. Make sure that at the starting time, you are really ready to  start, e.g. the first slide is up already. Fighting with the projector at that moment and blaming  technology gets you off on the wrong foot. Instead of right away leading your trainees towards  meeting their expectations, for which they may have prepared a long time or travelled for hours, you  are distracting them with something which really can only be explained as a lack of preparation and  disrespect towards the trainees.  Sometimes your class is not full yet at starting time. This mostly depends on the culture/region you  are giving the training in – if you suspect that may be the case, then find out by asking. Sometimes it  can be due to external factors, like problems with the train system. Adapt as needed, but keep your  students informed and stick to what you say. If you say “as several students are still missing we will  wait for another five minutes” – then do start after those five minutes. In that first hour of any training,  you set the rules for the whole training. No matter what culture or region it is, and no matter how  busy the roads or trains may be – you set the rules of engagement. If needed, make this very explicit.  One of the authors sometimes gives trainings of six to twelwe days total. He then spends the first half  hour on setting the frames and expectations for all those days – and demands implicitly the  acceptance of the trainees, like in “as you sit here, you accept these rules, which are here to make you  all learn as effectively as possible, in an way that is agreeable for all of us”. Make sure that the trainees  stick to the rules you set, also after breaks and the following days – and make sure you stick to your  own rules as well.  When your training is part of a day program, insist that you can start on time. And if not, that  provisions are made so that you don’t have to rush because of others having been too late. If there is  no choice but to accept the shorter time available, consider leaving out part of your program, instead  of rushing it all. If you do, explain to your trainees what you leave out and why – and how they can  make up for this. Maybe you can give them the missing materials as hand-outs, and allow them to ask  questions by e-mail. Make the best of any given situation. If you genuinely feel that you cannot do  your work right – refuse to do it. This requires some strength of character and experience, but we  assure you – once you have done it once, you will know how to do it for the future but may find that  you won’t need it anymore39.  Stay on time. If you don’t, you will not get your materials done, or your end time may slip. Neither will  make you very popular with your students and it’s unprofessional. Adhere to the break times – its fine  to start five minutes later with a break, but do not shorten the break. Breaks are not there to give you  more time for teaching, they are there for the students and you to relax for a moment. When doing  exercises, stay on time too. It’s very easy to take longer for exercises. While this will usually happen a  few times when you give a training for the first time, be very aware of this, as it’s definitely a risk factor  towards your overall timing. Correct the timings for the future and stick to those.  Visible and audible cues, often called anchors, can help, especially during breaks and exercises. Some  trainers set up a timer during breaks which counts down to zero, indicating the end of the break. This  is very suggestive and cannot be mistaken. Other trainers use audible anchors. A straightforward one  39 You may not need it anymore as you will have learnt an unconscious behaviour that will make clear to future  hosts that you are really serious about wanting to do a good job and demanding that they give you the time  required for that.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  28  is for example in the concert hall or in a school, a buzz five minutes before the end of the break, and  one more when “class begins”. More imaginative is the use of music in the break, and a specific piece  of upbeat music which you always use in the last minutes of the break – this will become an auditory  anchor especially during longer trainings. When your students hear it they know even without thinking  that “break is over”. In exercises, the use of visual and audible anchors is recommended too, but keep  them simple. A visible timer and some articulate, preferably fun sound to mark different stages of the  exercise will do.  End on time. If you have done all of the above well, it will be easy to stick to the agreed end times.  Your students will be grateful, after a long day of learning. If you are done with your program, and still  have some time left, then be creative. Sometimes you may have an extra discussion, if events on the  day give cause for that. Other times you can just end the training early, and your students will often  even be more grateful, especially if that happens once or twice during a training that lasts for five days  or more. Do make clear to them that they deserved the free time for having been such excellent  students that day. Avoid going over the time limit. Inform the students when you do that and explain  why. Keep it as brief as possible. Inquire if anyone needs to catch a train or plane, and encourage those  to leave when they must, also make sure they have everything they need before they leave. If you can  compensate this the next day by ending early, then feel free to do so.  7.3 Speaking & visuals  7.3.1 Speaking  You don’t want to speak all day and your students certainly don’t want you to. We have explained in  previous chapters about the need for diversity as to cater for the different learning styles of students  and to ensure that they don’t fall asleep or lose focus. Be happy for that as most voices don’t last a  whole day. As an upper limit, you should not speak for longer than 30 minutes in one period and up  to seven of these speaking periods maximum per day. The rest of the time you should be using other  training methods. Group discussion is not speaking, exercises are not speaking, and breaks are not  speaking – though of course you will say things during those as well.  Use a microphone, especially if you have to speak a lot during the day. The ones that you attach over  the ears and that extend towards your mouth are generally the most flexible and rewarding ones. A  microphone that is fixed in place is only useful for shorter presentations, not for anything beyond one  hour, as it limits you too much and will make your training static.  One of the authors took singing lessons at the advice of an experienced speaker who started out his  career as opera singer. He had told the author that the lower and middle registers of his voice were  very good already, but that he would benefit from developing his upper register, plus learning some  general techniques for how to use your voice. This turned out to be excellent advice. The author is  now much more confident in using his voice in all tonalities – nor does he easily get tired anymore, as  he learnt to use his voice in a better way.  7.3.2 Visuals  Just as your voice needs to be heard clearly, the visuals that you provide need to be seen and  understood easily. Whether you write or draw on a flip-chart, whiteboard, and blackboard or use any  other visual aids, write or draw large enough to be seen from the back of the room. Just as in slides,  keep the number of words and details to a minimum. Use colours like black, dark blue or red as those  are easiest to see. If you use more colours in one sketch or text, then make sure you use those colours  in a consistent and meaningful way.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  29  7.4 Trainer state  Assume trainer state and maintain it throughout – only in trainer state you can achieve an excellence  and effectiveness as trainer that is completely outside the reach of trainers who just focus on their  slides, fingernails, whiteboard or the faces of one or two students. The third main elements of trainer  state can be most easily achieved in the following order, starting inside yourself and gradually going  out to your students:  7.4.1 Physical/emotional state of excellence  Practice this at home before a mirror. Achieve this state as follows  a. Stand up straight and relaxed as you place your body cylinders on top of one another. How to  do that? Imagine that your body consists of ten cylinders: two for each leg and arm, one for your main  body and one for your head. The arms can just hang relaxed down. Have the feet a little bit apart for  stability40. Stand in such a way that you place your six standing cylinders on top of one another without  any one of them wanting to break the order and tumble down. Have you ever made buildings out of  little wood cylinders as a kid? Just like that, gravity will tell you when the building of your body is stable  and relaxed.  b. Breathe relaxed – breathe in through your nose, using not only your chest but also your belly  area, and out of your mouth by talking41. If you give longer trainings this is very important. Good  breathing is a basis for feeling good and confident. This is not so easy to explain in a few words. If you  are not a natural at this, you may for instance take some yoga lessons – in yoga, breathing is very  important42.  c. Be relaxed yet attentive. You are opening up to the room and people around you.  d. Be confident. You know the training. You are well prepared. You have what it takes.  e. Be at cause. This is means that you are the cause of what happens around you 43. This is  essential for a trainer, because if you don’t cause your training to be a success and your students to  learn, then who will? You know that you can inspire and train your students. That’s what you prepared  for and what you are here for, in this training room. Also, have great trust in your students. Your  students can learn and actualise what you train them in. They may need some help from you and  that’s what you are there for44.  7.4.2 Peripheral vision  Central vision is when you focus your vision on something in particular, like a nice flower you are  looking at. The angle of view is very limited in that case. Peripheral vision is when you do not focus on  40 Always make sure it fits your personal style.  41 Some people don’t have enough air intake via the nose and need to use the mouth. When you have a cold this  may apply as well. Extending the stomach when breathing in, actually enables you to use your full lung capacity,  including the lower parts of the lungs.  42 See e.g. http://yogaforbeginners.com/breathing01.htm but better - follow some good yoga training and tell  the trainer what you want to focus on, like breathing and relaxation.  43 The opposite is to be at effect: this is the state where people feel they don’t influence what happens around  them or in their life. They are victims to circumstances, genetics, upbringing, education, the demands of their  job or marriage, in short: others are to “blame” for where they are in life and what they do.  44 A general principle of coaching and therapy – also forms of training – is that if you believe your client cannot  do something, then they probably cannot as part of the work you do with them. The more you unlimit yourself  in your beliefs as to what clients or students can achieve, the better you will be at helping them actualize  whatever it is they need to learn.  http://yogaforbeginners.com/breathing01.htm  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  30  anything in particular, but rather see everything that is happening in the room in front of you, without  this being any effort or trouble. Like in this picture:  Trainer state always involves peripheral vision, as this vision allows you to “be with your students”.  You will notice how they move, use their hands, even how they sigh or take a breath to (maybe) ask a  question45. Knowing all this does not distract you at all, it is in fact very simple to be giving a great  training while at the same time being aware of what is happening in the room. Experienced trainers  go into peripheral vision the very moment they start a training or presentation. If you are new to this,  30 this is an easy way to set up your peripheral vision:  1. Attach a coloured (or black) “dot” of about three cm in diameter to the wall at the end of the  training room, opposite of you, elevated at the height of a person. (If there is a similar focus point  already there, use that.)  2. A few minutes before starting the training, focus on that point, so that you only see that point.  You can do this sitting down, as not to attract the attention of your students just as yet.  3. Maintain that focus for just a few seconds, then allow your vision to wander out to both the  left and right, while loosely still looking at that point. Allow your vision to wander out all the way to  90 degrees left and 90 right, covering a full half circle. You can even go beyond a half circle, but in  most training rooms that will be all you need.  4. Get used to that peripheral vision for half a minute and notice how you can see everything  that happens in the room, even the smallest movements, while you are still loosely looking at that  point you attached at the end of the room.  5. Now you can look relaxed all through the room and see how the peripheral vision stays with  you46. You are now in peripheral vision. Maintain that vision, even when trainees ask you questions.  45 It is fair to say that in peripheral vision not just your visual sense is more aware, but at least also your auditory  sense. It’s a form of light trance that comes with heightened awareness of the senses.  46 As you learn peripheral vision you will notice that some students are easier to look at than others. We tend to  like most to look at responsive students, those that physically and positively respond to what we are doing. But  this is a trap as focusing too much on such students can lead you back into central vision, and you lose touch  Figure 13: peripheral versus central vision  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  31  Whenever you need, repeat this exercise (e.g. after a break) – soon you will find you won’t need it  anymore, though some trainers like to always have a “focus point” at the opposite wall, as a reminder  and confidence booster. This is completely up to you.  7.4.3 Be out there with your students  Having done all the above, your physical and emotional states are good and relaxed now, you are  confident and at cause, and peripheral vision allows you to notice all that is going on. Now as you train  your students, be out there with them, enjoy training them, have fun. When you are out there with  them, you will often notice that you go too fast or said something you need to repeat, without anyone  asking anything. You will just notice some stirring or uneasy movements. When there are questions,  you will usually know that there are before they are raised – this is very useful as it can allow you to  encourage shy students. One of the authors sometimes notices a yet unspoken question and then if  it’s a shy student, stops and encourages the person in question with “you may have a question, please  feel free to ask?” Yes, this is an advanced technique, but practicing and using trainer state will get you  there.  7.4.4 Stay in contact  Stay in contact with your students; do not ignore them. This may sound logical, but consider the  following – and see the photos:  • do not turn your back on your audience when you are writing on a flip-chart or whiteboard,  reading an important line from the screen, or using your laser pointer  • when you are sketching or writing something in response to a question, finish the sketch or  writing before continuing to talk again  with the rest of the group. So do not focus on any students, but just let your gaze wander through the room  whenever you feel like doing so, not favouring any specific student.  Figure 14: Stay in contact with your audience  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  32  7.5 Rapport & leadership  Rapport47  is a pleasant state of being between people where it becomes easy to unconsciously accept  the other’s communication. Rapport happens at the unconscious level and is completely natural as we  are social beings. Rapport between lovers is the most obvious and e.g. manifests itself by walking in  the exact same pace. Rapport with friends and good colleagues is easy too, and you can see it in a  group because most people have the same stance (arms crossed for instance, or fist under chin) at a  given moment, and have also adapted their use of voice to a generally agreeable level.  The background of why rapport works and why it is so important goes back to the fact that various  research indicates that the effectiveness of our communication is based for only some 10% on the  words we use – the rest is based on body language and voice48. This explains why your body language  (remember the trainer state) and use of voice are so very important towards the success of your  training.  As the trainer you want to be in rapport with your students, so that they feel relaxed and  unconsciously accept your authority as the trainer, as the one whose words are taken seriously on the  topic you are discussing. And likewise you will be relaxed when you are in rapport with your trainees.  It goes both ways.  How do you achieve rapport? First of all, we are all born with this talent, we can all do it and do it all  the time. Some are better at it than others though. In a room with students it’s different than one on  one49. The best you can do is to be in trainer state. When you do that right and including an unspoken  respect for your students, we guarantee you that you will stimulate rapport quickly50. You will notice  it as the initial tension that is usually in the air with a new group of students will ease off. You will see  random groups of students being in obvious rapport with one another (e.g. one group sitting with  arms crossed, another group with legs stretched out) and with you. When you are in trainer state you  will always be included in this spreading rapport, you are even an important cause of it.  As you are in trainer state, stimulate rapport and are the trainer and expert – leading becomes really  simple. But you got to accept your leadership role. It is your training, you are in charge – no one else.  You decide when training starts, and when the breaks are. You decide content, and exercises. You  decide when it’s ok to ask questions and when it is not. When you do this consistently you will find  that it happens naturally and there is no need whatsoever to act like an archetypal army drill sergeant.  In fact, in most professional groups such dominant macho behaviour could well break rapport and  render your training ineffective, as it will create a battlefield instead of collaborative learning  environment. Nonetheless, do use your authority when you feel you need to: when some trainee is  breaking the rules so much as to become a disturbance to the other trainees or the success of your  training, you must act decisively and timely.  7.6 Socialization  Before we go into the handling of groups and individuals, it is useful to shortly consider when it’s a  good idea to plan some socialization event like an icebreaker, before the training starts. If you don’t  47 See e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapport - rapport is taught in any decent NLP training and in many  presentation and communication trainings  48 See e.g. http://www.microdot.net/nlp/rapport/physiology-in-rapport.shtml  49 For gaining rapport one-on-one see e.g. http://teejay648.wordpress.com/2008/04/01/how-to-build-rapport- with-anyone-instantly/ or http://coachingleaders.emotional-climate.com/how-to-achieve-rapport/  or attend  any good NLP Practitioner training.  50 Unless some trainees do not want to be there but were forced to. You will notice a lack of rapport then and  this should alarm you enough to go and find the cause of this, and see if you can remedy it one way or the other.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapport http://www.microdot.net/nlp/rapport/physiology-in-rapport.shtml http://teejay648.wordpress.com/2008/04/01/how-to-build-rapport-with-anyone-instantly/ http://teejay648.wordpress.com/2008/04/01/how-to-build-rapport-with-anyone-instantly/ http://coachingleaders.emotional-climate.com/how-to-achieve-rapport/  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  33  do something like that, the first few hours of a training tend to be a bit uneasy. Your trainees don’t  know each other and they don’t know you. Most are silent, interaction is low. So for any training that’s  longer than just one day, it’s a good idea to gain some time and momentum by breaking the ice before  the training starts. The evening before is often a good option. One way of doing it is setting a time that  everyone will be in the bar, for instance. There you find a relatively quiet place (preparation), or you  ask the barmen to bring the music down for a moment. You welcome everyone, introduce yourself  and any other trainers or staff, roughly tell about the training days ahead, and end with any logistics  details worth mentioning. A free first round of drinks is really nice, if the budget allows that. The rest  of that meeting is just informal, talking with people. As trainer, go round and talk with some people.  Adopt your training style. Of course this is an informal event, so you can dress relaxed, but not too  relaxed – you are the trainer, you will be watched, your example sets the tone for the whole training51.  You can also be creative and organize some sort of game for the icebreaker session, with the intention  of people leaving their comfort zone and talking with trainees they do not know yet. Don’t overdo this  however. You may love this kind of game, but others don’t like them much and may feel pushed.  Whatever you do, let it be inviting and respectful.  The next stage of socialization happens in the training room, after you start. Do a round of  introductions. During introductions, position yourself in such a way that when a trainee talks about  himself and looks at you, he also looks at the other trainees. So be in the position of the trainees. Take  enough time for that, so that people can say a few personal things. Ask some questions to your  trainees in a relaxed way - no cross examination. If you can, lead them into some form of small group  exercise within the hour. Small group exercises work really well for people to get better acquainted  and thus break the ice.  If you had no opportunity for an icebreaker event, what was just said about breaking the ice in the  training room becomes extra important.  One other social aspect of the training that you will set the tone for is how much you allow your  students to be in contact with their e-life outside the training room. In this era, asking for 100%  attention all the time during is unlikely to succeed, and may feel overwhelming especially for younger  trainees. Consider telling your students that you expect a 10%/90% split – 90% is for the training, 10%  they can use to keep track of their e-life. It is reasonable to require that such e-life interactions are  done unobtrusively and subtly to avoid disturbing other students.  Socialization does not stop there. It continues during the whole event. Breaks need to be long enough  to allow people to talk and share. Intermediate breaks typically 30 minutes. Lunch break 60-90  minutes, dinner up to two hours. The timings also depend on the country where you are. In countries  like France and Italy for instance, 60 minutes is usually too short for lunch.  If there is time for a social event during the training, then grab the chance. A social event needs to be  fun, but also respectful and not pushy. Some trainers utilise the social event for their training goals,  but you don’t have to. The same as said above applies: no matter how nice the event is, and no matter  how good the wine and beer are – you are always the trainer and set the example.  7.7 Group dynamics  Every new group of trainees will be different from the previous one. Humans differ and their reaction  to trainings differs. Also any group that is newly formed has its own dynamics. This is part of the  challenge for you as trainer – for experienced trainers it is part of the fun of doing trainings. You could  51 E.g. drinking too much together with your students is something you must avoid at all cost. The authors would  not go out with their students, but that’s up for debate.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  34  of course follow trainings in group dynamics, though this is rarely done in the field of information  security. Any decent communication or trainer training will certainly touch on this topic and is in  general more recommendable.  If your group of trainees stays together for longer than just a day and have regular interaction, like  during exercises, then this group will follow the usual group dynamics path. If there are more  participants and you form fixed subgroups, the same applies to those. Barry Tuckman’s stages for  group development52 are a useful model to know. The following picture explains the stages that any  newly formed group goes through.  Figure 15: Group Development Stages (Tuckman)  It is useful to recognise these phases when they occur – phases can vary in length from almost absent  to quite long. Sometimes, a storming group can take a lot of time to storm. Depending on the goal of  your training, you may need to address this, as storming is a natural process but can also be a  distraction. If team building is part of your goals, then in general it is not wise to try and stop the  storming, unless it takes offensive forms. Men storm more than women on average – especially a  female trainer needs to recognise this and not get worried.  Groups create implicit functions for the group members, mostly unconsciously. There will be one or  two leaders. There will be a “scribe”, someone taking notes. There will be easy going members who  just cooperate. There will be a mostly silent member – and what you hope is that the group leaders  will stimulate this person to participate. And there may be the occasional mismatcher, who usually  does the opposite of what the group does53. Do what you can to ensure that as many group members  participate as possible. If for instance one person is the scribe, then during evaluation you could ask  another group member to use the scribe’s notes and verbalise them (in most cases you want to  announce this beforehand, or you will scare people).  7.8 Handling of individuals  Most of your trainees will be great people, and when you are respectful and inviting towards them,  entertain good rapport and do as you promise, then you will do just great towards them. A few words  of advice on the handling of those very rare individual trainees who cause grief:  52 See e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development  53 No need to worry about natural mismatchers – it’s no sabotage, just how they are. They are the people who  go left when everyone goes right. When it IS sabotage, e.g. by someone who does not want to be in your training,  then you will notice some form of venom which is absent with mismatchers.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  35  • In any training group you will find someone who wants to teach you, the trainer. They have  some reason to show off their own knowledge or experience, or they just love to go on about their  personal experiences even if they may not be too interesting to the group. Don’t become their pet.  You are in charge. Make clear when it is ok to ask questions or make remarks, and when it is not. If  the remarks made are not very relevant or have too much repetition, then kindly but clearly put an  end to this. You could say any variation of “thank you for your input – we will continue now”. You  could add “if you want to discuss this more, do it offline please” but you don’t have to, especially if  that is exactly what you do not want. Be friendly, respectful and kind – but also honest. Now these  people are easy to handle. However sometimes, rarely in the experience of the authors, you have  someone in your group who does not want to be there. They were sent by their boss or someone else  in authority, and they have decided not to like this and take it out on the world. That is: on you as  trainer especially, as you represent authority. Even if they could benefit from your training, it is not  going to happen, they will punish you. Now you make talk some sense into them, during a break, and  this needs to be done at the earliest possible stage. If they really want to punish their boss – with you  as proxy – then not much is going to help and you may even need to remove them from the class. This  is treated in the next bullet point.  • The one showstopper is when one or more group members become clearly offensive or  hurtful towards others. This is unacceptable and you as the trainer will need to stop this. Respect  between trainees is essential – and as we argued before you set the example in that. In such cases the  first thing to do is a one-on-one talk with who you believe to be the offender – be very aware though,  as things are not always what they seem: some people like to play the victim role and blame others.  There are usually psychological reasons for any kind of bully or victim behaviour, but you are not their  therapist. Tell them what you expect in regard their behaviour, make it crystal clear if needed. If they  persist in negative behaviour warn them a second time – and make clear that the third time you will  remove them from the training.  • Make sure beforehand that you know what authority you have with this group. Can you  remove someone from the group? If you are not sure, can someone else in a leadership position do  that for you? If so, make sure you know such people and that they know you. Be aware that removing  someone from your training is the last thing you want to do. But sometimes you have to, so be  prepared. In countries like the UK or the USA it is not unusual to have the trainees sign rules of  engagement on the spot, at the very beginning of the training. These rules invariably allow the trainer  to remove a student – usually without a refund of the training cost54. When you have to use that last  resort and remove someone from your training, you need to make sure to do this during a break,  preferable a longer one like the lunch break, or at the end of the training day – and you must do it  one-on-one. The other trainees do not want to hear an unpleasant discussion between you and the  person to be removed: it’s not functional and will only spoil the mood. When they return from a break  and see that the offender has gone, they will usually be pleased.  7.9 Structuring the training  The first thing to do to structure your training is to use what you learnt in chapter 5, where we told  you to use the 4MAT system to bring an order to your teaching that will result in effective learning.  Now of course you use the 4MAT that you prepared in your classes. So with specific chunks of learning  you go WHY - WHAT - HOW - WHAT IF, where the WHY and WHAT IF can be 5-10% of the time and  the WHAT and the HOW fill the rest of the time. Also remember that if you have a topic with specific  54 One of the authors once had to remove a trainee who was spoiling a training for all others. Half of the course  money was paid back. The main thing is to get it done, one way or the other, with a minimum level of disruption  for the other students!  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  36  subtopics that need to be practiced (i.e. they need a HOW), that you can also go WHY - WHAT (subtopic  A) - HOW (subtopic A) - WHAT (subtopic B) - HOW (subtopic B) - etc. - WHAT IF. Use this, practice it. It  even works for your five minutes of fame before the board of the organisation: in such cases, five  minutes is all you’ll ever get. You start with explaining in a few sentences WHY the board must listen  to you – and this had better be good and related to how the board thinks, or you are wasting your  time. Then you spend two minutes on the WHAT and two on the HOW, and always you stay high level  – the HOW for a board member is about money, laws and resources, not about technical difficulties.  And finally the WHAT IF is time for questions.  Equally important is that you take the lessons of chapter three to hear and avoid lecture fatigue. Don’t  talk for more than 30 minutes at a time, make sure to embed other teaching elements to cater for  variety and to reach all types of students. Discussions, exercises, working in groups, technical work,  breaks, challenges, etc. are all tools that you can use for this purpose. Use them consciously, make  sure this was in your session plan. You can always improvise a teaching element when the interaction  with the trainees gives cause for that, or when you are inspired to do so – but know what you do when  you do this and do it sparingly please, to avoid chaos. Chaos will never give students the feeling that  they were in a good training.  A teaching element you can always use is the metaphor. We use metaphor here in the sense of a story  that is meaningful in the context of the training. That can be consciously meaningful – the topic can  be the same or similar for example – or it can be unconsciously meaningful: a story about challenge  and learning for instance. Plan your metaphors and think about the goal they have in the context of  your training. Put them in your session plan and explain why there are there at that moment. Don’t  put too many purposes in one metaphor – use more metaphors if needed, and keep the purpose of  each metaphor clear in your own mind. Do not explain the purpose to your trainees. It’s great when  you can tell your own stories as they are usually the most gripping. Make sure to polish your stories in  such a way that they become a great metaphor for the trainees. If that means you need to rewrite  history a bit, feel free to do so: you are not giving a lecture on a historical topic. Do not use metaphors  to show off: that is not their purpose. If you use the stories of others, make them sound if they are  your own – a metaphor does not work when the storyteller is detached. You need to play out the  metaphor in your choice of words and use of voice. If you have kids and you read out to them, you  already know how it is – just go with it and enjoy telling the story.  Why do metaphors, meaningful, contextualised stories, work so well? That’s because we humans love  stories. Look at movies and books – all stories. Even the most serious business men or university  professors love stories deep down. The idea behind this is that stories engage both the conscious and  the unconscious mind. And as learning requires the participation of the unconscious, this is exactly the  kind of buy-in that you want to achieve. Do you ever remember ten years later how you learnt  something so well? No you don’t, as the learning became unconscious and only then was it really  useful and lasting.  Milton Erickson55 was a famous psychiatrist and therapist who pioneered the use of metaphors as  important therapeutic tools. The first thing he did with metaphors was that he opened one at the  beginning of a therapeutic session, but did not close it right away. He just stopped the story at a cliff- hanger. Then at the end of the session, he’d close the story. The idea behind this is that the  unconscious mind loves stories and wants to hear how they end. So this way he opened up not only  the conscious but also the unconscious mind, to ensure that the learning effects were maximised. Why  don’t you try that in your trainings, just see how it goes.  55 See e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_H._Erickson  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  37  Erickson also very carefully picked his metaphors for purpose, as we already argued above you should  do too. Now he even did one more thing, and we advise you to only try this out once you are sure  footed in using metaphors, because it requires some skill. Once you are you will find how great this  can work. What Erickson did was not just open ONE story A and not close it. He opened up to five  stories B, C, D and E in a row, and did not close any one of them! Then he did his therapy work. Then  he closed the metaphors in reverse order, so from E to A. This process is called “multiple embedded  metaphors”.  7.10 Feedback  To give constructive and useful feedback to your students is an important part of training. If the  feedback is felt as harsh – the student will only remember the harshness and not the content – and  he will probably reject and resent it. If the feedback is too long and detailed, the student will only  remember two to three things. If it’s too nice all over because you want to motivate him, then the  student may feel great about his own achievement, but if it really wasn’t any good, this kind of  feedback won’t make it any better. In general, a good way of giving feedback is using the so-called  feedback sandwich as you can see in the picture. You need to read this top-down. So first you start  with a thank you for trying and a few points that went really well. Then secondly, a few precise  observations of things to improve, and the way how to improve them: tell clearly to the students what  you expect of them. And thirdly, you wrap up with a positive, motivating conclusion. This way of giving  feedback can work quite well, but do remember to moderate your critique. If the student still has a  lot of improvements to make, limit your observations to a few main things that need improvement.  When a trainee does  something 90% well, then you  can go into the finer details.  Remember, here too “less is  more” applies. Another good  idea is that if the trainees have  done an assignment in a  group, to have one of the  other group members write  down a summary of the  feedback. That way the  student can listen to you  without worrying about  forgetting it. Another method  is to have the student repeat  the two to four (no more!)  suggestions that you made for  improvement.  Most importantly for feedback: give feedback in a respectful way and stay in rapport. Make a joke if  you are natural at that, but never ever at the expense of the student. Break the ice, make clear that  everyone is there to learn, and that you as trainer learn from each training too.  7.11 Be prepared for the worst  And just when you think you got everything under control and your training is well on its way – things  happen. The air-conditioning stops working and its blazing hot outside. One of your trainees becomes  Figure 16: Feedback sandwich  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  38  ill, or runs into an emotional state that needs attention. The hotel’s renovations have just started and  the drill does not sound quite right for your training. Your voice decides to take a day off.  All of this and much more can happen – and will happen someday, one way or the other. If you  prepared well, you can already meet a lot of challenges. Some are hard or impossible to prepare for  in terms of equipment or arrangements. For those you need to prepare mentally. Set yourself up so  that the training will be a success, no matter what. Then instead of panicking, or going passive, you  will find the best possible solution and go for it.  Often this means you need to take action or negotiate. Be prepared to pause the training to do that.  You can be open about this: “folks, this is one of these things you can’t plan for – I need to address  this problem right now or it will affect our training – twenty minute break, starting now – wish me  luck!”. If the hotel is “to blame” you may need to really escalate the problem. Hotel staff is in the  authors’ experience very good in saying “sorry Sir, nothing we can do about it”. Once one of us was  offered a refund – but that doesn’t help the trainees and is not acceptable as a solution. If necessary  one of the hotel management will need to come up with a satisfactory solution, and quick. Use all your  powers of persuasion.  Clearly it is ideal to not be on your own. When you have a co-trainer – or a logistics man, it becomes  much easier to deal with such issues, as at least you can keep focusing on the training, as best as can  be done under the circumstances. Be flexible. If there is a lot of noise, then you could possibly go into  a small group exercise.  Let’s look at technical trainings for a moment. There you almost always have to prepare for challenges  occurring. Some estimates from real life experience:  • If the training involves a number of technical devices which are supplied to the trainees to  work with, then you can safely assume that around 20% of these devices will not work properly.  • If the trainees use their own devices, such as laptops, and you e.g. provide them with virtual  images to install, then the percentage of problems will usually exceed 20%, no matter how well you  thought you prepared everything.  • If you do a technical training for the first time and it involves hands-on technical work, then  estimate the time needed for that hands-on work, and at least double it. That figure will be a better  estimate.  Sometimes your trainees give you a hard time. Remember: you are in charge, therefore stay calm,  maintain trainer state, and stay in charge. In the worst case you may need to ask a trainee to leave  the training. Never allow to be engaged in discussions about the set-up and format of the training,  and make sure that classroom discussions don’t touch topics like politics or religion. It is always you  as trainer who decides what to discuss and for how long. Be worthy, respectful and predictable in your  intentions and behaviour.  8 Closing of trainings  I never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn. [Albert  Einstein]  When you have done as Einstein suggested, and provided the right conditions for learning, then the  closing of the training will simply be the next natural step in the process. Closing the training should  be much more than just saying “thank you and goodbye”, in fact it should be part of the learning  process, not the end of it. In this chapter we explore some closing tactics that you can adopt.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  39  8.1 How to properly wrap up a training?  Wrapping up a training is an opening, not a closure. It opens the way for the trainees to actually use  what they have learnt. And possibly they will opt for further learning. So the use of your training does  not stop when it ends: that’s the time that it really begins. Once you understand this fully, you can  devise a sensible wrap-up. We give two suggestions here:  • Check during the training and during wrap-up if the learning objectives have been met. This  requires that you have clear, achievable learning objectives – we already advised you to have such. If  they are clear, you can ask simple questions and find out. It definitely has to be more than “ok, we’re  done, is all clear to you now?”  • If the topic allows this, you can send the trainees away with some additional materials, printed  and/or electronic, around the theme “now this is what you can do when you get home”. So this would  typically be checklists, including suggestions for application of the knowledge and how to achieve  further learning. The idea is to make sure that the trainees never get stuck in working what they just  learnt.  8.2 Testing & tasking  Your training may include a test near the end – oral, written, or computerized. Whatever test you do,  make sure that it supports the learning objectives. See the test as part of the learning process, not as  a punishment for the trainees for behaving so well during the course. Ideally, make the test results  known before the training ends. If passing the test is a requirement, and someone does not pass –  then communicate this in private, discuss available options (Take the test again later? Take the course  again? At extra cost?) and suggest clearly what the trainee needs to do and prepare to pass the test  next time.  In rare cases, you can task the trainees when they leave the training. This means – give them a task  that they need to fulfil within a given timeframe, and provide you with satisfactory feedback. This will  only work when they have agreed to this in advance, or when their management supports it. When it  happens, make the tasking very clear: they need to exactly know what to do, as you won’t be around  for asking questions. The timeframe also needs to be set. And finally, the feedback to you needs to be  clearly defined, or else you will just get a mail which says “I did it”. Say for instance they need to  prepare a demo – then ask them to make a video of that demo while they give it, and send you that  video.  8.3 Evaluation  The worst way of evaluating the course is not evaluating it at all, but just say “that’s about it, thanks  guys, safe travels home and good luck!” You may have been brilliant as a trainer, but how are you ever  going to know? How are you going to improve the training materials and your own performance? In  short, it is useful to do a proper evaluation.  The method most used is usually no good either, because poorly implemented: the written evaluation  form that you fill out at the end of the training. They are usually filled in hastily, remark fields (which  are the most useful to your growth as a trainer) get ignored and if you ask people to rate on a scale of  one to five then one and five will hardly be used and you end up with bland results. If you do choose  to use this kind of evaluation then pre-frame it before you hand over the forms. Tell them you will  absolutely pay attention to what they fill out, to use the full scale for rating, and to please, please  write down some remarks, as those are really helpful.  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  40  Probably the most useful kind of evaluation during the training is done orally. You do this all the time  – especially in breaks. This kind of evaluation is veiled – you don’t ask your trainee “how was that last  session and was I any good?” but you might ask “do you think you can apply now what we just  discussed? Did you miss any insights or learnings?”  Additionally, you can ask an experienced tutor to attend your training and write down comments and  suggestions for you to use afterwards, to improve the materials and your teaching. Also ask them for  a verbal debriefing. The evaluator is ideally a fellow tutor, but can really be anyone with a critical mind  and open eye: but make sure he is independent and brave enough to criticize you. If an evaluator is  assigned to a training then do make sure that the trainer knows this well in advance, and that evaluator  and trainer have a chance to meet before the training starts. You don’t want the trainer to feel  ambushed – this might well affect the quality of the training in a negative way.  Another option is a follow-up interview one month later. Your trainees need to agree with this in  advance. You can explain them that this has a dual purpose – for you to find out how successful the  training was and how it might be improved – and for the trainee as an opportunity to ask additional  questions a month later. In 2012 ENISA conducted a survey asking the average perceived value of  various trainings, and the results are presented in the Roadmap to provide more proactive and  efficient Computer Emergency Response Team training56  In case there is an opportunity and need to test the effectiveness of a training one very good way  might be to organise an exercise where previously taught skills are exercised individually. The results  need to be addressed with caution though, because it is nearly impossible to correctly evaluate a skill  not taking into account the previous experience and many other factors.  8.4 Acknowledgements  As formal acknowledgement that the trainees have successfully done the training, you can do a  number of things:  • A nice certificate on paper, with their name on it, a characterisation of the training content,  the number of hours they spent in preparing and following the training57 , the names of the trainers,  and a signature by the lead trainer and/or some other relevant figure of authority. The authors  recommend to always make such a certificate.  • A letter to the trainee, repeating much of the same which should be on the paper certificate,  and again signed by the lead trainer. It’s useful if they receive this letter as a pdf attached to an e-mail  sent to them, because that way they can easily send the pdf to their management, to accreditation  instances, etc.  • Accreditation points. If you can register your training with some accreditation body (like CISSP  in information security for instance), then your training can be rated with a certain number of points  in their education system. This is very helpful for trainees who are a member of such programs, as  they need to continuously collect such points to remain in good standing.  56  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise/roadmap-to-provide-more-proactive-and- efficient-cert-training/at_download/fullReport  57 The specification of the number of hours spent can help the trainees gathering “points” for professional  education programmes or accreditations they participate in.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise/roadmap-to-provide-more-proactive-and-efficient-cert-training/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise/roadmap-to-provide-more-proactive-and-efficient-cert-training/at_download/fullReport  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  41  8.5 Stay in touch  It depends on the kind of training and environment you work in, but sometimes it’s useful to have a  way of staying in touch with your ex-trainees. We suggest the following options:  • Encourage the trainees to exchange contact details – you should have those already,  otherwise, make sure you do.  • Create a mailing list containing you and the trainees. If you do, then use it. If you don’t use it,  it will be dead and forgotten within three months. Typically such a list is only for the participants of  one training.  • Create a web presence for this purpose and give the trainees access. If you do you had better  make it really inviting and useful, or else no one will ever use it more than once. A web presence can  work for the participants of all trainings on that topic.  • One option could be an interview after one month as an option to consider. A comeback event  is another option – this will be a rare possibility, but if it is possible, go for it. This event will typically  be a few hours or half day. Do it around threeto six months later. Annual comeback events are a real  luxury if you can afford them, but can be great for ongoing learning – both for the trainees and yourself  as trainer. Such events are clearly meant for sharing the learnings – so it should not be just you talking.

Use this checklist to prepare a successful training. The suggested timeline given is just an example to  help to think ahead. The checklist is written assuming you cover all items on the list on your own as a  trainer, in case you have help in the form of logistics person, or co-trainer, then divide the work, but  make sure that everything in the checklist will be covered – as the a trainer you are responsible of the  process!

Following  an overview with recommendations is presented.  10.1 Existing international CERT Training Initiatives  We offer a list of international CSIRT training initiatives here, with a regional focus on Europe:   TRANSITS: http://www.terena.org/activities/transits/  TRANSITS offers a two-day introductory course for CSIRT members (TRANSITS I) and a three-day  course with advanced topics (TRANSITS II: forensics, netflow and human communication).  TRANSITS’ aim is to foster the education of CERT professionals and keep the threshold (including  the cost) for that as low as is feasible. The programme is run  not-for-profit and was set up in  Europe by the European research network community (TERENA). ENISA supports TRANSITS.  TRANSITS is given all over the world, also thanks to cooperation with FIRST.  TRANSITS also offers a train-the-trainer course, to get experienced CERT professionals up-and- running as TRANSITS trainers – the body of trainers exists of volunteers.   ENISA exercises: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  ENISA offers a set of more than 30 exercises for CERTs which anyone can use for free. The topics  range from organisational, via legal and law enforcement oriented, towards highly technical. You  can run the exercises “off the shelf” as all materials (including VM images for some technical  exercises) are included.  TRANSITS uses some of the ENISA exercises in their trainings.  On request, ENISA can offer guided exercises and related trainings – get in touch with cert- relations@enisa.europa.eu .   CERT/CC training courses: http://cert.org/training/  The CERT Coordination Center was the first CERT on the planet and still is one of the most eminent  organisations in the field. They have trainings in the areas if incident handling, network security  and risk assessment & insider threat. Their trainings are commercial and take place in the USA.  Their incident handling courses are also offered in Germany on request: http://www.pre- secure.com/ir/courses/index.html   SANS training courses: http://www.sans.org/courses/  SANS offer a great variety of commercial security courses. Many are relevant to CERTs, to name  just a few:  o Incident Response Team Management  o Hacker Techniques, Exploits & Incident Handling  o Advanced Computer Forensic Analysis and Incident Response  All courses are offered in the USA – some also in other regions of the world. You can get SANS to  come to you and offer trainings, at a price.   FIRST Education Committee: http://www.first.org/about/organization/committees#edc  Not a training per se but an international group of CERT experts working together on education  issues. You can join them or get in touch with them.  The Education Committee supports the  TRANSITS framework and as such also organizes train-the-trainer training in cooperation with  TRANSITS.  http://www.terena.org/activities/transits/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise mailto:cert-relations@enisa.europa.eu mailto:cert-relations@enisa.europa.eu http://cert.org/training/ http://www.pre-secure.com/ir/courses/index.html http://www.pre-secure.com/ir/courses/index.html http://www.sans.org/courses/ http://www.first.org/about/organization/committees#edc  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  45  10.2 National & Local CERT Training Initiatives  Many bigger CSIRTs organize their own trainings locally – sometimes also inviting the members of  other teams, usually in the same country. Some use their own materials for these courses, others use  e.g. TRANSITS What speaks for these trainings is that they are given by experienced professionals.  We advise you to get in touch with a well respected CERT in your country, e.g. the national or  government team, and ask them if they offer trainings or can recommend trainings for your team. The  most up-to-date list of European CERTs (including national and governmental ones) is found at  https://www.trusted-introducer.org/directory/country_LICSA.html . A world directory at  http://www.first.org/members/map .  Commercial security training companies are only now starting to offer CERT related trainings. One  example is an “Incident Response Practitoner” training offered in The Netherlands by the Security  Academy. 59  We have no overview of such courses, nor hands-on experience with them. Ask  experienced CERTs in your countries if they can recommend such courses.  10.3 Synergy  In the following are suggestions that can improve the CERT training field and its coherence:   ENISA’s “Roadmap to provide more proactive and efficient CERT training” has already been  partially implemented. The following recommendations still apply in the context of “synergy” here  and are highly recommend to follow up on:  o Run ENISA CERT exercises at universities. This way students can participate in training that  will teach them about the CERT area, but at the same time the cooperation with university  teachers will prove beneficial for engaging universities more in the CERT area.  o “Fire Drills” for the CERT community. Get CERTs to do “fire drill” exercises together. This  is a very effective educational tool. Make sure that very experienced CERT members are  the mentors of the drill.  o ENISA CERT Training Hubs (ECTH). The idea here is to accredit existing CERTs or  commercial security training providers as providers of CERT related trainings. This will help  emerging CERTs pick the best educations for their staff, and it will encourage existing  training providers to improve their trainings to meet a minimum set of requirements.  o Certification paths. This is again about working together with universities, but also with  ECTHs (see above), to define education paths for (future) members of the CSIRT  community – and to add the element of certification to that. Ideally, this certification  would become an internationally recognised quality seal. Such a programme would be  very helpful for improving the education of (future) team members.   We recommend that each country make a list of available CERT related trainings in their country.  This could be an initiative of the national or governmental CERT. Ideally, some quality seal or  minimum set of requirements would apply to trainings listed in that way, but this may still be a  bridge too far in most countries. We recommend any party who sets up such a listing, to get in  59 No link offered as this is just one arbitrary example.  https://www.trusted-introducer.org/directory/country_LICSA.html http://www.first.org/members/map https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise/roadmap-to-provide-more-proactive-and-efficient-cert-training/at_download/fullReport  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  46  touch with ENISA first to look for synergy, as ENISA is aware of most ongoing developments in this  area.   We recommend that existing regional CERT meetings like e.g. TF-CSIRT in Europe (see  http://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/ ) add an element of education to their meetings, as in  an extra day before or after the meetings. To start with, such regional fora could ask existing  training providers such as TRANSITS, or indeed ENISA or experienced CERTs who have their own  training programmes, to come and fill such “training days”. Another option is to do a “fire drill” at  such days, as recommended above. This recommendation is a cost effective and relatively easy  way to organize trainings for a big number of CERTs. As a side effect, it will increase the standing  and reputation of such fora as TF-CSIRT.   We recommend that FIRST (e.g. by means of the Educational Committee) and/or ENISA set up a  dialogue between the various training providers, most notably including ENISA, FIRST, TRANSITS,  CERT/CC and SANS. Such a dialogue should include topics like certification paths in time. It is in  the interest of all to define education standards for the CERT area. Those responsible for  programmes like CISSP and CISM should be included at some stage, so that educations in the CERT  area could give “points” for the ongoing accreditation process involved in such programmes as  CISSP and CISM.   We recommend that a train-the-trainer programme is set up for future trainers in the CERT area,  but also to improve the skills of existing trainers, who are often great technical experts but less  experienced as a trainer. TRANSITS is well suited to set this up as they already have offered several  of such trainings, run by one of the authors and one of the reviewers of this guide. It is  recommended that this is set-up in cooperation with ENISA. Collaboration with the FIRST  Educational Committee is recommended.  http://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/  Good Practice Guide on Training Methodologies  How to become an effective and inspirational trainer  November 2014  Page  47  11 ANNEX C: Bibliography  1.

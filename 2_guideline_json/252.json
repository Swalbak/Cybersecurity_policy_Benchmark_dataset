Warning  customers2 regarding cyber threats is also industry good practice. Here are some recent  examples:  • In 2020, Google warned 40,000 customers that it had detected activity from nation- state sponsored cyber-attackers against customer accounts3.  • In 2019, WhatsApp detected attacks targeting around 1,400 users and sent each of  them a warning about this threat4.  • In 2020, T-Mobile warned its users to be on alert, following an increase in SIM  swapping attacks5.  • In 2021, Vodafone published a warning about the Flubot malware on its website,  warning customers about it and explaining what they could do if their device was  infected.6  However, warning about cyber threats is not a straightforward activity and has to be done  carefully. Warning toο often about cyber threats could be counter-productive because users  might start downplaying or even ignoring the warnings in the long run. Likewise, there may be  limited utility in warning about a general threat when there is very little customers can or are  likely to do about it. On the other hand, warning a customer about a particular and imminent yet  addressable threat is more likely to generate tangible results. Specifically, it may help the  customer avoid the threat turning into a security incident.  Choosing the right channel and method for contacting users is important. Very frequent and  badly designed warnings could result in users finding it difficult to distinguish them from  fraudulent messages. As a result, in some cases, such warnings could actually lead to  increasing the likelihood of fraud. Often, cyber-attacks start with an SMS message or email  containing an alarming text and a call for urgent action. For example, the so-called ‘helpdesk  scams’ warn the user about an infected PC asking them to contact customer support and install  ‘cleaning’ software, including links and contact information that lead them to the fraudster  instead.  In this paper, we aim to give guidance to national Authorities and providers of electronic  communications networks and services regarding how to strike the right balance and  carry out efficient and effective outreach to users about cyber threats.  In the first part of this report, we present an overview of the state of play by analysing several  examples, case studies and responses from the experts working in the sector. We note that this  overview reflects the situation before the EECC came into effect.  1 Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code, OJ L 321,  17.12.2018, p. 36  2 Art 40(3) of the EECC refers to ‘users’. However, for the purposes of this report, and given that not all practices described here may fall under Art 40(3), we will use the  terms ‘customers’, ‘consumers’, ‘users’ and ‘end-users’ interchangeably  3 https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/03/27/hacker-threat-google-confirms-40000-nation-state-cyber-attack-warnings-issued/ .  4 https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/01/whatsapp-hack-is-serious-rights-violation-say-alleged-victims .  5 https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/how-to-fight-account-takeover-fraud  6 https://support.vodafone.co.uk/Flubot/1656667612/What-is-the-Flubot-scam.htm  https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/03/27/hacker-threat-google-confirms-40000-nation-state-cyber-attack-warnings-issued/ https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/01/whatsapp-hack-is-serious-rights-violation-say-alleged-victims https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/how-to-fight-account-takeover-fraud https://support.vodafone.co.uk/Flubot/1656667612/What-is-the-Flubot-scam.htm  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  6  In the second part of this report, we provide a framework, a checklist, for determining whether to  carry out outreach activities and how.  The checklist has three steps:  1. Trigger: Determine if outreach about a potential threat is needed.  2. Communication: Determine the right channel, and the right message.  3. Evaluation: Define the parameters for measuring the effectiveness of the outreach.  Figure 1: Checklist to determine whether to carry out outreach activities and how  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  7  In the Annex we fill in this checklist for a few well-known cases.  We conclude this paper with general observations:  •  Monitoring and notifying about potential threats is a new paradigm: The EECC  requires providers of electronic communications networks and services to monitor  potential threats before they turn into cybersecurity incidents. In the proposal for the  revised Network and Information Systems Directive7 (the ‘NIS2 proposal’), the  Commission extends this approach to other sectors. While there are benefits in  communicating warnings about threats before they become cybersecurity incidents,  authorities and providers should collaborate to strike the right balance about which  threats should be in the scope of these warnings. The proposed simple framework is  sector-agnostic, and could be adjusted and reused in other policy areas, so that users  are informed about cyber threats and possible preventative or mitigative measures  effectively and in a timely manner.  •  Engage and collaborate with national authorities about outreach: The national  authorities we interviewed suggested that collaboration and knowledge sharing are  good between electronic communications providers and authorities. Providers could  engage them before reaching out to the customers. The national authorities could then  also coordinate with other providers, other governmental entities, such as the national  CSIRTs, and even coordinate with authorities in other sectors to address the problem.  •  Outreach does not replace other actions: Finally, outreach to customers should be  seen as a complementary measure and should not replace other actions by the  authorities or the providers - specifically, applying the necessary preventive or  mitigative technical measures. This is because the users receiving the communication  often do not have the time and/or the know-how to deal with technical issues.  7 Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2020 on measures for a high  common level of cybersecurity across the Union, repealing Directive (EU) 2016/1148, COM(2020) 823 final, 16.12.2020.  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  8  1. INTRODUCTION  EECC, the EU’s new telecom security legislation, requires providers of public electronic  communications networks or services to notify their users of a particular and significant threat.  Warning customers regarding cyber threats is also industry good practice.  In this paper we provide guidance on:  • Which cyber threats should trigger outreach to the customers using the networks and  services?  • How to communicate about threats, which channels to use, which messages to convey?  • How to evaluate the effectiveness of the outreach?  1.1 TARGET AUDIENCE  This paper provides technical guidance to national Authorities supervising the implementation of  Article 40, par. 3 of the EECC, and it may also be useful for experts working in the EU telecom  sector.  1.2 POLICY CONTEXT  EECC Article 40 par. 3 requires providers of communications networks and services in the EU  to notify users of particular and significant threats about the measures or remedies they can  take to mitigate these threats, to protect the security of their communications. Where relevant,  providers should also notify the users about the threat itself. We quote the legislative text in full:  \"Member States shall ensure that in the case of a particular and significant threat of a security  incident in public electronic communications networks or publicly available electronic  communications services, providers of such networks or services shall inform their users potentially  affected by such a threat of any possible protective measures or remedies which can be taken by  the users. Where appropriate, providers shall also inform their users of the threat itself.\"  In the following paragraphs, we give guidance about how this step can be implemented  effectively and efficiently in practice.  Note that the EU Member States are in the process of transposing the EECC into national  legislation.  Note also that the European Commission recently made a proposal for a reviewed NIS  Directive, the NIS2 proposal, which substitutes Article 40 of the EECC. However, current NIS2  proposal also contains the same provision about warning/notifying users of the service, which  means that there would be no substantial change in this regard.  1.3 METHODOLOGY  We developed this guidance by looking into the following research questions:  ● How do providers currently inform users about threats and mitigative measures and how  is the effectiveness of this outreach measured?  ● How do operators in other critical sectors such as banking and utilities reach out to their  customers?  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  9  We collected information in three ways:  • Desk research: We have analysed publicly available sources and specialised literature  on the status, practices and mechanisms in place related to consumer outreach about  cybersecurity threats. The processed materials served as the basis for the online  survey and the interviews.  • Online questionnaire, targeting national authorities and telecom providers in the  EU: In total, 49 stakeholders answered the online questionnaire, from both private and  public sectors at EU and national levels.  • Interviews with stakeholders: We held 15 expert interviews to get a better  understanding of the current industry practices when it comes to reaching out to users  about cybersecurity threats.  Figure 2: Overview of the research participation  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  10  2. CASE STUDIES  In this section, we provide examples of situations in which providers reach out to customers  about cybersecurity threats.  Note that these case studies are indicative of the existing good practices in the industry, before  transposition of the EECC into national legislation.  2.1 CASE STUDIES FROM THE TELECOM SECTOR  General awareness raising – Telenor8  Telenor has an awareness programme, including 10 ‘digital lessons’ introducing security  awareness for typical cybersecurity threats, such as ransomware, phishing and malicious links,  or fake news and false facts. The digital lessons are available for citizens and enterprises.  Videos with lifelike examples of threats – Telefónica 9  Telefónica provides detailed descriptions of currently trending potential threats in posts on social  media, which includes video explanations of threats through lifelike examples. For instance, in a  video-post in May 2021, Telefónica provided information  on the characteristics, consequences  and preventive measures of ‘smishing’, a variant of phishing, through SMS.  Fake email examples - Deutsche Telekom 10  On its website, Deutsche Telecom publishes information about ongoing and past incidents  sorted by date, including the characteristics of the incident, the measures that have been taken  to address it, and suggestions for users on how to take preventive or mitigating measures.  For example, on 19 May 2021, Deutsche Telekom published a description of fake emails  allegedly sent by Deutsche Bank, Sparkasse and Amazon, which included a description of the  characteristics of such messages (e.g. misspellings, strange email address), the tricks for  stealing log-in data (e.g. mandatory updates, user advantages available on a link), the  consequences of falling victim to those emails, as well as the mitigation steps customers could  take (e.g. call customer service).  FluBot warning - Vodafone Greece 11  Vodafone Greece maintains a webpage about the FluBot mobile phone malware, where users  can find detailed information about the threat, e.g. a description of the fraud, protecting  measures and a comprehensive list of steps a user can take to find out if he has been affected.  8 https://www.telenor.com/get-free-access-to-online-security-awareness-program/  9  https://m.facebook.com/watch/?v=292264332511439&_rdr  10 www.telekom.de/hilfe/festnetz-internet-tv/sicherheit/sicherheitsmeldungen?samChecked=true  11 https://support.vodafone.co.uk/Flubot/1656667612/What-is-the-Flubot-scam.htm  https://www.telenor.com/get-free-access-to-online-security-awareness-program/ https://m.facebook.com/watch/?v=292264332511439&_rdr http://www.telekom.de/hilfe/festnetz-internet-tv/sicherheit/sicherheitsmeldungen?samChecked=true https://support.vodafone.co.uk/Flubot/1656667612/What-is-the-Flubot-scam.htm  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  11  FluBot warning - Vodafone UK 12  Vodafone UK provides a detailed description of current threats on Twitter, e.g. a description of  the FluBot fraud. The tweet consists of three steps, which should be taken by the users to avoid  the fraud.  Detailed incident communication, including severity scores and steps taken – Zoom 13  Zoom provides descriptions of vulnerabilities and incidents in its ‘Security Bulletin’. This bulletin  entails not only descriptions of the incidents dating back several years, but also assigns a score  to identify their severity based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)14.  Furthermore, it includes descriptions of measures that have been taken to mitigate the  vulnerabilities. For example, on 26 March 2021, Zoom posted the details of a screen-sharing  vulnerability with a CVSS score of 5.7 (medium severity), a detailed description of the  consequences of using screen sharing (screen sharing users may be seen by other meeting  participants for a brief moment), all the products affected and the steps Zoom had taken to  address it.  Belgian Anti-Phishing Shield15 - Proximus  The campaign aims at reducing active botnet participation from user devices. The customers  are warned when they are about to access a malicious website following a phishing attack. The  initiative does not only notify users of potential threats, but also navigates them to an  awareness-raising site where they are walked through the steps for cleaning their device. The  step-by-step instructions and immediate alerts make the process more user-friendly and easy- to-understand.  Countrywide awareness raising campaigns with provider participation - T-Mobile  Netherlands  T-Mobile participates in countrywide awareness-raising campaigns about potential cybersecurity  threats and mitigation measures, where the participating providers share their industry  knowledge. These awareness-raising campaigns are funded by the Dutch Government and  organised by the Dutch Ministry of Justice and Security.  Simple targeted awareness raising campaign – SSF Cybersecurity  The Swedish Internet Foundation conducted research in connection with leaked passwords and  the Swedish internet security organisation (Stoldskyddsforeningen - SSF) turned the results of  this survey into a nationwide awareness raising campaign with easy-to-understand messages.  The most common leaked passwords were presented on eye-catching billboards and bus stop  advertisements.  A variety of dedicated educational material for children, parents and teachers - Liberty  Global16171819  12 https://support.vodafone.co.uk/Flubot/1656667612/What-is-the-Flubot-scam.htm  13 https://explore.zoom.us/en/trust/security/security-bulletin/  14 https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss  15 https://baps.ccb.belgium.be/en/belgian-anti-phishing-shield Belgian Anti Phishing Shield  16 https://www.virginmedia.com/help/security-hub;  17 https://www.virginmedia.ie/customer-support/support-by-products/broadband/online-security-safety/  18 https://www.sunrise.ch/en/residential/mobile/freedom/options/surf-protect.html;  19 https://www2.telenet.be/fr/serviceclient/signaler-un-abus-dinternet/  https://support.vodafone.co.uk/Flubot/1656667612/What-is-the-Flubot-scam.htm https://explore.zoom.us/en/trust/security/security-bulletin/ https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss https://baps.ccb.belgium.be/en/belgian-anti-phishing-shield https://www.virginmedia.com/help/security-hub https://www.virginmedia.ie/customer-support/support-by-products/broadband/online-security-safety/ https://www.sunrise.ch/en/residential/mobile/freedom/options/surf-protect.html https://www2.telenet.be/fr/serviceclient/signaler-un-abus-dinternet/  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  12  Via its subsidiaries, Liberty Global provides educational material on online safety dedicated to  different age groups, parents and teachers. The material is provided in easy-to-understand  formats, games, workbooks and readings for the ages of 4 to 16 in more than 10 languages.  For example, the workbook for children from 13-16 years incorporates decision-making steps in  real-life examples, such as what information we can share on the internet and with whom. This  segmentation of the young generations allows parents and teachers to provide access to  suitable learning materials for the children.  Interactive learning environment with hands-on tasks designed for children - Google20  Google has developed an initiative called ‘Interland’ in which children can access interactive  videos, games and materials to become ‘internet awesome’ and learn to use the internet safely.  ‘Interland’ includes hands-on practice with four challenging games (namely ‘Share with care’,  ‘Don’t fall for fake’ and ‘Secure your secrets’), and helps children learn how to act responsibly in  unsafe situations. The interactivity of the platform provides a unique learning environment  specifically designed for children, who may find it easier to learn new things through interactive  formats.  2.2 CASE STUDIES FROM THE BANKING SECTOR  Automatic tracking, alerting and blocking of suspicious activities – Santander Bank21  In the finance sector, banks must send alerts to users if their system detects anything  suspicious. For example, the Santander Bank in Spain uses a behavioural biometrics solution  called “Trusteer”, which develops a customer profile based on normal user activity. It can detect  abnormal activity and continuously authenticates the user. When the solution does detect  abnormal behaviour, they alert the customer and block unauthorized transactions before they  cause damage.  Obligatory guidelines on source authenticity and potential precautious actions  Banks are required to include cybersecurity awareness material on their websites, as their  customers must be careful with checking the authenticity of sources that are asking for account  details and take precautions while using the bank’s websites22.  BNP Paribas has a dedicated subpage for awareness raising, on which the internet banking  risks, the bank’s security practices and client recommendations are listed 23.  20 https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us/  21 https://www.ibm.com/blogs/client-voices/outsmart-bank-fraud-real-time-cybersecurity/  22 https://www.byteacademy.co/blog/banking-cyber-security  23 https://chile.bnpparibas.com/en/__trashed/  https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us/ https://www.ibm.com/blogs/client-voices/outsmart-bank-fraud-real-time-cybersecurity/ https://chile.bnpparibas.com/en/__trashed/  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  13  Figure 3: Bank Millennium’s warnings and advice usually for social engineering  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  14  On its internet banking log-on page 24, Bank Millennium also provides information on the most  common vulnerabilities, threats and mitigation measures. Apart from providing advice on good  login practices, Bank Millennium’s warnings and advice usually relate to social engineering  tactics25 – for example: fake authorisation SMS, fake ads on social networks and fake emails  claiming to originate from Bank Millennium. In addition, Bank Millennium advises on the security  measures it has in place to minimise cybersecurity risks.  Alior Bank, with its own Computer Emergency Response Team (‘CERT’)26, also provides advice  on its website regarding the most common threats and vulnerabilities, and how to minimise  them. It also provides descriptions of, and guidelines on security measures the bank provides,  such as multi-factor authorisation.  Alior’s advice goes beyond its banking services. The bank provides general cyber-hygiene  awareness-raising on conducting oneself online – for example, on offers that seem ‘too good to  be true’27.  We note that Alior Bank has a series of short educational videos28 in which it provides simple  language information on selected threats and vulnerabilities, for example fake banking websites,  SpyWindow, applications coming from unknown third parties or security of connected devices.  Figure 4: Alior Bank’s SpyWindow  Information on the “SIM Swapping” fraud – Alpha Bank Greece29  Alpha bank Greece has developed a web page including information on the SIM Swapping  fraud. On this page, the bank explains how the fraud works, and includes advice for the clients  to self-protect. On its website, the bank also lists measures it takes to mitigate the risk of SIM  swapping frauds.  24 https://www.bankmillennium.pl/en/log-in  25 https://www.bankmillennium.pl/en/electronic-banking/internet-banking-security  26 https://www.aliorbank.pl/dodatkowe-informacje/bezpieczenstwo/cert-alior.html  27 https://www.aliorbank.pl/dodatkowe-informacje/bezpieczenstwo/bezpieczenstwo-edukacja.html  28 https://www.aliorbank.pl/dodatkowe-informacje/bezpieczenstwo/bezpieczenstwo-filmy-edukacyjne.html  29 https://www.alpha.gr/en/retail/support-center/security/apati-sim-swapping  https://www.alpha.gr/en/retail/support-center/security/apati-sim-swapping https://www.bankmillennium.pl/en/log-in https://www.bankmillennium.pl/en/electronic-banking/internet-banking-security https://www.aliorbank.pl/dodatkowe-informacje/bezpieczenstwo/cert-alior.html https://www.aliorbank.pl/dodatkowe-informacje/bezpieczenstwo/bezpieczenstwo-edukacja.html https://www.aliorbank.pl/dodatkowe-informacje/bezpieczenstwo/bezpieczenstwo-filmy-edukacyjne.html https://www.alpha.gr/en/retail/support-center/security/apati-sim-swapping  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  15  Cybersecurity-related advice to both B2C30 and B2B31 segments - National Westminster  Bank (NatWest)  National Westminster Bank (NatWest) provides cybersecurity-related advice to both B2C32 and  B2B33 segments. In the latter case, information related to preventive and mitigative measures is  further divided based on the size of the business.  For example, in the B2C part of its website, NatWest advises on some of the latest types of  fraud (such as delivery and cryptocurrency scams), the steps customers can take when they  feel they may have become a victim of one, and the channels they can use to contact NatWest.  Specifically, NatWest, several other banks, and telecommunications companies in the United  Kingdom are operating a pilot scheme offering customers one specific number they can call  regardless of which bank they do business with – similar to calling the police – if they have  reasons to believe they are at risk of fraud34.  30 https://www.natwest.com/fraud-and-security.html.  31 https://www.natwest.com/business/security.html.  32 https://www.natwest.com/fraud-and-security.html.  33 https://www.natwest.com/business/security.html.  34 https://stopscamsuk.org.uk/159 .  https://www.natwest.com/fraud-and-security.html https://www.natwest.com/business/security.html https://www.natwest.com/fraud-and-security.html https://www.natwest.com/business/security.html https://stopscamsuk.org.uk/159  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  16  3. STOCK TAKING OF  CURRENT PRACTICES  In this section, we look at current good practices in the industry, using data from the online  survey and the in-depth interviews.  We asked industry experts detailed questions about the kind of outreach they perform now. We  used the following structure for this survey:  1. General approach: What is the general approach to user outreach?  2. Triggers for outreach: Which factors and circumstances trigger an outreach to  customers?  3. Content of the communication: What information is shared with the customers?  4. Target audience: What is the target audience of the outreach?  5. Communication channels and frequency: What are the channels used for the  outreach?  6. Measuring effectiveness: How is the effectiveness of the outreach measured?  3.1 GENERAL APPROACH  The overall strategy for user  outreach needs to take into account the general  cybersecurity strategy of the provider, as well as its communication strategy:  ● Provider’s cybersecurity strategy - What are the provider’s high-level plans to build  resilience to threats and ensure its users (natural persons and businesses) benefit  from trustworthy services?  ● Provider’s communication strategy - How should the company communicate about  a threat? How – in what language and style – should the message be formulated?  What channels should be used in specific cases? How can the effects of this  communication be measured?  Figure 5: Connection between communication and security strategy  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  17  When reaching out to their customers, providers of electronic communications and services  mix two approaches:  • Targeted communications about specific security threats  • General awareness raising activities about potential security threats  Figure 6: Two general types of user outreach about security threats  Most providers carry out user outreach only when customers can actually take preventive or  mitigative measures. Based on the surveys and the interview responses, providers appear to be  mindful of the risk of information overload.  Figure 7: Survey responses on when electronic communications providers reach out to users  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  18  Providers reach out about malicious actions (potential security threats) and system failures, but  rarely about natural phenomena. See the diagram below.  Figure 8: Survey responses: Threats users are informed about  The main reported goal for the providers in their user outreach is to increase user awareness  about cybersecurity threats. Other aspects, such as brand protection, reportedly do not play an  important role.  3.3 CONTENT OF THE COMMUNICATION  The content of the outreach is often adjusted to the knowledge and competency level of the  users, with focus on sending a clear message. Cybersecurity is a challenging topic and, if  messages are not specific and sufficiently understandable, they are less effective.  Communication about specific threats often includes facts about the nature of the threat,  potential impact, steps that have been taken by the provider so far, etc. The most frequent  topics are:  • phishing e-mails,  • data breaches,  • system failures or  • denial-of-service attacks (DoS).  The majority of experts agree that besides the preventive and/or mitigative measures users may  take, they should also be informed about the threats themselves. Incorporating information on  examples of specific threats in the communication, supports its effectiveness. Some providers  provide detailed, lifelike examples of threats.  3.4 TARGET AUDIENCE  When reaching out to users about security threats, electronic communications providers  generally target those who are directly affected by the threat.  Providers do not segment their customers in groups (for example based on age, etc.). The more  the communication is targeted and specific, the more likely it is to trigger action by the customer.  Communication with the business segment is different. In this segment, outreach goes to the  corporate account and the procedures are integrated in standard IT processes, as part of  technical support. The communication is typically more technical and more strictly monitored, for  example, by ticketing systems.  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  19  3.5 COMMUNICATION CHANNELS USED  Providers use different communication channels, depending on the type of outreach. See the  chart below – showing survey responses from experts working in the sector.  Figure 9: Survey responses: channels used for communication about threats  Social media posts may reach a wider audience. However, if we were to take the number of  ‘likes’, comments and shares as the indication of their effectiveness, it would often appear to be  limited.  In general, it would appear that number-independent interpersonal communication service  providers (NI-ICS or OTT providers), such as WhatsApp and Facebook generate more impact  with outreach using their social media than traditional telecom providers.  Providers often also use their own website for informing customers about threats. Typically, the  messages can be found on the home page to ensure that customers can easily find these  warnings.  Direct communication, such as emails or SMS, appears to be more effective. Mass  communication, such as press releases and social media posts, reach large groups, but are not  as effective as direct communication.  Electronic communications providers detect a significant number of threats on a daily basis.  Communicating every single threat would be ineffective, so in most cases providers only approach  their users in high-risk cases, in order to increase the chances of grabbing their users’ attention.  In case an action is  required from the  users: direct  channels are the  most commonly  used.  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  20  3.6 MEASURING EFFECTIVENESS  Most providers do not measure the effectiveness of their outreach about threats.  However, several providers plan to implement such measurements. The providers who do  measure the effectiveness of their communication to users regarding security threats, mostly  focus on monitoring whether the target audience has been reached properly and the requested  actions have been implemented by the users.  Figure 10: Survey responses: Measurement of the effectiveness of communication to users  regarding security threats  The following KPIs are monitored most frequently:  ● Delivery rate of emails: The percentage of emails that were actually delivered to  recipients' inboxes, calculated by subtracting hard and soft bounces from the gross  number of emails sent, then dividing that number by gross emails sent,  ● First call resolution rate: no repeat calls or contacts are required to follow-up on the  initial call, and  ● Click through rate: the ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total  users who view a page, email, or advertisement hosting that link.  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  21  4. OUTREACH FRAMEWORK  Following a review of the current industry practices and considering the requirements of Article  40, par. 3 of the EECC, in this section, we provide three high-level steps that can be followed by  electronic communications providers for notifying threats to their users.  Our framework consists  of a decision point (Trigger- whether to proceed with user outreach) and two factors for  consideration that will shape the outreach (Communication and Evaluation).  In the end of this section, the steps are included in a checklist that can be used by the provider  to structure the information of a specific outreach campaign and explain the reasoning behind it  on the basis of Article 40, par. 3 of the EECC.  4.1 FRAMEWORK  Article 40, par. 3 of the EECC includes several factors/circumstances having to do with  communication to users about cybersecurity threats and the kind of outreach action required. It  provides that if a threat is particular (i.e. it is not a general or common threat) or significant  (i.e. it poses a risk to the customer), providers should communicate possible protective  measures or remedies to all users that are potentially affected and if appropriate (i.e. if  such communication does not result in increasing the overall level of risk), inform customers  of the threat itself.  We outline these factors/circumstances and actions in the flow-chart below.  Figure 11: Framework for user outreach about cybersecurity threats  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  22  We go over the three steps in more detail and provide guiding questions.  4.2 TRIGGER  When a new threat is found, an assessment should be made on a case-by-case basis to decide  if outreach is needed, and to ensure that there is added value in the outreach. It is important to  strike a balance between the communication objectives and the risk of ‘customer fatigue’. If  providers send messages too often, customers may start to ignore them.  Questions to ask:  ● Is it a particular threat? Or is it a more general and common threat?  ● Is it a significant threat?  ● What is the potential impact of the threat for the customers?  ● What is the likelihood that the threat materializes?  ● Does the security threat affect a particular component of the network, a particular  service, or transmitted, stored or processed data?  ● Would communication lead to unnecessary loss of trust or fatigue?  ● Can users take measures to mitigate/prevent the threat?  ● Is it appropriate to communicate about the threat itself? Would such communication  not result in additional (potentially significant) risks?  4.3 COMMUNICATION  Communication about a specific threat should include description of the threat and well-defined  instructions for threat mitigation or prevention. Simple messages with practical information are  most effective in reaching the target audience. The following questions are important to answer:  • Who is targeted and affected by this threat?  • What is the best channel for reaching out to this group of customers?  • Is a specific action required from the customer? If so, direct channels could work best.  • Is it appropriate to use multiple channels and messages?  • Could a simplified explanation/message be provided for non-expert users?  • Will there be a separate message and channel for the B2B segment?  • Is it appropriate to inform the customers about the threat itself? Would such  communication not result in additional (potentially significant) risks?  4.4 EVALUATION  Evaluating the outreach about threats is important, but it is not always easy to define the right  parameters. The parameters should be defined on a case-by-case basis.  • What parameters and KPIs can be used to evaluate if the outreach/communication  reached all the targeted users?  • What parameters and KPIs can be used to evaluate if the users took the required  actions (such as a password change)?  • What parameters and KPIs can be used to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the  outreach (such as a decrease in the number of infected smartphones)?  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  23  4.5 CHECKLIST  In this section, we provide a basic checklist that can help in structuring the information and  explaining the reasoning behind carrying out user outreach.

CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  24  4.6 ISSUES/CHALLENGES  Warning about cyber threats, even following the framework described in the previous  paragraphs is not an easy task.  It has to be done carefully, taking into account several issues  and challenges that could interfere with the effectiveness of the communication.  • There is a risk of causing fatigue:  Warning toο often about cyber threats could be  counter-productive, because users could start downplaying or even ignoring the  warnings in the long run. Likewise, there may be limited utility in warning about a  general threat when there is very little the users can do or are likely to do about it. On  the other hand, warning a customer about a particular and imminent yet addressable  threat is more likely to generate tangible results. and prevent the threat from turning  into a security incident.  • There is a risk of increasing the likelihood of fraud: Choosing the right channel and  method for contacting the users is important. Very frequent and badly designed  warnings could result in the users finding it difficult to distinguish them from fraudulent  messages. As a result, in some cases, such warnings could actually increase the  likelihood of fraud. Often, cyber-attacks start with an SMS message or email containing  an alarming text and a call for urgent action. For example, so-called ‘helpdesk scams’  warn the user about an infected PC asking them to contact customer support and  install ‘cleaning’ software, including links and contact information that lead him to the  fraudster instead.  • Outreach does not replace other actions: Outreach to customers should be seen as  a complementary measure and should not replace other actions by the authorities or  the providers – specifically, applying the necessary preventative or mitigative technical  measures. Obviously, the users receiving the communication often do not have the  time and/or the know-how to deal with technical issues. In general, it is not a proposed  to rely on communication alone as a mitigative measure.  For example, in the case of the Flubot malware, in some country’s providers started to  block certain SMS messages to avoid infection, which could be much more efficient  than just warning the customers about the malware.  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  25  5. CONCLUSIONS  The new EU telecom security legislation, the EECC, requires providers of public electronic  communications networks or services, to notify their users in the case of a particular and  significant threat to these networks or services. Warning customers in case of cyber threats is  also industry good practice.  However, warning about cyber threats is not a straightforward activity and has to be done  carefully. In this paper we proposed a checklist that could help providers and authorities  determine whether to carry out outreach activities and how, and we outlined several  issues/challenges.  In the NIS2 proposal, the Commission extends the approach of user outreach about  cybersecurity threats to other critical sectors. The proposed simple framework is sector- agnostic, could be adjusted and reused in other policy areas, so that users are informed  effectively and in a timely manner about cyber threats and possible preventative or mitigative  measures.  Collaboration and knowledge sharing between national authorities and electronic  communications providers in the case of specific and important threats is very important. It  could promote coordination also with other providers and other governmental entities, such as  the national CSIRTs and lead to successful threat mitigation.  For instance, AGCOM35, the national regulatory Authority of Italy led a trial involving the Bank of  Italy, the Italian Data Protection Authority, the Ministry of Economic Development, Police and  Financial Police, Banks, operators that offer messaging services to the banks and MNOs. The  trial involves MNOs informing banks of the latest SIM swap, either through the subscriber’s  IMSI, hashed IMSI, or sending time information of the latest SIM swap.  In the case of the Flubot malware, the Belgian Institute for Postal Services and  Telecommunications had a discussion with the electronic communication providers on how to  respond in a coordinated way. The Authority supported the electronic communication providers  by creating a forum for discussing and sharing good practices, filter rules and suspicious links.  They agreed on how the electronic communication providers should reach out to their users and  what measures they could take (blocking URLs and outgoing traffic/calls, and asking customers  to factory reset their devices).  Finally, it is important to note that outreach to customers should be seen as a complementary  measure and should not replace other actions by the authorities or the providers - specifically,  applying the necessary mitigation and/or preventive technical measures.  35 https://www.agcom.it/  https://www.agcom.it/  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  26  ANNEX: EXAMPLES  A.1 WARNING USERS ABOUT FLUBOT SCAM MESSAGES  FluBot is an Android malware that is used by cyber attackers to steal passwords, online account  login information, personal details and banking information.

FluBot spreads via SMS  messages, and infected smartphones send SMS messages to the contacts listed in the infected  smartphone to try and infect other customers36.  A.2 WARNING CUSTOMERS ABOUT SIM SWAPPING ATTACKS  Fraudulent SIM swapping is a type of fraud in which the attacker takes over a mobile  subscriber’s account by changing affiliation of that account with the original SIM card to a SIM  card under the attacker’s control.  This type of attack takes advantage of the mobile network operator’s ability to quickly and  seamlessly affiliate a mobile telephone number with a different SIM. This ability, usually referred  to as ‘number porting’, is normally used when a subscriber has lost his device, the device has  36 For example, see the news articles at https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/flubot-android-malware- spreading-rapidly-through-europe-may-hit-us-soon  CHECKLIST FOR NOTIFYING CUSTOMERS ABOUT THREATS  THREAT  INFORMATION  Short name Flubot phishing SMS messages in Q1 of 2021  Date 03 March 2021  Description Flubot is a malware that infects smartphones  References https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/flubot-android- malware-spreading-rapidly-through-europe-may-hit-us-soon  Nature of the threat Malicious (malware)  Potential impact Compromised smartphone of the user (Android) and more malicious  SMS messages targeting contacts.  1.

An attacker typically begins a SIM swapping attack by gathering personal details about the  targeted subscriber, for example through social engineering, phishing, malware, exploiting  information from data breaches, or by doing research on social media. Once an attacker has  obtained enough details to convincingly impersonate the targeted subscriber, he may be able to  convince the MNO to port the subscriber's mobile number to a new SIM card under the  attacker’s control.  Should this initial part of the attack be successful, the genuine subscriber’s SIM card loses  connection to the network. This will enable the attacker to receive all the SMS and voice traffic  intended for the targeted subscriber. This, in turn, will enable him to undermine or indeed exploit  SMS-based security measures, as SMS-based authentication is often used in online banking  portals, as well as for social media and email accounts (e.g., one-time passwords sent via text  or telephone calls).

The cyber-attack exploited WhatsApp’s video calling system in order to send malware to the  mobile devices of a number of WhatsApp users.  NSO spyware was used to exploit a vulnerability in the app to target more than 1,400 people  between approximately April 2019 and May 2019. One hundred of those targeted were human  rights defenders according to WhatsApp, in countries around the world. The vulnerability, first  published about in May, allowed attackers to install spyware by calling the target using  WhatsApp.  CHECKLIST FOR NOTIFYING CUSTOMERS ABOUT THREATS  THREAT  INFORMATION  Short name WhatsApp hack  Date June 2019  Description  More than 1,400 WhatsApp users were targeted by NSO technology in  a two-week period in May 2019.

Warning  customers2 regarding cyber threats is also industry good practice. Here are some recent  examples:  • In 2020, Google warned 40,000 customers that it had detected activity from nation- state sponsored cyber-attackers against customer accounts3.  • In 2019, WhatsApp detected attacks targeting around 1,400 users and sent each of  them a warning about this threat4.  • In 2020, T-Mobile warned its users to be on alert, following an increase in SIM  swapping attacks5.  • In 2021, Vodafone published a warning about the Flubot malware on its website,  warning customers about it and explaining what they could do if their device was  infected.6  However, warning about cyber threats is not a straightforward activity and has to be done  carefully. Warning toο often about cyber threats could be counter-productive because users  might start downplaying or even ignoring the warnings in the long run. Likewise, there may be  limited utility in warning about a general threat when there is very little customers can or are  likely to do about it. On the other hand, warning a customer about a particular and imminent yet  addressable threat is more likely to generate tangible results. Specifically, it may help the  customer avoid the threat turning into a security incident.  Choosing the right channel and method for contacting users is important. Very frequent and  badly designed warnings could result in users finding it difficult to distinguish them from  fraudulent messages. As a result, in some cases, such warnings could actually lead to  increasing the likelihood of fraud. Often, cyber-attacks start with an SMS message or email  containing an alarming text and a call for urgent action. For example, the so-called ‘helpdesk  scams’ warn the user about an infected PC asking them to contact customer support and install  ‘cleaning’ software, including links and contact information that lead them to the fraudster  instead.  In this paper, we aim to give guidance to national Authorities and providers of electronic  communications networks and services regarding how to strike the right balance and  carry out efficient and effective outreach to users about cyber threats.  In the first part of this report, we present an overview of the state of play by analysing several  examples, case studies and responses from the experts working in the sector. We note that this  overview reflects the situation before the EECC came into effect.  1 Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code, OJ L 321,  17.12.2018, p. 36  2 Art 40(3) of the EECC refers to ‘users’. However, for the purposes of this report, and given that not all practices described here may fall under Art 40(3), we will use the  terms ‘customers’, ‘consumers’, ‘users’ and ‘end-users’ interchangeably  3 https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/03/27/hacker-threat-google-confirms-40000-nation-state-cyber-attack-warnings-issued/ .  4 https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/01/whatsapp-hack-is-serious-rights-violation-say-alleged-victims .  5 https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/how-to-fight-account-takeover-fraud  6 https://support.vodafone.co.uk/Flubot/1656667612/What-is-the-Flubot-scam.htm  https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/03/27/hacker-threat-google-confirms-40000-nation-state-cyber-attack-warnings-issued/ https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/01/whatsapp-hack-is-serious-rights-violation-say-alleged-victims https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/how-to-fight-account-takeover-fraud https://support.vodafone.co.uk/Flubot/1656667612/What-is-the-Flubot-scam.htm  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  6  In the second part of this report, we provide a framework, a checklist, for determining whether to  carry out outreach activities and how.  The checklist has three steps:  1. Trigger: Determine if outreach about a potential threat is needed.  2. Communication: Determine the right channel, and the right message.  3. Evaluation: Define the parameters for measuring the effectiveness of the outreach.  Figure 1: Checklist to determine whether to carry out outreach activities and how  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  7  In the Annex we fill in this checklist for a few well-known cases.  We conclude this paper with general observations:  •  Monitoring and notifying about potential threats is a new paradigm: The EECC  requires providers of electronic communications networks and services to monitor  potential threats before they turn into cybersecurity incidents. In the proposal for the  revised Network and Information Systems Directive7 (the ‘NIS2 proposal’), the  Commission extends this approach to other sectors. While there are benefits in  communicating warnings about threats before they become cybersecurity incidents,  authorities and providers should collaborate to strike the right balance about which  threats should be in the scope of these warnings. The proposed simple framework is  sector-agnostic, and could be adjusted and reused in other policy areas, so that users  are informed about cyber threats and possible preventative or mitigative measures  effectively and in a timely manner.  •  Engage and collaborate with national authorities about outreach: The national  authorities we interviewed suggested that collaboration and knowledge sharing are  good between electronic communications providers and authorities. Providers could  engage them before reaching out to the customers. The national authorities could then  also coordinate with other providers, other governmental entities, such as the national  CSIRTs, and even coordinate with authorities in other sectors to address the problem.  •  Outreach does not replace other actions: Finally, outreach to customers should be  seen as a complementary measure and should not replace other actions by the  authorities or the providers - specifically, applying the necessary preventive or  mitigative technical measures. This is because the users receiving the communication  often do not have the time and/or the know-how to deal with technical issues.  7 Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2020 on measures for a high  common level of cybersecurity across the Union, repealing Directive (EU) 2016/1148, COM(2020) 823 final, 16.12.2020.  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  8  1. INTRODUCTION  EECC, the EU’s new telecom security legislation, requires providers of public electronic  communications networks or services to notify their users of a particular and significant threat.  Warning customers regarding cyber threats is also industry good practice.  In this paper we provide guidance on:  • Which cyber threats should trigger outreach to the customers using the networks and  services?  • How to communicate about threats, which channels to use, which messages to convey?  • How to evaluate the effectiveness of the outreach?  1.1 TARGET AUDIENCE  This paper provides technical guidance to national Authorities supervising the implementation of  Article 40, par. 3 of the EECC, and it may also be useful for experts working in the EU telecom  sector.  1.2 POLICY CONTEXT  EECC Article 40 par. 3 requires providers of communications networks and services in the EU  to notify users of particular and significant threats about the measures or remedies they can  take to mitigate these threats, to protect the security of their communications. Where relevant,  providers should also notify the users about the threat itself. We quote the legislative text in full:  \"Member States shall ensure that in the case of a particular and significant threat of a security  incident in public electronic communications networks or publicly available electronic  communications services, providers of such networks or services shall inform their users potentially  affected by such a threat of any possible protective measures or remedies which can be taken by  the users. Where appropriate, providers shall also inform their users of the threat itself.\"  In the following paragraphs, we give guidance about how this step can be implemented  effectively and efficiently in practice.  Note that the EU Member States are in the process of transposing the EECC into national  legislation.  Note also that the European Commission recently made a proposal for a reviewed NIS  Directive, the NIS2 proposal, which substitutes Article 40 of the EECC. However, current NIS2  proposal also contains the same provision about warning/notifying users of the service, which  means that there would be no substantial change in this regard.  1.3 METHODOLOGY  We developed this guidance by looking into the following research questions:  ● How do providers currently inform users about threats and mitigative measures and how  is the effectiveness of this outreach measured?  ● How do operators in other critical sectors such as banking and utilities reach out to their  customers?  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  9  We collected information in three ways:  • Desk research: We have analysed publicly available sources and specialised literature  on the status, practices and mechanisms in place related to consumer outreach about  cybersecurity threats. The processed materials served as the basis for the online  survey and the interviews.  • Online questionnaire, targeting national authorities and telecom providers in the  EU: In total, 49 stakeholders answered the online questionnaire, from both private and  public sectors at EU and national levels.  • Interviews with stakeholders: We held 15 expert interviews to get a better  understanding of the current industry practices when it comes to reaching out to users  about cybersecurity threats.  Figure 2: Overview of the research participation  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  10  2. CASE STUDIES  In this section, we provide examples of situations in which providers reach out to customers  about cybersecurity threats.  Note that these case studies are indicative of the existing good practices in the industry, before  transposition of the EECC into national legislation.  2.1 CASE STUDIES FROM THE TELECOM SECTOR  General awareness raising – Telenor8  Telenor has an awareness programme, including 10 ‘digital lessons’ introducing security  awareness for typical cybersecurity threats, such as ransomware, phishing and malicious links,  or fake news and false facts. The digital lessons are available for citizens and enterprises.  Videos with lifelike examples of threats – Telefónica 9  Telefónica provides detailed descriptions of currently trending potential threats in posts on social  media, which includes video explanations of threats through lifelike examples. For instance, in a  video-post in May 2021, Telefónica provided information  on the characteristics, consequences  and preventive measures of ‘smishing’, a variant of phishing, through SMS.  Fake email examples - Deutsche Telekom 10  On its website, Deutsche Telecom publishes information about ongoing and past incidents  sorted by date, including the characteristics of the incident, the measures that have been taken  to address it, and suggestions for users on how to take preventive or mitigating measures.  For example, on 19 May 2021, Deutsche Telekom published a description of fake emails  allegedly sent by Deutsche Bank, Sparkasse and Amazon, which included a description of the  characteristics of such messages (e.g. misspellings, strange email address), the tricks for  stealing log-in data (e.g. mandatory updates, user advantages available on a link), the  consequences of falling victim to those emails, as well as the mitigation steps customers could  take (e.g. call customer service).  FluBot warning - Vodafone Greece 11  Vodafone Greece maintains a webpage about the FluBot mobile phone malware, where users  can find detailed information about the threat, e.g. a description of the fraud, protecting  measures and a comprehensive list of steps a user can take to find out if he has been affected.  8 https://www.telenor.com/get-free-access-to-online-security-awareness-program/  9  https://m.facebook.com/watch/?v=292264332511439&_rdr  10 www.telekom.de/hilfe/festnetz-internet-tv/sicherheit/sicherheitsmeldungen?samChecked=true  11 https://support.vodafone.co.uk/Flubot/1656667612/What-is-the-Flubot-scam.htm  https://www.telenor.com/get-free-access-to-online-security-awareness-program/ https://m.facebook.com/watch/?v=292264332511439&_rdr http://www.telekom.de/hilfe/festnetz-internet-tv/sicherheit/sicherheitsmeldungen?samChecked=true https://support.vodafone.co.uk/Flubot/1656667612/What-is-the-Flubot-scam.htm  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  11  FluBot warning - Vodafone UK 12  Vodafone UK provides a detailed description of current threats on Twitter, e.g. a description of  the FluBot fraud. The tweet consists of three steps, which should be taken by the users to avoid  the fraud.  Detailed incident communication, including severity scores and steps taken – Zoom 13  Zoom provides descriptions of vulnerabilities and incidents in its ‘Security Bulletin’. This bulletin  entails not only descriptions of the incidents dating back several years, but also assigns a score  to identify their severity based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)14.  Furthermore, it includes descriptions of measures that have been taken to mitigate the  vulnerabilities. For example, on 26 March 2021, Zoom posted the details of a screen-sharing  vulnerability with a CVSS score of 5.7 (medium severity), a detailed description of the  consequences of using screen sharing (screen sharing users may be seen by other meeting  participants for a brief moment), all the products affected and the steps Zoom had taken to  address it.  Belgian Anti-Phishing Shield15 - Proximus  The campaign aims at reducing active botnet participation from user devices. The customers  are warned when they are about to access a malicious website following a phishing attack. The  initiative does not only notify users of potential threats, but also navigates them to an  awareness-raising site where they are walked through the steps for cleaning their device. The  step-by-step instructions and immediate alerts make the process more user-friendly and easy- to-understand.  Countrywide awareness raising campaigns with provider participation - T-Mobile  Netherlands  T-Mobile participates in countrywide awareness-raising campaigns about potential cybersecurity  threats and mitigation measures, where the participating providers share their industry  knowledge. These awareness-raising campaigns are funded by the Dutch Government and  organised by the Dutch Ministry of Justice and Security.  Simple targeted awareness raising campaign – SSF Cybersecurity  The Swedish Internet Foundation conducted research in connection with leaked passwords and  the Swedish internet security organisation (Stoldskyddsforeningen - SSF) turned the results of  this survey into a nationwide awareness raising campaign with easy-to-understand messages.  The most common leaked passwords were presented on eye-catching billboards and bus stop  advertisements.  A variety of dedicated educational material for children, parents and teachers - Liberty  Global16171819  12 https://support.vodafone.co.uk/Flubot/1656667612/What-is-the-Flubot-scam.htm  13 https://explore.zoom.us/en/trust/security/security-bulletin/  14 https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss  15 https://baps.ccb.belgium.be/en/belgian-anti-phishing-shield Belgian Anti Phishing Shield  16 https://www.virginmedia.com/help/security-hub;  17 https://www.virginmedia.ie/customer-support/support-by-products/broadband/online-security-safety/  18 https://www.sunrise.ch/en/residential/mobile/freedom/options/surf-protect.html;  19 https://www2.telenet.be/fr/serviceclient/signaler-un-abus-dinternet/  https://support.vodafone.co.uk/Flubot/1656667612/What-is-the-Flubot-scam.htm https://explore.zoom.us/en/trust/security/security-bulletin/ https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss https://baps.ccb.belgium.be/en/belgian-anti-phishing-shield https://www.virginmedia.com/help/security-hub https://www.virginmedia.ie/customer-support/support-by-products/broadband/online-security-safety/ https://www.sunrise.ch/en/residential/mobile/freedom/options/surf-protect.html https://www2.telenet.be/fr/serviceclient/signaler-un-abus-dinternet/  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  12  Via its subsidiaries, Liberty Global provides educational material on online safety dedicated to  different age groups, parents and teachers. The material is provided in easy-to-understand  formats, games, workbooks and readings for the ages of 4 to 16 in more than 10 languages.  For example, the workbook for children from 13-16 years incorporates decision-making steps in  real-life examples, such as what information we can share on the internet and with whom. This  segmentation of the young generations allows parents and teachers to provide access to  suitable learning materials for the children.  Interactive learning environment with hands-on tasks designed for children - Google20  Google has developed an initiative called ‘Interland’ in which children can access interactive  videos, games and materials to become ‘internet awesome’ and learn to use the internet safely.  ‘Interland’ includes hands-on practice with four challenging games (namely ‘Share with care’,  ‘Don’t fall for fake’ and ‘Secure your secrets’), and helps children learn how to act responsibly in  unsafe situations. The interactivity of the platform provides a unique learning environment  specifically designed for children, who may find it easier to learn new things through interactive  formats.  2.2 CASE STUDIES FROM THE BANKING SECTOR  Automatic tracking, alerting and blocking of suspicious activities – Santander Bank21  In the finance sector, banks must send alerts to users if their system detects anything  suspicious. For example, the Santander Bank in Spain uses a behavioural biometrics solution  called “Trusteer”, which develops a customer profile based on normal user activity. It can detect  abnormal activity and continuously authenticates the user. When the solution does detect  abnormal behaviour, they alert the customer and block unauthorized transactions before they  cause damage.  Obligatory guidelines on source authenticity and potential precautious actions  Banks are required to include cybersecurity awareness material on their websites, as their  customers must be careful with checking the authenticity of sources that are asking for account  details and take precautions while using the bank’s websites22.  BNP Paribas has a dedicated subpage for awareness raising, on which the internet banking  risks, the bank’s security practices and client recommendations are listed 23.  20 https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us/  21 https://www.ibm.com/blogs/client-voices/outsmart-bank-fraud-real-time-cybersecurity/  22 https://www.byteacademy.co/blog/banking-cyber-security  23 https://chile.bnpparibas.com/en/__trashed/  https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us/ https://www.ibm.com/blogs/client-voices/outsmart-bank-fraud-real-time-cybersecurity/ https://chile.bnpparibas.com/en/__trashed/  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  13  Figure 3: Bank Millennium’s warnings and advice usually for social engineering  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  14  On its internet banking log-on page 24, Bank Millennium also provides information on the most  common vulnerabilities, threats and mitigation measures. Apart from providing advice on good  login practices, Bank Millennium’s warnings and advice usually relate to social engineering  tactics25 – for example: fake authorisation SMS, fake ads on social networks and fake emails  claiming to originate from Bank Millennium. In addition, Bank Millennium advises on the security  measures it has in place to minimise cybersecurity risks.  Alior Bank, with its own Computer Emergency Response Team (‘CERT’)26, also provides advice  on its website regarding the most common threats and vulnerabilities, and how to minimise  them. It also provides descriptions of, and guidelines on security measures the bank provides,  such as multi-factor authorisation.  Alior’s advice goes beyond its banking services. The bank provides general cyber-hygiene  awareness-raising on conducting oneself online – for example, on offers that seem ‘too good to  be true’27.  We note that Alior Bank has a series of short educational videos28 in which it provides simple  language information on selected threats and vulnerabilities, for example fake banking websites,  SpyWindow, applications coming from unknown third parties or security of connected devices.  Figure 4: Alior Bank’s SpyWindow  Information on the “SIM Swapping” fraud – Alpha Bank Greece29  Alpha bank Greece has developed a web page including information on the SIM Swapping  fraud. On this page, the bank explains how the fraud works, and includes advice for the clients  to self-protect. On its website, the bank also lists measures it takes to mitigate the risk of SIM  swapping frauds.  24 https://www.bankmillennium.pl/en/log-in  25 https://www.bankmillennium.pl/en/electronic-banking/internet-banking-security  26 https://www.aliorbank.pl/dodatkowe-informacje/bezpieczenstwo/cert-alior.html  27 https://www.aliorbank.pl/dodatkowe-informacje/bezpieczenstwo/bezpieczenstwo-edukacja.html  28 https://www.aliorbank.pl/dodatkowe-informacje/bezpieczenstwo/bezpieczenstwo-filmy-edukacyjne.html  29 https://www.alpha.gr/en/retail/support-center/security/apati-sim-swapping  https://www.alpha.gr/en/retail/support-center/security/apati-sim-swapping https://www.bankmillennium.pl/en/log-in https://www.bankmillennium.pl/en/electronic-banking/internet-banking-security https://www.aliorbank.pl/dodatkowe-informacje/bezpieczenstwo/cert-alior.html https://www.aliorbank.pl/dodatkowe-informacje/bezpieczenstwo/bezpieczenstwo-edukacja.html https://www.aliorbank.pl/dodatkowe-informacje/bezpieczenstwo/bezpieczenstwo-filmy-edukacyjne.html https://www.alpha.gr/en/retail/support-center/security/apati-sim-swapping  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  15  Cybersecurity-related advice to both B2C30 and B2B31 segments - National Westminster  Bank (NatWest)  National Westminster Bank (NatWest) provides cybersecurity-related advice to both B2C32 and  B2B33 segments. In the latter case, information related to preventive and mitigative measures is  further divided based on the size of the business.  For example, in the B2C part of its website, NatWest advises on some of the latest types of  fraud (such as delivery and cryptocurrency scams), the steps customers can take when they  feel they may have become a victim of one, and the channels they can use to contact NatWest.  Specifically, NatWest, several other banks, and telecommunications companies in the United  Kingdom are operating a pilot scheme offering customers one specific number they can call  regardless of which bank they do business with – similar to calling the police – if they have  reasons to believe they are at risk of fraud34.  30 https://www.natwest.com/fraud-and-security.html.  31 https://www.natwest.com/business/security.html.  32 https://www.natwest.com/fraud-and-security.html.  33 https://www.natwest.com/business/security.html.  34 https://stopscamsuk.org.uk/159 .  https://www.natwest.com/fraud-and-security.html https://www.natwest.com/business/security.html https://www.natwest.com/fraud-and-security.html https://www.natwest.com/business/security.html https://stopscamsuk.org.uk/159  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  16  3. STOCK TAKING OF  CURRENT PRACTICES  In this section, we look at current good practices in the industry, using data from the online  survey and the in-depth interviews.  We asked industry experts detailed questions about the kind of outreach they perform now. We  used the following structure for this survey:  1. General approach: What is the general approach to user outreach?  2. Triggers for outreach: Which factors and circumstances trigger an outreach to  customers?  3. Content of the communication: What information is shared with the customers?  4. Target audience: What is the target audience of the outreach?  5. Communication channels and frequency: What are the channels used for the  outreach?  6. Measuring effectiveness: How is the effectiveness of the outreach measured?  3.1 GENERAL APPROACH  The overall strategy for user  outreach needs to take into account the general  cybersecurity strategy of the provider, as well as its communication strategy:  ● Provider’s cybersecurity strategy - What are the provider’s high-level plans to build  resilience to threats and ensure its users (natural persons and businesses) benefit  from trustworthy services?  ● Provider’s communication strategy - How should the company communicate about  a threat? How – in what language and style – should the message be formulated?  What channels should be used in specific cases? How can the effects of this  communication be measured?  Figure 5: Connection between communication and security strategy  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  17  When reaching out to their customers, providers of electronic communications and services  mix two approaches:  • Targeted communications about specific security threats  • General awareness raising activities about potential security threats  Figure 6: Two general types of user outreach about security threats  Most providers carry out user outreach only when customers can actually take preventive or  mitigative measures. Based on the surveys and the interview responses, providers appear to be  mindful of the risk of information overload.  Figure 7: Survey responses on when electronic communications providers reach out to users  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  18  Providers reach out about malicious actions (potential security threats) and system failures, but  rarely about natural phenomena. See the diagram below.  Figure 8: Survey responses: Threats users are informed about  The main reported goal for the providers in their user outreach is to increase user awareness  about cybersecurity threats. Other aspects, such as brand protection, reportedly do not play an  important role.  3.3 CONTENT OF THE COMMUNICATION  The content of the outreach is often adjusted to the knowledge and competency level of the  users, with focus on sending a clear message. Cybersecurity is a challenging topic and, if  messages are not specific and sufficiently understandable, they are less effective.  Communication about specific threats often includes facts about the nature of the threat,  potential impact, steps that have been taken by the provider so far, etc. The most frequent  topics are:  • phishing e-mails,  • data breaches,  • system failures or  • denial-of-service attacks (DoS).  The majority of experts agree that besides the preventive and/or mitigative measures users may  take, they should also be informed about the threats themselves. Incorporating information on  examples of specific threats in the communication, supports its effectiveness. Some providers  provide detailed, lifelike examples of threats.  3.4 TARGET AUDIENCE  When reaching out to users about security threats, electronic communications providers  generally target those who are directly affected by the threat.  Providers do not segment their customers in groups (for example based on age, etc.). The more  the communication is targeted and specific, the more likely it is to trigger action by the customer.  Communication with the business segment is different. In this segment, outreach goes to the  corporate account and the procedures are integrated in standard IT processes, as part of  technical support. The communication is typically more technical and more strictly monitored, for  example, by ticketing systems.  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  19  3.5 COMMUNICATION CHANNELS USED  Providers use different communication channels, depending on the type of outreach. See the  chart below – showing survey responses from experts working in the sector.  Figure 9: Survey responses: channels used for communication about threats  Social media posts may reach a wider audience. However, if we were to take the number of  ‘likes’, comments and shares as the indication of their effectiveness, it would often appear to be  limited.  In general, it would appear that number-independent interpersonal communication service  providers (NI-ICS or OTT providers), such as WhatsApp and Facebook generate more impact  with outreach using their social media than traditional telecom providers.  Providers often also use their own website for informing customers about threats. Typically, the  messages can be found on the home page to ensure that customers can easily find these  warnings.  Direct communication, such as emails or SMS, appears to be more effective. Mass  communication, such as press releases and social media posts, reach large groups, but are not  as effective as direct communication.  Electronic communications providers detect a significant number of threats on a daily basis.  Communicating every single threat would be ineffective, so in most cases providers only approach  their users in high-risk cases, in order to increase the chances of grabbing their users’ attention.  In case an action is  required from the  users: direct  channels are the  most commonly  used.  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  20  3.6 MEASURING EFFECTIVENESS  Most providers do not measure the effectiveness of their outreach about threats.  However, several providers plan to implement such measurements. The providers who do  measure the effectiveness of their communication to users regarding security threats, mostly  focus on monitoring whether the target audience has been reached properly and the requested  actions have been implemented by the users.  Figure 10: Survey responses: Measurement of the effectiveness of communication to users  regarding security threats  The following KPIs are monitored most frequently:  ● Delivery rate of emails: The percentage of emails that were actually delivered to  recipients' inboxes, calculated by subtracting hard and soft bounces from the gross  number of emails sent, then dividing that number by gross emails sent,  ● First call resolution rate: no repeat calls or contacts are required to follow-up on the  initial call, and  ● Click through rate: the ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total  users who view a page, email, or advertisement hosting that link.  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  21  4. OUTREACH FRAMEWORK  Following a review of the current industry practices and considering the requirements of Article  40, par. 3 of the EECC, in this section, we provide three high-level steps that can be followed by  electronic communications providers for notifying threats to their users.  Our framework consists  of a decision point (Trigger- whether to proceed with user outreach) and two factors for  consideration that will shape the outreach (Communication and Evaluation).  In the end of this section, the steps are included in a checklist that can be used by the provider  to structure the information of a specific outreach campaign and explain the reasoning behind it  on the basis of Article 40, par. 3 of the EECC.  4.1 FRAMEWORK  Article 40, par. 3 of the EECC includes several factors/circumstances having to do with  communication to users about cybersecurity threats and the kind of outreach action required. It  provides that if a threat is particular (i.e. it is not a general or common threat) or significant  (i.e. it poses a risk to the customer), providers should communicate possible protective  measures or remedies to all users that are potentially affected and if appropriate (i.e. if  such communication does not result in increasing the overall level of risk), inform customers  of the threat itself.  We outline these factors/circumstances and actions in the flow-chart below.  Figure 11: Framework for user outreach about cybersecurity threats  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  22  We go over the three steps in more detail and provide guiding questions.  4.2 TRIGGER  When a new threat is found, an assessment should be made on a case-by-case basis to decide  if outreach is needed, and to ensure that there is added value in the outreach. It is important to  strike a balance between the communication objectives and the risk of ‘customer fatigue’. If  providers send messages too often, customers may start to ignore them.  Questions to ask:  ● Is it a particular threat? Or is it a more general and common threat?  ● Is it a significant threat?  ● What is the potential impact of the threat for the customers?  ● What is the likelihood that the threat materializes?  ● Does the security threat affect a particular component of the network, a particular  service, or transmitted, stored or processed data?  ● Would communication lead to unnecessary loss of trust or fatigue?  ● Can users take measures to mitigate/prevent the threat?  ● Is it appropriate to communicate about the threat itself? Would such communication  not result in additional (potentially significant) risks?  4.3 COMMUNICATION  Communication about a specific threat should include description of the threat and well-defined  instructions for threat mitigation or prevention. Simple messages with practical information are  most effective in reaching the target audience. The following questions are important to answer:  • Who is targeted and affected by this threat?  • What is the best channel for reaching out to this group of customers?  • Is a specific action required from the customer? If so, direct channels could work best.  • Is it appropriate to use multiple channels and messages?  • Could a simplified explanation/message be provided for non-expert users?  • Will there be a separate message and channel for the B2B segment?  • Is it appropriate to inform the customers about the threat itself? Would such  communication not result in additional (potentially significant) risks?  4.4 EVALUATION  Evaluating the outreach about threats is important, but it is not always easy to define the right  parameters. The parameters should be defined on a case-by-case basis.  • What parameters and KPIs can be used to evaluate if the outreach/communication  reached all the targeted users?  • What parameters and KPIs can be used to evaluate if the users took the required  actions (such as a password change)?  • What parameters and KPIs can be used to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the  outreach (such as a decrease in the number of infected smartphones)?  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  23  4.5 CHECKLIST  In this section, we provide a basic checklist that can help in structuring the information and  explaining the reasoning behind carrying out user outreach.  Figure 12: Checklist for notifying customers about threats  CHECKLIST FOR NOTIFYING CUSTOMERS ABOUT THREATS  THREAT  INFORMATION Short name Descriptive name of the threat  Date Date  Description Short description of the threat  References Reference to background information, media reports, etc  Nature of the threat Choose from: System failures, Natural phenomena, Malicious  actions, human errors, third-party failures.  Potential impact Describe the potential impact on the network or service  1. TRIGGER  Particular? Determine if the threat is particular or common/general.  Significant risk? Determine if there is a significant risk: Assess the likelihood  and the potential impact to find the level of risk.  Outreach or not? Yes or no  2. COMMUNICATE  Channel? Choose from: SMS, emails, social media (general or direct),  company’s app, company’s website, other (please specify)  Measures or  remedy?

CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  24  4.6 ISSUES/CHALLENGES  Warning about cyber threats, even following the framework described in the previous  paragraphs is not an easy task.  It has to be done carefully, taking into account several issues  and challenges that could interfere with the effectiveness of the communication.  • There is a risk of causing fatigue:  Warning toο often about cyber threats could be  counter-productive, because users could start downplaying or even ignoring the  warnings in the long run. Likewise, there may be limited utility in warning about a  general threat when there is very little the users can do or are likely to do about it. On  the other hand, warning a customer about a particular and imminent yet addressable  threat is more likely to generate tangible results. and prevent the threat from turning  into a security incident.  • There is a risk of increasing the likelihood of fraud: Choosing the right channel and  method for contacting the users is important. Very frequent and badly designed  warnings could result in the users finding it difficult to distinguish them from fraudulent  messages. As a result, in some cases, such warnings could actually increase the  likelihood of fraud. Often, cyber-attacks start with an SMS message or email containing  an alarming text and a call for urgent action. For example, so-called ‘helpdesk scams’  warn the user about an infected PC asking them to contact customer support and  install ‘cleaning’ software, including links and contact information that lead him to the  fraudster instead.  • Outreach does not replace other actions: Outreach to customers should be seen as  a complementary measure and should not replace other actions by the authorities or  the providers – specifically, applying the necessary preventative or mitigative technical  measures. Obviously, the users receiving the communication often do not have the  time and/or the know-how to deal with technical issues. In general, it is not a proposed  to rely on communication alone as a mitigative measure.  For example, in the case of the Flubot malware, in some country’s providers started to  block certain SMS messages to avoid infection, which could be much more efficient  than just warning the customers about the malware.  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  25  5. CONCLUSIONS  The new EU telecom security legislation, the EECC, requires providers of public electronic  communications networks or services, to notify their users in the case of a particular and  significant threat to these networks or services. Warning customers in case of cyber threats is  also industry good practice.  However, warning about cyber threats is not a straightforward activity and has to be done  carefully. In this paper we proposed a checklist that could help providers and authorities  determine whether to carry out outreach activities and how, and we outlined several  issues/challenges.  In the NIS2 proposal, the Commission extends the approach of user outreach about  cybersecurity threats to other critical sectors. The proposed simple framework is sector- agnostic, could be adjusted and reused in other policy areas, so that users are informed  effectively and in a timely manner about cyber threats and possible preventative or mitigative  measures.  Collaboration and knowledge sharing between national authorities and electronic  communications providers in the case of specific and important threats is very important. It  could promote coordination also with other providers and other governmental entities, such as  the national CSIRTs and lead to successful threat mitigation.  For instance, AGCOM35, the national regulatory Authority of Italy led a trial involving the Bank of  Italy, the Italian Data Protection Authority, the Ministry of Economic Development, Police and  Financial Police, Banks, operators that offer messaging services to the banks and MNOs. The  trial involves MNOs informing banks of the latest SIM swap, either through the subscriber’s  IMSI, hashed IMSI, or sending time information of the latest SIM swap.  In the case of the Flubot malware, the Belgian Institute for Postal Services and  Telecommunications had a discussion with the electronic communication providers on how to  respond in a coordinated way. The Authority supported the electronic communication providers  by creating a forum for discussing and sharing good practices, filter rules and suspicious links.  They agreed on how the electronic communication providers should reach out to their users and  what measures they could take (blocking URLs and outgoing traffic/calls, and asking customers  to factory reset their devices).  Finally, it is important to note that outreach to customers should be seen as a complementary  measure and should not replace other actions by the authorities or the providers - specifically,  applying the necessary mitigation and/or preventive technical measures.  35 https://www.agcom.it/  https://www.agcom.it/  CYBER THREATS OUTREACH IN TELECOM  March 2022  26  ANNEX: EXAMPLES  A.1 WARNING USERS ABOUT FLUBOT SCAM MESSAGES  FluBot is an Android malware that is used by cyber attackers to steal passwords, online account  login information, personal details and banking information. This information is then used to  make payments, take over accounts and perform identity theft. FluBot spreads via SMS  messages, and infected smartphones send SMS messages to the contacts listed in the infected  smartphone to try and infect other customers36.  A.2 WARNING CUSTOMERS ABOUT SIM SWAPPING ATTACKS  Fraudulent SIM swapping is a type of fraud in which the attacker takes over a mobile  subscriber’s account by changing affiliation of that account with the original SIM card to a SIM  card under the attacker’s control.  This type of attack takes advantage of the mobile network operator’s ability to quickly and  seamlessly affiliate a mobile telephone number with a different SIM. This ability, usually referred  to as ‘number porting’, is normally used when a subscriber has lost his device, the device has  36 For example, see the news articles at https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/flubot-android-malware- spreading-rapidly-through-europe-may-hit-us-soon  CHECKLIST FOR NOTIFYING CUSTOMERS ABOUT THREATS  THREAT  INFORMATION  Short name Flubot phishing SMS messages in Q1 of 2021  Date 03 March 2021  Description Flubot is a malware that infects smartphones  References https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/flubot-android- malware-spreading-rapidly-through-europe-may-hit-us-soon  Nature of the threat Malicious (malware)  Potential impact Compromised smartphone of the user (Android) and more malicious  SMS messages targeting contacts.  1.

An attacker typically begins a SIM swapping attack by gathering personal details about the  targeted subscriber, for example through social engineering, phishing, malware, exploiting  information from data breaches, or by doing research on social media. Once an attacker has  obtained enough details to convincingly impersonate the targeted subscriber, he may be able to  convince the MNO to port the subscriber's mobile number to a new SIM card under the  attacker’s control.  Should this initial part of the attack be successful, the genuine subscriber’s SIM card loses  connection to the network. This will enable the attacker to receive all the SMS and voice traffic  intended for the targeted subscriber. This, in turn, will enable him to undermine or indeed exploit  SMS-based security measures, as SMS-based authentication is often used in online banking  portals, as well as for social media and email accounts (e.g., one-time passwords sent via text  or telephone calls).

The cyber-attack exploited WhatsApp’s video calling system in order to send malware to the  mobile devices of a number of WhatsApp users.  NSO spyware was used to exploit a vulnerability in the app to target more than 1,400 people  between approximately April 2019 and May 2019. One hundred of those targeted were human  rights defenders according to WhatsApp, in countries around the world. The vulnerability, first  published about in May, allowed attackers to install spyware by calling the target using  WhatsApp.  CHECKLIST FOR NOTIFYING CUSTOMERS ABOUT THREATS  THREAT  INFORMATION  Short name WhatsApp hack  Date June 2019  Description  More than 1,400 WhatsApp users were targeted by NSO technology in  a two-week period in May 2019.

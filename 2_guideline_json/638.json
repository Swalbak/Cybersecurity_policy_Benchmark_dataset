This change consists of the  deletion of the deliverable D3 “Guidelines on Minimum Security Measures for Trust Service  Providers” of Work package 3.2.  Work Package 3.2 of the ENISA Work Programme 2015 aims to assist the member states of the  European Union (EU) and the European Commission in the implementation of the EU Network and  Information Security (NIS) legislation. More specifically, ENISA continues its efforts to bring  together all relevant stakeholders from member states, including the competent national  regulatory bodies and debate with them on the development of a consistent implementation  framework of article 19 of the eIDAs regulation1 and relevant minimum security measures.  Article 19 (1) of the eIDAS regulation states that qualified and non-qualified trust service providers  shall take appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the  services they provide. To facilitate the implementation of this provision, the Agency, in  collaboration with the European Commission, has established an expert group representing  member states’ bodies. The objective of this group is to assist ENISA with the implementation of  the provisions of article 19 of the eIDAS regulation.  The minutes of the Article 19 expert group meeting dated on 11 May 20152 record the conclusion  that the responsibility to conduct the risk assessment of Trust Service Providers (TSPs)  services,  and, as a result for the security measures, to mitigate these risks, belong exclusively to the TSPs  themselves. In addition, the Meeting stated that initiatives on these issues are in place. For that  reason, work on security measures and risk assessment methodologies should be put on hold.  1 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC  2 May be distributed upon request.

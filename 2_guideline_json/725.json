The most effective of these mitigation strategies are the Essential Eight.  The Essential Eight has been designed to protect Microsoft Windows-based internet-connected networks. While the  principles behind the Essential Eight may be applied to cloud services and enterprise mobility, or other operating  systems, it was not primarily designed for such purposes and alternative mitigation strategies may be more appropriate  to mitigate unique cyber threats to these environments. In such cases, organisations should consider alternative  guidance provided by the ACSC.  The Essential Eight Maturity Model, first published in June 2017 and updated regularly, supports the implementation  of the Essential Eight. It is based on the ACSC’s experience in producing cyber threat intelligence, responding to cyber  security incidents, conducting penetration testing and assisting organisations to implement the Essential Eight.  Implementation  When implementing the Essential Eight, organisations should identify and plan for a target maturity level suitable for  their environment. Organisations should then progressively implement each maturity level until that target is achieved.  As the mitigation strategies that constitute the Essential Eight have been designed to complement each other, and to  provide coverage of various cyber threats, organisations should plan their implementation to achieve the same  maturity level across all eight mitigation strategies before moving onto higher maturity levels.  Organisations should implement the Essential Eight using a risk-based approach. In doing so, organisations should seek  to minimise any exceptions and their scope, for example, by implementing compensating security controls and ensuring  the number of systems or users impacted are minimised. In addition, any exceptions should be documented and  approved through an appropriate process. Subsequently, the need for any exceptions, and associated compensating  security controls, should be monitored and reviewed on a regular basis. Note, the appropriate use of exceptions should  not preclude an organisation from being assessed as meeting the requirements for a given maturity level.  As the Essential Eight outlines a minimum set of preventative measures, organisations need to implement additional  measures to those within this maturity model where it is warranted by their environment. Further, while the Essential  Eight can help to mitigate the majority of cyber threats, it will not mitigate all cyber threats. As such, additional  mitigation strategies and security controls need to be considered, including those from the Strategies to Mitigate  Cyber Security Incidents and the Information Security Manual.  EEsssseennttiiaall  EEiigghhtt  MMaattuurriittyy  MMooddeell  First published: June 2017  Last updated: November 2022  1  Introduction  The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) has developed prioritised mitigation strategies to help cyber security  professionals in all organisations mitigate cyber security incidents caused by various cyber threats. This guidance  addresses targeted cyber intrusions (i.e. those executed by advanced persistent threats such as foreign intelligence  services), ransomware and external adversaries with destructive intent, malicious insiders, ‘business email  compromise’, and industrial control systems.  This guidance is informed by the ACSC’s experience in responding to cyber security incidents, performing vulnerability  assessments and penetration testing Australian government organisations.  Prior to implementing any of the mitigation strategies, organisations need to identify their assets and perform a risk  assessment to identify the level of protection required from various cyber threats. Furthermore, organisations require  motivation to improve their cyber security posture, supportive executives, access to skilled cyber security professionals  and adequate financial resources. Motivators can include a significant cyber security incident, a penetration test,  mandatory data breach reporting, mandatory compliance, and evidence of a lower cyber security posture or higher  threat exposure than previously realised.  The following page provides mitigation strategies and a suggested implementation order for:   targeted cyber intrusions and other external adversaries who steal data   ransomware denying access to data for monetary gain, and external adversaries who destroy data and prevent  computers/networks from functioning   malicious insiders who steal data such as customer details or intellectual property   malicious insiders who destroy data and prevent computers/networks from functioning.  When implementing a mitigation strategy, first implement it for high risk users and computers such as those with  access to important (sensitive or high-availability) data and exposed to untrustworthy internet content, and then  implement it for all other users and computers. Organisations should perform hands-on testing to verify the  effectiveness of their implementation of mitigation strategies.  No set of mitigation strategies is guaranteed to prevent all cyber security incidents. However, properly implementing  the eight mitigation strategies with an ‘essential’ effectiveness rating is so effective at mitigating targeted cyber  intrusions and ransomware, that the ACSC considers these to be the new cyber security baseline for all organisations.  The companion Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents – Mitigation Details publication contains  implementation guidance for the mitigation strategies, as well as guidance to mitigate ‘business email compromise’ and  threats to Industrial Control Systems. Further, the companion Essential Eight Maturity Model publication advises how  to implement mitigation strategies in a phased approach and how to measure the maturity of their implementation.  Finally, the ACSC’s website has supporting guidance in the Information Security Manual, as well as separate guidance  for mitigating denial of service, and securely using cloud computing and enterprise mobility.

The ACSC Annual  Cyber Threat Report 2022 found that the average  cyber security incident costs small businesses  sting in their cyber security. In recognition of  the  increasing prevalence of cloud computing,  the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)  has published the Small Business Cloud Security  Guides. These guides are designed to provide  advice to protect against cyber incidents while  remaining accessible to organisations which  may not have the resources to implement a more  sophisticated strategy.  The ACSC’s Small Business Cloud Security Guides  provide technical examples organisations can  use as a reference point when designing their  own cyber security approach. The examples  demonstrate how the business can securely  configure their Microsoft 365 tenancy.  Why invest in cyber  security? Cybercriminals and state-sponsored actors are  using sophisticated techniques to compromise  Australian organisations. The ACSC responds to  attacks against Australian organisations every  day, with the biggest threats including:  • ransomware  • exploitation of security vulnerabilities  • software supply chain compromises  • business email compromise.  Simply installing the latest technology in your  organisation is not good enough, cyber security  thinking needs to evolve. Failing to invest in your  organisation’s cyber security could lead to costly  attacks, interruptions to operations, loss of data,  reputational damage, legal liabilities and more.  Implementing the Small Business Cloud Security  Guides will help protect your organisation by  making it much harder for cyber incidents to  impact your office productivity capabilities.  ¹www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/reports-and-statistics/acsc-annual-cyber-threat-report-july-2021-june-2022  Small Business: Cloud Security Guides - Executive Overview  |  cyber.gov.au 4  https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/reports-and-statistics/acsc-annual-cyber-threat-report-july-2021-june-2022 https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/reports-and-statistics/acsc-annual-cyber-threat-report-july-2021-june-2022  Case Study  The Federal Court rules on managing cyber security risks.  In 2021, the Federal Court delivered a  landmark ruling that highlights the  obligations organisations hold to manage  their cyber security risks.  The ruling related to an Australian Financial  Services licensee which suffered several cyber  attacks over a six year period. As a result of  these attacks, the Federal Court found that  the organisation had breached its obligations  as an Australian financial services licensee.  In their judgement, the Federal Court noted  a number of inadequate risk management  practices across the organisation’s network.  This included some of its authorised  representatives failing to have up-to-date  anti virus software, system backups, email  filtering or quarantining, and poor password  practices. They were ordered to engage a  cyber security expert to improve their cyber  risk management and pay $750,000 towards  the Australian Securities & Investments  Commission costs.  While this judgment related to obligations  as an Australian financial services licensee,  it should put organisations of all sectors  on notice. Managing cyber risks cannot be  an afterthought or an optional extra. It is  increasingly being recognised as an essential  responsibility of all organisations.  How to use the guides The ACSC’s Small Business Cloud Security Guides  are made up of a series of technical examples  which use strategies aligned with ACSC’s Essential  Eight.² They’re not designed for organisations  looking to meet a specific Essential Eight maturity  level. Instead, they have been designed as an  easy way for organisations to protect against  cyber threats and increase cyber security. These  guides should be used as a reference only.  Organisations should apply appropriate risk  management when implementing the advice,  with consideration for their unique operational  needs and environment.  All organisations should implement cyber security  mitigation strategies that are proportionate  to their risk profile and risk appetite. The Small  Business Cloud Security Guides are a good  starting point for most small and medium sized  Australian organisations that use a Microsoft  365 software as a service environment and have  devices configured with Microsoft Intune. To find  out more about which ACSC guidance is the best  fit for your organisation, read the ACSC Business  Guidance Breakdown. ³  Resourcing  considerations Protecting your organisation from cyber incidents  will require a financial and human resources  investment and should be a priority for all  organisations. Investing in preventative measures  is typically far less expensive than responding to a  cyber security incident.  The Small Business Cyber Security Guides will  require a resourcing commitment from your staff  or IT managed service provider to implement  and maintain. It may be appropriate to train staff  on how to administer your Software as a Service  suite. Many vendors provide free training on how  to use their products.  The ACSC has endeavoured to use low cost or  free solutions in these guides where possible,  however, many security configuration options  are unavailable in entry level Microsoft 365  subscriptions. To follow these guides, and  increase opportunities to protect against cyber  threats, organisations will need a Microsoft 365  Business Premium subscription (or equivalent).  Employees that require administrator roles will  also need an Azure Active Directory Premium  P2 subscription.  ²www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight  3www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/small-business-cyber-security/small-business-cloud-security- guide/small-business-cloud-security-guides-introduction  Small Business: Cloud Security Guides - Executive Overview  |  cyber.gov.au 5  \rhttps://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight \rhttps://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/small-business-cyber-security/small-business-cloud-security-guide/small-business-cloud-security-guides-introduction https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/small-business-cyber-security/small-business-cloud-security-guide/small-business-cloud-security-guides-introduction  The eight mitigation  strategies The Small Business Cloud Security Guides  apply the principles of the Essential Eight. The  Essential Eight are the eight most effective  and highest priority strategies from the ACSC’s  Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents4  to protect against cyber threats. The strategies  are underpinned by the ACSC’s experience in  producing cyber threat intelligence, responding  to cyber security incidents and conducting  penetration testing. Table 1, over the page,  summarises each of the mitigation strategies  including their benefits and costs.  Next steps There are actions your IT team need to take  before your organisation implements the  Small Business Cloud Security Guides. These are  outlined in the introduction to the guide on  cyber.gov.au. After completing these actions,  your IT staff or IT managed service provider will  be ready to review each technical example and  adapt it to your organisation’s needs.  Also consider joining our Partnership Program.  The ACSC Partnership Program enables  Australian organisations and individuals to  engage with the ACSC and fellow partners,  drawing on collective understanding, experience,  skills and capability to lift cyber resilience across  the Australian economy⁵.  4 www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents ⁵ www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/become-acsc-partner  Small Business: Cloud Security Guides - Executive Overview  |  cyber.gov.au 6  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/become-acsc-partner  Table 1 – Mitigation strategies, benefits and costs  Mitigation strategies  Benefits  Impost on organisation  Protect  against  malware  Limit the  extent  of cyber  incidents  Recover  from a  cyber  incident  Application control  Reduces the risk of executing  malicious programs.  √ Users can only install applications that are  deemed secure by Microsoft’s Intelligent  Security Graph.

Passphrases are most effective when they are long, complex, unpredictable and unique.  Introduction Multi-factor authentication (a combination of something that you know, something that you  have or something that you are) is one of the most effective ways to protect against unauthorised  access to valuable information and accounts. However, in cases where multi-factor  authentication is not available, a strong passphrase can often be the only barrier between  adversaries and your valuable information and accounts. Passphrases are most effective when  they are long, unpredictable and unique. By following this guidance, you can create stronger  passphrases and avoid mistakes that adversaries exploit.  Passwords are passé - passphrases are longer and stronger  Passwords are passé. It’s time to use passphrases instead. As we have increased our reliance on  passwords, adversaries have developed increasingly sophisticated ways to crack them. In  attempting to make passwords stronger, we have made them harder for humans to remember,  and easier for machines to crack. Hence, the need for passphrases that are easy for humans to  remember, and harder for machines to crack.  Principles for strong passphrases Whenever you can, use a passphrase instead of a password. By following as many of these  principles as you can, you will know you have created the most secure passphrase possible.

ECSC 2019 29  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  04  Executive Summary  The 5th Edition of the European Cyber Security Challenge, ECSC2018 was hosted in London during 14th to  17th October. The event was organised by the Cyber Security Challenge UK at the Tobacco Dock, an iconic  grade one listed building which has a rich history. The event was hosted together with the job fair Cyber  Re:coded.  Each country was represented at the ECSC final by a team of 10 contestants, comprised of the winners of  the national competition. Half of the team members are within the range of ages of 14-20 years old and half  in the 21-25 range. In total, 200 people (contestants, coaches and judges) representing 17 EU and EFTA  countries (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy,  Liechtenstein, Norway, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, and United Kingdom) competed in the ECSC final in  London. The participants investigated vulnerabilities in web applications, binaries and document files, solved  crypto puzzles and hacked hardware systems. However, technical skills are just one part of the whole story.  Teamwork and presentation skills were also evaluated. The complete skillset which is important for working  in an IT security team, is thus tested. The finalists of ECSC 2018 were the teams from Germany, France and  UK.  ENISA is currently hosting different platforms and performing different activities to support the European  Cyber Security Challenge hosting country and the evolution of the project, this includes among others: ECSC  main website, ECSC planning platform, public affairs strategy, challenges creation, governance framework  of the competition, secretariat support, etc…  In order to ensure appropriate and transparent reporting to the Steering Committee ENISA, the following  key observations were made by independent third-party observers that have attended the ECSC planning  meetings and the actual event. These observations have been produced based on the feedback collected  from participants, members of the ECSC Jury, members of the ECSC Steering Committee, and attendees to  the event. In addition, these observations reflect the feedback provided by organisers and participants  collected by an online evaluation survey:   The venue, accommodation and logistics provided by Cyberchallenge UK has been very well received  by participants. The venue was very well aligned with the theme of the challenge and provided for  adequate facilities to support the event.   The technical infrastructure supporting the challenge has significantly improved as compared to  ECSC2017. The service providers contracted by Cyberchallenge UK delivered a relatively stable,  state-of-the-art and reliable infrastructure. Some opportunities for improvement have been noted,  but overall the user experience was positive. Some infrastructure challenges have affected the  course of specific individual challenges (e.g. King of the hill, Capture The Flag), which is a key lesson  learned to take into account in future editions.   The platform developed by ENISA to support the challenges in the format of contracts was received  well by the participants and organisers as it facilitates a real-time scoreboard that is also accessible  to the public over the ECSC website (www.ecsc.eu).   The Public Affairs activities conducted by the national teams, the organisers and ENISA have gained  significantly in exposure, reach and engagement. To put things in perspective: #ECSC2017 had a total  estimated social media reach of 199 913, compared to 5 062 457 for #ECSC2018.   Exposure towards traditional press and media, as well as potential sponsors, national  representatives, and private entities has significantly increased. ECSC2018 welcomed several  political representatives of EU Member States thereby supporting the objective of bringing  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  05  nationalities together and foster a pan-European spirit in the realm of the European Cyber Security  Challenge.  The 2019 edition of the European Cyber Security Challenge will take place in Bucharest Romania, in October  2019.  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  06  1. Introduction  The growing need for IT security professionals is widely acknowledged at European level. To help mitigate  this shortage of skills, many countries launched national cyber security competitions addressed towards  students, university graduates or even non-ICT professionals with a clear aim:  ‘Identify new and young cyber talents and encourage young people to pursue a career in cyber security.’  The European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC) https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/  leverages on these competitions by adding a pan-European layer. Top cyber talents from each participating  country meet to network and collaborate and finally compete against each other. Contestants are  challenged in solving security related tasks from domains such as web security, mobile security, crypto  puzzles, reverse engineering and forensics and in the process collect points for solving them.  In a nutshell, ECSC is the annual European event that brings together young talent from across Europe to  have fun and compete in cyber security. Its main aim is to highlight the importance of the national  competition.  ECSC Background  The project was initiated under the umbrella of the EU Cyber Security Strategy (Feb 2013):  ‘The European Commission will organise, with the support of ENISA, a cybersecurity Championship in 2014,  where university students will compete in proposing NIS solutions.’  As of 2014, ENISA has been supporting the organisation of the ECSC. ENISA is actively organising the  meetings of the governance structures, supporting the development of the competition rules and games  and it is also part of the ECSC Jury. As of 2016, ENISA is the acting secretariat of the ESCS Steering  Committee.  In 2017, 15 countries attended (Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Greece,  Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Norway, Romania, Spain, Switzerland and United Kingdom). The ECSC2017  took place between the 31st and 2nd November in Malaga, Spain. The winner of the final was Spain.  In the edition of 2018, held during 15-17 October 2018, 200 people (contestants, coaches and judges)  representing 17 EU and EFTA countries (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,  France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Liechtenstein, Norway, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, and United Kingdom)  competed in the ECSC final at London. The participants investigated vulnerabilities in web applications,  binaries and document files, solved crypto puzzles and hack hardware systems. However, technical skills  are just one part of the whole story. As time and resources were limited, teamwork and presentation skills  were also evaluated. The complete skillset which is important for working in an IT security team, is thus  tested. The finalist of ECSC 2018 were the teams from Germany, France and UK. By 2020, ENISA expects to  have more than 25 countries involved in the ECSC.  The 2019 edition of the European Cyber Security Challenge will take place Bucharest Romania, in October  2019.  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  07  ECSC Setup  Each country is represented at the ECSC final by a team of 10 contestants, comprised by the winners of the  national round. Half of them are within the range of ages of 14-20 years old and half in the 21-25 range.  Two preparatory pilot phases of ECSC have been held in 2014 (in Austria) and 2015 (in Switzerland) with  attendance by 3 and 6 countries, respectively.  Since 2015, ENISA is lending its experience and position to  coordinate and organise the ECSC effort to reach its full maturity by 2020.  The activities of the ECSC are supervised by a Steering Committee, composed of representatives of the  attending countries. ENISA facilitates the meetings of this group and provides strategic guidance. The  decision making processes are described in the ECSC Charter, which is approved every year.  ENISA is currently hosting different platforms and performing different activities to support the European  Cyber Security Challenge hosting country and the evolution of the project, this includes among others: the  ECSC main website, the ECSC planning platform, the public affairs strategy, challenges creation, etc…  In addition, ENISA is working closely with the host of each edition, in order to ensure appropriate and  transparent reporting to the Steering Committee.  During the year, two Steering Committee meetings are held prior the execution of the event:   Initial Planning Conference (IPC ) was held in Brussels, 1st of March in DG Connect   Main Planning Conference (MPC), held in Athens (ENISA premises) during 19th-20th June  ENISA organised these preparatory events and was overall responsible for the efficient running of the  project, including meetings minutes and the follow-up of the proposed actions.  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  08  2.

ECSC 2018 hosting country  The 5th Edition of the European Cyber Security Challenge, ECSC2018 was hosted in London during 14th to  17th October. The event was organised by the Cyber Security Challenge UK at the Tobacco Dock, an iconic  grade one listed building which has a rich history. The event was hosted together with the job fair Cyber  Re:coded.  The organization provided different useful information about how to get to the event from the selected  hotel and the different facilities provided during the execution of the competition. Also, different activities  were performed for the participants:   Sunday 14th Oct : Welcome dinner and presentation of the teams   Monday 15th Oct: Dinner in London with some of the teams   Tuesday 16th Oct: ECSC Competition Closing Party at London’s newest rooftop bar   Wednesday 17th Oct: Awards Dinner and Presentations on the River Thames, aboard Riverboat  Figure 2 ECSC 2018 Winning team - Award ceremony  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  10  4. ENISA Contribution to ECSC2018  Steering Committee Management  The activities of the ECSC are supervised by a Steering Committee, made out of representatives of the  attending countries. ENISA facilitates the meetings of this groups and provides strategic guidance. The  decision making processes are described in the ECSC Charter, which is approved every year.  During the preparation of ECSC 2018, ENISA was responsible for the following activities related with the  management of the Steering Committee:   Planning Platform maintenance and update   Mail list management   Organization of the IPC in Brussels   Organization of the MPC in Athens   Hot wash meeting after the execution of the competition in London   Feedback collection: Lessons learnt report and surveys to the participants  Jury Management  A jury body was established during the competition:  A jury member is appointed from each of the  members of the ECSC’s Steering Committee, once this is set, it will resolve any dispute during the  competition.  The following improvements were implemented this year:  1. A “Jury guidelines” document was created, summing up the most important points to take in to  account. The Jury members and captains from all teams could use this document as a reference.  2. Jury meetings were scheduled at regular intervals in order to improve the efficiency of the  competition: Jury members meet at predefined times during the competition to discuss and  resolve complaints and queries received during the period in between two jury meetings. Also, a  framework was created in the case an “extraordinary jury meeting” was necessary for issues that  may affect severely the running of the competition.  3. Creation of a Jury coordinator role:  In charge of acting as a PoC, receiving and collecting complains  from participants, captains and jury members.  4. Definition of a clear workflow in case of complaints. The workflow is depicted in Fig. 3.  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  11  Figure 3 Jury Workflow  In general, during the competition the role of the jury was:   Attend jury meetings   Resolve disputes with impartiality   Attend and evaluate presentations   Attend to any other issue that may need the expertise of the jury.  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  12  Presentation management  For ECSC 21018, ENISA proposed new guidelines and rules for the presentation of the contracts (“ECSC  contract presentations guidelines”). During the event, the teams had the chance to present a contract of  their choice, earning additional cash rewards.  The final grade varied between:   Good ( extra 40% cash reward of the selected contract)   Very good (extra 50% cash reward of the selected contract)   Excellent (extra 60%  cash reward of the selected contract)  All the 17 teams presented during the competition with the following grades:  GRADE NUMBER OF TEAMS  Excellent 13  Very good 3  Good 1  Table 1 Presentation grades  Deployed Platforms  For the planning, testing and execution of the ECSC, ENISA supported the development of the competition  by deploying different platforms:   Planning portal: https://ecsc.enisa.europa.eu.   Test Scoreboard and contracts platform: https://board.ecsc.eu   File Sharing platform (owncloud): Used for information sharing and contingency mechanism:  https://storage.ecsc.eu/   ECSC 2018 Website: Promotion of the event.  Real time scoring information was provided during  the challenge to externals interested parties: https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  13  Scoring Platform (Score board)  In order to manage the scores and the contract resolution, ENISA coordinated the development of a new  game board platform:  Figure 4 Scoreboard and contract management platform  Also, onsite support by the main developer was provided during the challenge.  The code of the platform was released to the community under EUPL licensing and can be found on Github  (https://github.com/enisaeu/ecsc-gameboard). For ECSC 2019 is expected that this platform will be further  improved and many changes requested and identified during the challenge will be implemented.  Competition Challenges  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  14  For ECSC 2018, 36 challenges or “contracts” were provided to participants during the two days of the  competition divided in 110 different tasks, these includes activities involving different skills like Crypto,  forensics, malware and artefacts analysis, reverse engineering, network forensics, hardware, mobile,  steganography, and Capture the flag (CTF) challenges.  Challenges were provided by BT and ENISA. The final selection of challenges was done by the organisers.

The bandstand was set-up by BT and consisted in a physical challenge with 5  different associated tasks which the teams can choose to do but is not compulsory.  1. Bypass electronic access control  2. Disarm an intruder alarm using a number sequence challenge  3. Bypass some combination locks  4. Solve some hidden riddles which will be exposed by use of a UV torch  5. Using teamwork, disarm a device (wire cutting challenge)  This challenge was located just outside the main competition area and was manned by BT personnel.  Figure 5 Bandstand  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  17  Public affairs Strategy  The European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC) Steering Committee decided per ECSC Charter to develop a  Public Affairs Strategy for every edition. The main objective of this Public Affairs strategy is to create,  distribute and manage a coherent information flow to inform relevant audiences and participating  countries about the ECSC final. Moreover, the Strategy provides the input for the Dissemination plan that  ensures coherent and synchronised communication.  These documents will contribute to the maturity enhancement of the European Cyber Security Challenge  and increase brand exposure. This will draw interested parties from the private sector in context of  sponsor opportunities and attract more countries and participants to enrol in future ECSC editions.  The hosting country and ENISA implemented the strategy for the first year and the participants were  provided with an official media pack which included the lines to take, brand identity information and  press releases. In addition, ENISA will provide a Dissemination Plan that facilitates timely and coordinated  implementation of the strategy amongst all participants and ECSC stakeholders.  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  18  Social media impact  Together with the public affair strategy a social media report was created, collecting the reactions during  the event, according to the report, some of the most remarkable facts regarding to social media impact  were the following:   Estimated social media reach over the 5 million   Over 17 thousands direct social media interactions   97,2% of positive mentions.  The complete list of collected indicators is the following:  Figure 6 Social Media Impact  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  19  VIP program support  A program for VIP visits was supported by ECSC 2018 organization. In this context, the following VIP visits  were received during the execution of the competition:   Raffaele Trombetta, Italy's ambassador in the UK   His Excellency Lars Thuesen, Danish Ambassador to the UK   Brigadier Lars Christian Hedemark, Defence Attaché, Danish Embassy UK   Jakob Holm, Press Attaché at the Royal Danish Embassy in the UK   Guillaume POUPARD, Director general ANSSI  International Engagement  The head of the USA cyber challenge, Douglas Logan, attended as observer in order to find synergies for  future collaborations and leverage the event to a more international scale.

Logistics: Aspects of the competition related with venue, catering, hotel, transportation, etc.  5. Side Events: Aspects of the competition related with social events and networking meetings  6. Compliance: Aspects of the competition to be improved related with compliance with laws and  standards  ECSC2018 Lessons Learnt Report  ECSC  Steering  Committee  and Jury  ECSC2018  Feedback  surveys  ECSC2018  Event  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  24  Governance and decision-making  PARAMETER RECOMMENDATION  Roles and  responsibilities   The ECSC project team should consider creating a playbook with pictures of the national  teams (“Who is who”) to be made available to the other ECSC stakeholders digitally and via  hard copies during the event in order to enable the ECSC stakeholders (participants,  facilitators, watch dogs…) to distinguish the team captains and coaches of the national  teams and the ECSC Jury members.   Clearly define and communicate the internal roles (team captains, coaches, ECSC Jury  members, watch dogs…) to the ECSC stakeholders.   Consider creating visual indications for the different roles, for example, by providing  stickers, polos and lanyards in different colours for each role.  Decision- making of the  Steering  Committee  and Jury   Consider foreseeing specific time slots for Jury meetings during the competition.   Capture and document all decisions made during the ECSC Steering Committee and Jury  meetings, including decisions, actions and owners, in a decision-making log.   Track the implementation of decisions made by the ECSC Steering Committee and Jury in a  central register.   Ensure fair and equal representation of the different national teams with equal voting  power in the ECSC Steering Committee and Jury meetings.  Transparency   Communicate all decisions made during the ECSC Steering Committee and Jury meetings in  a transparent manner via official communication channels to the ECSC stakeholders  (participants, organisers, facilitators, watch dogs…).   Avoid any last-minute changes to the ECSC game rules, in order to avoid confusion and  ambiguity within the teams and unfair outcomes during the challenge.   Consider putting in place a screen within the ECSC gaming area via which any relevant  communication towards the ECSC participants about the Jury meetings can be displayed.  Table 5 Governance and decision-making lessons learnt  Public Affairs  PARAMETER RECOMMENDATION  Public  Affairs  Strategy  adoption by  national  teams   Consider incentivising the transposition of the Public Affairs Strategy on a national level.  Improve the communication between the national teams and coordination on social media  in order to ensure an even intenser and more valuable collaboration between the Member  States on approaching social media for ECSC2019.  Table 6 Public affairs  lessons learnt  Challenge  PARAMETER RECOMMENDATION  Design   Consider developing a few real challenges to be tested by the participants in order to assess  whether the level of complexity is adequate to their skill. Request participant’s feedback on  complexity for individual test challenges and take these into account for development of the  final challenges.  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  25   Consult with ECSC alumni and other active CTF players to ensure a level of complexity and  challenge proportionate to the level of skill of participants.   Consider implementing a feature on the platform to report and provide feedback on  challenges from a complexity point of view.  Service  Providers   Fixed position for service provider representative in jury.   Additional HR capacity for service provider for trouble shooting.  Rules   Consider a process for enforcement of rules and define standard consequences based on the  type of violation. For example the use of red and yellow cards could be used by analogy with  football games, where significant violations are penalised by a red card. Consider the  following enforcement scheme:  o Red card. First red card: half hour time-out, second red card: disqualification  o Yellow card. First yellow card: warning, second yellow card: 15 minutes time-out,  third yellow card constitutes first red card.   Consider assigning the role of Referee to an individual that monitors compliance with the  rules. Upon unclarity, the Referee can escalate to the Jury for final decision.  Enforcement   Mandatory communication channels (between coaches and teams, and jury members).   Consider establishing an enforcement scheme that discourages malicious participants to  spoil the fun for others. I.e. consider assessing ethical behaviour and incentivise fairplay. It  is up the Steering Committee to develop and apply these rules.   Consider detailing specific responsibilities for the watchdog function and communicate  clearly their role to all stakeholders, including participants and organisers in order to avoid  confusion about their mandate.   Consider installing a technical monitoring capability that enables identification of technical  rule infringement by participating teams or specific individuals.  Presentations   Reconsider incentives for presentations in order to make them more strategically fitting with  the challenges and encourage participants to do it.   Consider enlarging the driver for presentations. Incentivising presentations by providing  points that will be taken into account for the challenge could be an option, but it has to be  aligned with the overall philosophy of combining soft skills with technical skills.  Platform  Consider implementing access controls to prevent users access the platform before it is  intended to be used.  Infrastructure   Perform adequate capacity testing beforehand (i.e. simulation testing/stress test).   Consider cloud / hybrid setup for hosting the challenge platform -> given high-bandwith  and speed internet uplink.  Complexity   Consider involving ECSC alumni into designing the challenges in order to reflect the groups'  level of expertise.   Consider involving CTF community – that is, actively involving seasoned CTF players into  the process -  in designing challenges.  Scoring   Consider implementing a scoring system that indicates scores for different phases in the  challenge progress (indicate completion of milestones, overall progress for specific  individual challenges, etc.).  Table 7 Challenge  lessons learnt  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  26  Logistics  PARAMETER RECOMMENDATION  Venue   When determining the location of the challenge venue and hotel accommodations, take  into account the distance and transportation options between both places. Ensure that  participants, organisers, facilitators and other relevant ECSC stakeholders can easily reach  the challenge venue under any weather conditions.  Catering   Ensure that sufficient water and food supplies are foreseen at the challenge venue.   Consider foreseeing a variety of meal options (including several vegan/vegetarian meal  options, gluten-free…) for the participants and other ECSC stakeholders during the  challenge.  In-event  communication   Consider putting in place a big, central screen at the challenge venue, which displays all  relevant communication regarding the outcome of the Jury meetings, lunch time, end time  of the competition… towards the ECSC participants and other stakeholders.   Consider establishing a central WhatsApp group or other communication platform for the  ECSC Jury members and organisers before the start of the challenge, in order to make it  possible for the members to communicate during the competition and inform each other  of decisions taken during the Jury meetings.   Consider sharing an updated program schedule with the ECSC participants and other  stakeholder throughout the competition to create the right expectations.   Consider using other means than microphones to communicate updates to the ECSC  participants and other stakeholders during the competition.  Accomodation   Consider the climate and weather context of the hosting country in order to foresee  alternate transport options from the accommodations to the actual event venue (e.g. in  case of heavy rain).  Table 8 Logistics  lessons learnt  Side Events  PARAMETER RECOMMENDATION  Social event   Consider facilitating the social events in spacious locations, which are adequate and  sufficiently large to accommodate the amount of people present at the ECSC.   Consider organising social events which trigger more interaction between the national  teams (e.g. by placing name tags on the tables during dinner and ensuring that at least 4  countries are represented at each table).  Schedule/timing  Ensure that the ECSC program schedule is aligned with the agendas of the side event  (e.g. job fair) in order to enable participants to attend the side event.  Table 9 Side events  lessons learnt  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  27  Compliance  PARAMETER RECOMMENDATION  Data  protection   Ensure that the privacy preferences of all ECSC attendees are visible and respected. Privacy  preferences could be expressed, for example, by providing coloured bracelets, polos or  badges, which indicate whether or not the attendee wants to be captured in pictures, movies  or other images which will be shared on social media (choice principle).   Ensure that all ECSC attendees are aware of the possible processing activities (e.g. being part  of a group picture that will be shared on social media) by providing a general transparency  notice at the event, for example via a banner at the entrance of the event, stating that  pictures could be taken and shared with a wider audience) (transparency principle).   Ensure that all individuals have the option to opt-out of some of the processing activities  (e.g. enable them to express they do not want to be in pictures published on the internet  etc.) (choice principle).

ECSC 2019 29  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  04  Executive Summary  The 5th Edition of the European Cyber Security Challenge, ECSC2018 was hosted in London during 14th to  17th October. The event was organised by the Cyber Security Challenge UK at the Tobacco Dock, an iconic  grade one listed building which has a rich history. The event was hosted together with the job fair Cyber  Re:coded.  Each country was represented at the ECSC final by a team of 10 contestants, comprised of the winners of  the national competition. Half of the team members are within the range of ages of 14-20 years old and half  in the 21-25 range. In total, 200 people (contestants, coaches and judges) representing 17 EU and EFTA  countries (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy,  Liechtenstein, Norway, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, and United Kingdom) competed in the ECSC final in  London. The participants investigated vulnerabilities in web applications, binaries and document files, solved  crypto puzzles and hacked hardware systems. However, technical skills are just one part of the whole story.  Teamwork and presentation skills were also evaluated. The complete skillset which is important for working  in an IT security team, is thus tested. The finalists of ECSC 2018 were the teams from Germany, France and  UK.  ENISA is currently hosting different platforms and performing different activities to support the European  Cyber Security Challenge hosting country and the evolution of the project, this includes among others: ECSC  main website, ECSC planning platform, public affairs strategy, challenges creation, governance framework  of the competition, secretariat support, etc…  In order to ensure appropriate and transparent reporting to the Steering Committee ENISA, the following  key observations were made by independent third-party observers that have attended the ECSC planning  meetings and the actual event. These observations have been produced based on the feedback collected  from participants, members of the ECSC Jury, members of the ECSC Steering Committee, and attendees to  the event. In addition, these observations reflect the feedback provided by organisers and participants  collected by an online evaluation survey:   The venue, accommodation and logistics provided by Cyberchallenge UK has been very well received  by participants. The venue was very well aligned with the theme of the challenge and provided for  adequate facilities to support the event.   The technical infrastructure supporting the challenge has significantly improved as compared to  ECSC2017. The service providers contracted by Cyberchallenge UK delivered a relatively stable,  state-of-the-art and reliable infrastructure. Some opportunities for improvement have been noted,  but overall the user experience was positive. Some infrastructure challenges have affected the  course of specific individual challenges (e.g. King of the hill, Capture The Flag), which is a key lesson  learned to take into account in future editions.   The platform developed by ENISA to support the challenges in the format of contracts was received  well by the participants and organisers as it facilitates a real-time scoreboard that is also accessible  to the public over the ECSC website (www.ecsc.eu).   The Public Affairs activities conducted by the national teams, the organisers and ENISA have gained  significantly in exposure, reach and engagement. To put things in perspective: #ECSC2017 had a total  estimated social media reach of 199 913, compared to 5 062 457 for #ECSC2018.   Exposure towards traditional press and media, as well as potential sponsors, national  representatives, and private entities has significantly increased. ECSC2018 welcomed several  political representatives of EU Member States thereby supporting the objective of bringing  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  05  nationalities together and foster a pan-European spirit in the realm of the European Cyber Security  Challenge.  The 2019 edition of the European Cyber Security Challenge will take place in Bucharest Romania, in October  2019.  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  06  1. Introduction  The growing need for IT security professionals is widely acknowledged at European level. To help mitigate  this shortage of skills, many countries launched national cyber security competitions addressed towards  students, university graduates or even non-ICT professionals with a clear aim:  ‘Identify new and young cyber talents and encourage young people to pursue a career in cyber security.’  The European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC) https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/  leverages on these competitions by adding a pan-European layer. Top cyber talents from each participating  country meet to network and collaborate and finally compete against each other. Contestants are  challenged in solving security related tasks from domains such as web security, mobile security, crypto  puzzles, reverse engineering and forensics and in the process collect points for solving them.  In a nutshell, ECSC is the annual European event that brings together young talent from across Europe to  have fun and compete in cyber security. Its main aim is to highlight the importance of the national  competition.  ECSC Background  The project was initiated under the umbrella of the EU Cyber Security Strategy (Feb 2013):  ‘The European Commission will organise, with the support of ENISA, a cybersecurity Championship in 2014,  where university students will compete in proposing NIS solutions.’  As of 2014, ENISA has been supporting the organisation of the ECSC. ENISA is actively organising the  meetings of the governance structures, supporting the development of the competition rules and games  and it is also part of the ECSC Jury. As of 2016, ENISA is the acting secretariat of the ESCS Steering  Committee.  In 2017, 15 countries attended (Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Greece,  Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Norway, Romania, Spain, Switzerland and United Kingdom). The ECSC2017  took place between the 31st and 2nd November in Malaga, Spain. The winner of the final was Spain.  In the edition of 2018, held during 15-17 October 2018, 200 people (contestants, coaches and judges)  representing 17 EU and EFTA countries (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,  France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Liechtenstein, Norway, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, and United Kingdom)  competed in the ECSC final at London. The participants investigated vulnerabilities in web applications,  binaries and document files, solved crypto puzzles and hack hardware systems. However, technical skills  are just one part of the whole story. As time and resources were limited, teamwork and presentation skills  were also evaluated. The complete skillset which is important for working in an IT security team, is thus  tested. The finalist of ECSC 2018 were the teams from Germany, France and UK. By 2020, ENISA expects to  have more than 25 countries involved in the ECSC.  The 2019 edition of the European Cyber Security Challenge will take place Bucharest Romania, in October  2019.  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  07  ECSC Setup  Each country is represented at the ECSC final by a team of 10 contestants, comprised by the winners of the  national round. Half of them are within the range of ages of 14-20 years old and half in the 21-25 range.  Two preparatory pilot phases of ECSC have been held in 2014 (in Austria) and 2015 (in Switzerland) with  attendance by 3 and 6 countries, respectively.  Since 2015, ENISA is lending its experience and position to  coordinate and organise the ECSC effort to reach its full maturity by 2020.  The activities of the ECSC are supervised by a Steering Committee, composed of representatives of the  attending countries. ENISA facilitates the meetings of this group and provides strategic guidance. The  decision making processes are described in the ECSC Charter, which is approved every year.  ENISA is currently hosting different platforms and performing different activities to support the European  Cyber Security Challenge hosting country and the evolution of the project, this includes among others: the  ECSC main website, the ECSC planning platform, the public affairs strategy, challenges creation, etc…  In addition, ENISA is working closely with the host of each edition, in order to ensure appropriate and  transparent reporting to the Steering Committee.  During the year, two Steering Committee meetings are held prior the execution of the event:   Initial Planning Conference (IPC ) was held in Brussels, 1st of March in DG Connect   Main Planning Conference (MPC), held in Athens (ENISA premises) during 19th-20th June  ENISA organised these preparatory events and was overall responsible for the efficient running of the  project, including meetings minutes and the follow-up of the proposed actions.  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  08  2.

ECSC 2018 hosting country  The 5th Edition of the European Cyber Security Challenge, ECSC2018 was hosted in London during 14th to  17th October. The event was organised by the Cyber Security Challenge UK at the Tobacco Dock, an iconic  grade one listed building which has a rich history. The event was hosted together with the job fair Cyber  Re:coded.  The organization provided different useful information about how to get to the event from the selected  hotel and the different facilities provided during the execution of the competition. Also, different activities  were performed for the participants:   Sunday 14th Oct : Welcome dinner and presentation of the teams   Monday 15th Oct: Dinner in London with some of the teams   Tuesday 16th Oct: ECSC Competition Closing Party at London’s newest rooftop bar   Wednesday 17th Oct: Awards Dinner and Presentations on the River Thames, aboard Riverboat  Figure 2 ECSC 2018 Winning team - Award ceremony  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  10  4. ENISA Contribution to ECSC2018  Steering Committee Management  The activities of the ECSC are supervised by a Steering Committee, made out of representatives of the  attending countries. ENISA facilitates the meetings of this groups and provides strategic guidance. The  decision making processes are described in the ECSC Charter, which is approved every year.  During the preparation of ECSC 2018, ENISA was responsible for the following activities related with the  management of the Steering Committee:   Planning Platform maintenance and update   Mail list management   Organization of the IPC in Brussels   Organization of the MPC in Athens   Hot wash meeting after the execution of the competition in London   Feedback collection: Lessons learnt report and surveys to the participants  Jury Management  A jury body was established during the competition:  A jury member is appointed from each of the  members of the ECSC’s Steering Committee, once this is set, it will resolve any dispute during the  competition.  The following improvements were implemented this year:  1. A “Jury guidelines” document was created, summing up the most important points to take in to  account. The Jury members and captains from all teams could use this document as a reference.  2. Jury meetings were scheduled at regular intervals in order to improve the efficiency of the  competition: Jury members meet at predefined times during the competition to discuss and  resolve complaints and queries received during the period in between two jury meetings. Also, a  framework was created in the case an “extraordinary jury meeting” was necessary for issues that  may affect severely the running of the competition.  3. Creation of a Jury coordinator role:  In charge of acting as a PoC, receiving and collecting complains  from participants, captains and jury members.  4. Definition of a clear workflow in case of complaints. The workflow is depicted in Fig. 3.  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  11  Figure 3 Jury Workflow  In general, during the competition the role of the jury was:   Attend jury meetings   Resolve disputes with impartiality   Attend and evaluate presentations   Attend to any other issue that may need the expertise of the jury.  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  12  Presentation management  For ECSC 21018, ENISA proposed new guidelines and rules for the presentation of the contracts (“ECSC  contract presentations guidelines”). During the event, the teams had the chance to present a contract of  their choice, earning additional cash rewards.  The final grade varied between:   Good ( extra 40% cash reward of the selected contract)   Very good (extra 50% cash reward of the selected contract)   Excellent (extra 60%  cash reward of the selected contract)  All the 17 teams presented during the competition with the following grades:  GRADE NUMBER OF TEAMS  Excellent 13  Very good 3  Good 1  Table 1 Presentation grades  Deployed Platforms  For the planning, testing and execution of the ECSC, ENISA supported the development of the competition  by deploying different platforms:   Planning portal: https://ecsc.enisa.europa.eu.   Test Scoreboard and contracts platform: https://board.ecsc.eu   File Sharing platform (owncloud): Used for information sharing and contingency mechanism:  https://storage.ecsc.eu/   ECSC 2018 Website: Promotion of the event.  Real time scoring information was provided during  the challenge to externals interested parties: https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  13  Scoring Platform (Score board)  In order to manage the scores and the contract resolution, ENISA coordinated the development of a new  game board platform:  Figure 4 Scoreboard and contract management platform  Also, onsite support by the main developer was provided during the challenge.  The code of the platform was released to the community under EUPL licensing and can be found on Github  (https://github.com/enisaeu/ecsc-gameboard). For ECSC 2019 is expected that this platform will be further  improved and many changes requested and identified during the challenge will be implemented.  Competition Challenges  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  14  For ECSC 2018, 36 challenges or “contracts” were provided to participants during the two days of the  competition divided in 110 different tasks, these includes activities involving different skills like Crypto,  forensics, malware and artefacts analysis, reverse engineering, network forensics, hardware, mobile,  steganography, and Capture the flag (CTF) challenges.  Challenges were provided by BT and ENISA. The final selection of challenges was done by the organisers.

The bandstand was set-up by BT and consisted in a physical challenge with 5  different associated tasks which the teams can choose to do but is not compulsory.  1. Bypass electronic access control  2. Disarm an intruder alarm using a number sequence challenge  3. Bypass some combination locks  4. Solve some hidden riddles which will be exposed by use of a UV torch  5. Using teamwork, disarm a device (wire cutting challenge)  This challenge was located just outside the main competition area and was manned by BT personnel.  Figure 5 Bandstand  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  17  Public affairs Strategy  The European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC) Steering Committee decided per ECSC Charter to develop a  Public Affairs Strategy for every edition. The main objective of this Public Affairs strategy is to create,  distribute and manage a coherent information flow to inform relevant audiences and participating  countries about the ECSC final. Moreover, the Strategy provides the input for the Dissemination plan that  ensures coherent and synchronised communication.  These documents will contribute to the maturity enhancement of the European Cyber Security Challenge  and increase brand exposure. This will draw interested parties from the private sector in context of  sponsor opportunities and attract more countries and participants to enrol in future ECSC editions.  The hosting country and ENISA implemented the strategy for the first year and the participants were  provided with an official media pack which included the lines to take, brand identity information and  press releases. In addition, ENISA will provide a Dissemination Plan that facilitates timely and coordinated  implementation of the strategy amongst all participants and ECSC stakeholders.  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  18  Social media impact  Together with the public affair strategy a social media report was created, collecting the reactions during  the event, according to the report, some of the most remarkable facts regarding to social media impact  were the following:   Estimated social media reach over the 5 million   Over 17 thousands direct social media interactions   97,2% of positive mentions.  The complete list of collected indicators is the following:  Figure 6 Social Media Impact  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  19  VIP program support  A program for VIP visits was supported by ECSC 2018 organization. In this context, the following VIP visits  were received during the execution of the competition:   Raffaele Trombetta, Italy's ambassador in the UK   His Excellency Lars Thuesen, Danish Ambassador to the UK   Brigadier Lars Christian Hedemark, Defence Attaché, Danish Embassy UK   Jakob Holm, Press Attaché at the Royal Danish Embassy in the UK   Guillaume POUPARD, Director general ANSSI  International Engagement  The head of the USA cyber challenge, Douglas Logan, attended as observer in order to find synergies for  future collaborations and leverage the event to a more international scale.

Decision- making of the  Steering  Committee  and Jury   Consider foreseeing specific time slots for Jury meetings during the competition.   Capture and document all decisions made during the ECSC Steering Committee and Jury  meetings, including decisions, actions and owners, in a decision-making log.   Track the implementation of decisions made by the ECSC Steering Committee and Jury in a  central register.   Ensure fair and equal representation of the different national teams with equal voting  power in the ECSC Steering Committee and Jury meetings.  Transparency   Communicate all decisions made during the ECSC Steering Committee and Jury meetings in  a transparent manner via official communication channels to the ECSC stakeholders  (participants, organisers, facilitators, watch dogs…).   Avoid any last-minute changes to the ECSC game rules, in order to avoid confusion and  ambiguity within the teams and unfair outcomes during the challenge.   Consider putting in place a screen within the ECSC gaming area via which any relevant  communication towards the ECSC participants about the Jury meetings can be displayed.  Table 5 Governance and decision-making lessons learnt  Public Affairs  PARAMETER RECOMMENDATION  Public  Affairs  Strategy  adoption by  national  teams   Consider incentivising the transposition of the Public Affairs Strategy on a national level.  Improve the communication between the national teams and coordination on social media  in order to ensure an even intenser and more valuable collaboration between the Member  States on approaching social media for ECSC2019.  Table 6 Public affairs  lessons learnt  Challenge  PARAMETER RECOMMENDATION  Design   Consider developing a few real challenges to be tested by the participants in order to assess  whether the level of complexity is adequate to their skill. Request participant’s feedback on  complexity for individual test challenges and take these into account for development of the  final challenges.  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  25   Consult with ECSC alumni and other active CTF players to ensure a level of complexity and  challenge proportionate to the level of skill of participants.   Consider implementing a feature on the platform to report and provide feedback on  challenges from a complexity point of view.  Service  Providers   Fixed position for service provider representative in jury.   Additional HR capacity for service provider for trouble shooting.  Rules   Consider a process for enforcement of rules and define standard consequences based on the  type of violation. For example the use of red and yellow cards could be used by analogy with  football games, where significant violations are penalised by a red card. Consider the  following enforcement scheme:  o Red card. First red card: half hour time-out, second red card: disqualification  o Yellow card. First yellow card: warning, second yellow card: 15 minutes time-out,  third yellow card constitutes first red card.   Consider assigning the role of Referee to an individual that monitors compliance with the  rules. Upon unclarity, the Referee can escalate to the Jury for final decision.  Enforcement   Mandatory communication channels (between coaches and teams, and jury members).   Consider establishing an enforcement scheme that discourages malicious participants to  spoil the fun for others. I.e. consider assessing ethical behaviour and incentivise fairplay. It  is up the Steering Committee to develop and apply these rules.   Consider detailing specific responsibilities for the watchdog function and communicate  clearly their role to all stakeholders, including participants and organisers in order to avoid  confusion about their mandate.   Consider installing a technical monitoring capability that enables identification of technical  rule infringement by participating teams or specific individuals.  Presentations   Reconsider incentives for presentations in order to make them more strategically fitting with  the challenges and encourage participants to do it.   Consider enlarging the driver for presentations. Incentivising presentations by providing  points that will be taken into account for the challenge could be an option, but it has to be  aligned with the overall philosophy of combining soft skills with technical skills.  Platform  Consider implementing access controls to prevent users access the platform before it is  intended to be used.  Infrastructure   Perform adequate capacity testing beforehand (i.e. simulation testing/stress test).   Consider cloud / hybrid setup for hosting the challenge platform -> given high-bandwith  and speed internet uplink.  Complexity   Consider involving ECSC alumni into designing the challenges in order to reflect the groups'  level of expertise.   Consider involving CTF community – that is, actively involving seasoned CTF players into  the process -  in designing challenges.  Scoring   Consider implementing a scoring system that indicates scores for different phases in the  challenge progress (indicate completion of milestones, overall progress for specific  individual challenges, etc.).  Table 7 Challenge  lessons learnt  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  26  Logistics  PARAMETER RECOMMENDATION  Venue   When determining the location of the challenge venue and hotel accommodations, take  into account the distance and transportation options between both places. Ensure that  participants, organisers, facilitators and other relevant ECSC stakeholders can easily reach  the challenge venue under any weather conditions.  Catering   Ensure that sufficient water and food supplies are foreseen at the challenge venue.   Consider foreseeing a variety of meal options (including several vegan/vegetarian meal  options, gluten-free…) for the participants and other ECSC stakeholders during the  challenge.  In-event  communication   Consider putting in place a big, central screen at the challenge venue, which displays all  relevant communication regarding the outcome of the Jury meetings, lunch time, end time  of the competition… towards the ECSC participants and other stakeholders.   Consider establishing a central WhatsApp group or other communication platform for the  ECSC Jury members and organisers before the start of the challenge, in order to make it  possible for the members to communicate during the competition and inform each other  of decisions taken during the Jury meetings.   Consider sharing an updated program schedule with the ECSC participants and other  stakeholder throughout the competition to create the right expectations.   Consider using other means than microphones to communicate updates to the ECSC  participants and other stakeholders during the competition.  Accomodation   Consider the climate and weather context of the hosting country in order to foresee  alternate transport options from the accommodations to the actual event venue (e.g. in  case of heavy rain).  Table 8 Logistics  lessons learnt  Side Events  PARAMETER RECOMMENDATION  Social event   Consider facilitating the social events in spacious locations, which are adequate and  sufficiently large to accommodate the amount of people present at the ECSC.   Consider organising social events which trigger more interaction between the national  teams (e.g. by placing name tags on the tables during dinner and ensuring that at least 4  countries are represented at each table).  Schedule/timing  Ensure that the ECSC program schedule is aligned with the agendas of the side event  (e.g. job fair) in order to enable participants to attend the side event.  Table 9 Side events  lessons learnt  ECSC 2018 Analysis Report  December 2018  27  Compliance  PARAMETER RECOMMENDATION  Data  protection   Ensure that the privacy preferences of all ECSC attendees are visible and respected. Privacy  preferences could be expressed, for example, by providing coloured bracelets, polos or  badges, which indicate whether or not the attendee wants to be captured in pictures, movies  or other images which will be shared on social media (choice principle).   Ensure that all ECSC attendees are aware of the possible processing activities (e.g. being part  of a group picture that will be shared on social media) by providing a general transparency  notice at the event, for example via a banner at the entrance of the event, stating that  pictures could be taken and shared with a wider audience) (transparency principle).   Ensure that all individuals have the option to opt-out of some of the processing activities  (e.g. enable them to express they do not want to be in pictures published on the internet  etc.) (choice principle).

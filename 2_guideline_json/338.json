These are important steps since the pace  of innovation from adversaries (e.g. malicious actors) is higher than the  one from cybersecurity specialists finding solutions to deter them. In fact,  apart from basic cybersecurity hygiene and training, investing in research  and innovation is the most viable option for defenders to come closer to  what is required to improve the security of cyberspace. In this report, we  highlight some of the most important cybersecurity research and  innovation topics explored in the EU and around the world.  _ Better understanding of the human  dimension  Cybersecurity is still seen as the practice of protecting networks,  information systems and data (NIS). This definition needs to be further  expanded beyond technical issues to include socio, behavioural and  economic concerns and the different roles performed by the parties  involved. This should constitute a priority in future cybersecurity research  and innovation discussions. A better understanding of the human  dimension is key in the definition of any cybersecurity strategy so that  security decisions are taken to meet their needs, skills and expectations.  3  _ Cybersecurity research and  innovation  During 2019, we observed an increase in the number of test labs and  cyber-ranges1 becoming available on-premises and in cloud offerings.  These are essential resources for researchers to simulate attacks, develop  exploitation scenarios, obtain operational data and test defence strategies  in a multipurpose virtual environment. However, existing testing  environments lack on replicating many vulnerabilities that typically  compromise security such as human and engineering factors, among  others. To improve efficiency, it is import to research and innovate the  scope and fidelity of these test labs and propose new technical solutions.  4  Overview  _ 5G security  The rollout of 5G mobile networks in some countries started in 2019 but  the expectation is for the number of installations to increase in 2021. This  next generation of mobile communications is of paramount importance for  the social and economic progress of the European Union. Hence, the  future research and development of 5G security solutions is crucial for the  sustainability and reliability of this technology. In 2019, ENISA published a  threat landscape for 5G networks reviewing some critical security aspects  related with this emerging technology.2 Key topics in research and  innovation of 5G security should consider the following aspects.   The research and development of security controls to cover the  protection of the network, physical elements and data layers, thus  providing a multi-layer protection solution. With 5G Networks, data will  be located in centralized cloud servers, intermediate fog nodes, and  edge devices, increasing complexity in the implementation of a security  solution.   The research and development of standards and requirements for  security controls to implement across interconnected networks with  multiple owners, topologies, operators, and a diversified variety of  devices and network layers.   The research and development of key management capabilities enabling  secure interoperability between nodes connecting resource-limited edge  and IoT devices. This capability should include effective access control,  authentication, cryptography, and key management techniques to  limited-resource nodes.  5  _ EU research and innovation projects on  cybersecurity   The EU is working to establish a pilot for a cybersecurity competence  network. CONCORDIA3, ECHO4, SPARTA5 and CyberSec4Europe6 are the  four winning pilot projects of the 2018 Horizon 2020 cybersecurity call  for ‘establishing and operating a pilot for a European Cybersecurity  Competence Network and developing a common European  Cybersecurity Research & Innovation Roadmap’. The EU expects to  strengthen its cybersecurity capacity and address future cybersecurity  challenges with these four pilot projects, for a safer EU Digital Single  Market.   The EU grants €38 million for protection of critical infrastructure against  cyber threats. The European Commission has announced that it is  committing more than €38 million through Horizon 2020 to the EU’s  research and innovation programme. The program is meant to support  several innovative projects in the field of protection of critical  infrastructure against cyber and physical threats and making cities  smarter and safer.7   The EU launched a €10.5 million call for projects in cybersecurity. The  Commission has launched a new call worth €10,5 million through the  Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) programme for projects that will work  on stepping up Europe’s cybersecurity capabilities and cooperation  across member states.8  6  CTI research and  innovation  _ Rapid dissemination of CTI methods and  content  Various research needs were identified during the reporting period and  the actions to address these needs are proposed here. These have been  grouped into some categories to better reflect the scope better. Though  not overlap-free, these categories are indicative for areas of potential CTI  improvements.   The results of research projects in the area of CTI need to be  assessed and mapped to a broader CTI context to identify overlaps  and gaps and to make them comparable with existing CTI commercial  products, services and practices. This will help to disseminate the  results to the user community. At the same time, existing gaps will be  filled by additional functions, content and processes. EU (Horizon  H2020) projects with CTI relevance are excellent candidates for this  task, contributing to improving CTI practices.   The provision and use of open-source CTI material should be  promoted. This will facilitate knowledge transfer, but it will also lower  the threshold of CTI skills. Open-CTI is the perfect candidate for this  purpose, as it supports the ingestion of CTI from multiple sources into  a single base that can be shared among various users, while at the  same time offering a set of functions for managing this information.  By adopting Open-CTI, users will be in a position to obtain valuable  information at a relatively low skill threshold.  7  _Research resulting in emerging  trends  The need to strengthen CTI with other established cybersecurity  tools requires the structural and contextual evolution of this  domain. At the same time, technological advances brought by  emerging technologies pose the question of how CTI can benefit  from these developments. Thus, prospective research needs in  the area of CTI will contribute to improving processes, functions,  automation, content structure and validation, service delivery,  speed-to-user/dissemination, CTI deployment and mappings.  CTI has been firmly established in the cybersecurity domain  as an essential tool for enhancing agility and efficiency in  defending cyberattacks.  8  CTI research and  innovation  _ Functionality, level of automation and  compliance with maturity requirements   Process automation will assume a key role in CTI. While modern  cyberattacks have become heavily automated, organisations try to  defend themselves against them manually or by partially using  automation. This is an unequal contest, which slows down the speed and  capability of responding. Investigating the potential automation of CTI  processes will be vital for striking a balance between attackers and  defenders. Achieving this will need a thorough analysis of CTI process  steps and options for automating these steps via available and emerging  technologies.   CTI maturity requirements will need to be identified in further  detail. Although some criteria/requirements for the selection of CTI  functions (e.g. Threat Intelligence Platforms or TIPs) have been  developed for various CTI user profiles, similar requirements will be  necessary for further CTI products, services and tools. Such  requirements will be associated with multiple levels of user maturity and  expenditure and types of CTI. Similar criteria/requirements are  necessary for various other elements of a CTI infrastructure, such as  tools, good practices, sharing platforms, etc. Hence, apart from the  development of CTI capability maturity models, research is needed to  show how CTI functions correspond to the various CTI maturity levels.  This work will contribute to increasing the speed of adoption of CTI  practices.   The use of AI/ML in CTI should be further investigated. This will  reduce the number of manual steps in CTI analysis and will increase the  value of ML functions within CTI activities.  9  _ Building bridges to related areas   Novel approaches for the ingestion of CTI knowledge by domains  that can profit from it need to be developed. Examples are cyber-  ranges, hybrid threats, supply chains and geopolitical assessments  and crises. Questions to be asked in this respect include: What are the  points at which CTI can be taken into account? Which CTI content is  relevant? What are the validation criteria for the appropriateness of  CTI information? How can CTI be ‘hooked’ into information about the  domain concerned? What kind of information from those domains can  be added to CTI? The synergies reflected in these questions may boost  use-cases and content quality in an omnidirectional manner.   CTI is essential for a number of disciplines. Examples include risk  assessment/management and the definition of protection  requirements and certification. It will be beneficial for those disciplines  to use CTI in the correct way. CTI contribution to these disciplines can  be identified using information, such as threat models, threat actor  information (capabilities, motives), attack methods and exploits.  Although some relevant material does exist (e.g. ATT&CK attack  framework9), significant work is required in order to identify and  standardise such information interfaces.  10  CTI research and  innovation  _ Effectiveness of CTI operations   Methods for using CTI effectively will be a tool for decision-  making. Such methods of deploying CTI efficiently will help decision-  makers to understand the value of CTI and practitioners to evaluate  the return-on investing in CTI. Such methods/KPIs will need to  consider factors beyond the CTI content, taking into account  improvements achieved within the entire life cycle of security  management and risk mitigation. Optimally, measuring the  effectiveness of investment in CTI will be part of a much wider  consideration of the economics of cybersecurity in various kinds of  organisations (e.g. according to security requirements, maturity levels,  etc.).   Although low-cost tools prevail for aggregating, analysing and  disseminating CTI, some research may be necessary to find  automated tools for managing the CTI consumed and produced.  Other than standardised data formats (e.g. CSV files, STIX, TAXII),  standard CTI functions may be the subject of such research, followed  by the development of low-cost, open-source tools supporting such  functions.  11  _ Evolution of CTI structure and content   As CTI is penetrating additional domains, information from these  contexts needs to be fed back to the original CTI knowledge  base. For example, CTI structures need to be defined to capture  geopolitical and hybrid-threat information. The same applies to the  relevance of CTI for risks, incidents, forensic analyses, assurance  levels, etc. The existing CTI formats need to evolve to capture  information emanating from these dependencies in CTI.   Emerging technologies such as AI may be used to validate of  analysed CTI. Such tools may augment or even replace manual CTI  analysis, but also provide support throughout the life cycle of CTI  (e.g. check the relevance of CTI based on existing incident  information). Such novel approaches to CTI will enhance the quality  and relevance of the information.  12  References  1.

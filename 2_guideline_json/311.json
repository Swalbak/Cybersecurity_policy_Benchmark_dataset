However, contrary to  traditional security risk management, addressing cyber risks introduces entirely new challenges  for port operators who often lack the internal expertise, organisational structure and processes  or the resources to effectively assess and mitigate them. Moreover, the nature of port  operations and, especially, the interconnectedness and service inter-dependencies across port  ecosystems requires all involved operators to achieve and maintain a baseline level of  cybersecurity.  This report aims to provide port operators with good practices for cyber risk assessment  that they can adapt to whatever risk assessment methodology they follow. In order to  achieve this, this report introduces a four-phase approach to cyber risk management for  port operators, which follows common risk management principles and is mapped to the  steps of the risk assessment methodology that is laid out in the ISPS Code1 and relevant  EU legislation for Port and Port Facility Security.  Specifically, the four phases are:   Phase 1: Identifying cyber-related assets and services   Phase 2: Identifying and evaluating cyber-related risks   Phase 3: Identifying security measures   Phase 4: Assessing cybersecurity maturity  For each of these phases, this report provides actionable guidelines to assist port operators in  their efforts, lists common challenges associated with the performance of the relevant activities,  good practices that can be readily adopted and customised by individual organisations and a  mapping of the listed good practices for each phase with the respective challenges they  address. The proposed guidelines and good practices may be adapted to any common cyber  risk management methodology and can be tailored to the unique characteristics of port  operators of different sizes, cybersecurity maturity, information security budgets and operational  scope.  Phase four of this approach also introduces a model for port operators to perform cybersecurity  maturity self-assessment founded on the selected security measures and to identify priorities for  investing resources for either improving on or building an organisational cybersecurity maturity  program.  1 http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Security/Guide_to_Maritime_Security/Pages/SOLAS-XI-2%20ISPS%20Code.aspx  http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Security/Guide_to_Maritime_Security/Pages/SOLAS-XI-2%20ISPS%20Code.aspx  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  8  1. INTRODUCTION  Ports serve a critical function in facilitating domestic and international supply-chain activities by  connecting sea and inland transport services. In the EU seaports play a significant role,  supporting 90 percent of EU exports and an additional 43 percent of internal market exchange2.  Ports are considered as critical information infrastructure for water transport. The Directive  2016/1148 (NIS Directive)3 classifies managing bodies of ports (defined as “any specified area  of land and water, with boundaries defined by the Member State MS in which the port is  situated, containing works and equipment designed to facilitate commercial maritime transport  operations” in the Directive 2005/65/EC4), including their port facilities (defined as “a location  where the ship/port interface takes place; this includes areas such as anchorages, awaiting  berths and approaches from seaward, as appropriate” in the Regulation (EC) No 725/20045)  and entities operating works and equipment contained within ports as eligible to be identified as  Operators of Essential Services (OES).  This report builds on the Port Cybersecurity: Good Practices for Cybersecurity in the Maritime  Sector report6 published in November 2019 by ENISA, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity and  provides additional guidelines to port operators for managing their cyber risks.  1.1 BACKGROUND  The NIS Directive requires OES to conduct risk assessments that “cover all operations  including the security, integrity and resilience of network and information systems”7.  According to the NIS Directive, these risk assessments, along with the implementation of  appropriate mitigation measures, should promote “a culture of risk management” to be  developed through “appropriate regulatory requirements and voluntary industry practices”8.  While some EU Member States (MS) have issued relevant guidance to port operators on how to  conduct cyber risk assessment (see Annex A for reference), most port operators have chosen to  adopt one of the different methodologies introduced in the various industry standards (see  Annex B for reference). However, there is no common methodology for port cyber risk  assessment.  Of the three types of port OES defined in the NIS Directive, the closest framework to a common  risk assessment methodology is the International Maritime Organisation’s International Ship  and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code, which concerns port facilities / terminal operators. The  ISPS code is implemented in the EU by Regulation 725/2004 and ensures that port facilities  implement Port Facility Security Assessments (PFSAs) and Port Facility Security Plans  (PFSPs). The ISPS Code focuses primarily on physical security, though Part B, paragraph  15.3.5 of the Code recommends that the PFSA address computer systems and networks. It  further specifically identifies radio and telecommunication systems, including computer systems  and networks, and associated procedural policies. The ISPS code also defines minimum port  facility security assessment elements/steps. EU Directive 2005/65 on enhancing port  security9 introduces similar requirements and extends them to ports, namely with the  2 https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime_en  3 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148  4 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:310:0028:0039:FR:PDF  5 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/En/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32004R0725  6 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/port-cybersecurity-good-practices-for-cybersecurity-in-the-maritime-sector  7 See paragraph (13) page L.194/3 of https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN  8 See paragraph (44) page L.194/8 of https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN  9 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32005L0065  https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime_en https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:310:0028:0039:FR:PDF https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/En/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32004R0725 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/port-cybersecurity-good-practices-for-cybersecurity-in-the-maritime-sector https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32005L0065  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  9  implementation of Port Security Plans (PSP) and Port Security Assessments (PSA). These  measures should apply to all ports in which one or more port facilities covered by Regulation  (EC) No 725/2004 are situated. Annex I of the Directive describes the minimum requirements  for conducting a PSA in the same manner as Regulation 725/2004. PSAs shall take due  account of the specificities of different sections of a port and, where deemed applicable by the  relevant authority of the MS, of its adjacent areas if these have an impact on security in the port  and shall take into account the assessments for port facilities within their boundaries as carried  out pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 725/2004.  Stocktaking for this report revealed that a fragmented approach in the performance of cyber risk  assessments occurs across the EU port sector. Almost without exception, each port’s attempt to  address cyber risk within context of existing security risk assessment frameworks and  standards, followed a unique approach. Even more, port facilities complying with ISPS Code  requirements indicated that significant gaps emerged in their organisational cyber risk  assessments.  Inconsistent approaches represented only half the challenge. Key aspects of  organisations were left un-assessed due to a variety of factors that included but were not limited  to port resource availability and variability, variations in stakeholder knowledge and degrees of  engagement, compliance based focus, and inconsistent perceptions in how cyber risk can affect  a port facility’s operations.  1.2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  This report aims to provide port operators with a set of guidelines and good practices to  effectively manage commonly referenced cyber risk management challenges. Specifically, the  objectives of this report are established to provide port operators with:   Good practices for cyber risk assessment that can be adapted to a range of risk  assessment methodologies;   Actionable guidelines that make effective use of the taxonomies (e.g. assets, threats  etc.) presented in the 2019 ENISA report; and,   A framework for identifying appropriate cybersecurity measures to address cyber risks  and to conduct a cybersecurity maturity self-assessment that will facilitate the  development, prioritisation, and efficient allocation of cybersecurity budgets.  1.3 STUDY SCOPE   This study outlines good practices for cyber risk management in the maritime port  ecosystem concerning both IT systems and OT systems.   The port ecosystem comprises all the stakeholder groups involved in port operations:  port managing bodies (Port Authorities, terminal and facility operators), national  authorities (customs, police, cities, etc.), transport companies (shipping companies,  railway companies, etc.) and all the service providers essential to port operations (oil  companies, energy companies, etc.).  1.4 TARGET AUDIENCE  The primary target audience of this study are people responsible for cybersecurity (CISOs,  CIOs etc.) within operators in the port ecosystem, namely   Port Authorities;   Port facilities / terminal operators;   Other entities operating within ports.  In addition, the study can be useful for National Competent Authorities who may wish to develop  guidance for port operators to support them in conducting cyber risk assessment or  cybersecurity maturity self-assessment.  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  10  1.5 USING THIS DOCUMENT  This report introduces a four-phase approach to cyber risk management for port operators,  which follows common principles of risk management10 11. The approach is not intended to  provide a comprehensive methodology for cyber risk management but rather provide actionable  guidelines for managing cyber risk that can be mapped to any framework or methodology  the port operator is currently using or may wish to use.  The first three phases are also mapped to the steps of the risk assessment methodology  (minimum assessment requirements) articulated in the ISPS Code, Regulation 725/2004 and  described in Annex I of Directive 2005/65. The fourth phase introduces a model for port  operators to employ in performing cybersecurity maturity self-assessments for the selected  security measures, identifying priorities for investing resources for improvement and/or building  the programmatic foundations for organisational cybersecurity maturity. The four phases are:   Phase 1: Identifying cyber-related assets and services (ISPS Code Section 15.5.1:  Identification and evaluation of important assets and infrastructure it is important to  protect)   Phase 2: Identifying and evaluating cyber-related risks (ISPS Code Section 15.5.2:  Identification of possible threats to the assets and infrastructure and the likelihood of  their occurrence, in order to establish and prioritize security measures, ISPS Code  Section 15.5.4: Identification of weaknesses, including human factors in the  infrastructure, policies and procedures)   Phase 3: Identifying security measures (ISPS Code Section 15.5.3: Identification,  selection and prioritization of counter measures and procedural changes and their level  of effectiveness in reducing vulnerability)   Phase 4: Assessing cybersecurity maturity  Figure 1: Cyber risk management phases  Each of these four phases is reviewed in Chapters 2 – 5, respectively, with a specific emphasis  on the following themes:   Actionable guidelines to assist port operators in their efforts to perform each phase.  These include specific guidance in how to effectively apply the various taxonomies  presented in ENISA’s Port Cybersecurity report of 201912.   Challenges associated with the performance of activities as reported by port  stakeholders who were interviewed/surveyed for this report.   Good practices that can be readily adopted and customised by individual  organisations and easily tailored and integrated into any risk assessment methodology  utilised by port operators.   A mapping of the listed good practices for each phase with the respective  challenges they address.  10 ISO 31000:2018, Risk management – Guidelines  11 ISO 31010:2009 – Risk Management – Risk assessment techniques  12 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/port-cybersecurity-good-practices-for-cybersecurity-in-the-maritime-sector  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/port-cybersecurity-good-practices-for-cybersecurity-in-the-maritime-sector  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  11  1.6 METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH  Figure 2: Methodology adopted for the study  Task 1 - Definition of the project scope and identification of experts: This first step  consisted of establishing the scope of the project and selecting subject matter experts whose  input and insights were considered for the development of the report.  Task 2 - Desktop research: This involved the collection of information from reports, white  papers, and guidelines, as well as EU and (inter-)national regulations and industry-specific  standards concerning cybersecurity risk management and relevant maturity models.  Task 3 - Questionnaire and series of interviews with selected subject matter experts:  During this task interviews were conducted and an online survey was designed and published  by ENISA to collect additional information. Specifically, 18 semi-structured interviews were  performed with stakeholders representing 11 EU Member States and 49 responses were  collected from the survey, which collectively represented a wide cross-section of port industry  stakeholders from 16 EU member states. Overall, inputs were collected from 20 port authorities,  17 terminal operators, 6 EU National Competent Authorities including EMSA, 17 shipping  companies, 4 service providers and an EU research institute.  Task 4 - Analysis of collected material and report development: All inputs collected from  desktop research efforts and collaboration with stakeholders were thoroughly analysed. Based  on this analysis, the first draft of this report was developed.  Task 5 - Review and validation: The report was reviewed with and subsequently validated by  ENISA's subject matter experts. Feedback was solicited and provided by experts throughout  this process.  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  12  2. IDENTIFYING CYBER-RELATED  ASSETS AND SERVICES  2.1 GUIDELINES FOR IDENTIFYING CYBER-RELATED ASSETS AND  SERVICES  Phase one focuses on the identification of key IT and OT assets and the port services they  support. In general, port operators should follow a service-based risk assessment in order to  focus mainly on the aggregated business/operational impact of risks, However, port operators  functioning at a more nascent stage of cybersecurity maturity will likely focus initial efforts on  asset identification and enumeration.  The identification and evaluation of these assets, systems and services is not necessarily  constrained to the organisation’s own operational ecosystem. Ports represent complex  ecosystems where assets and systems are increasingly integrated and interconnected, resulting  in service-based interdependencies and voluminous data exchanges that occur every day.  At the same time external third-party stakeholders (partners, vendors) frequently request or  maintain continuous access to port IT/OT assets, systems, supporting infrastructure, and data,  exponentially increasing the attack surface for potential malicious cyber threat actors. With all  those touch points, especially those found in port community system enabled environments,  vulnerabilities will inevitably arise.  Within the context of this digital environment the port must be  able to assess its ability to continue provisioning services in the event an asset, system or  service is rendered unavailable as a result of a cyber incident, and also understand the extent to  which rapid re-establishment of normal operation is possible.  Specific actions that port operators can perform include:   Identify cyber-related assets and related services   Develop indicators to assess cybersecurity incident impact on cyber-related assets and  related services (e.g. number of users affected, economic impact, environmental  impact, recovery time objectives etc.)   Assess impact on the availability of cyber-related assets and related services   Assess impact on the integrity of cyber-related assets and related services   Assess impact on the confidentiality of cyber-related assets and related services   Identify internal dependencies   Identify external dependencies with third parties  ENISA’s 2019 report on Port Cybersecurity identifies the main port services and infrastructure  and presents a port asset taxonomy. Port operators can use the proposed taxonomies as the  basis to identify their key cyber-related assets and services. The high-level categories of these  assets and services are depicted in Figure 3, while the ENISA 2019 report provides a detailed  description of each taxonomy.  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  13  Figure 3: High-level categories of port assets and services  2.2 RELATED CHALLENGES   Difficulty in identifying vulnerable IT and OT systems. As different  departments/divisions handle a variety of IT and OT equipment, identifying the  vulnerable systems based on predefined criteria is challenging.   Difficulty in compiling and maintaining IT and OT systems risk registries.   Difficulty in evaluating 3rd party-managed assets and services.   Difficulty in attributing all assets, applications, systems and staff that relate to the  provisioning of specific services. This involves data creation, processing,  transmission, exchange, and storage, which involves numerous stakeholders, both  internally and externally.  Increasing integration, technology refresh, evolution and  integration create a range of challenges.   Difficulty in handling configuration management of OT systems. Most OT systems  providers do not offer access to extensive configuration management interfaces such  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  14  as user and system settings, which result in supply chain dependencies based more  heavily on vendor support availability.   Difficulty in applying automated tools for identifying cyber-related assets, since  the deployment of such tools may inadvertently interfere with the normal functioning of  critical OT assets, which may rely on legacy system/software or reside on segmented  networks.   Difficulty in managing the procurement of software-enabled assets and stand-  alone applications due to local performance, compliance and/or certification  requirements resulting in varying procurement mechanisms. This challenge is greater  for large organisations with multiple business units, i.e. a company operating several  port terminals around the globe.  2.3 RELATED GOOD PRACTICES   Define the assessment focus. It is critical to define the specific focus of the  assessment based on the unique characteristics of the port operator.  An assessment  can be asset-based or service-based, such as loading and unloading of containers,  where several applications and assets are used to deliver specific services.   Maintain an asset inventory for cyber-related assets.   Assets should be identified and registered in the asset inventory by the System  they relate to.   Assets should be identified and registered in the asset inventory by the Service  they support.   Assets should be identified and registered in the asset inventory by the Information  they handle.   Dependencies should be identified on the technical interface (and/or data  exchange) requirements with third party software.   Dependencies should be identified on the technical interface (and/or data  exchange) requirements with vendors.   Dependencies should be identified on the technical interface (and/or data  exchange) requirements between IT and OT systems.   Deploy automated tools for asset identification, logging and monitoring.   Include the department/division responsible for cybersecurity in procurement  contract review and implementation in order to ensure cybersecurity is addressed.  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  15  Figure 4: Mapping of good practices against challenges in identifying and evaluating cyber-  related assets and services  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  16  3. IDENTIFYING AND EVALUATING  CYBER-RELATED RISKS  3.1 GUIDELINES FOR IDENTIFYING AND EVALUATING CYBER-  RELATED RISKS  Phase two focuses on the identification and evaluation of cyber risks related to the assets and  services identified in phase one. There exist a variety of methodologies and frameworks that  offer detailed steps for how risk identification and evaluation should occur. For instance, the  ISPS Code recognizes threat identification and vulnerability identification as essential and  distinct activities in the performance of a port facility security assessment. Regardless of the  methodology, framework or standard employed, results derived from this phase should include  the identification of all relevant risks, which should be accompanied by an analysis of their  likelihood and potential impact expressed in either a quantitative (e.g. score-based) or  qualitative way.  Specific actions that port operators can perform include:   Contextualise the risk identification and evaluation process   Identify cyber-related threats   Identify vulnerabilities to assets and services   Identify internal and external dependencies   Assess the possible likelihood and impact of a cybersecurity incident   Adopt a specific methodology for identifying and evaluating risks (e.g. scenario-based,  empirical, data-driven, workshops/brainstorming sessions etc.)   Develop indicators (qualitative or quantitative) to evaluate identified risks  Calculating the likelihood of occurrence of a cyber incident, along with identifying related  vulnerabilities to assets, services, policies and procedures, is critical to establishing and  prioritizing mitigation measures. It is commonly recognized by port stakeholders that although  relatively minor threats may individually result in negligible impact to operations, a series of  cascading minor threats, if left unaddressed, does harbour the potential to cause major  disruption. Therefore, the identification of vulnerabilities should not be limited to assets and  applications used in the organisation’s ecosystem. Maintaining safe and secure operations also  involves people handling the equipment and their adherence to defined policies, procedures  and operational guidelines. Ultimately, any holistic vulnerability assessment should take the  human element into consideration.  ENISA’s 2019 report on Port Cybersecurity identifies the main threats to port assets and  services and proposes a threat taxonomy and also lists the key possible impacts of cybersecurity  incidents. Port operators can use the proposed taxonomies as the basis to identify their key  cyber-related risks. The high-level categories of these threats and possible impacts are depicted  in Figure 5. ENISA’s 2019 report also provides a detailed description for each taxonomy.  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  17  Figure 5: High-level categories of threats and possible impacts of cybersecurity incidents  3.2 RELATED CHALLENGES   Cyber risk is not specifically identified in currently utilized risk assessment  methodologies.   Threats have been identified for physical security and IT security, but they are not  combined for asymmetrical risk consideration. Approved PSP/PFSPs reflect  assessment inputs that have not been updated to accommodate (let alone  acknowledge) the potential impact cyber threats pose.   Difficulty in calculating risk factors (likelihood, impact of a cyber incident)   Difficulty in calculating aggregated risk, as assets and services are increasingly  interrelated within the digital port environment.   Lack of organisation-wide cyber awareness and commensurate cyber training,  which makes it difficult for staff to consistently identify threats and recognize potential  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  18  vulnerabilities of assets and services that may exist across the organisation’s different  departments/divisions.   Lack of recordkeeping regarding past incidents and subsequent response and  recovery activities.   Lack of information/intelligence regarding IT / OT systems' vulnerabilities, actual  and/or emergent.   Lack of available resources (people, budget) to carry out an effective risk  assessment, as they are perceived to be time-consuming and costly or require  additional expenditures for obtaining information, such as automated vulnerability  scanning tools etc.   Difficulty in defining cyber residual risk/risk acceptance thresholds, based on the  organisation’s risk appetite.  3.3 RELATED GOOD PRACTICES   Perform a cyber risk assessment at the enterprise level. Engage representatives  from all the departments/divisions in order to collect accurate information and solicit  cross-functional insights.   Clearly define stakeholder responsibilities, authorities and risk ownership for  assets or services within each department/division/business unit.   The security of IT and OT systems should be the responsibility of the same  department/division.   Integrate cyber risk assessment and management with existing risk assessment and  management frameworks, such as the PSA/PFSA or PSP/PFSP and/or the  organisation’s Enterprise Risk Management Strategy.   Adopt a comprehensive and consistent approach to calculating the likelihood of  occurrence for a cyber incident, including factors such as threat actor motivation,  their available resources, access to the port IT/OT infrastructure and target-specific  knowledge.   Adopt a comprehensive and consistent approach to calculating the impact of a  cyber incident, in all business areas through a scenario-based approach that includes  legal, reputational damage, health and safety, financial damage and business  operations.   Engage in sectorial initiatives, where organisations can liaise with each other to  identify common risks, share best practices and communicate in a secure and  trusted environment.   Include cyber threat intelligence (CTI) inputs in the risk assessment methodology.  CTI is a key capability that can provide critical insights into an organisation’s potential  risk exposure. In some cases, national competent authorities and/or commercial  vendors can play a key role in the provision of such information to ports and port  facilities.   Develop a methodology to calculate residual risk/risk acceptance determinations.  All risks in the risk registry should have an Inherent, Residual, and Target risk score.  The inherent risk is the initial risk identified without any existing controls applied. If  mitigation measures are in place, the risk can be given a residual risk score. If there  are additional actions that can be taken to further mitigate that risk, it can be assigned  a target risk score. Progress should be tracked and once the actions are completed the  process can restart with the new risk score and the new inherent risk score.   Develop a methodology to track cyber risk indicators, such as the number of infected  systems per month, in order to identify trends and measure scope.   Deploy a business impact analysis methodology which provides an assessment,  using a scoring mechanism, against specific attributes, such as data Confidentiality,  Integrity, Availability, and operational safety and security. Such a tool should also  take into consideration systems’ criticality and sensitivity. This can be scenario-  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  19  based, as it is easier for all stakeholders to understand how cyber threats can affect  port operations.   Perform a cyber vulnerability assessment/penetration test. This can help identify  assets that may be unrecorded or not appropriately assessed and expose weaknesses  in the port environment.   Involve senior management in the process of defining residual risk/risk acceptance  levels.

IDENTIFYING SECURITY  MEASURES  4.1 GUIDELINES FOR IDENTIFYING SECURITY MEASURES  Phase three focuses on the identification and prioritisation of security measures that should be  implemented to reduce the identified risks to acceptable levels. Security measures should be  adopted following a risk-based approach that directs budget, resources and technical  capabilities towards the implementation of those security measures that will have the most  substantial impact on the organisation’s cyber risk posture. As such, this phase heavily relies on  the evaluation of the identified risks.  Specific actions that port operators can perform include:   Identify security measures to mitigate identified risks   Assess the effectiveness and impact of the security measures in terms of how they  influence the risk evaluation   Assess resource requirements for the implementation of security measures   Define a process for prioritising security measures  ENISA’s 2019 report provides a comprehensive list of baseline security measures grouped in  specific domains. When identifying security measures, port operators can reference the mapping  in Table 1 to identify which security measures are most appropriate for protecting identified  assets against acknowledged threats.

(people, time, budget) for the identification,  adoption, implementation and review of suitable mitigation measures.   Difficulty in sharing established security measures, procedures and policies, both  internally and externally, with third party stakeholders, which impedes the  development of a common approach to driving port community resilience.   Difficulty in identifying and selecting security measures based on business  continuity requirements. Most port stakeholders are currently focused on  implementing security measures in response to cyber incidents instead of adopting  proactive security measures.   The perception that any attempt to protect the entire organisation against cyber  threats may exhaust organisational resources (time consuming, costly, large  number of dedicated staff, etc.).  4.3 RELATED GOOD PRACTICES   Implement security measures based on predefined criteria, applicable to the entire  organisation, such as those that drive cost reduction, deliver risk reduction and/or  reduce the impact of a cyber incident.   Assess all security measures for risk reduction effectiveness by implementing a  scoring methodology.   Test security measures during cyber drills/exercises, or security drills/exercises  that include detailed cyber elements, both internally and externally with port  stakeholders.   Coordinate the identification, adoption and implementation of security measures  with the asset risk owner.   Adopt a ‘security-by-design’ approach in all procurement activities. Taking  cybersecurity into consideration in the conceptualisation phase of a project minimises  the need for additional allocation of resources during the operational cycle of the  asset/service.   - For less mature organisations focus on identifying and implementing security  measures that offer detection, response and recovery capabilities in the event of a  cyber incident.  - For mature organisations focus on identifying and implementing security measures  that protect the organisation’s most critical assets/services.   Consider cyber insurance as a risk reduction mitigation measure. Cyber insurance  can contribute to the organisation’s resilience by reducing risk of financial loss and can  also help to mobilize resources (e.g. funding, expertise) quickly in response to a cyber  incident.   Introduce cyber specific metrics, or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as  monitoring the availability of IT and OT assets and related services, awareness levels  of staff, number of critical security incidents etc. These should be periodically reported  to and reviewed by senior management.   Highlight the role of individuals as the first line of defence, response and  recovery. Training plays a prominent role in raising awareness and developing  capacity in responding to cyber incidents.   For effective incident response, prioritise response capabilities to focus on key  business-critical assets / services / departments / divisions / business units,  along with the organisations they are connected to in order to contain a potential cyber  incident.

ASSESSING CYBERSECURITY  MATURITY  5.1 INTRODUCTION  Phase four goes beyond the adoption of baseline security measures to identify areas where port  operators can improve their cybersecurity maturity. The process of cybersecurity maturity self-  assessment can support organisations in their efforts to understand where they currently stand  in terms of maturity in security domains – or individual security measures – of interest and plan  their organisational progression accordingly.  Identifying where organisations need to improve their cybersecurity practices informs the  prioritisation and allocation of limited resources that will result in the most effective outcome.  This chapter lists the security measures proposed in the 2019 ENISA report and introduces  maturity levels that port operators can select to help prioritise security measures and conduct a  self-assessment for the purpose of determining their current maturity level.  Results from this  effort will guide stakeholders in their selection of security measures and better understand the  specific actions they should undertake in order to improve their organisational cybersecurity  capabilities, and thus achieve higher maturity levels.  A maturity self-assessment model is a set of characteristics, attributes, indicators, or patterns  that represent capability and progression in a particular discipline. This provides a benchmark  against which an organisation can evaluate the current level of capability exhibited by the day-  to-day implementation of its controls, practices, processes, tools, and personnel, and supports  stakeholders in their effort to set goals and priorities for continuous improvement  A maturity model approach relies on the fact that effective cyber risk management cannot be  achieved through a “checklist mentality”, since cyber threats represent a persistent, constantly  evolving risk to port operations. Achieving and sustaining organisational cyber resiliency  requires effective cyber risk assessment and management at an organisational level.  The first step to effective cyber resilience is the establishment of an organisation-wide  cybersecurity capability baseline that is commensurate with the nature and scale of the cyber  risks associated with its operations and supporting supply chain. To establish a realistic  baseline requires that port organisations gain situational awareness of their current  cybersecurity capabilities and identify the cybersecurity capability gaps that may exist.  The next step includes the “institutionalisation” of the organisation’s existing cybersecurity  capability posture, throughout the various business assets, services, and processes. This is  achieved through structured and well-defined recurring activities focused on maintaining an  increased cyber risk awareness, revised risk-based behaviours, and appropriate resource  allocation (people, processes, tools and funding).  The approach proposed here is based on the introduction of maturity levels of implementation  for the security measures proposed in the 2019 ENISA report on Port Cybersecurity. Each  maturity level includes a description of what the organisation needs to put in place in order to  achieve the respective level.  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  29  5.2 RELATED CHALLENGES   Lack of communication between the departments responsible for physical security  and cybersecurity. Poor (or lack of) effective communication is frequently exacerbated  by the fact that in the majority of cases personnel responsible for physical security risk  management fail to communicate with and/or involve cybersecurity or IT experts in  security planning, coordination, and preparation activities.13   The IT department is tasked to assume the responsibility for cybersecurity  without appropriate training or internal coordination with other departments.   IT and OT systems are the responsibility of different working groups or  divisions, and, therefore, fall under different organisational authorities (usually IT and  Technical). Thus, efforts to develop a holistic cybersecurity strategy that address both  IT and OT systems are often uncoordinated and inconsistently resourced.   Cybersecurity maturity varies among different groups or operating divisions across the  organisation, including senior management and board of directors. This is usually a  result of a lack of organisation-wide cyber awareness and related cyber training,  including tailored training for executives.   Lack of available resources (people, processes, tools, budget, time) to fully organize,  develop, conduct and regularly update the organisation’s baseline cyber risk  assessment.   Difficulty in staffing. This is exacerbated by the shortage of cybersecurity experts  currently available in the global market.   Difficulty in assigning internal roles. This is worsened by the difficulty among key  stakeholders in fully apprehending the nature of the cyber threat.   Difficulty in managing internal change. Organisations finding it difficult to  encompass and comprehend changes made to existing policies and procedures  regarding cybersecurity.   Difficulty in third-party management. Larger organisations with several business  units and external partners are finding it difficult to implement a consistent cyber risk  management approach across their organisation.   Variety of cyber risk assessment standards/frameworks. The large number of  standards regarding IT security, cybersecurity or risk assessment is causing confusion  to port stakeholders, making the selection and implementation of the appropriate  standard or framework challenging for organisations with limited resources or low cyber  maturity.   Fragmentation and distribution of governance of ports operators. Ports are  characterized by a very fragmented and distributed governance especially in the  private sector. Frequently, organisations or entities responsible for part/full of  operations at ports comprise multiple stakeholders, and cybersecurity responsibilities  are unclear and complex to implement.  5.3 RELATED GOOD PRACTICES   Ensure the cyber risk assessment includes all aspects of the scoped  environment.  As cybersecurity is not only an IT issue, linking it to all plans, policies,  resources and capabilities are included to ensure a more accurate determination of the  current cybersecurity state and the implementation of cyber risk assessment good  practices.   Implement cybersecurity awareness and technical training programmes.  Awareness training represents a fundamental capability in addressing several of the  aforementioned challenges.  Standardized training ensures consistency in establishing  13 A key common factor behind all these challenges is how cybersecurity is positioned in the maritime sector. Cyber security  is still mainly viewed as an IT problem. Isolating cybersecurity in the IT department and lack of appropriate reporting lines  for cyber risk within the organisation results in limitations in terms of responsibility, competences, approach, resources,  budget, etc.  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  30  minimum cybersecurity awareness across all staff irrespective of their functional  activities.  Also, develop and deploy specific content that is relevant for the  organisation’s operating environment and to educate staff specifically on how to safely  and securely access and use corporate, software-enabled, assets and equipment.   Formally organize a cybersecurity working group. Staff with key leadership and/or  representatives from each of the organisation’s operational areas and/or divisions. All  functions of the organisation should be represented, and individuals should be  assigned specific responsibilities. Establish a regular schedule, preferably monthly, and  grant appropriate authorities to the group to support cyber risk management activities.  The working group size will vary by organisation.   Seek advice from external sources, such as contracting governments,  national/international competent authorities or private companies. Using external  assistance to secure guidance on how best to implement and sustain cyber risk  assessment standards/ frameworks can help an organisation avoid repeating mistakes.   Develop a cybersecurity programme. This should include a cyber risk management  strategy that is supported by documented plans, policies, procedures, and internal  guidelines informed by referenced standards. This should identify and define the  cybersecurity working group, resource allocations, training, performance objectives,  budgets and the various cyber risk management activities that are performed to meet  defined cybersecurity objectives.  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  31  Figure 8: Mapping of good practices against challenges in addressing cybersecurity maturity  5.4 PORT CYBERSECURITY MATURITY LEVELS  The proposed approach is structured to (1) assess an organisation’s cybersecurity capabilities  over three maturity levels and (2) follow a dual progression approach that characterizes both  capability progression and institutionalisation is adopted:   Capability progression measures the degree to which the organisation has  implemented cybersecurity capabilities (people, processes, tools, and funding).   Institutionalisation measures how deeply entrenched specific activities, controls,  processes, and procedures are within and across the organisation. The more ingrained  these are, the more likely the organisation will maintain them consistently during and  after an incident.  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  32  Additionally, the three maturity levels of the proposed approach are defined in Table 2.  Table 2: Maturity level definitions  Maturity Level Description  1  (Basic)  This level corresponds to the minimum-security measures that are implemented  to achieve a security objective. The organisation performs baseline activities  and/or capabilities, even in an ad hoc manner.  2  (Intermediate)  This level corresponds to more sustained capabilities that align with identified  standards and best practices. The organisation implements, manages, monitors,  and measures capabilities against defined objectives and operational applicability.  Documentation (i.e. plans and policies) guides the application and utilisation of  resources for specific and/or coordinated activities.  3  (Optimal)  This level corresponds to activities and/or capabilities that are planned, tested,  policy-informed, and repeatable; subject to regular oversight and reviews to  confirm effectiveness; and improve the implementation of security measures,  taking into account disciplined changes, tests, and exercises. The organisation  regularly measures capabilities to support continuous improvement efforts to  attain and sustain defined performance objectives.  Section 5.5 provides examples of the proposed maturity levels for the security measures  defined in the ENISA 2019 report. Port operators can use the information therein as follows:  1. Following their own implementation of the previous risk assessment/management  phases, port operators can identify a list of security measures that are most relevant to  them.  2. Port operators can then review the policies, practices and technical measures  throughout the tables in section 5.5. For each security measure, the respective  maturity level indicates examples or evidence that the measure is implemented at a  specific maturity level.  3. Port operators should carefully consider the evidence/examples to ensure relevance to  their operational environment and appropriateness to capabilities.  For example,  operators such as customs are not required to consider examples related to  PSPs/PFSPs requirements, while a port authority may have a Port Security Officer but  not a Port Facility Security Officer. Similarly, the examples/evidence provided should  be tailored by the port operator to match their organisation’s unique characteristics  regarding cyber risk management (e.g. terminology, information security framework  etc.).  4. Port operators should assess their current maturity level in terms of implementing the  selected security measures by determining how their current practices map to the  maturity levels of the provided examples/evidence. It’s important to note that in many  cases a port operator may select one or more security measures that may result in an  organizational cybersecurity posture that reflects variable maturity levels.  5. Port operators can identify priorities for improvement depending on specific needs, as  well as determine the viability of and benefits derived from actions that can be easily  and quickly implemented.

SUMMARY  This report offers some practical and actionable good practices to support port operators in  conducting effective cyber risk management. Regardless of the framework or methodology used  to conduct a cyber risk assessment, port operators are typically confronted by the same  challenges related to the complexity of the increasingly integrated IT/OT environment, lack of  expertise, security risk management responsibilities split between different operational areas  and/or business units, etc. The proposed good practices in this report can be implemented in  alignment with any standard risk management methodology, including the framework defined in  the ISPS Code, Regulation 725/2004 and Directive 2005/65.  Moreover, this report offers  practical guidance on how port operators can use the taxonomies introduced in ENISA’s 2019  report on Port Cybersecurity to support their cyber risk management activities. Finally, building  on the security measures described in the 2019 ENISA report, this document introduces three  maturity levels for assessing their organisational cybersecurity capability maturity. Findings  derived from these efforts can be used to identify operational vulnerabilities, prioritize security  and allocate their cybersecurity resources in a sustainable manner.  People responsible for cyber risk management in port operators can use this document by  tailoring the guidelines, good practices and resources presented for each phase of the  proposed four-phase approach to their own cyber risk management methodologies and  operational and organisational context. Moreover, for each phase port operators may consult  the relevant list of common challenges to identify those good practices most relevant to their  needs. The four phases are:   Phase 1: Identifying cyber-related assets and services; port operators may use the  guidelines, good practices and resources/taxonomies presented here to identify their  assets and services that should be addressed in the context of cyber risk management  more effectively   Phase 2: Identifying and evaluating cyber-related risks; port operators may adapt the  guidelines, good practices and use the relevant taxonomies in the context of their risk  identification and evaluation methodologies.   Phase 3: Identifying security measures; port operators may use the guidelines, good  practices and reference security measures to prioritise those security measures that  would be most impactful and practical in the context of their own cyber risk  management.   Phase 4: Assessing cybersecurity maturity; port operators may adapt and employ the  proposed model in performing cybersecurity maturity self-assessments for the security  measures selected in phase 3, identifying priorities for investing resources for  improvement and/or building the programmatic foundations for organisational  cybersecurity maturity.

However, contrary to  traditional security risk management, addressing cyber risks introduces entirely new challenges  for port operators who often lack the internal expertise, organisational structure and processes  or the resources to effectively assess and mitigate them. Moreover, the nature of port  operations and, especially, the interconnectedness and service inter-dependencies across port  ecosystems requires all involved operators to achieve and maintain a baseline level of  cybersecurity.  This report aims to provide port operators with good practices for cyber risk assessment  that they can adapt to whatever risk assessment methodology they follow. In order to  achieve this, this report introduces a four-phase approach to cyber risk management for  port operators, which follows common risk management principles and is mapped to the  steps of the risk assessment methodology that is laid out in the ISPS Code1 and relevant  EU legislation for Port and Port Facility Security.  Specifically, the four phases are:   Phase 1: Identifying cyber-related assets and services   Phase 2: Identifying and evaluating cyber-related risks   Phase 3: Identifying security measures   Phase 4: Assessing cybersecurity maturity  For each of these phases, this report provides actionable guidelines to assist port operators in  their efforts, lists common challenges associated with the performance of the relevant activities,  good practices that can be readily adopted and customised by individual organisations and a  mapping of the listed good practices for each phase with the respective challenges they  address. The proposed guidelines and good practices may be adapted to any common cyber  risk management methodology and can be tailored to the unique characteristics of port  operators of different sizes, cybersecurity maturity, information security budgets and operational  scope.  Phase four of this approach also introduces a model for port operators to perform cybersecurity  maturity self-assessment founded on the selected security measures and to identify priorities for  investing resources for either improving on or building an organisational cybersecurity maturity  program.  1 http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Security/Guide_to_Maritime_Security/Pages/SOLAS-XI-2%20ISPS%20Code.aspx  http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Security/Guide_to_Maritime_Security/Pages/SOLAS-XI-2%20ISPS%20Code.aspx  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  8  1. INTRODUCTION  Ports serve a critical function in facilitating domestic and international supply-chain activities by  connecting sea and inland transport services. In the EU seaports play a significant role,  supporting 90 percent of EU exports and an additional 43 percent of internal market exchange2.  Ports are considered as critical information infrastructure for water transport. The Directive  2016/1148 (NIS Directive)3 classifies managing bodies of ports (defined as “any specified area  of land and water, with boundaries defined by the Member State MS in which the port is  situated, containing works and equipment designed to facilitate commercial maritime transport  operations” in the Directive 2005/65/EC4), including their port facilities (defined as “a location  where the ship/port interface takes place; this includes areas such as anchorages, awaiting  berths and approaches from seaward, as appropriate” in the Regulation (EC) No 725/20045)  and entities operating works and equipment contained within ports as eligible to be identified as  Operators of Essential Services (OES).  This report builds on the Port Cybersecurity: Good Practices for Cybersecurity in the Maritime  Sector report6 published in November 2019 by ENISA, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity and  provides additional guidelines to port operators for managing their cyber risks.  1.1 BACKGROUND  The NIS Directive requires OES to conduct risk assessments that “cover all operations  including the security, integrity and resilience of network and information systems”7.  According to the NIS Directive, these risk assessments, along with the implementation of  appropriate mitigation measures, should promote “a culture of risk management” to be  developed through “appropriate regulatory requirements and voluntary industry practices”8.  While some EU Member States (MS) have issued relevant guidance to port operators on how to  conduct cyber risk assessment (see Annex A for reference), most port operators have chosen to  adopt one of the different methodologies introduced in the various industry standards (see  Annex B for reference). However, there is no common methodology for port cyber risk  assessment.  Of the three types of port OES defined in the NIS Directive, the closest framework to a common  risk assessment methodology is the International Maritime Organisation’s International Ship  and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code, which concerns port facilities / terminal operators. The  ISPS code is implemented in the EU by Regulation 725/2004 and ensures that port facilities  implement Port Facility Security Assessments (PFSAs) and Port Facility Security Plans  (PFSPs). The ISPS Code focuses primarily on physical security, though Part B, paragraph  15.3.5 of the Code recommends that the PFSA address computer systems and networks. It  further specifically identifies radio and telecommunication systems, including computer systems  and networks, and associated procedural policies. The ISPS code also defines minimum port  facility security assessment elements/steps. EU Directive 2005/65 on enhancing port  security9 introduces similar requirements and extends them to ports, namely with the  2 https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime_en  3 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148  4 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:310:0028:0039:FR:PDF  5 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/En/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32004R0725  6 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/port-cybersecurity-good-practices-for-cybersecurity-in-the-maritime-sector  7 See paragraph (13) page L.194/3 of https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN  8 See paragraph (44) page L.194/8 of https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN  9 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32005L0065  https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime_en https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:310:0028:0039:FR:PDF https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/En/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32004R0725 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/port-cybersecurity-good-practices-for-cybersecurity-in-the-maritime-sector https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32005L0065  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  9  implementation of Port Security Plans (PSP) and Port Security Assessments (PSA). These  measures should apply to all ports in which one or more port facilities covered by Regulation  (EC) No 725/2004 are situated. Annex I of the Directive describes the minimum requirements  for conducting a PSA in the same manner as Regulation 725/2004. PSAs shall take due  account of the specificities of different sections of a port and, where deemed applicable by the  relevant authority of the MS, of its adjacent areas if these have an impact on security in the port  and shall take into account the assessments for port facilities within their boundaries as carried  out pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 725/2004.  Stocktaking for this report revealed that a fragmented approach in the performance of cyber risk  assessments occurs across the EU port sector. Almost without exception, each port’s attempt to  address cyber risk within context of existing security risk assessment frameworks and  standards, followed a unique approach. Even more, port facilities complying with ISPS Code  requirements indicated that significant gaps emerged in their organisational cyber risk  assessments.  Inconsistent approaches represented only half the challenge. Key aspects of  organisations were left un-assessed due to a variety of factors that included but were not limited  to port resource availability and variability, variations in stakeholder knowledge and degrees of  engagement, compliance based focus, and inconsistent perceptions in how cyber risk can affect  a port facility’s operations.  1.2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  This report aims to provide port operators with a set of guidelines and good practices to  effectively manage commonly referenced cyber risk management challenges. Specifically, the  objectives of this report are established to provide port operators with:   Good practices for cyber risk assessment that can be adapted to a range of risk  assessment methodologies;   Actionable guidelines that make effective use of the taxonomies (e.g. assets, threats  etc.) presented in the 2019 ENISA report; and,   A framework for identifying appropriate cybersecurity measures to address cyber risks  and to conduct a cybersecurity maturity self-assessment that will facilitate the  development, prioritisation, and efficient allocation of cybersecurity budgets.  1.3 STUDY SCOPE   This study outlines good practices for cyber risk management in the maritime port  ecosystem concerning both IT systems and OT systems.   The port ecosystem comprises all the stakeholder groups involved in port operations:  port managing bodies (Port Authorities, terminal and facility operators), national  authorities (customs, police, cities, etc.), transport companies (shipping companies,  railway companies, etc.) and all the service providers essential to port operations (oil  companies, energy companies, etc.).  1.4 TARGET AUDIENCE  The primary target audience of this study are people responsible for cybersecurity (CISOs,  CIOs etc.) within operators in the port ecosystem, namely   Port Authorities;   Port facilities / terminal operators;   Other entities operating within ports.  In addition, the study can be useful for National Competent Authorities who may wish to develop  guidance for port operators to support them in conducting cyber risk assessment or  cybersecurity maturity self-assessment.  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  10  1.5 USING THIS DOCUMENT  This report introduces a four-phase approach to cyber risk management for port operators,  which follows common principles of risk management10 11. The approach is not intended to  provide a comprehensive methodology for cyber risk management but rather provide actionable  guidelines for managing cyber risk that can be mapped to any framework or methodology  the port operator is currently using or may wish to use.  The first three phases are also mapped to the steps of the risk assessment methodology  (minimum assessment requirements) articulated in the ISPS Code, Regulation 725/2004 and  described in Annex I of Directive 2005/65. The fourth phase introduces a model for port  operators to employ in performing cybersecurity maturity self-assessments for the selected  security measures, identifying priorities for investing resources for improvement and/or building  the programmatic foundations for organisational cybersecurity maturity. The four phases are:   Phase 1: Identifying cyber-related assets and services (ISPS Code Section 15.5.1:  Identification and evaluation of important assets and infrastructure it is important to  protect)   Phase 2: Identifying and evaluating cyber-related risks (ISPS Code Section 15.5.2:  Identification of possible threats to the assets and infrastructure and the likelihood of  their occurrence, in order to establish and prioritize security measures, ISPS Code  Section 15.5.4: Identification of weaknesses, including human factors in the  infrastructure, policies and procedures)   Phase 3: Identifying security measures (ISPS Code Section 15.5.3: Identification,  selection and prioritization of counter measures and procedural changes and their level  of effectiveness in reducing vulnerability)   Phase 4: Assessing cybersecurity maturity  Figure 1: Cyber risk management phases  Each of these four phases is reviewed in Chapters 2 – 5, respectively, with a specific emphasis  on the following themes:   Actionable guidelines to assist port operators in their efforts to perform each phase.  These include specific guidance in how to effectively apply the various taxonomies  presented in ENISA’s Port Cybersecurity report of 201912.   Challenges associated with the performance of activities as reported by port  stakeholders who were interviewed/surveyed for this report.   Good practices that can be readily adopted and customised by individual  organisations and easily tailored and integrated into any risk assessment methodology  utilised by port operators.   A mapping of the listed good practices for each phase with the respective  challenges they address.  10 ISO 31000:2018, Risk management – Guidelines  11 ISO 31010:2009 – Risk Management – Risk assessment techniques  12 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/port-cybersecurity-good-practices-for-cybersecurity-in-the-maritime-sector  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/port-cybersecurity-good-practices-for-cybersecurity-in-the-maritime-sector  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  11  1.6 METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH  Figure 2: Methodology adopted for the study  Task 1 - Definition of the project scope and identification of experts: This first step  consisted of establishing the scope of the project and selecting subject matter experts whose  input and insights were considered for the development of the report.  Task 2 - Desktop research: This involved the collection of information from reports, white  papers, and guidelines, as well as EU and (inter-)national regulations and industry-specific  standards concerning cybersecurity risk management and relevant maturity models.  Task 3 - Questionnaire and series of interviews with selected subject matter experts:  During this task interviews were conducted and an online survey was designed and published  by ENISA to collect additional information. Specifically, 18 semi-structured interviews were  performed with stakeholders representing 11 EU Member States and 49 responses were  collected from the survey, which collectively represented a wide cross-section of port industry  stakeholders from 16 EU member states. Overall, inputs were collected from 20 port authorities,  17 terminal operators, 6 EU National Competent Authorities including EMSA, 17 shipping  companies, 4 service providers and an EU research institute.  Task 4 - Analysis of collected material and report development: All inputs collected from  desktop research efforts and collaboration with stakeholders were thoroughly analysed. Based  on this analysis, the first draft of this report was developed.  Task 5 - Review and validation: The report was reviewed with and subsequently validated by  ENISA's subject matter experts. Feedback was solicited and provided by experts throughout  this process.  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  12  2. IDENTIFYING CYBER-RELATED  ASSETS AND SERVICES  2.1 GUIDELINES FOR IDENTIFYING CYBER-RELATED ASSETS AND  SERVICES  Phase one focuses on the identification of key IT and OT assets and the port services they  support. In general, port operators should follow a service-based risk assessment in order to  focus mainly on the aggregated business/operational impact of risks, However, port operators  functioning at a more nascent stage of cybersecurity maturity will likely focus initial efforts on  asset identification and enumeration.  The identification and evaluation of these assets, systems and services is not necessarily  constrained to the organisation’s own operational ecosystem. Ports represent complex  ecosystems where assets and systems are increasingly integrated and interconnected, resulting  in service-based interdependencies and voluminous data exchanges that occur every day.  At the same time external third-party stakeholders (partners, vendors) frequently request or  maintain continuous access to port IT/OT assets, systems, supporting infrastructure, and data,  exponentially increasing the attack surface for potential malicious cyber threat actors. With all  those touch points, especially those found in port community system enabled environments,  vulnerabilities will inevitably arise.  Within the context of this digital environment the port must be  able to assess its ability to continue provisioning services in the event an asset, system or  service is rendered unavailable as a result of a cyber incident, and also understand the extent to  which rapid re-establishment of normal operation is possible.  Specific actions that port operators can perform include:   Identify cyber-related assets and related services   Develop indicators to assess cybersecurity incident impact on cyber-related assets and  related services (e.g. number of users affected, economic impact, environmental  impact, recovery time objectives etc.)   Assess impact on the availability of cyber-related assets and related services   Assess impact on the integrity of cyber-related assets and related services   Assess impact on the confidentiality of cyber-related assets and related services   Identify internal dependencies   Identify external dependencies with third parties  ENISA’s 2019 report on Port Cybersecurity identifies the main port services and infrastructure  and presents a port asset taxonomy. Port operators can use the proposed taxonomies as the  basis to identify their key cyber-related assets and services. The high-level categories of these  assets and services are depicted in Figure 3, while the ENISA 2019 report provides a detailed  description of each taxonomy.  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  13  Figure 3: High-level categories of port assets and services  2.2 RELATED CHALLENGES   Difficulty in identifying vulnerable IT and OT systems. As different  departments/divisions handle a variety of IT and OT equipment, identifying the  vulnerable systems based on predefined criteria is challenging.   Difficulty in compiling and maintaining IT and OT systems risk registries.   Difficulty in evaluating 3rd party-managed assets and services.   Difficulty in attributing all assets, applications, systems and staff that relate to the  provisioning of specific services. This involves data creation, processing,  transmission, exchange, and storage, which involves numerous stakeholders, both  internally and externally.  Increasing integration, technology refresh, evolution and  integration create a range of challenges.   Difficulty in handling configuration management of OT systems. Most OT systems  providers do not offer access to extensive configuration management interfaces such  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  14  as user and system settings, which result in supply chain dependencies based more  heavily on vendor support availability.   Difficulty in applying automated tools for identifying cyber-related assets, since  the deployment of such tools may inadvertently interfere with the normal functioning of  critical OT assets, which may rely on legacy system/software or reside on segmented  networks.   Difficulty in managing the procurement of software-enabled assets and stand-  alone applications due to local performance, compliance and/or certification  requirements resulting in varying procurement mechanisms. This challenge is greater  for large organisations with multiple business units, i.e. a company operating several  port terminals around the globe.  2.3 RELATED GOOD PRACTICES   Define the assessment focus. It is critical to define the specific focus of the  assessment based on the unique characteristics of the port operator.  An assessment  can be asset-based or service-based, such as loading and unloading of containers,  where several applications and assets are used to deliver specific services.   Maintain an asset inventory for cyber-related assets.   Assets should be identified and registered in the asset inventory by the System  they relate to.   Assets should be identified and registered in the asset inventory by the Service  they support.   Assets should be identified and registered in the asset inventory by the Information  they handle.   Dependencies should be identified on the technical interface (and/or data  exchange) requirements with third party software.   Dependencies should be identified on the technical interface (and/or data  exchange) requirements with vendors.   Dependencies should be identified on the technical interface (and/or data  exchange) requirements between IT and OT systems.   Deploy automated tools for asset identification, logging and monitoring.   Include the department/division responsible for cybersecurity in procurement  contract review and implementation in order to ensure cybersecurity is addressed.

IDENTIFYING AND EVALUATING  CYBER-RELATED RISKS  3.1 GUIDELINES FOR IDENTIFYING AND EVALUATING CYBER-  RELATED RISKS  Phase two focuses on the identification and evaluation of cyber risks related to the assets and  services identified in phase one. There exist a variety of methodologies and frameworks that  offer detailed steps for how risk identification and evaluation should occur. For instance, the  ISPS Code recognizes threat identification and vulnerability identification as essential and  distinct activities in the performance of a port facility security assessment. Regardless of the  methodology, framework or standard employed, results derived from this phase should include  the identification of all relevant risks, which should be accompanied by an analysis of their  likelihood and potential impact expressed in either a quantitative (e.g. score-based) or  qualitative way.  Specific actions that port operators can perform include:   Contextualise the risk identification and evaluation process   Identify cyber-related threats   Identify vulnerabilities to assets and services   Identify internal and external dependencies   Assess the possible likelihood and impact of a cybersecurity incident   Adopt a specific methodology for identifying and evaluating risks (e.g. scenario-based,  empirical, data-driven, workshops/brainstorming sessions etc.)   Develop indicators (qualitative or quantitative) to evaluate identified risks  Calculating the likelihood of occurrence of a cyber incident, along with identifying related  vulnerabilities to assets, services, policies and procedures, is critical to establishing and  prioritizing mitigation measures. It is commonly recognized by port stakeholders that although  relatively minor threats may individually result in negligible impact to operations, a series of  cascading minor threats, if left unaddressed, does harbour the potential to cause major  disruption. Therefore, the identification of vulnerabilities should not be limited to assets and  applications used in the organisation’s ecosystem. Maintaining safe and secure operations also  involves people handling the equipment and their adherence to defined policies, procedures  and operational guidelines. Ultimately, any holistic vulnerability assessment should take the  human element into consideration.  ENISA’s 2019 report on Port Cybersecurity identifies the main threats to port assets and  services and proposes a threat taxonomy and also lists the key possible impacts of cybersecurity  incidents. Port operators can use the proposed taxonomies as the basis to identify their key  cyber-related risks. The high-level categories of these threats and possible impacts are depicted  in Figure 5. ENISA’s 2019 report also provides a detailed description for each taxonomy.  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  17  Figure 5: High-level categories of threats and possible impacts of cybersecurity incidents  3.2 RELATED CHALLENGES   Cyber risk is not specifically identified in currently utilized risk assessment  methodologies.   Threats have been identified for physical security and IT security, but they are not  combined for asymmetrical risk consideration. Approved PSP/PFSPs reflect  assessment inputs that have not been updated to accommodate (let alone  acknowledge) the potential impact cyber threats pose.   Difficulty in calculating risk factors (likelihood, impact of a cyber incident)   Difficulty in calculating aggregated risk, as assets and services are increasingly  interrelated within the digital port environment.   Lack of organisation-wide cyber awareness and commensurate cyber training,  which makes it difficult for staff to consistently identify threats and recognize potential  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  18  vulnerabilities of assets and services that may exist across the organisation’s different  departments/divisions.   Lack of recordkeeping regarding past incidents and subsequent response and  recovery activities.   Lack of information/intelligence regarding IT / OT systems' vulnerabilities, actual  and/or emergent.   Lack of available resources (people, budget) to carry out an effective risk  assessment, as they are perceived to be time-consuming and costly or require  additional expenditures for obtaining information, such as automated vulnerability  scanning tools etc.   Difficulty in defining cyber residual risk/risk acceptance thresholds, based on the  organisation’s risk appetite.  3.3 RELATED GOOD PRACTICES   Perform a cyber risk assessment at the enterprise level. Engage representatives  from all the departments/divisions in order to collect accurate information and solicit  cross-functional insights.   Clearly define stakeholder responsibilities, authorities and risk ownership for  assets or services within each department/division/business unit.   The security of IT and OT systems should be the responsibility of the same  department/division.   Integrate cyber risk assessment and management with existing risk assessment and  management frameworks, such as the PSA/PFSA or PSP/PFSP and/or the  organisation’s Enterprise Risk Management Strategy.   Adopt a comprehensive and consistent approach to calculating the likelihood of  occurrence for a cyber incident, including factors such as threat actor motivation,  their available resources, access to the port IT/OT infrastructure and target-specific  knowledge.   Adopt a comprehensive and consistent approach to calculating the impact of a  cyber incident, in all business areas through a scenario-based approach that includes  legal, reputational damage, health and safety, financial damage and business  operations.   Engage in sectorial initiatives, where organisations can liaise with each other to  identify common risks, share best practices and communicate in a secure and  trusted environment.   Include cyber threat intelligence (CTI) inputs in the risk assessment methodology.  CTI is a key capability that can provide critical insights into an organisation’s potential  risk exposure. In some cases, national competent authorities and/or commercial  vendors can play a key role in the provision of such information to ports and port  facilities.   Develop a methodology to calculate residual risk/risk acceptance determinations.  All risks in the risk registry should have an Inherent, Residual, and Target risk score.  The inherent risk is the initial risk identified without any existing controls applied. If  mitigation measures are in place, the risk can be given a residual risk score. If there  are additional actions that can be taken to further mitigate that risk, it can be assigned  a target risk score. Progress should be tracked and once the actions are completed the  process can restart with the new risk score and the new inherent risk score.   Develop a methodology to track cyber risk indicators, such as the number of infected  systems per month, in order to identify trends and measure scope.   Deploy a business impact analysis methodology which provides an assessment,  using a scoring mechanism, against specific attributes, such as data Confidentiality,  Integrity, Availability, and operational safety and security. Such a tool should also  take into consideration systems’ criticality and sensitivity. This can be scenario-  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  19  based, as it is easier for all stakeholders to understand how cyber threats can affect  port operations.   Perform a cyber vulnerability assessment/penetration test. This can help identify  assets that may be unrecorded or not appropriately assessed and expose weaknesses  in the port environment.   Involve senior management in the process of defining residual risk/risk acceptance  levels.  Figure 6: Mapping of good practices against challenges in identifying and evaluating cyber-  related risks  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  20  4. IDENTIFYING SECURITY  MEASURES  4.1 GUIDELINES FOR IDENTIFYING SECURITY MEASURES  Phase three focuses on the identification and prioritisation of security measures that should be  implemented to reduce the identified risks to acceptable levels. Security measures should be  adopted following a risk-based approach that directs budget, resources and technical  capabilities towards the implementation of those security measures that will have the most  substantial impact on the organisation’s cyber risk posture. As such, this phase heavily relies on  the evaluation of the identified risks.  Specific actions that port operators can perform include:   Identify security measures to mitigate identified risks   Assess the effectiveness and impact of the security measures in terms of how they  influence the risk evaluation   Assess resource requirements for the implementation of security measures   Define a process for prioritising security measures  ENISA’s 2019 report provides a comprehensive list of baseline security measures grouped in  specific domains. When identifying security measures, port operators can reference the mapping  in Table 1 to identify which security measures are most appropriate for protecting identified  assets against acknowledged threats.

(people, time, budget) for the identification,  adoption, implementation and review of suitable mitigation measures.   Difficulty in sharing established security measures, procedures and policies, both  internally and externally, with third party stakeholders, which impedes the  development of a common approach to driving port community resilience.   Difficulty in identifying and selecting security measures based on business  continuity requirements. Most port stakeholders are currently focused on  implementing security measures in response to cyber incidents instead of adopting  proactive security measures.   The perception that any attempt to protect the entire organisation against cyber  threats may exhaust organisational resources (time consuming, costly, large  number of dedicated staff, etc.).  4.3 RELATED GOOD PRACTICES   Implement security measures based on predefined criteria, applicable to the entire  organisation, such as those that drive cost reduction, deliver risk reduction and/or  reduce the impact of a cyber incident.   Assess all security measures for risk reduction effectiveness by implementing a  scoring methodology.   Test security measures during cyber drills/exercises, or security drills/exercises  that include detailed cyber elements, both internally and externally with port  stakeholders.   Coordinate the identification, adoption and implementation of security measures  with the asset risk owner.   Adopt a ‘security-by-design’ approach in all procurement activities. Taking  cybersecurity into consideration in the conceptualisation phase of a project minimises  the need for additional allocation of resources during the operational cycle of the  asset/service.   - For less mature organisations focus on identifying and implementing security  measures that offer detection, response and recovery capabilities in the event of a  cyber incident.  - For mature organisations focus on identifying and implementing security measures  that protect the organisation’s most critical assets/services.   Consider cyber insurance as a risk reduction mitigation measure. Cyber insurance  can contribute to the organisation’s resilience by reducing risk of financial loss and can  also help to mobilize resources (e.g. funding, expertise) quickly in response to a cyber  incident.   Introduce cyber specific metrics, or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as  monitoring the availability of IT and OT assets and related services, awareness levels  of staff, number of critical security incidents etc. These should be periodically reported  to and reviewed by senior management.   Highlight the role of individuals as the first line of defence, response and  recovery. Training plays a prominent role in raising awareness and developing  capacity in responding to cyber incidents.   For effective incident response, prioritise response capabilities to focus on key  business-critical assets / services / departments / divisions / business units,  along with the organisations they are connected to in order to contain a potential cyber  incident.

ASSESSING CYBERSECURITY  MATURITY  5.1 INTRODUCTION  Phase four goes beyond the adoption of baseline security measures to identify areas where port  operators can improve their cybersecurity maturity. The process of cybersecurity maturity self-  assessment can support organisations in their efforts to understand where they currently stand  in terms of maturity in security domains – or individual security measures – of interest and plan  their organisational progression accordingly.  Identifying where organisations need to improve their cybersecurity practices informs the  prioritisation and allocation of limited resources that will result in the most effective outcome.  This chapter lists the security measures proposed in the 2019 ENISA report and introduces  maturity levels that port operators can select to help prioritise security measures and conduct a  self-assessment for the purpose of determining their current maturity level.  Results from this  effort will guide stakeholders in their selection of security measures and better understand the  specific actions they should undertake in order to improve their organisational cybersecurity  capabilities, and thus achieve higher maturity levels.  A maturity self-assessment model is a set of characteristics, attributes, indicators, or patterns  that represent capability and progression in a particular discipline. This provides a benchmark  against which an organisation can evaluate the current level of capability exhibited by the day-  to-day implementation of its controls, practices, processes, tools, and personnel, and supports  stakeholders in their effort to set goals and priorities for continuous improvement  A maturity model approach relies on the fact that effective cyber risk management cannot be  achieved through a “checklist mentality”, since cyber threats represent a persistent, constantly  evolving risk to port operations. Achieving and sustaining organisational cyber resiliency  requires effective cyber risk assessment and management at an organisational level.  The first step to effective cyber resilience is the establishment of an organisation-wide  cybersecurity capability baseline that is commensurate with the nature and scale of the cyber  risks associated with its operations and supporting supply chain. To establish a realistic  baseline requires that port organisations gain situational awareness of their current  cybersecurity capabilities and identify the cybersecurity capability gaps that may exist.  The next step includes the “institutionalisation” of the organisation’s existing cybersecurity  capability posture, throughout the various business assets, services, and processes. This is  achieved through structured and well-defined recurring activities focused on maintaining an  increased cyber risk awareness, revised risk-based behaviours, and appropriate resource  allocation (people, processes, tools and funding).  The approach proposed here is based on the introduction of maturity levels of implementation  for the security measures proposed in the 2019 ENISA report on Port Cybersecurity. Each  maturity level includes a description of what the organisation needs to put in place in order to  achieve the respective level.  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  29  5.2 RELATED CHALLENGES   Lack of communication between the departments responsible for physical security  and cybersecurity. Poor (or lack of) effective communication is frequently exacerbated  by the fact that in the majority of cases personnel responsible for physical security risk  management fail to communicate with and/or involve cybersecurity or IT experts in  security planning, coordination, and preparation activities.13   The IT department is tasked to assume the responsibility for cybersecurity  without appropriate training or internal coordination with other departments.   IT and OT systems are the responsibility of different working groups or  divisions, and, therefore, fall under different organisational authorities (usually IT and  Technical). Thus, efforts to develop a holistic cybersecurity strategy that address both  IT and OT systems are often uncoordinated and inconsistently resourced.   Cybersecurity maturity varies among different groups or operating divisions across the  organisation, including senior management and board of directors. This is usually a  result of a lack of organisation-wide cyber awareness and related cyber training,  including tailored training for executives.   Lack of available resources (people, processes, tools, budget, time) to fully organize,  develop, conduct and regularly update the organisation’s baseline cyber risk  assessment.   Difficulty in staffing. This is exacerbated by the shortage of cybersecurity experts  currently available in the global market.   Difficulty in assigning internal roles. This is worsened by the difficulty among key  stakeholders in fully apprehending the nature of the cyber threat.   Difficulty in managing internal change. Organisations finding it difficult to  encompass and comprehend changes made to existing policies and procedures  regarding cybersecurity.   Difficulty in third-party management. Larger organisations with several business  units and external partners are finding it difficult to implement a consistent cyber risk  management approach across their organisation.   Variety of cyber risk assessment standards/frameworks. The large number of  standards regarding IT security, cybersecurity or risk assessment is causing confusion  to port stakeholders, making the selection and implementation of the appropriate  standard or framework challenging for organisations with limited resources or low cyber  maturity.   Fragmentation and distribution of governance of ports operators. Ports are  characterized by a very fragmented and distributed governance especially in the  private sector. Frequently, organisations or entities responsible for part/full of  operations at ports comprise multiple stakeholders, and cybersecurity responsibilities  are unclear and complex to implement.  5.3 RELATED GOOD PRACTICES   Ensure the cyber risk assessment includes all aspects of the scoped  environment.  As cybersecurity is not only an IT issue, linking it to all plans, policies,  resources and capabilities are included to ensure a more accurate determination of the  current cybersecurity state and the implementation of cyber risk assessment good  practices.   Implement cybersecurity awareness and technical training programmes.  Awareness training represents a fundamental capability in addressing several of the  aforementioned challenges.  Standardized training ensures consistency in establishing  13 A key common factor behind all these challenges is how cybersecurity is positioned in the maritime sector. Cyber security  is still mainly viewed as an IT problem. Isolating cybersecurity in the IT department and lack of appropriate reporting lines  for cyber risk within the organisation results in limitations in terms of responsibility, competences, approach, resources,  budget, etc.  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  30  minimum cybersecurity awareness across all staff irrespective of their functional  activities.  Also, develop and deploy specific content that is relevant for the  organisation’s operating environment and to educate staff specifically on how to safely  and securely access and use corporate, software-enabled, assets and equipment.   Formally organize a cybersecurity working group. Staff with key leadership and/or  representatives from each of the organisation’s operational areas and/or divisions. All  functions of the organisation should be represented, and individuals should be  assigned specific responsibilities. Establish a regular schedule, preferably monthly, and  grant appropriate authorities to the group to support cyber risk management activities.  The working group size will vary by organisation.   Seek advice from external sources, such as contracting governments,  national/international competent authorities or private companies. Using external  assistance to secure guidance on how best to implement and sustain cyber risk  assessment standards/ frameworks can help an organisation avoid repeating mistakes.   Develop a cybersecurity programme. This should include a cyber risk management  strategy that is supported by documented plans, policies, procedures, and internal  guidelines informed by referenced standards. This should identify and define the  cybersecurity working group, resource allocations, training, performance objectives,  budgets and the various cyber risk management activities that are performed to meet  defined cybersecurity objectives.  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  31  Figure 8: Mapping of good practices against challenges in addressing cybersecurity maturity  5.4 PORT CYBERSECURITY MATURITY LEVELS  The proposed approach is structured to (1) assess an organisation’s cybersecurity capabilities  over three maturity levels and (2) follow a dual progression approach that characterizes both  capability progression and institutionalisation is adopted:   Capability progression measures the degree to which the organisation has  implemented cybersecurity capabilities (people, processes, tools, and funding).   Institutionalisation measures how deeply entrenched specific activities, controls,  processes, and procedures are within and across the organisation. The more ingrained  these are, the more likely the organisation will maintain them consistently during and  after an incident.  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  32  Additionally, the three maturity levels of the proposed approach are defined in Table 2.  Table 2: Maturity level definitions  Maturity Level Description  1  (Basic)  This level corresponds to the minimum-security measures that are implemented  to achieve a security objective. The organisation performs baseline activities  and/or capabilities, even in an ad hoc manner.  2  (Intermediate)  This level corresponds to more sustained capabilities that align with identified  standards and best practices. The organisation implements, manages, monitors,  and measures capabilities against defined objectives and operational applicability.  Documentation (i.e. plans and policies) guides the application and utilisation of  resources for specific and/or coordinated activities.  3  (Optimal)  This level corresponds to activities and/or capabilities that are planned, tested,  policy-informed, and repeatable; subject to regular oversight and reviews to  confirm effectiveness; and improve the implementation of security measures,  taking into account disciplined changes, tests, and exercises. The organisation  regularly measures capabilities to support continuous improvement efforts to  attain and sustain defined performance objectives.  Section 5.5 provides examples of the proposed maturity levels for the security measures  defined in the ENISA 2019 report. Port operators can use the information therein as follows:  1. Following their own implementation of the previous risk assessment/management  phases, port operators can identify a list of security measures that are most relevant to  them.  2. Port operators can then review the policies, practices and technical measures  throughout the tables in section 5.5. For each security measure, the respective  maturity level indicates examples or evidence that the measure is implemented at a  specific maturity level.  3. Port operators should carefully consider the evidence/examples to ensure relevance to  their operational environment and appropriateness to capabilities.  For example,  operators such as customs are not required to consider examples related to  PSPs/PFSPs requirements, while a port authority may have a Port Security Officer but  not a Port Facility Security Officer. Similarly, the examples/evidence provided should  be tailored by the port operator to match their organisation’s unique characteristics  regarding cyber risk management (e.g. terminology, information security framework  etc.).  4. Port operators should assess their current maturity level in terms of implementing the  selected security measures by determining how their current practices map to the  maturity levels of the provided examples/evidence. It’s important to note that in many  cases a port operator may select one or more security measures that may result in an  organizational cybersecurity posture that reflects variable maturity levels.  5. Port operators can identify priorities for improvement depending on specific needs, as  well as determine the viability of and benefits derived from actions that can be easily  and quickly implemented.  CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT FOR PORTS  December 2020  33  5.5 MATURITY LEVELS FOR PORT CYBERSECURITY MEASURES  5.5.1 Policies  Security measure Examples/evidence for maturity level 1 Examples/evidence for maturity level 2 Examples/evidence for maturity level 3  Security policy and organisation  PS-01: Write and implement  an information systems  security policy (ISSP), which  describes all organisational  and technical means and  procedures, including topics  related to the OT  environment.

SUMMARY  This report offers some practical and actionable good practices to support port operators in  conducting effective cyber risk management. Regardless of the framework or methodology used  to conduct a cyber risk assessment, port operators are typically confronted by the same  challenges related to the complexity of the increasingly integrated IT/OT environment, lack of  expertise, security risk management responsibilities split between different operational areas  and/or business units, etc. The proposed good practices in this report can be implemented in  alignment with any standard risk management methodology, including the framework defined in  the ISPS Code, Regulation 725/2004 and Directive 2005/65.  Moreover, this report offers  practical guidance on how port operators can use the taxonomies introduced in ENISA’s 2019  report on Port Cybersecurity to support their cyber risk management activities. Finally, building  on the security measures described in the 2019 ENISA report, this document introduces three  maturity levels for assessing their organisational cybersecurity capability maturity. Findings  derived from these efforts can be used to identify operational vulnerabilities, prioritize security  and allocate their cybersecurity resources in a sustainable manner.  People responsible for cyber risk management in port operators can use this document by  tailoring the guidelines, good practices and resources presented for each phase of the  proposed four-phase approach to their own cyber risk management methodologies and  operational and organisational context. Moreover, for each phase port operators may consult  the relevant list of common challenges to identify those good practices most relevant to their  needs. The four phases are:   Phase 1: Identifying cyber-related assets and services; port operators may use the  guidelines, good practices and resources/taxonomies presented here to identify their  assets and services that should be addressed in the context of cyber risk management  more effectively   Phase 2: Identifying and evaluating cyber-related risks; port operators may adapt the  guidelines, good practices and use the relevant taxonomies in the context of their risk  identification and evaluation methodologies.   Phase 3: Identifying security measures; port operators may use the guidelines, good  practices and reference security measures to prioritise those security measures that  would be most impactful and practical in the context of their own cyber risk  management.   Phase 4: Assessing cybersecurity maturity; port operators may adapt and employ the  proposed model in performing cybersecurity maturity self-assessments for the security  measures selected in phase 3, identifying priorities for investing resources for  improvement and/or building the programmatic foundations for organisational  cybersecurity maturity.

    "abstract": "This report aims to provide port operators with good practices for cyber risk assessment that they can adapt to whatever risk assessment methodology they follow. In order to achieve this, this report introduces a four-phase approach to cyber risk management for port operators, which follows common risk management principles and is mapped to the steps of the risk assessment methodology that is laid out in the ISPS Code and relevant EU legislation for Port and Port Facility Security. For each of these phases, this report provides actionable guidelines to assist port operators in their efforts, lists common challenges associated with the performance of the relevant activities, good practices that can be readily adopted and customised by individual organisations and a mapping of the listed good practices for each phase with the respective challenges they address."

While it initially started in a limited form, it developed to cover more and more types of cyber risk. In  comparison with other insurance sectors, cyber insurance appears to have a lower adoption rate, while the  growth projections remain high. Projections estimate the global cyber insurance market to reach $ 7.5  billion in annual sales by 2020 – tripling the 2015 figure2 – and over $ 20 billion by 20253. It is evident that  regions with established cybersecurity-related legislation, have a higher cyber insurance adoption than  regions that have recent or no formed legislation. The expected growth for the European market is  anticipated to be further accelerated by the adoption of the GDPR and NIS directive.  Many Member States are recognising the importance of addressing cyber risk, and have taken relevant  action by publishing guides of good cyber-hygiene4 5. Furthermore, insurance federations have also a great  interest on cyber insurance, with actions taking place on both European6 and national7 level. Among  others, insurers are facing challenges around the lack of cyber-security incident data8 in support of risk  assessment, gathering information on cyber security management, and the uncertainty around  accumulating risk. Further to the reported good practices, ENISA had generated the following  recommendations, directed to policy makers, insurers, and customers, for the improvement of cyber  insurance constituency:  Policy Makers   Encourage the active participation of European Commission on ENISA cyber insurance activities   Avoid the introduction of mandatory requirements that might undermine the cyber insurance  market adoption rate  Insurance Companies   Improve the areas of pre-policy risk assessment that are found as the most underseen by insurers   Invest in and advance the accumulating risk calculation   Consider adopting common standards and methodologies   Introduce explanatory sessions, and provide customer scenarios and generic examples of policy  coverage   Clarify the policy language and offer a transparent underwriting process  Cyber Insurance Customers   Be more open on sharing data, possibly under a legal agreement (e.g. NDA)   Get informed, prepare, and document their environment, before requesting a cyber insurance  policy  2 PwC “The Global State of Information Security® Survey 2016” http://pwc.to/2dqFg4Y  3 Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty “A Guide to Cyber Risk: Managing The Impact of Increasing Interconnectivity”  http://bit.ly/1YyMUrD  4 France, ANSSI “40 essential measures for a healthy network” http://bit.ly/2dr6nbA  5 United Kingdom, Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy “Cyber essentials scheme: overview”  http://bit.ly/1hkkmdz  6 i.e. Insurance Europe  7 e.g. GDV in Germany  8 ENISA “The cost of incidents affecting CIIs” http://bit.ly/2dIkNmo  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  06  1. Introduction  Cyber insurance is a product that has been created to counter residual risk associated with the information  systems of asset owners. Despite the large number of developments that have taken place over the last  few years, the cyber insurance market is yet to receive the anticipated adoption rate. While some regions  have made progress on the basis of supportive legislation, it is found that in comparison with other  insurance sectors, the state of cyber insurance is at a less mature stage. With the general data protection  regulation (GDPR) being adopted on April of 20169, and network and information security (NIS) directive10  on July 2016, the need for cyber insurance is anticipated to grow11; a growth that can be embraced by  enabling an informative product development and adoption.  Scope and Objectives  The objectives of this report are to:   Raise awareness for the most impactful market advances, by shortly identifying the most  significant cyber insurance developments for the past four years (2012-2016)   Capture the good practices and challenges during the early stages of cyber insurance lifecycle (i.e.  before an actual policy is signed) – laying the ground for future work in the area.  Audience  The primary audience is insurance companies, who can either benchmark themselves against the market  trends, or evaluate good practices before entering the market.  Additional beneficiaries are customers interested to adopt a cyber insurance policy, allowing them to take  informed decisions and prepare in advance.  Methodology  The report consists of two streams; the first one identifies the most impactful advances, and the other  captures the good practices and challenges of the insurer-driven pre-policy risk assessment.  Information gathering utilised publicly available information, and a cyber insurance stakeholders group,  including representatives from cyber insurance companies. To ensure multidimensional feedback, there  was a significant effort to have a diverse geographical and industry representation within the formed  stakeholders group. ENISA has established contact with insurance companies that have an active cyber  insurance business. Feedback was received by conducting interviews, using predefined and group- validated questions.  9 European Commission – Press Release “Joint Statement on the final adoption of the new EU rules for personal data  protection” http://bit.ly/1V3hmdM  10 European Council – Council of the European Union “EU-wide cybersecurity rules adopted by the Council”  http://bit.ly/1WCtcMv  11 EurActiv.com “New EU digital laws could boost specialised cybersecurity insurance” http://bit.ly/24sDJJF  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  07  Brief Demographics  From a total of 37 participants approximately 78% (29) of the stakeholders group is based in EU/EFTA  countries. Of these, 40% (10) of all participants comes from United Kingdom; a percentage that might be  expected, since the British market exhibits a higher level of maturity in comparison with the rest of the  region. The industry representation within the stakeholders group has been diverse, with 69% (24) of the  representatives having an Academia/Research or Insurance background, and the other 31% (13) coming  from Advisory, Defence, Finance, Gambling, Information Technology and Services, Legal Services and Non- profit. From the market of insurance organisations with a cyber insurance product, we had participation  from Finland (1), France (1), Germany (2), Greece (2), Italy (1), Netherlands (1), and Spain (1).  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  08  2. Significant Developments  With cyber insurance being a relatively new product in its’ current form12, the market and environment  that surround it are subject to change. By taking a record of the most impactful changes, it might be easier  to understand which of them make a real difference. For the purpose of this work stream, we have asked  the following question to the stakeholders group.  What would you consider as the most notable (not necessarily big, but certainly impactful)  development(s) in the area of cyber insurance, in the past four years (2012-2016)?  Awareness and Preparation  Over a third of responders had recognized the increasing threat landscape complexity, with sophisticated  attacks13 becoming prevalent and accessible by a larger number of adversaries. Modern tools can turn an  intent to an act much more efficiently than before, and new technologies introduce a larger attack surface.  This results in a growing14 recognition15 by organisations and their leadership that cyber is an operational  risk that has to be addressed. Many Member States have taken relevant action by publishing guides of  good cyber-hygiene16 17. Insurance federations have also a great interest on cyber insurance, with actions  taking place on both European18 and national19 level.  Regardless of the increasing dynamic of  awareness, the level of understanding of  an organisations’ exposure to cyber risk  is basic. It has been shown that only a  fifth (21%) of the organisations have a  clear understanding33, placing the rest in  a relatively disadvantaged position33.  Increasing awareness leads to better  preparation, which could have the form  of adopting traditional security  measures, writing a new cyber insurance  policy, or increasing existing policy  limits23. This contradicts previous ENISA  12 I.e. providing both first and third party coverage.  13 Such as: Doxing, Energy Outage, Espionage, IP theft, Vandalism  14 World Economic Forum “Global Risks 2015 10th Edition” http://bit.ly/15wPuqV  15 Financial Times “High-profile hacking raises cyber security fears” http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5870af72-e298- 11e3-a829-00144feabdc0.html  16 France, ANSSI “40 essential measures for a healthy network” http://bit.ly/2dr6nbA  17 United Kingdom, Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy “Cyber essentials scheme: overview”  http://bit.ly/1hkkmdz  18 i.e. Insurance Europe  19 e.g. GDV in Germany  4%  26%  49%  21%  To what extend do you believe your  organisation has a clear understanding of its  exposure to cyber risk?

Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  09  findings20 that an insured entity might invest less in security measures due to a policy presence.  Nowadays insurance companies not only require to know, but might also validate a customers’ preparation  level21, and may also assist them by offering cyber risk assessment resources and incident response  services.  Regulation  Regulatory changes are found to impact cyber insurance to a great extent. Whether these have the form  of mandatory notification, introduction of fines, or “right to know” for users22 – they ultimately result in a  better market preparation, of which cyber insurance is a part of. In particular, the adoption of the EU NIS  Directive and GDPR may have an effect similar to the one that relevant law-making had on the US cyber  insurance market.  GDPR is aiming to safeguard personal data, while the NIS Directive requires operators to appropriately  secure their networks and protect the service provision. Both regulations are expected to drive a high  level of interest in the Cyber insurance market, particularly for the industries explicitly identified in the  NIS Directive (Table 1).  Table 1: Types of entities for the purposes of point (4) of Article 4 of NIS Directive  20 ENISA “Incentives and barriers of the cyber insurance market in Europe” http://bit.ly/1XoMZzX  21 E.g. UK Insurance Act 2016, requiring an insured to make a “fair presentation of the risk”  22 European Commission – Press release “Agreement on Commission's EU data protection reform will boost Digital  Single Market” http://bit.ly/1J9ZUdt  Essential  Services  in Critical  Sectors  Energy (Electricity, Oil, Gas)  Transport (Air transport, Rail transport, Water transport, Road transport)  Banking  Financial market infrastructures  Health sector  Drinking water supply and distribution  Digital Infrastructure  Digital  Service  Providers  Online marketplace  Online search engine  Cloud computing service  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  10  Market Growth and Maturity  There is evidence of market improvement  despite the fact that the available data in  support of the underwriting process are  still inadequate. The growth of the cyber  insurance market23 24 (Figure 2), has led to  an increased number of claims. Claims can  function as feedback and an evolutionary  force for the market, allowing brokers and  product development to improve over  time. That improvement along with  knowing the cause of loss25 for the  majority of claims (Figure 3), can lead to  the reasonable assumption that these are  the areas where the Cyber insurance  industry has gained the most experience.  A notable example of rising maturity is the one of British-based insurers, who have been writing policies  for US-based companies for the past few years. The exposure to a more legislative environment and the  presence of the mandatory incident reporting has given a wealth of valuable lessons to these companies,  well in advance of the recently adopted EU regulations.  Service  Improvement  Insurers can now offer a  better service through  the use of efficient  management and  analytics, allowing them  to extend their portfolio  by additional offerings  such as risk assessment  and breach  investigation.  Improvements on  assessing risk over time  allow covering more risk,  which in turn may result  in the introduction of  policies that cover  physical damage – when associated with a cyber-induced incident.  23 Advisen “Information Security and Cyber Liability Risk Management” http://bit.ly/1M9Gyp0  24 Insurance Business “‘Every large firm to have cyber cover in three years,’ says Marsh leader” http://bit.ly/1X0OELc  25 NetDiligence “2015 Cyber Claims Study” http://bit.ly/1HbxynK  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  2011 2012 2013 2014 2015  Does your organisation purchase  cyber liability insurance?

Pre-Policy Risk Assessment: Key Knowledge and Good Practices  Risk assessment assists both insurers and consumers to adapt to the rapid change of the operational  environment. This chapter will present basic knowledge and good practices on the insurer-driven risk  assessment, before a policy is issued.  Key Knowledge  The following sections will present key risk assessment knowledge, as obtained by the questionnaire26  answered by representatives of insurance organisations with a cyber insurance product.  3.1.1 Business Coverage and Baseline Assessment  The vast majority of the interviewed cyber insurance companies provide cover to all business sectors. A  few notable exceptions that insurers could be hesitant to address are: Payment Service Providers – unless  they would be part of a wider service27, gambling, and the adult industry. Many insurers have recognised  the importance of the SME market and develop tailored risk modelling, products and assessment for it.  The reported industries with the highest interest for purchasing a cyber insurance policy are: Finance,  Health, ISP, Legal, and Telecommunications; with an overlap between them and the NIS Directive list of  applicable industries – which is statistically non-significant since there was no data to verify any  assumptions.  Most insurers use the following information in carrying out a basic form of an assessment (i.e. Baseline  Assessment) for all sectors, and depending on the results of it, an extended (or follow-up) assessment:   Enumeration and geographical spread of business:  o Size  o Operations  o Revenue   Detail on business:  o Sector  o Activities  o Services  o Outsourced functions  o Risk exposure   Dependencies on IT infrastructure   The use, storage, or sharing of data  o Data volume  o Data sensitivity (e.g. personal data, health, intellectual property, machine generated)  o Derived liability   Incident history (if they have been attacked)   Corporate presence in social media   Policy and claims history (if they had a policy, and any claims against it)   Requested policy limit (or risk appetite of the insured)  26 Available on document section Error! Reference source not found. Error! Reference source not found.  27 e.g. Retail  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  12  Risk assessment might be performed on the basis of an established certification such as ISO 2700x, and it is  found that the ultimate decision maker is the underwriter or insurer management, who might take into  consideration factors that are not captured through the use of standard tools.  3.1.2 Provided Coverage  The core coverage by the majority of insurers is categorised as first and third party risk coverage, as  detailed below. First party risks are the ones that directly affect the insured; while third party risks are risks  that might initially affect someone other than the insured (first party) or insurer (second party), against  which an insured would like to have coverage.  Table 2: First and Third Party Risk Coverage among most insurers  Non common coverage that has been reported to be offered by a number of insurers includes the  following: business revenue (dependent or not), digital assets disruption, insider threat (of a non- intentional nature), intellectual property, reputational harms, and targeted attacks.  Extra coverage that might take the form of an additional policy or accompanying services is: forensics,  fraud, legal costs, PR measures, and ransomware.  The few instances of coverage exclusion have been reported to be around widespread non-targeted  attacks, and third party intrusion. The later exposes a significant gap, since there is a very low number of  organisations that assesses the risk of third parties33.  3.1.3 Adopting Standards or an Audit Strategy  None of the interviewed insurance companies would require the presence of a standard for assessing the  risk of a potential client; however, standards were universally identified as evidence of good governance.  All insurers have either recommended or endorsed as good to have, compliance with the following:  GRAMM–LEACH–BLILEY ACT, HIPAA, HITECH, ISO 2700x or derivatives (e.g. DIN 27001), PCI-DSS, SOX,  First  Party  Risk  Coverage  Data breach  Data leakage  Business interruption  Cyber extortion  Third  Party  Risk  Coverage  Privacy liability  Electronic media liability  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  13  and VdS28. It might be worth mentioning that in a small number of cases, the presence of a standard would  reduce premium or limit the risk assessment to the basic assessment questions (i.e. Baseline Assessment).  While the majority of the insurers does not have an auditing requirement, they do consider it a good  practise, and would do a risk assessment whether an audit strategy is present or not. If the insurer-driven  risk assessment exposes gaps, then an audit can follow up. Furthermore, since a recurring audit is  something that most corporate customers do, not doing so would have a negative impact.  There was also evidence that audit results are found to affect not only the insurability, but also the policy  limit. A small number of insurers would look at the global external audit reports for large corporate  customers, and would require an audit for operators of essential services (as defined by NIS Directive,  Table 1).  28 Third-party certification body, subsidiary of the German Insurance Association (GDV)  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  14  Good Practices  Risk assessment is the key to assess the changing risk appetite of a business, and further allows an insurer  to assess the level of preparation of a potential client. That can take the form of filing an application (with  no further action), running an assessment29, or obtaining evidence of a previous assessment.  Cyber insurance companies assess differently a clients’ risk, and they do not uniformly accept a  certification as validation of a customers’ security level. Recently, several insurance companies have been  engaged in an effort to develop common practices, and establish a higher degree of consistency in the  market30.  When assessing a clients’ risk, insurers generally focus on the following main categories:   Dedicated Resources   Policies and Procedures   Employee Awareness   Incident Response   Security Measures   Vendor Management   Board Oversight  Using these categories enabled a structured comparison of interview findings against the anticipated  results31 32 33, and the generation of good practices; with the latter being highlighted at the end of the  following subsections. A visual and brief representation of the comparison and results can be found in  section A.2 Risk Assessment: Metrics Map.  3.2.1 Dedicated Resources  Evidence has shown that insurers attach importance to the presence of leadership roles with Information  Security focus34 within an organisation, and enumerate the number of employees that are dedicated to  Information Security. While both these points give a good indication of the dedicated resources, they could  be significantly improved by a couple of additional checks.  Equally significant to the presence of an Information Security professional among leadership. is the time  allocation to tasks other than what their role mandates; thus, it is advisable to not only evaluate the  presence of such a role, but also examine their responsibilities. That could be done by conducting an  interview, or viewing records of time and task allocation.  The reporting lines of a CISO, can impact the effectiveness of an Information Security program. It would  therefore be highly recommended to evaluate the reporting line of a CISO (or equivalent), and whether  that role is reporting directly to the CEO.35 36 37  29 Internal or external, self-assessed or not  30 Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies “Cyber Insurance Exposure Data Schema V1.0” http://bit.ly/1Pb1vVb  31 FSSCC “Purchasers’ Guide to Cyber Insurance Products” http://bit.ly/1RT3T0M  32 Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty “A Guide to Cyber Risk” http://bit.ly/1YyMUrD  33 Marsh “European 2015 Cyber Risk Survey Report” http://bit.ly/1L7XJdh  34 Such as: CIO, CISO, CPO, CSO  35 CIO “Seven reasons the CISO should report to the CEO and not the CIO” http://bit.ly/29xE5xI  36 DARKReading “Top Infosec Execs Will Eventually Report To CEOs, CISOs Say” http://ubm.io/1XkwRNw  37 ThreatTrack Security “Why Your CISO Should Report to the CEO” http://bit.ly/29FXutG  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  15  In addition, it is advisable to examine the overall resources, in respect to both quality and quantity. Since  the number of employees is not a reliable metric by itself, it could be enhanced by incorporating metrics  that would compare current skillsets against the requirements, or metrics relevant to employee  effectiveness38.  As an example of a non-employee resource metric, an insurance company could request to view a list of  completed Information Security projects, their alignment to corporate Strategy, allocated budget, and  whether they have met the Critical Success Factor (CSF). While many of these details can be confidential,  critical elements could be anonymised prior to sharing, or have an insurer view evidence and validate  compliance.  Good Practices:   Examine if leadership roles with Information Security focus have any responsibilities irrelevant to  Information Security.   Check whether the CISO (or equivalent) reports directly to the CEO.   Measure the amount and quality of resources that a company invests on Information Security.  3.2.2 Policies and Procedures  Insurers have demonstrated an advanced maturity on assessing the policies and procedures of an  organisation. However, while insurers check whether cyber security standards are followed, they were not  found to thoroughly validate the existence of a comprehensive and formal Information Security program39.  The program would have to address Information Security in all possible dimensions of security controls (i.e.  technical, administrative, and physical).  Furthermore, since working remotely40 and the use of mobile devices41 42 are potential risks in a corporate  environment, cyber insurance companies would be advised to appropriately check clients’ preparation in  that respect43.  As the mere existence of a program does not imply an advanced capability, an insurer would also have to  assess the cyber-security maturity of an organisation44.  Good Practices:   Validate the existence of a comprehensive and formal Information Security program.  o Confirm it covers technical, administrative and physical measures for data protection.  o Ensure the appropriate provisions for the security of mobile devices and teleworking.   Evaluate the cyber security maturity of the organisation.  38 As per ISO 27001, section 7.2 Competence (v. 113010)  39 As per ISO 27001, section A.6.1 Organization of information security – Internal organization (v. 113010)  40 The Guardian “The security risks of remote working” http://bit.ly/2922A7t  41 ENISA “Workplace IT: ENISA sees opportunities and risks in “Bring Your Own Device” trend” http://bit.ly/1r8gjfy  42 US-CERT “The Risks of Using Portable Devices” http://1.usa.gov/1PcTXzu  43 As per ISO 27001, section A.6.2 Organization of information security – Mobile devices and teleworking (v. 113010)  44 ENISA “Technical Guideline on Minimum Security Measures” http://bit.ly/2aWGjD0  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  16  3.2.3 Employee Awareness  While the human factor can pose a significant risk within an organisation, with proper training it can turn  out to be a valuable defence mechanism – and an enabler for current controls. For example, an untrained  employee who cannot recognise a phishing e-mail, is the weakest link for any security measure that can be  applied; while one who is vigilant, will safeguard a company not only by not becoming a victim, but also by  reporting the attempt to the appropriate department. In addition, an employee who is aware will not only  implement policies and procedures, but also understand them – something of a great value.  Insurance companies were found to verify the presence of a formal Security Awareness program, which is  a key element for securing the human factor within a company. Since phishing is the prevalent method for  malware delivery45, any simulations and exercises of such, would add a significant value to such a program.  To secure the employees’ commitment, an organisation would need to provide motives or measures for  those who repeatedly pass or fail the exercises.  Good Practices:   Check whether phishing exercises are taking place as part of a formal Security Awareness program.  o Enumerate the actions (or rewards) that are taken (or offered) to employees who  repeatedly fail (or succeed) these.  3.2.4 Incident Response  An Incident Response program defines the processes and resources that an organisation engages for  addressing any Information Security incidents. Insurers validate the existence of a potential clients’  Incident Response program in a formal form, and evaluate their tolerance level towards withstanding  several incidents.  Incident notification is a key component of NIS Directive that requires the establishment of an Incident  Response function within an organisation.  Similar to other functions, testing the capabilities of a defence mechanism is critical to the success of it;  hence, confirmation of the presence of regular exercises in support of an existing Incident Response  program46 is recommended. A valuable finding is that the presence of an incident response team has the  top positive impact on the per capita cost of a data breach47 (Figure 4).  45 Symantec “Internet Security Threat Report, Volume 21, April 2016” http://symc.ly/1Ytqm9Y  46 Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation “The Importance of a Battle-Tested  Cyber Incident Response Plan” http://bit.ly/29llUwf  47 Ponemon Institute “2016 Cost of Data Breach Study: Global Analysis” http://ibm.co/1tz141c  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  17  Figure 4: Impact of 16 factors on the per capita cost of data breach (2016)47.  Good Practise:   Confirm there are regular exercises in support of a formal Incident Response program.  3.2.5 Security Measures  Insurers have indicated as important that technical measures and solutions are checked thoroughly, and  that a defined physical access is part of their security measures evaluation. However, it is important to  receive information about any existing encryption strategy and the technologies involved, to ensure the  proper implementation of technical measures such as data backup or remote connectivity. In addition to  encryption, the proper implementation of the following would need to be confirmed:   Business Continuity Planning48   Data classification49   Data retention   Access control   Log monitoring50   Intrusion detection   Network segmentation51   Network monitoring   Vulnerability management52   Penetration testing  48 As per ISO 22301  49 As per ISO 27001, Control objectives and controls A.8.2  50 As per ISO 27001, Control objectives and controls A.12.4  51 As per ISO 27001, Control objectives and controls A.13.1.3  52 As per ISO 27001, Control objectives and controls A.12.6.1  -$14  -$12  -$6  -$5  -$5  -$3  $5  $5  $6  $7  $8  $9  $9  $9  $13  $16  -$20 -$15 -$10 -$5 $0 $5 $10 $15 $20  Third party involvement  Extensive cloud migration  Rush to notify  Consultants engaged  Lost or stolen devices  Provision of ID protection  Data classification schema  Insurance protection  Board-level involvement  CISO appointed  Extensive use of DLP  Employee training  Participation in threat sharing  BCM involvement  Extensive use of encryption  Incident response team  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  18  Good Practices:   Confirm the proper implementation of: Business Continuity Planning, data classification, data  retention, access control, log monitoring, intrusion detection, network segmentation, network  monitoring, vulnerability management, and penetration testing.   Receive information about any existing encryption strategy and the technologies involved.  3.2.6 Vendor Management  Vendor Management is a greatly overlooked weakness. It has been observed that only 23% of  organisations assess suppliers for cyber risk33. That can result in a significant exposure, since supplier  networks are outside an organisations’ control – with many examples of successful breaches supporting  that conclusion53 54 55 56.  The above finding should be of a particular attention to cyber insurance companies, since it could  significantly affect a large number of potential or existing clients. It is recommended that insurers verify  the existence of a formal third party management process, and receive details on due diligence, ongoing  oversight, and contractual obligations.57  Good Practices:   Verify the existence of a formal third party management process.   Receive details on: due diligence, ongoing oversight, and contractual obligations.  3.2.7 Board Oversight  The awareness of governing board concerning crucial information security issues is an early step for  addressing risk. Should a board become aware of such issues in an irregular or delayed manner, there is a  risk of the corrective action being unauthorised, badly timed, or disproportionate. Therefore, it is  important to evaluate the frequency of reporting cyber-security risk issues and related action to the Board.  While it is important to have knowledge of crucial information security issues, a board may have a defined  set for the approval of oversight, enough to have an impact on an organisation – without overwhelming  the board with such requests. It is strongly advised that should such a detail exists, an insurer would obtain  information about it. 58  The earlier paragraphs address the boards’ frequency of being informed, and the level of involvement in a  program. It has been found that although these two factors are of a great importance, the ongoing  communication and direction throughout an organisation is the basis upon which the decisions and  53 Computer Weekly “Home Depot traces credit card data hack to supplier compromise” http://bit.ly/1XtDWxE  54 DARK Reading “Target Breach: HVAC Contractor Systems Investigated” http://ubm.io/1Pwm8yM  55 SC Magazine “TalkTalk blames supplier for breach affecting 4m customers” http://bit.ly/1F0rIjd  56 Health IT Security “Potential Healthcare Data Breach Affects Over 19K Patients” http://bit.ly/1t9Q7mL  57 As per ISO 27001, Control objectives and controls A.15  58 IT Governance Institute “Information Security Governance: Guidance for Boards of Directors and Executive  Management, 2nd Edition” http://bit.ly/1WddA0A  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  19  messages will traverse59. An effective communication and direction would be a facilitating factor for the  decisions and information flow, which could be described as an organisations’ equivalent of a neural  network during an information security event; a slow message traversal would have a catalytic effect on  the efficiency of its’ content.  Good Practices:   Detail the frequency of reporting cyber-security risk issues and related action to the board.   Detail any existing board-level approval of oversight of the Information Security Program.   Receive details of the organisations’ internal information flow related to cyber-security, lines of  communication, including crisis communication plans.  59 KPMG “Connecting the dots: A proactive approach to cybersecurity oversight in the boardroom”  http://bit.ly/1LMAdXn  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  20  4. Challenges  The greatest challenge of insurers is the lack of cyber-security incident data in support of risk assessment,  which would further allow them to differentiate customers on the basis of risk. The establishment of  anonymized databases for cyber incidents, would help insurers better understand the risk and provide  adapted cover. A further data-related challenge is gathering information on cyber security management,  especially for multinational corporate customers with diverse activities and Mergers and Acquisitions  (M&A) history. Furthermore, while customers are willing to discuss company related information without a  record, they are less likely to share information by official documentation (e.g. incident report history,  audit report). A rising concern among a number of insurers is the uncertainty around accumulating risk;  for example, customers might not only migrate data to the cloud, but operations as well. In the event that  an incident would occur, an insurer cannot be certain about the number of customers that would be  affected. Customers will know if they use cloud, but not who else does. That concern becomes very  realistic by knowing that such threats exist60 61. An additional example can be around third-party vendors,  where a formed relationship of trust could be taken advantage by an adversary. Other items that were  noted as challenges from a smaller number of insurers are:   Lack of customer awareness on cyber insurance   Common understanding of policy terms and conditions   Lack of internal (technical) expertise   Cost calculation on the basis of an incident scenario   Utilizing predictive analytics for the assessment of potential risks and impact  It is interesting to note that recent findings on challenges, as seen on Figure 5, could possibly be tackled  together with present findings. For example, not understanding exposures or coverage, and the application  process, could be addressed by explanatory sessions. Giving the customer scenarios and examples of  policy coverage could act as a fast method to raise awareness and understanding of cyber insurance.

Recommendations and Findings  The interviews revealed a number of points that drove good practices, many of which are found to also  reduce the cost of an incident47. These can improve the insurers risk assessment by adapting priorities  and focus, include new items for evaluation – and improve customer preparedness by a thorough risk  assessment checklist.  Further to the derived good practices, the report had generated the following recommendations, directed  to policy makers, insurers, and customers, for the betterment of cyber insurance constituency:  Policy Makers   Encourage the active participation of European Commission on ENISA cyber insurance activities   Avoid the introduction of mandatory requirements that might undermine the cyber insurance  market adoption rate  Insurers – Risk Assessment   Focus on an organisations’ resources, and conduct a throughout review in terms of both quality  and quantity   Evaluate whether a customers’ policies and procedures address the prevalent threat of remote  working and mobile devices   Consider the existence of recurring exercises as a key factor for evaluating the completeness of a  customers’ response or preparedness function   Evaluate security measures on the basis of state-of-the-art practices, while considering a  customers’ environmental characteristics and needs   Review an organisations’ board involvement as thoroughly as any traditional security measure  Insurers – Risk Calculation   Invest and advance the accumulating risk calculation, particularly in the areas of vendor  management and cloud computing  Insurers – Business Enablers   Introduce explanatory sessions, and provide customer scenarios and generic examples of policy  coverage.   Clarify the policy language, and avoid using generic terminology that can be interpreted in multiple  ways   Offer a transparent underwriting process, detailing the criteria and criticality that drives pricing  Cyber insurance Customers   Be more open on sharing data, possibly under a legal agreement (e.g. NDA)   Get informed, prepare, and document their environment, before requesting a cyber insurance  policy  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  22  The past four years have been full of advances on the Cyber insurance frontier. Organisations and their  leadership have recognised the importance of cyber as an operational risk. Since the understanding on  cyber risk is basic, it is recommended that the organisations work to understand risk before addressing it.  It was of significant importance to see that, in contrast to previous ENISA findings, customers do not invest  less in (traditional) security measures due to a policy presence. The fact that insurers usually require an  annual re-assessment might be reinforcing that different customer behaviour.  Regulatory changes are resulting in better preparedness, similar to the post-legislative adoption in US.  Thus, both GDPR and NIS Directive are expected to be followed by an increased market need in EU. The  increased claims have been found to function as feedback that enhances market proposals. European  insurers who have been exposed to a more legislative environment, have obtained a wealth of valuable  lessons that can now apply in EU.  The majority of insurers cover all sectors, with many of them recognising the importance of SME market  and develop customised solutions for it. Underwriters and management are the ultimate decision makers  following a risk assessment, where they would be called to take into consideration several more variables.  The core coverage by most insurers includes first and third party risks (Table 2), with less common  coverage addressing business revenue (dependent or not), digital assets disruption, insider threat (of a  non-intentional nature), intellectual property, reputational harms, and targeted attacks. Insurers offer  extra coverage such as: forensics, fraud, legal costs, PR measures, and ransomware. The reported  coverage exclusion around widespread non-targeted attacks, and third party intrusion exposes a  significant gap, since less than a quarter of organisations are assessing suppliers for cyber risk.  The total of interviewed insurers have either recommended or endorsed as good to have, the following  third party certifications: GRAMM–LEACH–BLILEY ACT, HIPAA, HITECH, ISO 2700x or derivatives (e.g. DIN  27001), PCI-DSS, SOX, and VdS28. Auditing was not identified as a requirement but it is considered a best  practise.  The core identified challenges of insurers, in respect to pre-policy risk assessment are:   Lack of cyber-security incident data   Gathering information on cyber security management   Customers less likely to share any documentation   Uncertainty around accumulating risk  Future work could focus on individual study findings, or evaluate the pre-policy risk assessment from a  pure customers’ perspective. A current theme would be to examine the post-insurance effects on a  customers’ environment, or in-depth on market growth and check any possible relation to the industries  affected by the NIS Directive.

While it initially started in a limited form, it developed to cover more and more types of cyber risk. In  comparison with other insurance sectors, cyber insurance appears to have a lower adoption rate, while the  growth projections remain high. Projections estimate the global cyber insurance market to reach $ 7.5  billion in annual sales by 2020 – tripling the 2015 figure2 – and over $ 20 billion by 20253. It is evident that  regions with established cybersecurity-related legislation, have a higher cyber insurance adoption than  regions that have recent or no formed legislation. The expected growth for the European market is  anticipated to be further accelerated by the adoption of the GDPR and NIS directive.  Many Member States are recognising the importance of addressing cyber risk, and have taken relevant  action by publishing guides of good cyber-hygiene4 5. Furthermore, insurance federations have also a great  interest on cyber insurance, with actions taking place on both European6 and national7 level. Among  others, insurers are facing challenges around the lack of cyber-security incident data8 in support of risk  assessment, gathering information on cyber security management, and the uncertainty around  accumulating risk. Further to the reported good practices, ENISA had generated the following  recommendations, directed to policy makers, insurers, and customers, for the improvement of cyber  insurance constituency:  Policy Makers   Encourage the active participation of European Commission on ENISA cyber insurance activities   Avoid the introduction of mandatory requirements that might undermine the cyber insurance  market adoption rate  Insurance Companies   Improve the areas of pre-policy risk assessment that are found as the most underseen by insurers   Invest in and advance the accumulating risk calculation   Consider adopting common standards and methodologies   Introduce explanatory sessions, and provide customer scenarios and generic examples of policy  coverage   Clarify the policy language and offer a transparent underwriting process  Cyber Insurance Customers   Be more open on sharing data, possibly under a legal agreement (e.g. NDA)   Get informed, prepare, and document their environment, before requesting a cyber insurance  policy  2 PwC “The Global State of Information Security® Survey 2016” http://pwc.to/2dqFg4Y  3 Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty “A Guide to Cyber Risk: Managing The Impact of Increasing Interconnectivity”  http://bit.ly/1YyMUrD  4 France, ANSSI “40 essential measures for a healthy network” http://bit.ly/2dr6nbA  5 United Kingdom, Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy “Cyber essentials scheme: overview”  http://bit.ly/1hkkmdz  6 i.e. Insurance Europe  7 e.g. GDV in Germany  8 ENISA “The cost of incidents affecting CIIs” http://bit.ly/2dIkNmo  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  06  1. Introduction  Cyber insurance is a product that has been created to counter residual risk associated with the information  systems of asset owners. Despite the large number of developments that have taken place over the last  few years, the cyber insurance market is yet to receive the anticipated adoption rate. While some regions  have made progress on the basis of supportive legislation, it is found that in comparison with other  insurance sectors, the state of cyber insurance is at a less mature stage. With the general data protection  regulation (GDPR) being adopted on April of 20169, and network and information security (NIS) directive10  on July 2016, the need for cyber insurance is anticipated to grow11; a growth that can be embraced by  enabling an informative product development and adoption.  Scope and Objectives  The objectives of this report are to:   Raise awareness for the most impactful market advances, by shortly identifying the most  significant cyber insurance developments for the past four years (2012-2016)   Capture the good practices and challenges during the early stages of cyber insurance lifecycle (i.e.  before an actual policy is signed) – laying the ground for future work in the area.  Audience  The primary audience is insurance companies, who can either benchmark themselves against the market  trends, or evaluate good practices before entering the market.  Additional beneficiaries are customers interested to adopt a cyber insurance policy, allowing them to take  informed decisions and prepare in advance.  Methodology  The report consists of two streams; the first one identifies the most impactful advances, and the other  captures the good practices and challenges of the insurer-driven pre-policy risk assessment.  Information gathering utilised publicly available information, and a cyber insurance stakeholders group,  including representatives from cyber insurance companies. To ensure multidimensional feedback, there  was a significant effort to have a diverse geographical and industry representation within the formed  stakeholders group. ENISA has established contact with insurance companies that have an active cyber  insurance business. Feedback was received by conducting interviews, using predefined and group- validated questions.  9 European Commission – Press Release “Joint Statement on the final adoption of the new EU rules for personal data  protection” http://bit.ly/1V3hmdM  10 European Council – Council of the European Union “EU-wide cybersecurity rules adopted by the Council”  http://bit.ly/1WCtcMv  11 EurActiv.com “New EU digital laws could boost specialised cybersecurity insurance” http://bit.ly/24sDJJF  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  07  Brief Demographics  From a total of 37 participants approximately 78% (29) of the stakeholders group is based in EU/EFTA  countries. Of these, 40% (10) of all participants comes from United Kingdom; a percentage that might be  expected, since the British market exhibits a higher level of maturity in comparison with the rest of the  region. The industry representation within the stakeholders group has been diverse, with 69% (24) of the  representatives having an Academia/Research or Insurance background, and the other 31% (13) coming  from Advisory, Defence, Finance, Gambling, Information Technology and Services, Legal Services and Non- profit. From the market of insurance organisations with a cyber insurance product, we had participation  from Finland (1), France (1), Germany (2), Greece (2), Italy (1), Netherlands (1), and Spain (1).  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  08  2. Significant Developments  With cyber insurance being a relatively new product in its’ current form12, the market and environment  that surround it are subject to change. By taking a record of the most impactful changes, it might be easier  to understand which of them make a real difference. For the purpose of this work stream, we have asked  the following question to the stakeholders group.  What would you consider as the most notable (not necessarily big, but certainly impactful)  development(s) in the area of cyber insurance, in the past four years (2012-2016)?  Awareness and Preparation  Over a third of responders had recognized the increasing threat landscape complexity, with sophisticated  attacks13 becoming prevalent and accessible by a larger number of adversaries. Modern tools can turn an  intent to an act much more efficiently than before, and new technologies introduce a larger attack surface.  This results in a growing14 recognition15 by organisations and their leadership that cyber is an operational  risk that has to be addressed. Many Member States have taken relevant action by publishing guides of  good cyber-hygiene16 17. Insurance federations have also a great interest on cyber insurance, with actions  taking place on both European18 and national19 level.  Regardless of the increasing dynamic of  awareness, the level of understanding of  an organisations’ exposure to cyber risk  is basic. It has been shown that only a  fifth (21%) of the organisations have a  clear understanding33, placing the rest in  a relatively disadvantaged position33.  Increasing awareness leads to better  preparation, which could have the form  of adopting traditional security  measures, writing a new cyber insurance  policy, or increasing existing policy  limits23. This contradicts previous ENISA  12 I.e. providing both first and third party coverage.  13 Such as: Doxing, Energy Outage, Espionage, IP theft, Vandalism  14 World Economic Forum “Global Risks 2015 10th Edition” http://bit.ly/15wPuqV  15 Financial Times “High-profile hacking raises cyber security fears” http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5870af72-e298- 11e3-a829-00144feabdc0.html  16 France, ANSSI “40 essential measures for a healthy network” http://bit.ly/2dr6nbA  17 United Kingdom, Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy “Cyber essentials scheme: overview”  http://bit.ly/1hkkmdz  18 i.e. Insurance Europe  19 e.g. GDV in Germany  4%  26%  49%  21%  To what extend do you believe your  organisation has a clear understanding of its  exposure to cyber risk?

Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  09  findings20 that an insured entity might invest less in security measures due to a policy presence.  Nowadays insurance companies not only require to know, but might also validate a customers’ preparation  level21, and may also assist them by offering cyber risk assessment resources and incident response  services.  Regulation  Regulatory changes are found to impact cyber insurance to a great extent. Whether these have the form  of mandatory notification, introduction of fines, or “right to know” for users22 – they ultimately result in a  better market preparation, of which cyber insurance is a part of. In particular, the adoption of the EU NIS  Directive and GDPR may have an effect similar to the one that relevant law-making had on the US cyber  insurance market.  GDPR is aiming to safeguard personal data, while the NIS Directive requires operators to appropriately  secure their networks and protect the service provision. Both regulations are expected to drive a high  level of interest in the Cyber insurance market, particularly for the industries explicitly identified in the  NIS Directive (Table 1).

The growth of the cyber  insurance market23 24 (Figure 2), has led to  an increased number of claims. Claims can  function as feedback and an evolutionary  force for the market, allowing brokers and  product development to improve over  time. That improvement along with  knowing the cause of loss25 for the  majority of claims (Figure 3), can lead to  the reasonable assumption that these are  the areas where the Cyber insurance  industry has gained the most experience.  A notable example of rising maturity is the one of British-based insurers, who have been writing policies  for US-based companies for the past few years. The exposure to a more legislative environment and the  presence of the mandatory incident reporting has given a wealth of valuable lessons to these companies,  well in advance of the recently adopted EU regulations.  Service  Improvement  Insurers can now offer a  better service through  the use of efficient  management and  analytics, allowing them  to extend their portfolio  by additional offerings  such as risk assessment  and breach  investigation.  Improvements on  assessing risk over time  allow covering more risk,  which in turn may result  in the introduction of  policies that cover  physical damage – when associated with a cyber-induced incident.  23 Advisen “Information Security and Cyber Liability Risk Management” http://bit.ly/1M9Gyp0  24 Insurance Business “‘Every large firm to have cyber cover in three years,’ says Marsh leader” http://bit.ly/1X0OELc  25 NetDiligence “2015 Cyber Claims Study” http://bit.ly/1HbxynK  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  2011 2012 2013 2014 2015  Does your organisation purchase  cyber liability insurance?

Pre-Policy Risk Assessment: Key Knowledge and Good Practices  Risk assessment assists both insurers and consumers to adapt to the rapid change of the operational  environment. This chapter will present basic knowledge and good practices on the insurer-driven risk  assessment, before a policy is issued.  Key Knowledge  The following sections will present key risk assessment knowledge, as obtained by the questionnaire26  answered by representatives of insurance organisations with a cyber insurance product.  3.1.1 Business Coverage and Baseline Assessment  The vast majority of the interviewed cyber insurance companies provide cover to all business sectors. A  few notable exceptions that insurers could be hesitant to address are: Payment Service Providers – unless  they would be part of a wider service27, gambling, and the adult industry. Many insurers have recognised  the importance of the SME market and develop tailored risk modelling, products and assessment for it.  The reported industries with the highest interest for purchasing a cyber insurance policy are: Finance,  Health, ISP, Legal, and Telecommunications; with an overlap between them and the NIS Directive list of  applicable industries – which is statistically non-significant since there was no data to verify any  assumptions.  Most insurers use the following information in carrying out a basic form of an assessment (i.e. Baseline  Assessment) for all sectors, and depending on the results of it, an extended (or follow-up) assessment:   Enumeration and geographical spread of business:  o Size  o Operations  o Revenue   Detail on business:  o Sector  o Activities  o Services  o Outsourced functions  o Risk exposure   Dependencies on IT infrastructure   The use, storage, or sharing of data  o Data volume  o Data sensitivity (e.g. personal data, health, intellectual property, machine generated)  o Derived liability   Incident history (if they have been attacked)   Corporate presence in social media   Policy and claims history (if they had a policy, and any claims against it)   Requested policy limit (or risk appetite of the insured)  26 Available on document section Error! Reference source not found. Error! Reference source not found.  27 e.g. Retail  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  12  Risk assessment might be performed on the basis of an established certification such as ISO 2700x, and it is  found that the ultimate decision maker is the underwriter or insurer management, who might take into  consideration factors that are not captured through the use of standard tools.  3.1.2 Provided Coverage  The core coverage by the majority of insurers is categorised as first and third party risk coverage, as  detailed below. First party risks are the ones that directly affect the insured; while third party risks are risks  that might initially affect someone other than the insured (first party) or insurer (second party), against  which an insured would like to have coverage.  Table 2: First and Third Party Risk Coverage among most insurers  Non common coverage that has been reported to be offered by a number of insurers includes the  following: business revenue (dependent or not), digital assets disruption, insider threat (of a non- intentional nature), intellectual property, reputational harms, and targeted attacks.  Extra coverage that might take the form of an additional policy or accompanying services is: forensics,  fraud, legal costs, PR measures, and ransomware.  The few instances of coverage exclusion have been reported to be around widespread non-targeted  attacks, and third party intrusion. The later exposes a significant gap, since there is a very low number of  organisations that assesses the risk of third parties33.  3.1.3 Adopting Standards or an Audit Strategy  None of the interviewed insurance companies would require the presence of a standard for assessing the  risk of a potential client; however, standards were universally identified as evidence of good governance.  All insurers have either recommended or endorsed as good to have, compliance with the following:  GRAMM–LEACH–BLILEY ACT, HIPAA, HITECH, ISO 2700x or derivatives (e.g. DIN 27001), PCI-DSS, SOX,  First  Party  Risk  Coverage  Data breach  Data leakage  Business interruption  Cyber extortion  Third  Party  Risk  Coverage  Privacy liability  Electronic media liability  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  13  and VdS28. It might be worth mentioning that in a small number of cases, the presence of a standard would  reduce premium or limit the risk assessment to the basic assessment questions (i.e. Baseline Assessment).  While the majority of the insurers does not have an auditing requirement, they do consider it a good  practise, and would do a risk assessment whether an audit strategy is present or not. If the insurer-driven  risk assessment exposes gaps, then an audit can follow up. Furthermore, since a recurring audit is  something that most corporate customers do, not doing so would have a negative impact.  There was also evidence that audit results are found to affect not only the insurability, but also the policy  limit. A small number of insurers would look at the global external audit reports for large corporate  customers, and would require an audit for operators of essential services (as defined by NIS Directive,  Table 1).  28 Third-party certification body, subsidiary of the German Insurance Association (GDV)  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  14  Good Practices  Risk assessment is the key to assess the changing risk appetite of a business, and further allows an insurer  to assess the level of preparation of a potential client. That can take the form of filing an application (with  no further action), running an assessment29, or obtaining evidence of a previous assessment.  Cyber insurance companies assess differently a clients’ risk, and they do not uniformly accept a  certification as validation of a customers’ security level. Recently, several insurance companies have been  engaged in an effort to develop common practices, and establish a higher degree of consistency in the  market30.  When assessing a clients’ risk, insurers generally focus on the following main categories:   Dedicated Resources   Policies and Procedures   Employee Awareness   Incident Response   Security Measures   Vendor Management   Board Oversight  Using these categories enabled a structured comparison of interview findings against the anticipated  results31 32 33, and the generation of good practices; with the latter being highlighted at the end of the  following subsections. A visual and brief representation of the comparison and results can be found in  section A.2 Risk Assessment: Metrics Map.  3.2.1 Dedicated Resources  Evidence has shown that insurers attach importance to the presence of leadership roles with Information  Security focus34 within an organisation, and enumerate the number of employees that are dedicated to  Information Security. While both these points give a good indication of the dedicated resources, they could  be significantly improved by a couple of additional checks.  Equally significant to the presence of an Information Security professional among leadership. is the time  allocation to tasks other than what their role mandates; thus, it is advisable to not only evaluate the  presence of such a role, but also examine their responsibilities. That could be done by conducting an  interview, or viewing records of time and task allocation.  The reporting lines of a CISO, can impact the effectiveness of an Information Security program. It would  therefore be highly recommended to evaluate the reporting line of a CISO (or equivalent), and whether  that role is reporting directly to the CEO.35 36 37  29 Internal or external, self-assessed or not  30 Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies “Cyber Insurance Exposure Data Schema V1.0” http://bit.ly/1Pb1vVb  31 FSSCC “Purchasers’ Guide to Cyber Insurance Products” http://bit.ly/1RT3T0M  32 Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty “A Guide to Cyber Risk” http://bit.ly/1YyMUrD  33 Marsh “European 2015 Cyber Risk Survey Report” http://bit.ly/1L7XJdh  34 Such as: CIO, CISO, CPO, CSO  35 CIO “Seven reasons the CISO should report to the CEO and not the CIO” http://bit.ly/29xE5xI  36 DARKReading “Top Infosec Execs Will Eventually Report To CEOs, CISOs Say” http://ubm.io/1XkwRNw  37 ThreatTrack Security “Why Your CISO Should Report to the CEO” http://bit.ly/29FXutG  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  15  In addition, it is advisable to examine the overall resources, in respect to both quality and quantity. Since  the number of employees is not a reliable metric by itself, it could be enhanced by incorporating metrics  that would compare current skillsets against the requirements, or metrics relevant to employee  effectiveness38.  As an example of a non-employee resource metric, an insurance company could request to view a list of  completed Information Security projects, their alignment to corporate Strategy, allocated budget, and  whether they have met the Critical Success Factor (CSF). While many of these details can be confidential,  critical elements could be anonymised prior to sharing, or have an insurer view evidence and validate  compliance.  Good Practices:   Examine if leadership roles with Information Security focus have any responsibilities irrelevant to  Information Security.   Check whether the CISO (or equivalent) reports directly to the CEO.   Measure the amount and quality of resources that a company invests on Information Security.  3.2.2 Policies and Procedures  Insurers have demonstrated an advanced maturity on assessing the policies and procedures of an  organisation. However, while insurers check whether cyber security standards are followed, they were not  found to thoroughly validate the existence of a comprehensive and formal Information Security program39.  The program would have to address Information Security in all possible dimensions of security controls (i.e.  technical, administrative, and physical).  Furthermore, since working remotely40 and the use of mobile devices41 42 are potential risks in a corporate  environment, cyber insurance companies would be advised to appropriately check clients’ preparation in  that respect43.  As the mere existence of a program does not imply an advanced capability, an insurer would also have to  assess the cyber-security maturity of an organisation44.  Good Practices:   Validate the existence of a comprehensive and formal Information Security program.  o Confirm it covers technical, administrative and physical measures for data protection.  o Ensure the appropriate provisions for the security of mobile devices and teleworking.   Evaluate the cyber security maturity of the organisation.  38 As per ISO 27001, section 7.2 Competence (v. 113010)  39 As per ISO 27001, section A.6.1 Organization of information security – Internal organization (v. 113010)  40 The Guardian “The security risks of remote working” http://bit.ly/2922A7t  41 ENISA “Workplace IT: ENISA sees opportunities and risks in “Bring Your Own Device” trend” http://bit.ly/1r8gjfy  42 US-CERT “The Risks of Using Portable Devices” http://1.usa.gov/1PcTXzu  43 As per ISO 27001, section A.6.2 Organization of information security – Mobile devices and teleworking (v. 113010)  44 ENISA “Technical Guideline on Minimum Security Measures” http://bit.ly/2aWGjD0  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  16  3.2.3 Employee Awareness  While the human factor can pose a significant risk within an organisation, with proper training it can turn  out to be a valuable defence mechanism – and an enabler for current controls. For example, an untrained  employee who cannot recognise a phishing e-mail, is the weakest link for any security measure that can be  applied; while one who is vigilant, will safeguard a company not only by not becoming a victim, but also by  reporting the attempt to the appropriate department. In addition, an employee who is aware will not only  implement policies and procedures, but also understand them – something of a great value.  Insurance companies were found to verify the presence of a formal Security Awareness program, which is  a key element for securing the human factor within a company. Since phishing is the prevalent method for  malware delivery45, any simulations and exercises of such, would add a significant value to such a program.  To secure the employees’ commitment, an organisation would need to provide motives or measures for  those who repeatedly pass or fail the exercises.  Good Practices:   Check whether phishing exercises are taking place as part of a formal Security Awareness program.  o Enumerate the actions (or rewards) that are taken (or offered) to employees who  repeatedly fail (or succeed) these.  3.2.4 Incident Response  An Incident Response program defines the processes and resources that an organisation engages for  addressing any Information Security incidents. Insurers validate the existence of a potential clients’  Incident Response program in a formal form, and evaluate their tolerance level towards withstanding  several incidents.  Incident notification is a key component of NIS Directive that requires the establishment of an Incident  Response function within an organisation.  Similar to other functions, testing the capabilities of a defence mechanism is critical to the success of it;  hence, confirmation of the presence of regular exercises in support of an existing Incident Response  program46 is recommended. A valuable finding is that the presence of an incident response team has the  top positive impact on the per capita cost of a data breach47 (Figure 4).  45 Symantec “Internet Security Threat Report, Volume 21, April 2016” http://symc.ly/1Ytqm9Y  46 Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation “The Importance of a Battle-Tested  Cyber Incident Response Plan” http://bit.ly/29llUwf  47 Ponemon Institute “2016 Cost of Data Breach Study: Global Analysis” http://ibm.co/1tz141c  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  17  Figure 4: Impact of 16 factors on the per capita cost of data breach (2016)47.  Good Practise:   Confirm there are regular exercises in support of a formal Incident Response program.  3.2.5 Security Measures  Insurers have indicated as important that technical measures and solutions are checked thoroughly, and  that a defined physical access is part of their security measures evaluation. However, it is important to  receive information about any existing encryption strategy and the technologies involved, to ensure the  proper implementation of technical measures such as data backup or remote connectivity. In addition to  encryption, the proper implementation of the following would need to be confirmed:   Business Continuity Planning48   Data classification49   Data retention   Access control   Log monitoring50   Intrusion detection   Network segmentation51   Network monitoring   Vulnerability management52   Penetration testing  48 As per ISO 22301  49 As per ISO 27001, Control objectives and controls A.8.2  50 As per ISO 27001, Control objectives and controls A.12.4  51 As per ISO 27001, Control objectives and controls A.13.1.3  52 As per ISO 27001, Control objectives and controls A.12.6.1  -$14  -$12  -$6  -$5  -$5  -$3  $5  $5  $6  $7  $8  $9  $9  $9  $13  $16  -$20 -$15 -$10 -$5 $0 $5 $10 $15 $20  Third party involvement  Extensive cloud migration  Rush to notify  Consultants engaged  Lost or stolen devices  Provision of ID protection  Data classification schema  Insurance protection  Board-level involvement  CISO appointed  Extensive use of DLP  Employee training  Participation in threat sharing  BCM involvement  Extensive use of encryption  Incident response team  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  18  Good Practices:   Confirm the proper implementation of: Business Continuity Planning, data classification, data  retention, access control, log monitoring, intrusion detection, network segmentation, network  monitoring, vulnerability management, and penetration testing.   Receive information about any existing encryption strategy and the technologies involved.  3.2.6 Vendor Management  Vendor Management is a greatly overlooked weakness. It has been observed that only 23% of  organisations assess suppliers for cyber risk33. That can result in a significant exposure, since supplier  networks are outside an organisations’ control – with many examples of successful breaches supporting  that conclusion53 54 55 56.  The above finding should be of a particular attention to cyber insurance companies, since it could  significantly affect a large number of potential or existing clients. It is recommended that insurers verify  the existence of a formal third party management process, and receive details on due diligence, ongoing  oversight, and contractual obligations.57  Good Practices:   Verify the existence of a formal third party management process.   Receive details on: due diligence, ongoing oversight, and contractual obligations.  3.2.7 Board Oversight  The awareness of governing board concerning crucial information security issues is an early step for  addressing risk. Should a board become aware of such issues in an irregular or delayed manner, there is a  risk of the corrective action being unauthorised, badly timed, or disproportionate. Therefore, it is  important to evaluate the frequency of reporting cyber-security risk issues and related action to the Board.  While it is important to have knowledge of crucial information security issues, a board may have a defined  set for the approval of oversight, enough to have an impact on an organisation – without overwhelming  the board with such requests. It is strongly advised that should such a detail exists, an insurer would obtain  information about it. 58  The earlier paragraphs address the boards’ frequency of being informed, and the level of involvement in a  program. It has been found that although these two factors are of a great importance, the ongoing  communication and direction throughout an organisation is the basis upon which the decisions and  53 Computer Weekly “Home Depot traces credit card data hack to supplier compromise” http://bit.ly/1XtDWxE  54 DARK Reading “Target Breach: HVAC Contractor Systems Investigated” http://ubm.io/1Pwm8yM  55 SC Magazine “TalkTalk blames supplier for breach affecting 4m customers” http://bit.ly/1F0rIjd  56 Health IT Security “Potential Healthcare Data Breach Affects Over 19K Patients” http://bit.ly/1t9Q7mL  57 As per ISO 27001, Control objectives and controls A.15  58 IT Governance Institute “Information Security Governance: Guidance for Boards of Directors and Executive  Management, 2nd Edition” http://bit.ly/1WddA0A  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  19  messages will traverse59. An effective communication and direction would be a facilitating factor for the  decisions and information flow, which could be described as an organisations’ equivalent of a neural  network during an information security event; a slow message traversal would have a catalytic effect on  the efficiency of its’ content.  Good Practices:   Detail the frequency of reporting cyber-security risk issues and related action to the board.   Detail any existing board-level approval of oversight of the Information Security Program.   Receive details of the organisations’ internal information flow related to cyber-security, lines of  communication, including crisis communication plans.  59 KPMG “Connecting the dots: A proactive approach to cybersecurity oversight in the boardroom”  http://bit.ly/1LMAdXn  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  20  4. Challenges  The greatest challenge of insurers is the lack of cyber-security incident data in support of risk assessment,  which would further allow them to differentiate customers on the basis of risk. The establishment of  anonymized databases for cyber incidents, would help insurers better understand the risk and provide  adapted cover. A further data-related challenge is gathering information on cyber security management,  especially for multinational corporate customers with diverse activities and Mergers and Acquisitions  (M&A) history. Furthermore, while customers are willing to discuss company related information without a  record, they are less likely to share information by official documentation (e.g. incident report history,  audit report). A rising concern among a number of insurers is the uncertainty around accumulating risk;  for example, customers might not only migrate data to the cloud, but operations as well. In the event that  an incident would occur, an insurer cannot be certain about the number of customers that would be  affected. Customers will know if they use cloud, but not who else does. That concern becomes very  realistic by knowing that such threats exist60 61. An additional example can be around third-party vendors,  where a formed relationship of trust could be taken advantage by an adversary. Other items that were  noted as challenges from a smaller number of insurers are:   Lack of customer awareness on cyber insurance   Common understanding of policy terms and conditions   Lack of internal (technical) expertise   Cost calculation on the basis of an incident scenario   Utilizing predictive analytics for the assessment of potential risks and impact  It is interesting to note that recent findings on challenges, as seen on Figure 5, could possibly be tackled  together with present findings. For example, not understanding exposures or coverage, and the application  process, could be addressed by explanatory sessions. Giving the customer scenarios and examples of  policy coverage could act as a fast method to raise awareness and understanding of cyber insurance.

Recommendations and Findings  The interviews revealed a number of points that drove good practices, many of which are found to also  reduce the cost of an incident47. These can improve the insurers risk assessment by adapting priorities  and focus, include new items for evaluation – and improve customer preparedness by a thorough risk  assessment checklist.  Further to the derived good practices, the report had generated the following recommendations, directed  to policy makers, insurers, and customers, for the betterment of cyber insurance constituency:  Policy Makers   Encourage the active participation of European Commission on ENISA cyber insurance activities   Avoid the introduction of mandatory requirements that might undermine the cyber insurance  market adoption rate  Insurers – Risk Assessment   Focus on an organisations’ resources, and conduct a throughout review in terms of both quality  and quantity   Evaluate whether a customers’ policies and procedures address the prevalent threat of remote  working and mobile devices   Consider the existence of recurring exercises as a key factor for evaluating the completeness of a  customers’ response or preparedness function   Evaluate security measures on the basis of state-of-the-art practices, while considering a  customers’ environmental characteristics and needs   Review an organisations’ board involvement as thoroughly as any traditional security measure  Insurers – Risk Calculation   Invest and advance the accumulating risk calculation, particularly in the areas of vendor  management and cloud computing  Insurers – Business Enablers   Introduce explanatory sessions, and provide customer scenarios and generic examples of policy  coverage.   Clarify the policy language, and avoid using generic terminology that can be interpreted in multiple  ways   Offer a transparent underwriting process, detailing the criteria and criticality that drives pricing  Cyber insurance Customers   Be more open on sharing data, possibly under a legal agreement (e.g. NDA)   Get informed, prepare, and document their environment, before requesting a cyber insurance  policy  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  22  The past four years have been full of advances on the Cyber insurance frontier. Organisations and their  leadership have recognised the importance of cyber as an operational risk. Since the understanding on  cyber risk is basic, it is recommended that the organisations work to understand risk before addressing it.  It was of significant importance to see that, in contrast to previous ENISA findings, customers do not invest  less in (traditional) security measures due to a policy presence. The fact that insurers usually require an  annual re-assessment might be reinforcing that different customer behaviour.  Regulatory changes are resulting in better preparedness, similar to the post-legislative adoption in US.  Thus, both GDPR and NIS Directive are expected to be followed by an increased market need in EU. The  increased claims have been found to function as feedback that enhances market proposals. European  insurers who have been exposed to a more legislative environment, have obtained a wealth of valuable  lessons that can now apply in EU.  The majority of insurers cover all sectors, with many of them recognising the importance of SME market  and develop customised solutions for it. Underwriters and management are the ultimate decision makers  following a risk assessment, where they would be called to take into consideration several more variables.  The core coverage by most insurers includes first and third party risks (Table 2), with less common  coverage addressing business revenue (dependent or not), digital assets disruption, insider threat (of a  non-intentional nature), intellectual property, reputational harms, and targeted attacks. Insurers offer  extra coverage such as: forensics, fraud, legal costs, PR measures, and ransomware. The reported  coverage exclusion around widespread non-targeted attacks, and third party intrusion exposes a  significant gap, since less than a quarter of organisations are assessing suppliers for cyber risk.  The total of interviewed insurers have either recommended or endorsed as good to have, the following  third party certifications: GRAMM–LEACH–BLILEY ACT, HIPAA, HITECH, ISO 2700x or derivatives (e.g. DIN  27001), PCI-DSS, SOX, and VdS28. Auditing was not identified as a requirement but it is considered a best  practise.  The core identified challenges of insurers, in respect to pre-policy risk assessment are:   Lack of cyber-security incident data   Gathering information on cyber security management   Customers less likely to share any documentation   Uncertainty around accumulating risk  Future work could focus on individual study findings, or evaluate the pre-policy risk assessment from a  pure customers’ perspective. A current theme would be to examine the post-insurance effects on a  customers’ environment, or in-depth on market growth and check any possible relation to the industries  affected by the NIS Directive.  Cyber Insurance: Recent Advances, Good Practices and Challenges  November 2016  23  Annex A: Questionnaire and Metrics Map  The following questionnaire was utilised to receive feedback for Chapter 3, and was aimed towards  Insurance companies with a current cyber insurance offering, focusing on the risk assessment phase of  potential clients.

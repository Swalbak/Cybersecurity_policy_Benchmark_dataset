In this context, public transport operators have an important role to enable this smartness. They contribute to the  life of the city, to the economy and ensure the resilience of the Smart City. The integration of several ICT systems  enables “Intelligent Public Transport” (IPT), where cyber-physical devices, communication networks and central  servers optimise the transport service up to a certain degree of automation.  While this fusion of cyber technology, physical infrastructures and mass transport vehicles creates new  opportunities for improving services and functionality, it also has the effect of introducing cyber security risks into  transport networks that have not historically been susceptible to such risks. Moreover, IPT becomes a natural  target for emerging cyber threats that will have an impact not only on the operations of the transport service but  also on the whole economy and potentially on the health and safety of citizens.  For that reason, it is important to consider security  for Intelligent Public Transport to protect the  operators, the economy and the life and safety of  citizens. However, IPT faces several challenges in  this direction: there is currently no EU policy on  cyber security for transport, the awareness level is  low and it is difficult for operators to dedicate  budget to this specific objective of cyber security  (see picture on the right).  This study proposes a pragmatic approach that will highlight the critical assets of Intelligent Public Transport  systems. It gives an overview of the existing security measures (good practices) that could be deployed to protect  these critical assets and ensure security of the IPT system, based on a survey and interviews of experts from the  sector, municipalities, operators, manufacturers and policy makers.  The good practices propose a first step toward actionable security and a better protection of the transport  ecosystem. Good practices go beyond technical security measures; they also integrate policies, standards,  operational and organisational measures. For example, transport operators can use this study in support of their  risk assessment in order to understand which critical assets to protect, and how.  In spite of the fact that security becomes a concern for all actors of Intelligent Public Transport, additional efforts  are still needed to improve the current situation. Following that direction, the study proposes recommendations to  three stakeholders groups that need to enhance the status of cyber security for IPT. For that purpose:  Decision makers in the European Commission and in Member States should:   Promote public/private collaboration on IPT cyber security at national level and EU-wide   Promote and facilitate the development of a common EU approach to IPT security   Develop a comprehensive EU strategy and framework for cyber security in IPT   Integrate and converge security efforts made in other sectors of activity   Foster the development of harmonised cyber security standards for IPT  No 40%  Don’t know 40%  Less than 2% 10%  Don't know 10%Yes  20%  Cyber security spending  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  08  Intelligent Public Transport operators should:   Integrate cyber security in their corporate governance   Develop and implement an integrated corporate strategy addressing holistically cyber security and safety  risks   Implement risk management for cyber security in multi-stakeholder environments including external  contractors and dependencies   Clearly and routinely specify their cyber security requirements   Annually review organisational cyber security processes, practices and infrastructures  Manufacturers of IPT systems and solutions should:   Create products/solutions that match the cyber security requirements of IPT end-users   Collaborate in the development of IPT-specific standards and apply them to IPT solutions   Develop a trusted information sharing platforms on risks and vulnerabilities   Provide security guidance for your systems, products and solutions  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  09  1. Introduction  Transport networks are designated as critical infrastructure within the European Union (EU) and are  essential for maintaining the health, safety, security, and social and economic well-being of citizens within  EU Member States (MS).1 Yet the effective operation of these transport networks is vulnerable to the  increasing levels of traffic, which also contribute to rising energy consumption and environmental and  social problems.2 These negative symptoms are strongly felt in European cities which draw together large  concentrations of citizens within relatively small geographic areas.  To help manage and mitigate increases in traffic congestion, cities rely upon effective public transport  networks as efficient mobility solutions. However, when seeking to expand and improve these public  transport networks it is not enough to count solely upon the traditional measure of simply increasing the  physical road and rail infrastructure. Rather technological innovation has a major role to play here in the  creation of appropriate solutions, and the realisation of this fact is directly connected with the rise of  Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) integrated into Smart Cities.3  ITS integrates information and communication technology (ICT) with transport engineering so as to plan,  design, operate, maintain and manage transport systems, which in turn significantly contribute to  improving the efficiency and operation of such networks.2 The application of these technologies to public  transport systems produces Intelligent Public Transport (IPT).  However, this process of increasing the incorporation of ICT into public transport through both the  introduction of networked devices and the expansion of remote access and control capabilities, coupled  with the linking together of different operators within a single Smart City network (creating a system-of- systems), all acts to increase the cyber threat exposure of traditional transport networks. While current  transport operators and engineers possess a wealth of knowledge and experience in ensuring their  networks and products are designed with safety in mind, they have less experience in ensuring the cyber  security of their networks and products.  This increase in the cyber security risks for IPT produces new objectives that need to be met. These include  the identification of critical IPT assets and the associated threats that target them, as well as the  identification of good practices in cyber security that can address these threats and increase the cyber  resilience of IPT operators. Such outcomes need to be coupled with a coherent strategic and policy  approach that encompasses all of the stakeholders linked to IPT within the Smart City environment.  1 See Council Directive 2008/11/EC on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the  assessment of the need to improve their protection, specifically Art.2 and Annex I  2 See Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the framework for the deployment of  Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport.  3 Smart Cities are cities that integrate ICT to meet public needs and foster development in a multi-stakeholder  environment. It is anticipated this integration of cyber-physical technologies and infrastructures creates  environmental and economic efficiencies while improving resident’s quality of life (see US Dept. of Homeland  Security, “The Future of Smart Cities: Cyber-Physical Infrastructure Risk”, August 2015).  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  10  1.1 Scope of the study  This study focuses on the protection of the assets critical to Intelligent Public Transports in the context of  Smart Cities. These assets are considered critical as they contribute to the normal operation of local public  transport networks, including metro, buses, light rail and other modes of mass public transport found in  Smart Cities.  For that purpose, this study identifies these critical assets from a business and societal point of view. It  highlights good security practices against cyber threats. The objective is to enhance the resilience of IPT.  From the point of view of Smart Cities, these assets can be considered “internal” to IPT operators.  Figure 1 defines the scope of the study by focusing on the critical assets of local public transport operators  (displayed in the green box). The scope does not consider a specific architecture but rather a  comprehensive list of assets owned by an IPT operator.  The protection of critical assets for other transport operators (private and non-local), operators from other  sectors and non-operators fall out of the scope of this study. The protection of data exchange between IPT  operators and other stakeholders is also out of scope of this study. ENISA study “Cyber Security for Smart  Cities - an architecture model for public transport”4 focuses on the protection of this data exchange and its  associated assets.

Hence, the task of developing secure and resilient IPT systems falls on multiple actors, requiring the  cooperation of both public and private stakeholders working together to enhance cyber security. Given  this fact, the target audiences of this study are drawn from a number of sectors (see Figure 2):  Figure 2: Target audience groups   Operators: they cover a wide range of actors; both those directly  involved in operating different public transport modes (metro,  bus, tram/trolley-bus, light rail, ferry) and an interconnected  network of operators within the Smart City (energy,  infrastructure, public & private clouds, communications, banks  and payment systems, etc.).   Manufacturers: Covering the full spectrum of manufacturers  including physical transport infrastructure, providers, vehicle  manufacturers, developers of ICT networks, hardware and  software engineers, etc.   Service Providers: Including risk managers, cloud providers, ICT  network providers, security providers, etc.   Policy Makers: Different levels of government (local, national,  EU), regulators and law enforcement agencies involved in IPT.  1.3 Methodology  This study is based on a combination of desktop research as well as empirical research (i.e. survey and  interviews) with the results validated through a stakeholder workshop. Initial data gathering scoped the  development of the study, including the current key policies and legislation. Critical societal and business  assets for IPT were identified by integrating the desktop and empirical findings, and a comparative  approach was employed (i.e. between threats, risks, vulnerabilities, good practices, and challenges and  gaps) focussing on enhancing cyber security within IPT.  Results of the desktop research were further developed, and good practices identified, through an online  survey5 and series of interviews involving a total of 22 respondents drawn from different stakeholder  groups.6 While this is sample size is limited it nevertheless represents a good starting point for conducting  research into IPT. These respondents were based in the following EU MS:   Belgium   Denmark   Estonia   France   Germany   Latvia   Luxembourg   Netherlands   Republic of Ireland   Spain   Sweden   United Kingdom  5 See Annex 5 for the survey questions.  6 See Section 1.3 of ENISA, “Cyber Security for Smart Cities - an architecture model for public transport”, December  2015, for a distribution of respondents based on sector.

The cyber threat vulnerabilities inherent to IPT are identified and  discussed, and an initial analysis of risks is conducted.   Section 4 – Good practices for securing Intelligent Public Transport: good practices for securing  IPT networks from cyber threats are presented here, as identified through both desktop research  and the interviews/surveying of IPT operators.   Section 5 – Gap analysis: The identification and analysis of existing gaps in securing IPT (arising  from existing policies, legislation, operational practices and employed technologies) identified  throughout this research via a comparative analysis of previous findings.   Section 6 – Recommendations: Sets out nine key recommendations for policy makers, IPT  operators, manufacturers and solution providers on enhancing the security and resilience of IPT.  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  13  2. The intelligent public transport environment  This section provides an overview of the IPT environment. It defines terms commonly used within this  sector, outlines the current legal and policy environment within which IPT operates, places IPT within the  wider smart environment, sets out the critical functions and assets for IPT operators, and finally it explains  why cyber security is so fundamentally critical in the physical-digital fusion that is IPT.  2.1 Definitions  Many of the common concepts within intelligent transport are the subject of multiple definitions provided  by different stakeholders, each with differing perspectives and agendas. These have been distilled here to  produce a single set of definitions describing how these concepts are approached within this study. Table 1  defines the terms employed throughout this study.  Table 1: Key definitions employed within this study  TERM DEFINITION  Intelligent Transport  The application of information and communication technologies to transport so as to  improve levels of service and efficiency.  Intelligent Public Transport7 (IPT)  The application of information and communication technologies to public transport  networks so as to improve levels of service and efficiency.  Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)  The application of information and communication technologies to the real-time  management of vehicles and networks involving the movement of people and  goods.8 9 10  Smart City  A city that uses ICT to meet public needs and foster development in a multi-stakeholder  environment.  Business critical  (as applied to IPT)  Any elements which can directly impact the execution and sustainability of a business  in the long-term, including business revenue, service provision, business operations,  and/or the brand and image of an organisation.  Societal critical  (as applied to IPT)  Any elements affecting the quality of life of the citizens and their daily experience of  transport, which includes the environment, their safety and security and their privacy.  Critical Infrastructure  (as applied to the EU)  An asset, system or part thereof located in MS which is essential for the maintenance of  vital societal functions, health, safety, security, economic or social well-being of people,  and the disruption or destruction of which would have a significant impact in a MS as a  result of the failure to maintain those functions.11  7 Intelligent Public Transport is not a term widely used or adopted, rather it is a term coined for this study.  8 EC,16.12.2008 COM(2008) 886 final, “Action Plan for the Deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in Europe”.  9EC, 20.3.2009 COM(2008) 886 final/2, “Corrigendum to Action Plan for the Deployment of Intelligent Transport  Systems in Europe”.  10 Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (Germany), “Intelligent Transport Systems”, p.2.  11 As defined within Article 2a of Directive 2008/114/EC. For more details on critical infrastructure see ENISA,  “Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets and services”, February 2015.  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  14  TERM DEFINITION  Cyber security  Cyber security is the collection of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards,  guidelines, risk management approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance  and technologies that can be used to protect the cyber environment and organization  and user’s assets.  IPT Cyber security  For IPT, cyber security is the protection of data, systems, infrastructure and end-users  vital to the transport network, its operation and stability.  2.2 EU policy context  At the EU regulatory level, Regulations and Directives have yet to be specifically drafted to govern the form  and operation of IPT. Instead, what currently exists are a number of Directives whose broader remits are,  to differing degrees, applicable to IPT. These existing Directives cover the protection of personal data,12 the  processing of personal data in the electronic communications sector,13 the promotion of clean and energy- efficient road transport vehicles,14 creating interoperability of national rail systems across the European  Community,15 and the deployment of intelligent transport systems in the field of road transport.16  Individual analyses of these Directives is provided in Annex 1.  Collectively these Directives demonstrate that while there is currently no piece of EU legislation focussing  specifically on the operation of IPT at the EU level, there are elements of IPT operations that are still  subject to a level of regulation. Despite this fact, when it comes to either cyber security protections,  requirements and/or guidance specific to IPT, these Directives have very little to say beyond a cursory  mention of general security and the need to protect in-vehicle communications in Directive 2010/40/EU,17  and the need to protect the data privacy rights of citizens in Directives 1995/46/EC and 2002/58/EC.18  There is the proposed Network Information Security (NIS) Directive19 which, if enacted, will place a duty on  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/Methodologies-for- identification-of-ciis  12 Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of  individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. http://eur- lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:l14012  13 Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of  personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and  electronic communications). http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?qid=1440673681836&uri=CELEX:32002L0058  14 Directive 2009/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of clean  and energy-efficient road transport vehicles. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?qid=1440673932348&uri=CELEX:32009L0033  15 Directive 2008/57/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the interoperability of the  rail system within the Community. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32008L0057  16 Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2010 on the framework for the  deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of  transport. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1440674103143&uri=CELEX:32010L0040  17 Art.2(1), Directive 2010/40/EU  18 Art.10, Directive 2010/40/EU  19 Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL concerning measures to ensure a  high common level of network and information security across the Union (COM/2013/048 final - 2013/0027 (COD)).  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52013PC0048  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/Methodologies-for-identification-of-ciis https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/Methodologies-for-identification-of-ciis http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:l14012 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:l14012 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1440673681836&uri=CELEX:32002L0058 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1440673681836&uri=CELEX:32002L0058 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1440673932348&uri=CELEX:32009L0033 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1440673932348&uri=CELEX:32009L0033 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32008L0057 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1440674103143&uri=CELEX:32010L0040 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52013PC0048  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  15  operators of critical infrastructures (including transport) to manage the risks posed to the security of the  networks and information systems which they control and use in their operations.20 While this Directive will  apply to IPT operators, the level of impact is uncertain as again it is not primarily focussed on the operation  of IPT.21  At the national level, while Member States need to ensure these Directives are incorporated into their  respective legal systems, they are free to go beyond existing EU legislation by establishing additional  national measures to promote IPT and cyber security.22  Running parallel with these Directives are a number of important EU policy documents acting to drive the  future development of IPT. These have appeared with regularity since the late 2000’s focussing on  Intelligent Transport and its integration within Smart Cities, and they indicate the importance being  assigned to these topics at the EU level. These policy documents include the following:23   Action Plan for the Deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in Europe: This Action Plan aims  to accelerate and coordinate the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) in road  transport, including interfaces with other transport modes.16   Internet of Things - An action plan for Europe: Sets out 14 “Lines of Action” regarding the future  design of objects/systems falling under the Internet of Things (IoT).24   A Digital Single Market Strategy Europe: Sets out the Commission’s strategy for creating a Digital  Single Market whereby the free movement principles of goods, services, people and capital are  translated and implemented into EU cyber space.25   European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities: Strategic Implementation  Plan: Presents the Strategic Implementation Plan for creating Smart Cities produced by the High  Level Group of the European Innovation Partnership for Smart Cities and Communities.26   Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area – Towards a competitive and resource efficient  transport system: Focus is on how to remove barriers and bottlenecks so as to complete the  internal market for transport by creating a competitive and sustainable transport market within  the EU.27  20 Art.14(1), Proposed NIS Directive  21 When multiple operators (including IPT operators) are integrated into the architecture of a Smart City it is  uncertain to what extent they control any shared network and information systems. Additionally the scope assigned  to transport as critical infrastructure within the proposed Directive as currently drafted in Annex II of the draft NIS  Directive does not clearly apply to road-based IPT operators (i.e. busses).  22 For example, it was noted during the final validation workshop that the French Agence nationale de la sécurité des  systèmes d’information (ANSSI) is working with Vital Importance Operators such as public transport and railways to  establish laws related to cyber security.  23 See Annex 1: Key EU legislation and policy/strategy documents affecting IPT, for more details on these documents.  24 Internet of Things - An action plan for Europe - COM(2009) 278 final. http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0278:FIN:EN:PDF  25 A Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe - COM(2015)192 final. http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single- market/docs/dsm-communication_en.pdf  26 European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities: Strategic Implementation Plan.  http://ec.europa.eu/eip/smartcities/files/sip_final_en.pdf  27 Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area – Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system -  COM(2011) 144 final. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:tr0054  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0278:FIN:EN:PDF http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0278:FIN:EN:PDF http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/docs/dsm-communication_en.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/docs/dsm-communication_en.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/eip/smartcities/files/sip_final_en.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:tr0054  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  16   Rolling plan for ICT Standardisation: This Rolling Plan provides a multi-annual overview of the  needs for preliminary or complementary ICT standardisation activities to undertake in support of  EU policy activities.28   Smart Cities and Communities – European Innovation Partnership: These are partnerships across  the areas of energy, transport and information and communication with the objective to catalyse  progress in areas where energy use, mobility and transport, and ICT are intimately linked.29  What is most telling is that many of the EU policy and strategy documents within IPT have moved beyond  simply seeking to educate the reader about IPT and/or justifying the development of this capability, and on  to promoting concrete actions and outcomes through the use of action plans and/or the setting of specific  objectives. This represents the level of acceptance IPT has achieved within the EU.  However, an EU policy specific to the development and security of IPT as a whole is still lacking. Instead the  focus of these documents is primarily to promote the uptake and development of ITS, IoT, ICT, Smart  Cities. Yet, there is no related policy on the cyber security requirements for the operators of such systems.  2.3 Critical business and societal functions and assets for intelligent public transport  2.3.1 Asset groups  In order to identify the key IPT assets, based on the field work we have extrapolated key functions and  their relevant specific assets from a business and societal prospective. Successfully managing an IPT  business requires identifying and protecting those functions that are critical to the effective, continued  operation of that business: i.e. business critical functions. Given the role and importance of IPT networks to  citizens and societies, there are also functions that are critical from a societal perspective; i.e. societal  critical functions. Within each of these business and societal functions are individual assets related to the  provision of that function. Through the survey, interviews as well as desktop research covering key  documents, the following five business and five societal functions were identified.  Business functions:   Traffic and vehicle management defines IPT through the use of ICT, and underlies its goals of  increasing efficiencies and productivity through the linking of systems and employing data. As a  result this function contains a long list of related assets covering the full digital-physical spectrum.  This mirrors the societal function “sustainable urban mobility”.   Transportation safety and security focuses on ensuring the effective cyber/physical security and  safety of IPT infrastructures (including both physical and digital entities) attached to the business  operations of the IPT operator. As such the assets range from cyber protection measures (i.e.  ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and communications) to access  controls to both physical and digital assets.   Sales, fees and charges are essential to the continuing financial viability of an IPT operator,  whether privately or publically owned. Protecting the payment system assets is therefore of  fundamental importance.  28 Rolling plan for ICT Standardisation. https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/rolling-plan-ict-standardisation- 0  29 Smart Cities and Communities – European Innovation Partnership - COM(2012) 4701 final.  http://ec.europa.eu/eip/smartcities/files/ec_communication_scc.pdf  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/rolling-plan-ict-standardisation-0 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/rolling-plan-ict-standardisation-0 http://ec.europa.eu/eip/smartcities/files/ec_communication_scc.pdf  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  17   Resilient management structure allows an IPT operator to respond effectively to, and overcome,  the range of threats IPT networks are subject to, including: acts of nature, cyber attacks, physical  attacks, energy supply problems, etc. Staff and business reputation are important assets here.   Energy and environment concerns have a direct impact on the operation of IPT networks.  Operators need to ensure the sufficient and continuous supply of energy to meet their network’s  needs. While at the same time they must manage energy usage to control costs and mitigate any  negative environmental impacts arising from their transport network. This function also mirrors the  societal function “sustainable environment”.  Societal functions:   Sustainable urban mobility networks are fundamental to the efficient operation of a city, providing  a wealth of social and economic benefits. Incorporating ICT into the operation of traditional  mobility networks to create IPT acts to maximise the efficiency, operation and sustainability of  these mobility networks. This is fundamental in differentiating IPT from the traditional silo-based  model of an urban public transport system. This infusion of ICT into the physical infrastructure and  assets of different operators enables the integration of wider systems and processes. The critical  assets to this function now include the digital infrastructure and integrated systems as well as  physical infrastructures.   Passenger safety and security focuses on ensuring the effective cyber/physical security and safety  of passengers using urban public transport networks. Achieving acceptable levels of safety and  security are fundamental prerequisites for passengers to trust and willingly choose to use such  networks. Providing the safety and (cyber) security of passengers on IPT networks requires a range  of assets, from technological safety systems and surveillance (CCTV) capabilities, through to trained  staff and the real-time ability to communicate with passengers.   Data protection and privacy are digital rights valued by societies, as well as representing EU legal  requirements which apply to the operation of IPT networks (see Section 2.2). Mature IPT operators  recognise that the data/information they hold constitutes one of their most valuable assets.   Sustainable environment recognises the impact of traffic networks on the wider city environment  through vectors including; air quality, noise pollutions, traffic flow, user safety, sustainable energy  grids, and the economic impact for both end-users and local businesses.30  Because of the different nature and focus of these two viewpoints (i.e. business and societal), business  assets tend to focus more on individual components of IPT, while societal assets tend to be concerned  more with integrated and broader elements of IPT systems cutting across several operators.  2.3.2 Main critical assets for intelligent public transport  Figure 3 below set out the business and societal functions grouped together with associated assets as  identified through the survey, interviews and desktop research of related documents.31 These were also  evaluated to identify those that are critical. The resulting five critical functions and 21 critical assets are  30 Scottish Government, “Smart Cities Maturity Model and Self-Assessment Tool”, January 2015  31 Key documents here included: EC, COM(2011)144 final, “Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area”, March  2011.

In addition, Annex 2 provides an easily referable table  listing those functions, assets and threats identified as critical.  Figure 3: Critical functions and assets for IPT  Assessing the nature and distribution of those assets prioritised within IPT, which act to connect IPT to the  wider Smart City networks, produces key insights into both the “physical-digital” nature of those assets  distributed throughout an IPT network, as well as their security requirements. Three key insights on the  nature of IPT assets and security requirements are set out below.  Transportation safety  and security  Identity management systems  Integrity and availability of data  and communication  Access control mechanisms  Data storage systems/facilities  Sensors, signals and detectors  Hardware  Human-machine interface devices  Trackside equipment  On-board equipment  Physical infrastructure  Networking/communication components  Cloud based services/platforms  Physical  Networking  Digital  Passenger safety systems  Traffic and vehicle  management  Sustainable urban  mobility  SCADA  Traffic management systems  Digital infrastructure  Signalling systems  Vehicles and physical infrastructure  Operational Control Centres  Physical  Networking  Communication systems  Radio telecommunication  Internet/networking  Digital  Video surveillance  Information distribution systems  Public communication and social media  Safety systems  Availability of law enforcement  Trained staff  Passenger safety and security  IPT: Functions and Assets  Societal functions and associated assets Business functions and associated assets  Data  Traffic fluidity capabilities  Software/applications  Operating systems  Power distribution systemEnergy and  environment  Power distribution grid  Payment systemsSales, fees and  charges  Staff  Reputation  Financial viability  Resilience management  structure  Data protection and  privacy  Data/information  Confidentiality  Sustainable  environment  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  19  2.3.3 Three key insights on the nature of intelligent public transport assets   Individual IPT assets combine multiple components: IPT assets are more complex than similar  assets in traditional silo-based transport systems, as they combine multiple assets into one. For  example, a bus is no longer just a public transport vehicle – it is also a data collection and recording  system, an information dissemination asset, mobile Wi-Fi hub, and a source of real-time intelligence  for optimising the transport network. This is especially true for those assets linked to societal  functions.   The cyber/physical divide disappears within IPT assets: IPT assets fuse together both physical and  digital components. The resulting assets are now cyber-physical hybrids.   IPT assets are linked together to form individual systems and systems-of-systems shared amongst  multiple stakeholders: Through the use of ICT, the individual assets of a traditional silo-based  transport network are linked together to form a transport operators IPT system. A Smart City links  these assets further by integrating the systems of multiple operators and/or other stakeholders and  providers, forming a system-of-systems.  2.3.4 Three key insights on security for intelligent public transport assets   IPT assets are subject to a greater range of security threats: When assets become cyber-physical  hybrids, they become susceptible to both physical attacks and cyberattacks.   Cyber security and physical safety can no longer be treated as separate concerns: When attackers  can affect the physical operation of ICT-enabled vehicles or other physical assets,32 network cyber  security and physical safety become interdependent.   Determining where an IPT operator’s (security) responsibilities end is no longer clear: By  integrating IPT into the wider Smart City through the sharing of assets, data and ICT networks with  3rd parties, the boundary of the transport operator’s network is no longer clear. If an organisation  cannot accurately map the network they control, this has important implications for how they  conduct their network risk assessments.  32 Chris Valasek and Charle Miller, Adventures in Automotive Networks and Control Units, 2014.  http://www.ioactive.com/pdfs/IOActive_Adventures_in_Automotive_Networks_and_Control_Units.pdf  http://www.ioactive.com/pdfs/IOActive_Adventures_in_Automotive_Networks_and_Control_Units.pdf  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  20  2.4 Intelligent public transport environment and elements  In order to discuss IPT it makes sense to place it in the urban context that both justifies the need for  developing IPT systems, as well as provides the necessary cyber-physical infrastructure that enables public  transport to become intelligent. This environment is the Smart City. Producing IPT systems (as opposed to  traditional public transport systems) within this Smart City environment requires the successful integration  of cyber-physical technologies and urban infrastructure. This entails the linking and integration of  (physical) infrastructures and (digital) processes which are not always well connected.27, 33 Figure 4 depicts  the different stakeholders operating within Smart Cities34 that can be integrated into the networks and  cyber-physical architecture of IPT operators.

A need to secure intelligent public transport  This section focuses on the threats, vulnerabilities and risks that are faced by IPT networks and operators  and their impact on both businesses and society. To this end we employ the following definitions35 when  discussing these terms.   Threat: is the potential cause of an incident that may result in harm to an IPT system or IPT  organisation.   Vulnerability: is a weakness within an IPT asset that can be exploited by the threats.   Risk: is the potential that a given threat will successfully exploit vulnerabilities within an IPT asset  and thereby result in harm to the businesses and/or society as a whole.   Challenges: are current limitations faced by stakeholders on the security status of IPT (as  expressed during the survey and the interviews).  3.1 Threats  3.1.1 Threat model  For the purpose of this study, a practical IPT based threat-taxonomy has been developed. The threats  included in the suggested threat model are all applicable to the IPT assets presented in the previous  section. The presented threat taxonomy covers mainly cyber-security threats; that is, threats applying to  information and communication technology assets. Additional non-IT threats have also been included in  order to cover threats to physical assets that are necessary for the operation of the considered ICT-assets.  Threats appear to be multifaceted and can be directed against specific assets, ranging from IPT systems to  data, through to broad organisational structures and entire IPT infrastructures. Furthermore, due to IPT  assets blurring the lines between digital and physical layers (see Section 3.2), IPT operators lean more  towards multifaceted threats affecting complex assets having both physical and digital characteristics.  This threat taxonomy draws upon the key findings from the survey, interviews and desktop research.  Previous ENISA studies have also been employed as a basis for the taxonomy (e.g. ENISA Threat Landscape  and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure 2015,36 ENISA Threat Landscape 201337 and the Smart  Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide).38 In order to keep a practical focus we propose a threat  model that regroups threats into seven threat categories. These groups define the origin of the threat with  each category having its own implications over the security of IPT. However, it must be noted that these  seven threat categories represent a generalised model. The threats each IPT operator must address will  vary depending on multiple factors, including the size of the operator and the contextual nature of their  35 These are contextually modified definitions of those from ETSI TS 102 165-1 V4.2.3 “Telecommunications and  Internet converged Services and Protocols for Advanced Networking (TISPAN); Methods and protocols; Part 1:  Method and preforms for Threat, Risk, Vulnerability Analysis”, March 2011.  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102100_102199/10216501/04.02.03_60/ts_10216501v040203p.pdf  36 ENISA, “Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure”.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic- landscapes/threat-landscape-of-the-internet-infrastructure  37 ENISA, “ENISA Threat Landscape 2013: Overview of current and emerging cyber threats”.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013- overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats  38 ENISA, “Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide”. http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk- management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102100_102199/10216501/04.02.03_60/ts_10216501v040203p.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic-landscapes/threat-landscape-of-the-internet-infrastructure https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic-landscapes/threat-landscape-of-the-internet-infrastructure http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  22  operating environment. As such it is essential IPT operators conduct individualised risk assessments to  identify the specific threats that they need to address.  The identified seven threat categories are as follows:   Physical and large scale attacks are intentional offensive actions, which aim to achieve maximum  distraction, disruption, destruction, exposure, alteration, theft or unauthorised accessing of assets  such as infrastructure, hardware, or ICT connections. This threat group has general application,  thus covers the entire spectrum of cyber-physical infrastructure.   Acts of nature and/or environmental incidents are serious disruptions of the functioning of a  society and can be divided into those natural disasters not directly triggered by humans, and  environmental disasters caused by humans. These threats apply to assets in general, hence also to  IPT infrastructures. Typical threats include: earthquakes, floods, wildfires, pollution, dust and  corrosion.   Accidental errors/malfunctions/failures are related to the condition of not functioning and/or  insufficient functioning of any IT infrastructure assets. Examples include; failures or disruptions of  network devices or systems, software bugs, and configuration errors.   Disruption and/or outages are unexpected disruptions of services or significant decreases in  expected quality, and can affect all kind of IPT assets. Disruption and outages may be triggered by  a range of different reasons.   Nefarious activities and/or abuse are intentional actions that target IPT assets, ranging from  systems and infrastructure to networks, by means of malicious acts with the aim to steal, alter, or  destroy a specified target. This group contains those common threats generally referred to as  cyber attacks, but also related actions that do not have a digital asset as a direct target.   Unintentional damage refers to the destruction, harm, or injury of property or people by accident.  Damage includes both physical and non-physical damage.   Insider threats are similar to nefarious activities, but originate from within the organisation being  attacked or targeted. The perpetrator is often an employee or officer of an organisation or  enterprise. An insider threat does not have to be a present employee or stakeholder, but can also  be a former employee, board member, or anyone who at one time had access to proprietary or  confidential information from within the organisation.  3.1.2 List of threats to public transport  This section presents the most relevant threats to IPT structures based on the desktop research, survey  and interviews, and arranges them according to the categories described in Section 3.1.1. Respondents to  the survey and interviews further evaluated these threats to identify those they consider to be critical.

The list of threats is non- exhaustive and could be complemented at a later date by a more in-depth study. The association between  the threats (both threat groups and individual threats) from Figure 5 and the top asset types from Figure 3  is established through Table 2 below (see Annex 3 for a more detailed table showing all the asset types). As  such, Table 2 shows the relationship between the identified critical threats and the asset types/functions  to which these threats apply.  This information is important for identifying countermeasures that will reduce the exposure surface of  assets. This threat-to-assets association is made on the basis of the field work and initial assessment done  within the project. Since IPT assets tend to blur the lines between digital and physical layers, the same  threat can affect multiple assets. The association performed in this study is non-exhaustive and subject to  refinements, according to particular transport and threat environments.  environmental disasters see: US Department of Transportation, “Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)”.

initial reflections are provided on IPT vulnerabilities. By implementing cyber-physical  systems into critical infrastructures, IPT brings benefits but also introduces a new set of vulnerabilities and  risks to operators and society as a whole.40 Historically, cyber and physical systems have operated fairly  independently of one another41, however, IPT is leading to an integration of both domains and therefore to  a situation where the exploitation of cyber vulnerabilities can result in physical consequences. This brings  both new vulnerabilities and risks. Since IPT is relatively new and on the making, information on IPT  vulnerabilities mainly originates from research, requirements and generic assumptions.42  3.2.1 General vulnerabilities   Common to other IT systems: This category relates to areas that communally affect other IT systems  (i.e. customer privacy and personal data, customer security and physical security and publicly  accessible devices).43 This also includes vulnerabilities in commercially available mainstream IT  products and systems.   Wireless and cellular communication: Wireless communication44 and cellular services introduce all the  typical vulnerabilities in the area of communication conducted between points not connected by an  40 US Department of Homeland Security, “The Future of Smart Cities: Cyber-Physical Infrastructure Risk”, August  2015.  41 This meant that the impact of a cyber-system disruption was contained within the cyber domain, while physical  disruption was contained in the physical domain.  42 This is mainly because there are not very many such infrastructures that have been operational for a sufficient  period such that experiences have been gained, analysed and shared  43 See: Gideon Mbiydzenyuy, Jan A Persson and Paul Davidsson, “Threat, Vulnerability, and Risk Analysis for Intelligent  Truck Parking, a Pre-study”, ETAP III Project Report,  https://www.bth.se/com/intelligent_truck_parking.nsf/attachments/Del_6_Security_pdf/$file/Del_6_Security.pdf  ETSI, “Intelligent Transport Systems”; and Edward Fox,” An Introduction to Cybersecurity Issues in Modern  Transportation Systems”, ITE Journal, July 2013.  http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.377.199&rep=rep1&type=pdf  44 It was noted by operators that the threat “Interruption and/or disruption of frequency” identified above is  considered as a major risk for transport operators as most of their moving assets are linked to their central  equipment via wireless connections. Such connections could be significantly disturbed with few resources (e.g. it is  quite simple to develop a frequency jammer that could block a major station).  https://www.bth.se/com/intelligent_truck_parking.nsf/attachments/Del_6_Security_pdf/$file/Del_6_Security.pdf http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.377.199&rep=rep1&type=pdf  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  27  electrical conductor. For example, inadequate security protocols, inadequate authentication  mechanisms, energy constrain, poor security and unreliable communication.45   Integration of physical and virtual layers: The physical and virtual layers are becoming increasingly  permeable as cyber and physical systems become networked and remotely accessible. “Increased  connectivity, faster speeds, and multi-directional data flows diversify access points into critical  infrastructure, changing and stretching the borders that must be secured.”46   Cohabitation between legacy and new systems: IPT evolves at different rates among operators  because of several factors including; resource availability, user preferences, and scale and  accessibility. Inconsistency of IPT technologies introduces new vulnerabilities. Blind-spots may emerge  in areas where legacy equipment and infrastructures are still used.46   Increased automation: While the process of removing or limiting human interaction for IPT systems  through increased automation improves safety by removing the possibility of human error, it also  introduces new potential vulnerabilities. These include, but are not limited to: an increased number of  system access points and, therefore, potential attack vectors; skill atrophy; cascading failures; and  changes in emergency response plans. 46  3.2.2 Specific vulnerabilities   Scale and complexity of transportation networks: This refers to the difficulty of mapping the entire  IPT system (i.e. due to the loss of visibility for all parts of a system) and the difficulty of securing the  connectivity of mobile devices within transportation networks. Other issues include; the need to trust  components and participants within the network, working with teams with different skills and  competences, and the effective involvement of multiple stakeholders.47   Applying networked technology across large transport systems: This leads to a large number of  system access points stemming from the presence of networked technology across these large  systems, which in turn increase both the difficulty and cost of properly securing each system device.48   Multiple interdependent systems: This refers to the burden of ensuring the smooth interfacing,  communication, and security among interdependent systems. These diverse systems include; sensors,  computers, payment systems, financial systems, emergency systems, ventilation systems, automated  devices, power relays, etc. 46   Access to real-time data: IPT requires nonstop access to real-time data which in turn leads to higher  costs associated with maintenance and service downtime and therefore increased vulnerability. 46   Higher volumes of passengers and freight: This refers to logistical and security hurdles of physically  accommodating enormous volumes of passengers and freight, along with the reality that security  breaches could result in public safety risks. 46  45 C.K.

The inferred vulnerabilities are listed below and presented in Figure 6, whereby these vulnerabilities are  mapped (based on the desktop analysis) on an axis system with axes general vulnerabilities (i.e. applicable  beyond IPT) and specific vulnerabilities (i.e. those specific to IPT); and internal vulnerabilities (i.e.  originating from and controlled by a few operators) versus external vulnerabilities (i.e. those originating  from operators’ interdependence and controlled by multiple operators).  This mapping allows for the identification of “quick wins”, defined as improvements that will impart  significant benefits to transport operators but are relatively easy and inexpensive to implement. These are  vulnerabilities that are internal and hence more likely to be under the direct control of the operator thus  allowing for more impactful interventions, and those that are general which imply more affordable  solutions (i.e. through off-the shelf products and/or greater competition between solution providers).

Specific actions are needed to recover operations, usually in a limited timeframe.   Loss of revenue: In the case of an incident, operations can become limited or suspended, which  leads to a loss revenues. Moreover, responsibilities in case of an incident can also lead to loss of  revenue (fines…).   Impact on reputation / loss of trust: In the case of major service disruptions, risks can also cover  reputational damage and the loss of revenue which can directly impact a company’s bottom line.51   Non-compliance with the regulation on data protection: The disclosure of personal data,  voluntarily or not, is covered by regulation. This risk is usually associated with loss of revenue (due  to fines and mitigation action) and loss of trust (from passengers, clients and municipalities).   Risks on hardware and software: Risks related to the manipulation or destruction of IPT  components, hardware and software (see Section 3.1 Threats) impact the stability and availability  of the IPT systems. This can lead to the disruption of services, inferior passenger and freight  experience, loss of sensitive data and fraud.52   Reliance on invalid information: The area of multiple interdependent systems is also becoming a  more relevant source of concern as traffic operators become more interconnected with each other  and with other smart operators. Using invalid information is a risk as it may limit the quality of the  service.  49 In risk management methodologies risk is interpreted as “the risk factor”, which is calculated based upon the  likelihood of a particular threat being successful and the impact that a successful threats would have on the system.  In this study we do not use risk as a risk factor but instead in more general term as the negative impact produced by a  successful threats.  50 Ahmed Abdel Rahim and Ybette Ochoa “A Framework to Analyze the Survivability and Vulnerability of Intelligent  Transportation System Networks”, Journal of Intelligent Transportation and Urban Planning, Jan 2014, Vol. 2 Issue 1,  pp. 22-29  51 Transport for London , “Strategic Risk Management and Assurance Annual Report 2013/14”, July 2013  52 US Department of Homeland Security , “The Future of Smart Cities”.  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  30   Lack of security of dependencies: The more IPT is moving towards “a system of systems”, the  more important is to understand the dependencies among involved components.53 Hence, the  output of individual vulnerability and risk assessments will depend on the particular mix of  components, processes and infrastructure involved in a particular scenario. For example, with the  increasing proliferation of mobile devices in traffic systems mobile security becomes another  important component of the complex traffic infrastructure.   Unavailability of a dependency: The IPT service depends on several internal and external  dependencies (e.g. power supply, mobile telecommunications…). Hence, the IPT service may suffer  from the unavailability of a dependency and become unavailable.  3.3.2 Societal risks  Similarly to business risk, societal risks are mainly triggered by the manipulation and destruction of IPT  components (see Section 3.1 Threats).54  Effective transportation systems are essential to European society: not only do they enable the mobility of  citizens and goods, they also have significant impacts on economic growth, social development and the  environment.55 Although the expectation is that IPT will cut costs, improve environmental quality and  enhance traditional safety (i.e. by reducing road accidents), it could also amplify old and open up new  societal risks.55   Unavailability of the IPT service: Given the nature of societal assets,56 these components tend to  be integrated systems which are shared among multiple stakeholders. This amplifies the  interdependency effect and consequently increases the risk that such events will lead not only to  interrupted and disrupted transport services for a single IPT operator but also to the unavailability  of transport systems (i.e. network gridlock) with consequent secondary effects for other sectors,  and increases in traffic accidents.57   Disruption to the society: The IPT service is used by citizens to carry out their daily lives. Incident  on the transport system will bring disruption to the society with several impacts on the economy  and the life of the citizens. In case of severe network gridlocks, societal financial losses and slower  economic growth could also occur.   Passengers’ health and safety: Passengers safety in IPT is the priority of all actors. Yet, specific  incidents may impact the transport system and bring a risk to health and safety (e.g. derailing  train…). Furthermore, the international context has changed in recent years: the sustained threat  from terrorism is real and needs to be accounted for when protecting IPT infrastructures.58  53 Steven H.

For example,  vehicles may emit higher pollutants than their expected levels. 59   Confidentiality and privacy: The increased use of sensing, tracking, real-time behavior evaluation  and automated decisions within IPT raises new risks against the confidentiality and privacy of  citizens. 60  3.4 Challenges  This section summarises eight identified key challenges facing cyber security within IPT. Challenges are  identified based on criticisms and/or shortcomings of the existing status quo that were collected during  the survey and the interviews with stakeholders.  While they are numbered 1 to 8 below, these challenges have not been ranked according to any measure  of importance.  3.4.1 Challenge 1: Difficulties to integrate security for safety  While there is a tendency in other contexts to combine safety and security into a single category, within  transport these two concepts are traditionally very separate. Manufacturers and IPT operators usually  prioritise the need for safety requirements, due to the fact that IPT operators experience difficulties in  understanding the concept of (cyber) security, acquiring the necessary skills and developing the necessary  measures to integrate security for safety in their systems.  3.4.2 Challenge 2: Inadequate importance and spending being afforded to cyber security  A key finding from the survey and interviews (see Figure 7) indicates that transport organisations still do  not grant the necessary importance to cyber security within their company. Spending on cyber security  also appears to be inadequate in response to the range of multifaceted cyber threats affecting IPT.  Figure 7: Cyber security spending  3.4.3 Challenge 3: Inadequate checking for countermeasures  The majority of transport organisations do not measure the effectiveness of their countermeasures (see  Figure 8 below presenting findings from the survey and interviews).61 This in turn produces a lack of  59 Even though not directly applied to IPT, the Volkswagen emission scandal shows that emission levels of vehicles can  be modified by software https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal  60 Steinfeld, Aaron, “Ethics and Policy Implications for Inclusive Intelligent Transportation Systems”, Second  International Symposium on Quality of Life Technology, 2010.  61 Please note that the respondents could select multiple relevant answers.

The question of measuring the value of security in a transport organisation is also important when security  teams ask the business to invest in security. The inability to answer this question can often explain why the  business is reluctant to invest.62  Figure 8: Measuring Effectiveness in Cyber security Measures  3.4.4 Challenge 4: Unwillingness to collaborate and exchange information on cyber security  Overall, transport organisations are less than willing to collaborate on and exchange information about  cyber security with other industry players, most likely because of the reputational costs, competitive  pressures and other indirect losses related to cyber crime. Additionally, they may not have implemented  the necessary systems/measures to collect the necessary information to be shared (see Figure 9 below  presenting finding from the survey and interviews). Furthermore, they also have low awareness of any  collaboration and information-sharing activities pertaining to cyber security being carried out within the  sector. However, operators are open to collaborate and exchange information with national Computer  Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA).  62 Ashford Warwick, “How can businesses measure the effectiveness of their IT security teams to ensure they are  getting value?”, http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Security-Think-Tank-How-can-businesses-measure-the- effectiveness-of-their-IT-security-teams  0%  5%  10%  15%  20%  25%  30%  35%  40%  45%  http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Security-Think-Tank-How-can-businesses-measure-the-effectiveness-of-their-IT-security-teams http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Security-Think-Tank-How-can-businesses-measure-the-effectiveness-of-their-IT-security-teams  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  33  Figure 9: Cyber security Information Exchange  3.4.5 Challenge 5: Slow phasing out of legacy systems  The existence and use of legacy systems can weaken cyber security. Legacy systems have security controls  typically focused on the simple necessity of reducing the risk of physical product tampering or theft.  However, the security and threat environment within IPT is beginning to shift towards connected  transportation systems as they become increasingly interconnected to the wider world.63  3.4.6 Challenge 6: Inadequate data exchange between IPT and Smart Cities operators  Data exchanges between IPT and different Smart Cities operators (i.e. railways, LEA, local government,  etc.) tend to be restricted, uncoordinated and ad-hoc. These interactions also vary depending on the  context and/or business model adopted by the operators.64 The potential implications of this uneven data  exchange include weaker security as threats are not being communicated and there is uncertainty over  who is responsible for the security of individual components within systems that integrate multiple  stakeholders.  3.4.7 Challenge 7: Weak situational awareness of cyber threats  Due to the fast moving and interconnect nature of IPT, transport organisations are struggling to achieve a  full awareness of the range of cyber threats and boundaries for securing the IPT landscape.65  3.4.8 Challenge 8: Resistance to security adoption  One finding from the field work indicates that some countermeasures are widely adopted even though  they are not considered effective (e.g. monitoring ICT systems for hardware and software faults), while  others that are considered effective are frequently not deployed (e.g. privacy-by-design, building-in  redundancy and shut down procedures). This underlines a resistance to adapt within the IPT sector and a  culture where things are done because operators are told to do them and/or have always done them  rather than because they work.  63 Steven H. Bayless, Sean Murphy and Anthony Shaw, “Connected Vehicle Assessment. Cybersecurity and  Dependable Transportation”, Connected Vehicle Technology Scan Series, 2012-2014.  64 For example electrified transport systems report good integration with energy suppliers. Some data exchanges are  happening between infrastructure providers, law enforcement and emergency services (and to a less extent with  local government, transport industry associations, e.g. UITP, and government/regulatory bodies) in relation to  criminal incidents and emergency events yet other stakeholders/elements such as banks and social media are often  not well integrated.  65 US Department of Homeland Security, “The Future of Smart Cities”.

Good practices for securing intelligent public transport  This section sets out existing good practices for securing IPT networks as identified through both an  analysis of existing good practice documentation complemented by interviews with a range of  stakeholders, including; transport operators, Smart City municipalities, risk managers and cyber security  experts. By good practices we are referring to effective security measures that should be implemented if  they address weaknesses identified during a risk assessment of your business operation. The inclusion of  these good practices reflects our intention that this study should operate as a practical guide for IPT  operators, one that will assist in supporting their internal processes.  One point that must be remembered when considering the good practices discussed here is that this  section only deals with existing good practices as identified during the desktop research and the survey  and interviews. Gaps in the current suite of existing good practices are not addressed here, but are  identified and discussed in Section 5.  This section provides a brief description of each individual good practice identified to secure IPT. They are  presented and arranged into three categories according to their inherent nature:   Technical good practices;   Policies and standards;   Organisational, people and processes.  These good practices are effective to counter threats before, during and/or after an attack. For more  information, Annex 4 details these good practices by presenting them as a checklist to assist stakeholders  in their assessment and implementation.  4.1 Technical good practices  Conduct security-focused risk assessments: Each operator should conduct regular risk assessments  covering physical, cyber and information security that entail mapping the scope of their business  operations, identifying the critical business functions, and then identifying the assets critical to these  functions. Regular risk assessments are required to identify changes in the threat landscape and thereby  ensure that the correct threats to the business are identified and efficiently addressed.66  Employ appropriate physical security, access controls and protection measures: Physical security is  required to protect both the physical and digital assets of an IPT network by preventing unauthorised  physical access to sensitive locations, whether deliberate and unintentional. The nature of the physical  security employed should be commensurate to the assets being protected67 (i.e. from simple locks for  areas designated low risk/value to layered security, such as multi-factor authentication systems potentially  combined with guards/CCTV, for high risk/value areas).68  66 See Cristin Goodwin and Paul Nicholas, “Developing a City Strategy for Cybersecurity: A seven-step guide for local  governments”, October 2014. http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/B/3/1B3C6BE3-8FA4-40BD-9BD6- 640FD2F1F648/City%20Strategy%20for%20Cybersecurity.pdf  67 A Risk Assessment will be required to differentiate between areas of high risk/value and low risk/value.  68 Ross Anderson, “Security Engineering (2nd Edition)”, 2008.  http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/B/3/1B3C6BE3-8FA4-40BD-9BD6-640FD2F1F648/City%20Strategy%20for%20Cybersecurity.pdf http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/B/3/1B3C6BE3-8FA4-40BD-9BD6-640FD2F1F648/City%20Strategy%20for%20Cybersecurity.pdf  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  35  Employ secure digital access controls to networks and data: To complement physical security measures,  IPT operators must ensure they employ robust digital access controls to their networks and stored data  (whether in local servers or cloud-based) so as to prevent attackers accessing these via ICT due to the  prevalent of these attacks on both large and small businesses.69 70 Common measures include: firewalls;  password controls; multi-factor authentication; use of firewall based VPNs.71 72  Employ alarms/surveillance for protecting physical and digital assets: Closely linked to the monitoring  and recording of activity is the need to install alarms and surveillance systems across the cyber/physical  network of an IPT operator to secure that network. Alarms and surveillance systems designed to focus the  attention of operators on specific locales or events are necessary requirements. This is because the size  and complexity of an IPT network distributed across a city demands the implementation of systems  enabling a limited security team to effectively monitor the entire network.  Encryption: Operators need to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive data (e.g. customer/employee  financial details, intellectual property, etc.) that they both hold (either internally or on external  servers/clouds) and communicate across networks, due to the prevalence of cyber attacks.68 In effect, IPT  operators should work on the assumption their digital systems will be successfully accessed by attackers.  To this end they should employ industry-recognised encryption standards,73 use VPNs,74 and if available  make use of national cyber security agencies to guide on encryption methods.  Develop secure and private communication networks: Operators need to ensure the security of their  communication networks and the privacy of the data traveling across these networks as they represent a  target for attacker. As IPT communication networks include both physical and digital elements, a  combination of protection methods are required, including; tamper-resistant devices, access controls,  firewalled VPNs, encryption, message integrity provisions, network intrusion detection systems, etc.75  Employ intrusion detection systems (IDSs): IDSs aid in monitoring a network to inform on internal and  external attacks, malicious network communications and usage of computer systems. Common methods  include anomaly detection and misuse (signature) detection.76 IDSs are needed to supplement firewalls  69 HM Government, “2015 Information Security Breaches Survey”, June 2015.  http://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs-technical-report-blue-03.pdf  70 Mariana Carroll and Paula Kotzé, “Secure Cloud Computing: Benefits, Risks and Controls”, Information Security  South Africa, 2011. http://researchspace.csir.co.za/dspace/bitstream/10204/5184/1/Kotze4_2011.pdf  71 HM Government, “Cyber Essentials Scheme: Requirements for basic technical protection from cyber attacks”, June  2014.  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/317481/Cyber_Essentials_Require ments.pdf  72 Government of the HKSAR, “VPN Security”, February 2008.  http://www.infosec.gov.hk/english/technical/files/vpn.pdf  73 See for example: ENISA, “Algorithms, key size and parameters report – 2014”, November 2014; ANSSI,  “Mécanismes cryptographiques, V2.03” 2014; BSI “Kryptographische Verfahren: Empfehlungen und Schlussellangen:  BSI TR-02102-1”, February 2015.  74 Ye Yan, Yi Qian, Hamid Sharif and David Tipper, “A survey on Cyber Security for Smart Grid Communications”,  Communication Surveys & Tutorials, IEEE, Vol.14(4), 2012, pp.998-1010.  75 Hung-Jen Liao, Chun-Hung Richard Lin, Ying-Chih Lin and Kuang-Yuan Tung, “Intrusion detection system: A  comprehensive review”, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, Vol.36, 2013, pp.16-24.  76 Chih-Fong Tsai, Yu-Feng Hsu, Chia-Ying Lin, and Wei-Yang Lin, “Intrusion detection by machine learning: A review”,  Expert Systems with Applications, Vol.36, 2009, pp.11994-12000.  http://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs-technical-report-blue-03.pdf http://researchspace.csir.co.za/dspace/bitstream/10204/5184/1/Kotze4_2011.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/317481/Cyber_Essentials_Requirements.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/317481/Cyber_Essentials_Requirements.pdf http://www.infosec.gov.hk/english/technical/files/vpn.pdf  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  36  and virus scanners as there is no network security measure that will ensure perfect cyber security. Hence  IPT operators should employ multiple protection measures through a defence-in-depth approach.  Employ identity management and authentication systems: To secure IPT requires restricting access to  both physical spaces and digital networks, such that only authorised individuals can access these spaces.  This requires the implementation of measures, such as multifactor (i.e. two and three-factor)  authentication systems, for confirming that the person seeking access is who they claim to be. Additionally  there is the need to link activity within a network to the identity of the actor to prevent repudiation:  measures such as digital signatures, access controls, and audit trails should be employed here.77  Integrate shut-down procedures/remote deactivation of capabilities, for assets: Malfunctioning,  compromised or stolen assets may be in geographically remote locales on a transport network. To enable  prompt reactions by IPT operators, the ability to either remotely shut-down or deactivate certain  capabilities/functionalities of these assets can minimise damage/loss. Operators can use SCADA systems to  issue such supervisory commands to field devices/assets.78  Operate in degraded mode of operation: In case of a failure, the system might still operate at with a  reduced level of service. In these conditions, the IPT system manages to ensure certain critical functions at  a minimum level. For that purpose, IPT operators have to determine which key performance indicators can  be relaxed until the normal service is recovered.  4.2 Policies and standards  Employ security by design: Physical/cyber infrastructure should incorporate security requirements  upstream during the engineering process to minimise the potential and impact of breaches. As per these  requirement, employing security by design improves the security capabilities of products and helps  mitigate the likelihood of the costly retrofitting of security protections.79  Establish disaster recovery processes and maintain back-ups: It is imperative to develop and establish a  disaster recovery processes, and to maintain back-ups of business data preferably in a remote secure  location to minimising the likelihood of collateral damage. These actions acknowledge the reality that  despite an operator’s best security efforts, it is inevitable that incidents will occur,80 whether through  deliberate attacks, user errors, accidents and/or environmental incidents.  Define degraded modes of operation: The definition of degraded modes of operation contributes to  enhancing the resilience of the IPT system by ensuring a minimum level of service. One of several  degraded modes can be defined in function of the systems impacted and the dependencies identified. For  example, degraded modes of operation are applied in air traffic management in order to ensure safety.81  77 Thomas Calabrese, “Information Security Intelligence: Cryptographic Principles and Applications”, 2004.  78 Bonnie Zhu, Anthony Joseph and Shankar Sastry, “A Taxonomy of Cyber Attacks on SCADA Systems”, Internet of  Things (iThings/CPSCom), 2011 International Conference on and 4th International Conference on Cyber, Physical and  Social Computing, pp.380-388, October 2011.  79 Ann Cavoukian and Marc Chanliau, “Privacy and Security by Design: A Convergence of Paradigms”, January 2013.  https://www.ipc.on.ca/images/resources/pbd-convergenceofparadigms.pdf  80 A.

It emphasises the need for information security to all staff members, and reflects  the commitment of the organisation to operate in a controlled, secure manner and achieve information  security.82 Failure to develop and implement an information security policy undermines the operator’s  ability to focus their information security activities consistently across their organisation.  Forecasting, early warning systems and risk analysis: IPT operators possess finite security resources,  hence it is essential they can direct these resources appropriately so as to maximise their impact. Knowing  of, or predicting the risk of, threats in advance of their emergence enables the stakeholder to efficiently  allocate their resources and to take pre-emptive steps to mitigate damages.  Separate critical systems from non-critical systems: Critical systems (i.e. those controlling steering,  braking, etc.) should not be accessible though other non-critical systems installed within the same vehicle  (e.g. information displays, entertainment systems, etc.). Successful attacks on critical systems in smart  vehicles where access was gained through non-critical systems demonstrates the safety and security  imperatives of keeping these systems separate.83 84 Similarly, networks linking critical systems and/or those  essential to the provision of critical services should be separated (either physically or virtually) from  networks linking non-critical systems/services.85  Enhance physical security protecting critical physical infrastructure: Risk assessments should be used to  identify which infrastructure is critical to the IPT operator and, enhanced physical protection measures  should be implemented as a result.86 Each operator will have their own unique assets requiring protection,  and this two-step process ensures resources are allocated on an evidence basis.  Implement a security control centre with real-time monitoring: A centralised control centre for directing  and coordinating security resources to respond to threats as they are identified enables the efficient  allocation of resources, and provides a recognisable point of contact for liaising with LEA, CSIRTs and other  Smart City stakeholders.  Ensure redundancy for critical systems: Building redundancy into critical systems reduces the likelihood  that the failure of a single or small number of components, or an isolated incident within the network, will  result in the failure of the entire network. While this good practice is applicable to all critical systems, two  specific instances were highlighted by respondents as being particularly critical for IPT, these being;  communication systems and power systems.  Create resilient communication systems: Communication systems are essential components of IPT  systems with the integration of ICT into public transport defining IPT. At its extreme, the failure of the  communication system will halt an IPT network, and these communication systems are susceptible to a  multitude of physical and cyber attacks, acts of nature and environmental incidents. Hence it is essential to  82 Karin Hone and J.H.P Eloff, “What Makes an Effective Information Security Policy?”, Network Security, Vol.6(1),  2002, pp.14-16.  83 BBC News, “Fiat Chrysler recalls 1.4 million cars after Jeep hack”, 24 July 2015.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33650491  84 BBC News, “Car hack uses digital-radio broadcasts to seize control”, 22 July 2015.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33622298  85 See Eric D. Knapp and Joel Langill, “Industrial Network Security: Securing Critical Infrastructure Networks for Smart  Grid, SCADA, and Other Industrial Control Systems (2nd edition)”, 2015.  86 This is not to say that non-critical infrastructure should be unprotected; merely that critical infrastructure should be  assessed for additional protections.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33650491 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33622298  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  38  build redundancy into IPT communication systems so no single failure will break the network. When public  telecommunication networks are used, this resilience can be contractual if specified in the Service Level  Agreement established with communication providers.  Create resilient power systems: IPT infrastructure (including some vehicles) require electricity to operate.  Nevertheless, these power systems are susceptible to a multitude of physical and cyber attacks, strikes,  acts of nature and environmental incidents which can lead to disruptions and outages. Hence it is essential  to build redundancy into IPT power networks so that no single point of failure exists. This resilience can be  contractual if specified in the Service Level Agreement established with power suppliers.  4.3 Organisational, people and processes  Monitor and record activity: Operators need to implement technologies to monitor and record both  physical activity at high value locations (e.g. CCTV, authentication logging, etc.) and digital activity (e.g.  activity logs) on their networks as part of a cohesive Security Management System.87 These measures are  required for multiple purposes including: ensuring safety, providing security, the gathering of forensic  evidence, system recovery processes, training purposes, identifying insider threats, data for risk analyses,  maintaining system stability, etc.88  Define security requirements during procurement processes: During the procurement process “security”  needs to be afforded the same importance as “functionality”. This enhancing of the status of security at  this early stage is to decrease business risks posed by cyber and physical threats, and acts to mitigate the  likelihood of the costly retrofitting of security protections.89  Coordinate with LEAs and CSIRTs: IPT operators should coordinate with LEAs/CSIRTS. The level of  coordination can include sharing threat/good practice information, developing and running online training  programmes, and conducting live drills.90 This level of coordination is necessary as LEA/CSIRTs occupy  privileged positions to see emerging and/or applicable threats from other stakeholders outside of IPT.  Raise awareness on cyber threats to all levels of staff including management: Cyber threats keep evolving  at fast pace. It is important to raise awareness among staff by informing them periodically about current  and top threats targeting IT systems and assets of the organisation. Highlighting security good practices to  protect against these threats is also important. In order to improve the awareness level efficiently, all staff  including non-technical staff and in particular management shall be informed. In particular, informing  management on existing governance models is likely to help integrating cyber security in the organisation.  Engage in staff training: IPT staff are valuable assets for protecting the network against both physical and  digital threats. They are also a potential source of threats to the network through accidently introducing  viruses and malware, as spearfishing victims, etc. To maximise benefits and minimise risks, pre-emptive  training programmes complemented by post-event training (to incorporate “lessons learnt”) are essential.  87 Giovanni Bocchetti, Francesco Flammini, Concetta Pragliola and Alfio Pappalardo, “Dependable integrated  surveillance systems for the physical security of metro railways”, Third ACM/IEEE International Conference on  Distributed Smart Cameras, 2009.  88 Preeti Tuli and Priyanka Sahu, “System Monitoring and Security Using Keylogger”, International Journal of  Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.2 (3), March 2013, pp.106-111.  89 Robert Newby, “Security Think Tank: Procurement and security are uneasy bedfellows”, ComputerWeekly.com,  November 2013.  90 See Cristin Goodwin and Paul Nicholas, “Developing a City Strategy for Cybersecurity: A seven-step guide for local  governments”, October 2014.  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  39  Develop organisational and operational procedures and guidelines: The development and  implementation of operational guidelines and procedures should be integrated into the culture of an IPT  via staff training. Without this process, good practices, lessons learnt from prior incidents and corporate  knowledge cannot be retained and applied throughout an organisation in a systematic fashion.  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  40  5. Gap analysis  This section provides an analysis of the main gaps in relation to cyber security in IPT as identified during  the field work. Gaps were elicited from the comparison between the identified threats, vulnerabilities and  risk, and good practices.  Gaps to be addressed are widespread and focused not just on technology but also on other areas, such as:  organisational gaps, policy and standardisation issues, and the need to develop more comprehensive and  integrated tools. This section summaries eight identified key cyber security gaps in IPT. While they are  numbered 1 to 8 below, these gaps have not been ranked according to any measure of importance.  5.1 Gap 1: Lack of a common EU approach to Intelligent Public Transport Security  There is currently no common EU approach specific to either intelligent or standard public transport, or  related framework that specifically address IPT cyber security needs (see Section 2.2 for an analysis on EU  legislation).91 Potentially the proposed NIS Directive might have an impact on addressing elements of this  gap, above all in relation to cyber threat reporting, but may need to be expanded to encompass  requirements for IPT cyber security within both urban transport networks and national/international rail  networks.  5.2 Gap 2: No integration of security in current EU guidelines for IPT  Although there are EU guidelines on cyber security, very little is specifically designed for intelligent  transport.92 A gap here exists for EU common guidelines that deal more closely with intelligent transport  above all in relation to enhancing the cyber security of IPT systems and the implementation of appropriate  processes with a suitable cyber security focus.93 Furthermore, although some initial developments in  relation to an EU-wide strategy for intelligent transport have been put in place in recent years, via the  action plan for the Deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in Europe94 and the Directive  2010/40/EU95 requiring MS to develop their own strategy for implementing transport, these attempts do  not focus on cyber security.96 Therefore there is still a gap in relation to comprehensive and integrated  guidelines or strategies tailored to secure IPT from cyber threats. Such guidelines could define the action  of different stakeholders involved on IPT cyber security (e.g. coordination, responsibilities…).  5.3 Gap 3: Lack of common definitions and formalised cyber security policies  The field work indicates that definitions for IPT are not widely used or adopted (see Figure 10) within  transport organisations. Furthermore, the majority of transport organisations do not have a formalised  91 While Directive 2008/57/EC is a partial exception here covering the interoperability of EU railways, this Directive  also has nothing to say on cyber security needs.  92 See: ENISA, “Good Practice Guide for Incident Management”, 2010; and ENISA, “Technical Guidelines on Security  Measures”, October 2014.  93 More mature IPT implies the coordination and cooperation among different operators and users in different  countries , hence the EU focus is a paramount.  94 EC, “Action Plan for the Deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in Europe - COM(2008) 886 final/2 –  CORRIGENDUM”, 2008.  95 EC, “Directive 2010/40/EU on the framework for the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of  road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport”, 2010.  96 In addition they only address road vehicles, therefore other major modes of transportation of IPT are not covered.  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  41  cyber security policy in place and/or list of critical assets that need to be protected by cyber threats (see  Figure 11). There is need for common definitions and the adoption of more formalised security  strategies.97 This will lead to greater security and collaboration within and among transport organisations.  Figure 10: Use of definition of Intelligent Transport  Figure 11: Cyber security policy and definitions for critical assets  5.4 Gap 4: Lack of corporate governance for IPT security98  An effective governance framework for IPT security within organisations, setting out clear responsibilities  and objectives is still missing.99 By allocating clear cyber security responsibilities with an organisation, this  governance framework (covering common training programmes, the identification and advance warning of  threats, support and advice, etc.) would also greatly facilitate cyber security collaboration between IPT and  smart city operators on the one hand, and governments, LEA and national CSIRTs on the other.  5.5 Gap 5: No specific security standards for IPT  There is a lack of specific security standards for IPT that can address the specific context and security  threats faced by IPT assets. Generic standards, such as the ISO27000 series, are not sufficiently useful for  the complex reality of IPT and are poorly related to the security environment within which transport  organisations interact and operate today. It is important that standards are able to accommodate new IPT  functionalities and concepts as they become relevant, while being able to remain dynamic, extensible and  flexible.100  5.6 Gap 6: Lack of advanced interdependent analysis tools  Given the highly interconnected and complex nature of transportation networks, there is the need for  more sophisticated analysis tools that can capture asset interdependence and cascade-effects among all  97 ISO, “Smart Cities. Preliminary Report 2014”, ISO/IEC publication, 2015.  http://www.iso.org/iso/smart_cities_report-jtc1.pdf  98 While we have avoided ranking either the identified gaps or challenges, during the validation workshop for this  research, practitioners were of the consensus that the lack of corporate governance currently represents the most  important gap/challenge facing IPT.  99 ESADEgeo and Zurich, “Global cyber governance: preparing for new business risks”, Risk Nexus, April 2015.  100 The recent work on IPT standards from ETSI and the US Department of Transportation aim at filling this gap at the  European and US level.

These tools will help capture how interdependencies  operate and will heighten impacts in order to develop procedures and policies to improve recovery.101  5.7 Gap 7: Lack of advanced risk assessment tools  Risk assessment methodologies that can deal with multiple networked stakeholders working in  collaboration need to be developed. This requires a different mind-set for existing risk management  approaches, which often begin by scoping a system (i.e. defining its borders) prior to a risk assessment  based on the individual elements. However, in interconnected systems this clear border does not exist. To  address this gap we need to redesign risk management systems/approaches so that they operate from a  stakeholder perspective rather than border perspective.102 103  5.8 Gap 8: Lack of advanced real-time and multi-stakeholder-enabled security  technologies  Due to the number of networked technologies applied across the transportation systems, often belonging  to different operators and displaying multiple interdependence,104 105 there is a need for more advanced  security IT infrastructures that allow for multi-stakeholder penetration testing, and provide real-time  authentication among both trusted and un-trusted users in a multi-stakeholder environment.105  101 Rae Zimmerman and Carlos E.

Recommendations  This final section of the study provides nine recommendations on how to enhance cyber security within  IPT. Recommendations are directed towards different groups of stakeholders, specifically: decision  makers; transport operators; and manufactures and solution providers. The recommendations try to  accommodate both the rigorous requirements coming from the study and the more practical matters of  short-range implementation by practitioners. Each recommendation draws upon the information and  analysis presented in earlier sections and has been validated by a range of different stakeholders. Below  each recommendation are brief explanatory notes.  Figure 12 summarizes the above mentioned challenges and gaps and allocates them across four areas:  Figure 12: Challenges and gaps   Gaps and challenges that are mainly related  to technology;   Gaps and challenges that are mainly related  to organisation, people and process;   Gaps and challenges mainly concerning  policy and standard; and   Gaps and challenges concerning a mix of all  the previous areas (i.e. affecting all the  previously mentioned areas).106  As the figure indicates, challenges and gaps  tend to concentrate in both the technology and  tools area and policy and standards area.  Challenges  C1 Difficulties to integrate security for safety  C2 Inadequate importance and spending being  afforded to cyber security  C3 Inadequate checking for countermeasures  C4 Unwillingness to collaborate and exchange  information on cyber security  C5 Slow phasing out of legacy systems  C6 Inadequate data exchange between IPT and SC  operators  C7 Weak situational awareness of cyber threats  C8 Resistance to security adoption  Gaps  G1: Lack of a common EU approach to IPT  G2: No integration of security in current guidelines  or strategies for IPT  G3: Lack of common definitions and formalised  cyber security policies  G4: Lack of corporate governance for IPT security  G5: No specific security standards for IPT  G6: Lack of advanced interdependent analysis tools  G7: Lack of advanced risk assessment tools  G8: Lack of advanced real-time and multi- stakeholder-enabled security technologies  106 The allocation was based on desktop research, survey and interviews  Technology Organisation, people & process  All Policy & standard  C1  C2  C3  C6  C5  C4  C8  C7  G1 G2  G3  G6  G5  G4  G8  G7  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  44  6.1 For decision makers107  6.1.1 EC and MS institutions should promote public/private collaboration on IPT cyber security at  national level and EU-wide  This requires EC and MS institutions to actively promote greater collaboration, information exchange and  knowledge on IPT cyber security across-borders via appropriate measures. For instance, this could take the  form of establishing EU multi-stakeholder fora, engaging in regular consultations, conducting awareness  campaigns, etc. The objectives of such initiatives will be: to set up cross-border and multi-stakeholder  collaboration on cyber security; develop and implement awareness campaigns to educate end-users on  risks in smart environments; and share best practices and information about cyber threats, attacks and  cyber measures. Regarding this last objective, voluntary reporting of threat incidents to a trusted third  party within the EU could be a viable tool for identifying and quantifying threat levels. At the moment in  transport there is no real coordination on cyber security across national borders. This recommendation  directly addresses challenges C4 and C7 as identified in Figure 12 above, while also having a positive  impact on challenges C2, C3, C6 and C8.  6.1.2 EC institutions and agencies should promote and facilitate the development of a common EU  approach to IPT security  Relevant EC institutions and agencies (e.g. ETSI, CEN, CENELEC, ENISA, DG MOVE) must play an important  role in facilitating and promoting integrated industry efforts via open IPT coordination initiatives, whereby  standards and common guidelines tailored for cyber security in IPT are produced by interested parties  across Europe through a transparent, open and consensus-based process. Transport operators,  manufactures and vendors will be consulted in order to gain their support and buy-in for these new  standards and guidelines. Existing initiatives on EC standards, led by ETSI, CEN and CENELEC108, could be  further developed and expanded to include wider participation from public and private partnerships,  and/or industry stakeholders. In addition, the cross-exchange of knowledge and practices between  transport and other sectors (e.g. telecommunication, finance, etc.) should be developed to leverage  lessons learned and existing good practices. Taken together, these actions would enable the identification  of common standards and guidelines for IPT in areas where these are currently less effective and mature  (e.g. minimum cyber security requirements and good practices that should be in place; implementation of  security by design; minimum security requirements for data exchange and collaborative IPT systems  among operators, etc.). Such guidelines could be based on the work of ENISA and/or national CSIRTs. This  recommendation directly addresses challenges C3-C8 as well as gap G2, while also having a positive impact  on gaps G1 and G4-G7.  6.1.3 EC institutions and agencies should develop a comprehensive EU strategy and framework for  cyber security in IPT  This suggests that EC institutions should further develop the existing EU cyber security strategy and  framework with a greater focus on IPT in order to provide a much more comprehensive, focused and  integrated approach to IPT cyber security across Europe. This goes hand-in-hand with efforts to develop an  ongoing dialogue with stakeholders to inform on policymaking and to ensure effective implementation of  107 By “decision makers” we are referring primarily to publically elected/appointed officials with decision-making  powers that impact on IPT at both the EU and Member States levels.  108 These organisations were given a mandate to develop European standards to provide interoperability,  compatibility and continuity for the deployment and operational use of ITS (see Directive 2010/40/EU of the  European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2010 and Directive 98/34/EC)  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  45  the endorsed strategy. The anticipated NIS is an initial step in this direction and a building block for a  comprehensive framework. This recommendation directly addresses gaps G1 and G8.  6.1.4 EC and MS should integrate and converge security efforts made in other sectors of activity  IPT operators share similarities with other operators in the usage of systems (e.g. ICS/SCADA) and  operations. Efforts have already been made in other sectors of activity to enhance their security (e.g.  Smart Grids). In order to benefit from these existing efforts, Policy Makers from the European Commission  and from Member States should assess which measures can be integrated to IPT. Moreover, it is important  to converge the efforts when possible, through collaboration and experience sharing. This  recommendation directly addresses gaps G1-G3 and challenge C6 and C8.  6.1.5 EC and MS should foster the development of harmonised cyber security standards for IPT  The lack of a dedicated cyber security standard for IPT is an obstacle to the adoption of good security  principles by IPT operators, manufacturers and solution vendors. With the support of the EC and MS, the  industry (private and public sector) should ensure the development and adoption of harmonised standards  adapted to the particularities. One or several completing standards could be developed to cover cyber  security from various points of views (e.g. technical, organisational, validation of security practices, etc.) as  it has been proposed in other domains (e.g. Smart Grids). This recommendation directly addressed gaps  G1-G3 and challenges C1 and C3.  6.2 For transport operators  6.2.1 IPT operators should integrate cyber security in their corporate governance  This leads transport operators to define the roles and responsibilities of top management as well as the  integration of cyber risks into their budgetary, risk and project management operational processes. This  does not necessarily mean that transport operators need to develop a new governance framework, but  integraty cyber security roles into its current one. The objective is to integrate within the current  framework the budget and responsibilities to meet cyber security objectives (e.g. training, awareness  raising, acquisition, etc.). This recommendation directly addresses challenges C1, C2, C3, C4 and C8, and  gaps G3 and G4.  6.2.2 IPT operators should develop and implement an integrated corporate strategy addressing  holistically cyber security and safety risks  This requires transport operators develop effective cyber security policies for cyber security in order to  start formalising cyber security processes both internally and with the other operators they  interact/collaborate with. The policy should also make clear the relationship between security and safety,  the minimum security requirements for collaborative IPT initiatives with other operators and the need to  report and exchange information and know-how on cyber security with relevant agencies and other  operators. If transport operators do not have a clear policy spelling out their objectives for cyber security,  and if a senior manager is not clearly responsible for the final outcome within the organisation(s) involved  in sharing IPT infrastructures (i.e. responsible for management of the cyber risk), then this final outcome  will not happen. This recommendation directly addresses challenges C1, C2, C4, C6 and C8, and gaps G6  and G7, while also having a positive impact on challenges C5 and C7.  6.2.3 IPT operators should implement risk management for cyber security in multi-stakeholder  environments including external contractors and dependencies  This entails that transport operators should have tailored risk management processes in place for cyber  security which involve all the relevant participating operators and are integrated into their corporate risk  frameworks. These processes shall also include external contractors that interact with the IPT operators.  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  46  This will improve standardisation and consistency on how to manage cyber security risks within all the  participant organisations, while supporting managers with cyber security responsibilities in doing their  jobs. Transport operators should also think of involving other external stakeholders, such as end-users and  civil society, as part of their approach to managing cyber risk. These external stakeholders could bring  valuable, external insights and a customer or citizen point of view, which are necessary for the effective  management of cyber risks. This recommendation directly addresses challenge C7 and gaps G3 and G4,  while also having a positive impact on challenge C4.  6.2.4 IPT operators should clearly and routinely specify their cyber security requirements  This suggests that transport operators should routinely and clearly specify their cyber security  requirements for all their transports initiatives and projects as part of their risk management processes.  Such activities should not be “one-off events”, rather they should be a part of regular cyber security  reviews. These cyber security requirements can then be incorporated into the beginning of project-cycles  through the use of security by design. They also provide a guide for enhancing the cyber security of future  infrastructure developments when planning the phasing-out of legacy systems. This recommendation  directly addresses challenges C5 and C8.  6.2.5 IPT operators should annually review organisational cyber security processes, practices and  infrastructures  This suggests that transport operators should check and review their internal processes, practices and  infrastructures for cyber security every year as part of the organisation’s corporate review and  performance management procedures. It also feed into the goal of creating/strengthening a cyber security  practice knowledge base among IPT stakeholders. This annual review should be done in parallel with the  review of overall risk management procedures. Senior managers discuss and assess how well the  organisation has performed in relation to its cyber security objectives, and assess whether the  implemented cyber security processes, practices, training, infrastructures and tools have been adequate.  This review provides a systematic and periodic process for assessing the organisation’s cyber security  performance in relation to certain pre-established criteria and organisational objectives, while identifying  needs for further enhancement and next steps. This recommendation directly addresses challenges C3,  while also having a positive impact on challenges C5 and C8, and gaps G3-G5.  6.3 For manufacturers and solution providers  6.3.1 Manufacturers and solution providers should create products/solutions that match the cyber  security requirements of IPT end-users  Manufacturers and providers should increase their collaboration with end-users in relation to R&D, while  aligning their solutions much more closely to the cyber security requirements, needs and affordability  concerns of end-users. Solutions should be specifically tailored to address both existing gaps and the needs  of end-users that the end-users themselves have identified via their own risk analyses (examples here may  include; the development of advanced interdependent analysis tools, improving real-time capabilities,  developing advanced risk assessment tools that can operate in multi-stakeholder environments, and  technologies that enable security). Products should also be developed by employing security by design  principles including; defence in depth, separation of privilege, securing the weakest link, promoting  privacy, etc. At the moment solutions tend to be too general and do not reflect the contextual reality of IPT  offerings. This recommendation directly addresses gaps G3-G5.  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  47  6.3.2 Manufacturers and solution providers should collaborate in the development of IPT-specific  standards and apply them to IPT solutions  This recommends that manufacturers and providers should collaborate in the development of security  standards tailored for IPT by participating in open IPT coordination initiatives (see recommendation in  Section 6.1.2), while also meeting all applicable EU and international standards in the development of their  products and solutions (e.g. ETSI, Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS); Security; Security header and  certificate formats, 2015 and US government, Federal Information Security Management Act - FISMA,  2002). This recommendation directly addresses gap G2.  6.3.3 Manufacturers and solution providers should develop a trusted information sharing platform on  risks and vulnerabilities  A trusted information sharing platform offers the possibility to its participants to exchange knowledge on  risks and vulnerabilities. The trust aspect of such platform is necessary to ensure good participation, as it  constitutes an incentive to share about incidents and solutions. For Intelligent Public Transports, it is  recommended that manufacturers and solution providers participate to the development of such a trusted  information sharing platform. The objective is to understand existing vulnerabilities in IPT systems, the  risks associated to IPT as well as to promote possible solutions in order to improve the readiness level of  the participants. This recommendation directly addresses challenges C4 and C7 as well as gap G3.  6.3.4 Manufacturers and solution providers should provide security guidance for your systems,  products and solutions  IPT operators who integrate new systems needs guidance to do it securely. Manufacturers and service  providers should provide security guidance to describe proper procedures and parameters for secure  configuration, operation and maintenance. Such guidance should lead IPT operators to improve their  awareness and clarify liabilities. For instance, one possible guidance regarding patch management could  explain the consequences on patching systems in relation to compatibility and availability. This  recommendation directly addresses challenges C6 and C7 as well as gaps G6 and G7.  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  48  Annexes  A.1 Key EU legislation and policy/strategy documents affecting IPT  Table 3 describes the legislation and policies that combine to form the legal and policy environment  governing IPT at the EU level.  Table 3: EU legislation and policy documents  EXISTING EU LEGISLATION  Title General Description Impact on IPT  Directive 95/46/EC  on the protection of individuals  with regard to the processing of  personal data and on the free  movement of such data  Under this Directive, MS shall protect the  fundamental rights and freedoms of  citizens, and in particular their right to  privacy with respect to the processing of  personal data, as well as ensuring the free  movement of such data between MS.  This Directive (together with Directive  2002/58/EC) sets out rules protecting  fundamental rights and freedoms of  individuals, specifically in relation to data  privacy, security and the re-use of  information. This includes passengers on  IPT networks.  Directive 2002/58/EC  concerning the processing of  personal data and the protection  of privacy in the electronic  communications sector (Directive  on privacy and electronic  communications)  Directive 2002/58/EC complements  Directive 1995/46/EC. It concerns the  protection of privacy with respect to the  processing of personal data in the  electronic communication sector, as well  as ensuring the free movement of such  data between MS.  This Directive (together with Directive  1995/46/EC) sets out rules protecting  fundamental rights and freedoms of  individuals, specifically in relation to  consent, privacy, security and the re-use  of information. Services provided to the  public within IPT networks via electronic  communications will need to have regard  for this Directive. Use of location data  linked to user’s devices, provision of  security, use of cookies, and  recording/storage of data are all possible  issues here.  Directive 2009/33/EC  on the promotion of clean and  energy-efficient road transport  vehicles  This Directive requires applicable  authorities, entities and operators to take  into account lifetime energy and  environmental impacts when purchasing  road transport vehicles. This includes  energy consumption and emissions of CO2  and of certain pollutants.  Directive (2009/33/EC) applies to public  transport, including; railways, automated  systems, tramways, trolley buses, and  buses. However, the focus is very narrow  covering only a specific set of  environmental vehicle specifications.  Directive 2010/40/EU  on the framework for the  deployment of Intelligent  Transport Systems in the field of  road transport and for interfaces  with other modes of transport  This Directive establishes a framework to  support the coordinated, coherent  deployment and use of Intelligent  Transport Systems (ITS) within the EU. It  also provides for the development of  specifications and necessary standards  within areas including; ITS road safety and  security, linking vehicles with transport  infrastructure, optimal use of data, and  continuity of service.  Defines ITS. Enables the EC to adopt  specifications necessary to ensure the  compatibility, interoperability and  continuity for the deployment and  operational use of ITS. Also, promotes the  development of necessary standards in  these areas. Sets out rules on privacy,  security and the reuse of information.  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  49  Directive 2008/57/EC  on the interoperability of the rail  system within the Community  This Directive concerns the provisions  relating to the interoperability  constituents, the interfaces and  procedures, as well as the conditions of  overall compatibility of the rail systems  across the EU, that are required to  achieve its interoperability.  This Directive establishes Technical  Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs)  for the subsystems that comprise the  trans-European rail system. No specific  mention of ITS, however, the  development of interoperability across  national rail networks provides a  convenient common platform for  developers of ITS to utilise and link into.  FUTURE EU LEGISLATION  Title General Description Impact on IPT  Proposed NIS Directive109  concerning measures to ensure a  high common level of network  and information security across  the Union  The aim of the proposed Directive is to  ensure a high common level of network  and information security (NIS). This means  improving the security of the Internet and  the private networks and information  systems underpinning the functioning of  EU societies and economies.  Operators of critical infrastructures,  including transport, will be required to  manage cyber security risks and report  serious incidents to their national  competent authorities.  PRINCIPLE EU POLICY & STRATEGY DOCUMENTS  Title General Description Impact on IPT  Action Plan for the Deployment  of Intelligent Transport Systems  in Europe - COM(2008) 886  final/2 – CORRIGENDUM  This Action Plan aims to accelerate and  coordinate the deployment of Intelligent  Transport Systems (ITS) in road transport,  including interfaces with other transport  modes.  While the overall focus of this Action Plan  is wider than just security and resilience  of ITS, specific actions identified within  this plan are applicable. These include: the  optimal use of traffic/travel data; road  safety and security; integration of the  vehicle into the transport infrastructure;  data security and protection and liability  issues; and European ITS cooperation and  coordination.  Internet of Things - An action  plan for Europe - COM(2009) 278  final  This action plan sets out 14 “Lines of  Action” regarding the future design of  objects/systems falling under the Internet  of Things (IoT) umbrella. Specifically this  introduces questions of privacy, the  monitoring of individuals, and the storage  of personal data. Also issues of design  standardisation are raised.  The IoT will become integrated into the  ICT networks of Smart Cities and IPT  systems. This action plan is useful in that  it raises a number of issues yet to be  addressed. As the IoT develops and  becomes integrated elements of this  action plan will take on increased  significance.  109 EC, “EU Cybersecurity plan to protect open internet and online freedom and opportunity - Cyber Security strategy  and Proposal for a Directive”. http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open- internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  50  Title General Description Impact on IPT  A Digital Single Market Strategy  for Europe - COM(2015) 192 final  The overall aim is to develop a Digital  Single Market across EU cyber space  whereby the principle of free movement  of people, goods, services and capital is  translated and applied online.

European Innovation Partnership  on Smart Cities and  Communities: Strategic  Implementation Plan  Presents the Strategic Implementation  Plan for creating Smart Cities produced by  the High Level Group of the European  Innovation Partnership for Smart Cities  and Communities.  This plan places strong emphasis on urban  mobility (i.e. map public transport) and  the integration of infrastructure assets  and processes across energy, ICT and  transport to improve the efficiency and  sustainability of cities (i.e. creating IPT).  Roadmap to a Single European  Transport Area – Towards a  competitive and resource  efficient transport system -  COM(2011) 144 final  Focus is on how to remove barriers and  bottlenecks so as to complete the internal  market for transport by creating a  competitive and sustainable transport  market within the EU.  While the focus is limited the Roadmap  does specifically mention the  development of smart mobility systems  such as intelligent transport systems, and  the need for regulatory frameworks to  protect privacy and personal data in  parallel with the wider use of information  technology tools. Highlights  standardisation and interoperability as  keys to avoiding the technological  fragmentation of the European transport  market.  Rolling plan for ICT  Standardisation  This Rolling Plan provides a multi-annual  overview of the needs for preliminary or  complementary ICT standardisation  activities to undertake in support of EU  policy activities.  Within Intelligent Transport Systems, this  document sets out the standards  developments that have occurred and the  legislation and policy documents at the  European and (to a lesser extent) at the  MS level.  Smart Cities and Communities –  European Innovation Partnership  - COM(2012) 4701 final  Covering Smart Cities and Communities  European Innovation Partnerships; these  are partnerships across the areas of  energy, transport and information and  communication with the objective to  catalyse progress in areas where energy  use, mobility and transport, and ICT are  intimately linked.  Strong focus on energy efficiency and  environmental concerns, this  communication does emphasise the need  for interoperability of smart technologies.  Highlights the lack of standards and the  immaturity of the market in truly  integrated energy, transport and ICT  solutions as market impediments.

Table 3 provides a reference guide of the current good practices identified for IPT whereby the practices are described according to both the  business/societal functions identified in Section 2.3, and the different threat groups identified in Section 3.1.1. In addition these good  practices are assessed according to when they should be applied using the following three categories: 110   Pre-attack good practices: Focus is on identifying threats to, and weaknesses within, an IPT network and increasing the preparedness  and resilience of that network prior to attacks such that threats can be reduced or even negated.   During attack good practices: Focuses on both measures that will enable the operator to identify that an attack is occurring, as well  as measures to be implemented once an ongoing attack is detected so as to halt and/or mitigate the consequences of that attack.   Post-attack good practices: Focuses on system monitoring practices that will enable the operator to identify that an attack has  occurred, returning the network to its pre-attack state, gathering evidence on the nature and perpetrators of the attacks, and  identifying lessons-learnt for improving the security of the network to resist future similar attacks.

In this context, public transport operators have an important role to enable this smartness. They contribute to the  life of the city, to the economy and ensure the resilience of the Smart City. The integration of several ICT systems  enables “Intelligent Public Transport” (IPT), where cyber-physical devices, communication networks and central  servers optimise the transport service up to a certain degree of automation.  While this fusion of cyber technology, physical infrastructures and mass transport vehicles creates new  opportunities for improving services and functionality, it also has the effect of introducing cyber security risks into  transport networks that have not historically been susceptible to such risks. Moreover, IPT becomes a natural  target for emerging cyber threats that will have an impact not only on the operations of the transport service but  also on the whole economy and potentially on the health and safety of citizens.  For that reason, it is important to consider security  for Intelligent Public Transport to protect the  operators, the economy and the life and safety of  citizens. However, IPT faces several challenges in  this direction: there is currently no EU policy on  cyber security for transport, the awareness level is  low and it is difficult for operators to dedicate  budget to this specific objective of cyber security  (see picture on the right).  This study proposes a pragmatic approach that will highlight the critical assets of Intelligent Public Transport  systems. It gives an overview of the existing security measures (good practices) that could be deployed to protect  these critical assets and ensure security of the IPT system, based on a survey and interviews of experts from the  sector, municipalities, operators, manufacturers and policy makers.  The good practices propose a first step toward actionable security and a better protection of the transport  ecosystem. Good practices go beyond technical security measures; they also integrate policies, standards,  operational and organisational measures. For example, transport operators can use this study in support of their  risk assessment in order to understand which critical assets to protect, and how.  In spite of the fact that security becomes a concern for all actors of Intelligent Public Transport, additional efforts  are still needed to improve the current situation. Following that direction, the study proposes recommendations to  three stakeholders groups that need to enhance the status of cyber security for IPT. For that purpose:  Decision makers in the European Commission and in Member States should:   Promote public/private collaboration on IPT cyber security at national level and EU-wide   Promote and facilitate the development of a common EU approach to IPT security   Develop a comprehensive EU strategy and framework for cyber security in IPT   Integrate and converge security efforts made in other sectors of activity   Foster the development of harmonised cyber security standards for IPT  No 40%  Don’t know 40%  Less than 2% 10%  Don't know 10%Yes  20%  Cyber security spending  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  08  Intelligent Public Transport operators should:   Integrate cyber security in their corporate governance   Develop and implement an integrated corporate strategy addressing holistically cyber security and safety  risks   Implement risk management for cyber security in multi-stakeholder environments including external  contractors and dependencies   Clearly and routinely specify their cyber security requirements   Annually review organisational cyber security processes, practices and infrastructures  Manufacturers of IPT systems and solutions should:   Create products/solutions that match the cyber security requirements of IPT end-users   Collaborate in the development of IPT-specific standards and apply them to IPT solutions   Develop a trusted information sharing platforms on risks and vulnerabilities   Provide security guidance for your systems, products and solutions  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  09  1. Introduction  Transport networks are designated as critical infrastructure within the European Union (EU) and are  essential for maintaining the health, safety, security, and social and economic well-being of citizens within  EU Member States (MS).1 Yet the effective operation of these transport networks is vulnerable to the  increasing levels of traffic, which also contribute to rising energy consumption and environmental and  social problems.2 These negative symptoms are strongly felt in European cities which draw together large  concentrations of citizens within relatively small geographic areas.  To help manage and mitigate increases in traffic congestion, cities rely upon effective public transport  networks as efficient mobility solutions. However, when seeking to expand and improve these public  transport networks it is not enough to count solely upon the traditional measure of simply increasing the  physical road and rail infrastructure. Rather technological innovation has a major role to play here in the  creation of appropriate solutions, and the realisation of this fact is directly connected with the rise of  Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) integrated into Smart Cities.3  ITS integrates information and communication technology (ICT) with transport engineering so as to plan,  design, operate, maintain and manage transport systems, which in turn significantly contribute to  improving the efficiency and operation of such networks.2 The application of these technologies to public  transport systems produces Intelligent Public Transport (IPT).  However, this process of increasing the incorporation of ICT into public transport through both the  introduction of networked devices and the expansion of remote access and control capabilities, coupled  with the linking together of different operators within a single Smart City network (creating a system-of- systems), all acts to increase the cyber threat exposure of traditional transport networks. While current  transport operators and engineers possess a wealth of knowledge and experience in ensuring their  networks and products are designed with safety in mind, they have less experience in ensuring the cyber  security of their networks and products.  This increase in the cyber security risks for IPT produces new objectives that need to be met. These include  the identification of critical IPT assets and the associated threats that target them, as well as the  identification of good practices in cyber security that can address these threats and increase the cyber  resilience of IPT operators. Such outcomes need to be coupled with a coherent strategic and policy  approach that encompasses all of the stakeholders linked to IPT within the Smart City environment.  1 See Council Directive 2008/11/EC on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the  assessment of the need to improve their protection, specifically Art.2 and Annex I  2 See Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the framework for the deployment of  Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport.  3 Smart Cities are cities that integrate ICT to meet public needs and foster development in a multi-stakeholder  environment. It is anticipated this integration of cyber-physical technologies and infrastructures creates  environmental and economic efficiencies while improving resident’s quality of life (see US Dept. of Homeland  Security, “The Future of Smart Cities: Cyber-Physical Infrastructure Risk”, August 2015).  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  10  1.1 Scope of the study  This study focuses on the protection of the assets critical to Intelligent Public Transports in the context of  Smart Cities. These assets are considered critical as they contribute to the normal operation of local public  transport networks, including metro, buses, light rail and other modes of mass public transport found in  Smart Cities.  For that purpose, this study identifies these critical assets from a business and societal point of view. It  highlights good security practices against cyber threats. The objective is to enhance the resilience of IPT.  From the point of view of Smart Cities, these assets can be considered “internal” to IPT operators.  Figure 1 defines the scope of the study by focusing on the critical assets of local public transport operators  (displayed in the green box). The scope does not consider a specific architecture but rather a  comprehensive list of assets owned by an IPT operator.  The protection of critical assets for other transport operators (private and non-local), operators from other  sectors and non-operators fall out of the scope of this study. The protection of data exchange between IPT  operators and other stakeholders is also out of scope of this study. ENISA study “Cyber Security for Smart  Cities - an architecture model for public transport”4 focuses on the protection of this data exchange and its  associated assets.

Hence, the task of developing secure and resilient IPT systems falls on multiple actors, requiring the  cooperation of both public and private stakeholders working together to enhance cyber security. Given  this fact, the target audiences of this study are drawn from a number of sectors (see Figure 2):  Figure 2: Target audience groups   Operators: they cover a wide range of actors; both those directly  involved in operating different public transport modes (metro,  bus, tram/trolley-bus, light rail, ferry) and an interconnected  network of operators within the Smart City (energy,  infrastructure, public & private clouds, communications, banks  and payment systems, etc.).   Manufacturers: Covering the full spectrum of manufacturers  including physical transport infrastructure, providers, vehicle  manufacturers, developers of ICT networks, hardware and  software engineers, etc.   Service Providers: Including risk managers, cloud providers, ICT  network providers, security providers, etc.   Policy Makers: Different levels of government (local, national,  EU), regulators and law enforcement agencies involved in IPT.  1.3 Methodology  This study is based on a combination of desktop research as well as empirical research (i.e. survey and  interviews) with the results validated through a stakeholder workshop. Initial data gathering scoped the  development of the study, including the current key policies and legislation. Critical societal and business  assets for IPT were identified by integrating the desktop and empirical findings, and a comparative  approach was employed (i.e. between threats, risks, vulnerabilities, good practices, and challenges and  gaps) focussing on enhancing cyber security within IPT.  Results of the desktop research were further developed, and good practices identified, through an online  survey5 and series of interviews involving a total of 22 respondents drawn from different stakeholder  groups.6 While this is sample size is limited it nevertheless represents a good starting point for conducting  research into IPT. These respondents were based in the following EU MS:   Belgium   Denmark   Estonia   France   Germany   Latvia   Luxembourg   Netherlands   Republic of Ireland   Spain   Sweden   United Kingdom  5 See Annex 5 for the survey questions.  6 See Section 1.3 of ENISA, “Cyber Security for Smart Cities - an architecture model for public transport”, December  2015, for a distribution of respondents based on sector.

It defines terms commonly used within this  sector, outlines the current legal and policy environment within which IPT operates, places IPT within the  wider smart environment, sets out the critical functions and assets for IPT operators, and finally it explains  why cyber security is so fundamentally critical in the physical-digital fusion that is IPT.  2.1 Definitions  Many of the common concepts within intelligent transport are the subject of multiple definitions provided  by different stakeholders, each with differing perspectives and agendas. These have been distilled here to  produce a single set of definitions describing how these concepts are approached within this study. Table 1  defines the terms employed throughout this study.  Table 1: Key definitions employed within this study  TERM DEFINITION  Intelligent Transport  The application of information and communication technologies to transport so as to  improve levels of service and efficiency.  Intelligent Public Transport7 (IPT)  The application of information and communication technologies to public transport  networks so as to improve levels of service and efficiency.  Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)  The application of information and communication technologies to the real-time  management of vehicles and networks involving the movement of people and  goods.8 9 10  Smart City  A city that uses ICT to meet public needs and foster development in a multi-stakeholder  environment.  Business critical  (as applied to IPT)  Any elements which can directly impact the execution and sustainability of a business  in the long-term, including business revenue, service provision, business operations,  and/or the brand and image of an organisation.  Societal critical  (as applied to IPT)  Any elements affecting the quality of life of the citizens and their daily experience of  transport, which includes the environment, their safety and security and their privacy.  Critical Infrastructure  (as applied to the EU)  An asset, system or part thereof located in MS which is essential for the maintenance of  vital societal functions, health, safety, security, economic or social well-being of people,  and the disruption or destruction of which would have a significant impact in a MS as a  result of the failure to maintain those functions.11  7 Intelligent Public Transport is not a term widely used or adopted, rather it is a term coined for this study.  8 EC,16.12.2008 COM(2008) 886 final, “Action Plan for the Deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in Europe”.  9EC, 20.3.2009 COM(2008) 886 final/2, “Corrigendum to Action Plan for the Deployment of Intelligent Transport  Systems in Europe”.  10 Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (Germany), “Intelligent Transport Systems”, p.2.  11 As defined within Article 2a of Directive 2008/114/EC.

Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  14  TERM DEFINITION  Cyber security  Cyber security is the collection of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards,  guidelines, risk management approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance  and technologies that can be used to protect the cyber environment and organization  and user’s assets.  IPT Cyber security  For IPT, cyber security is the protection of data, systems, infrastructure and end-users  vital to the transport network, its operation and stability.  2.2 EU policy context  At the EU regulatory level, Regulations and Directives have yet to be specifically drafted to govern the form  and operation of IPT. Instead, what currently exists are a number of Directives whose broader remits are,  to differing degrees, applicable to IPT. These existing Directives cover the protection of personal data,12 the  processing of personal data in the electronic communications sector,13 the promotion of clean and energy- efficient road transport vehicles,14 creating interoperability of national rail systems across the European  Community,15 and the deployment of intelligent transport systems in the field of road transport.16  Individual analyses of these Directives is provided in Annex 1.  Collectively these Directives demonstrate that while there is currently no piece of EU legislation focussing  specifically on the operation of IPT at the EU level, there are elements of IPT operations that are still  subject to a level of regulation. Despite this fact, when it comes to either cyber security protections,  requirements and/or guidance specific to IPT, these Directives have very little to say beyond a cursory  mention of general security and the need to protect in-vehicle communications in Directive 2010/40/EU,17  and the need to protect the data privacy rights of citizens in Directives 1995/46/EC and 2002/58/EC.18  There is the proposed Network Information Security (NIS) Directive19 which, if enacted, will place a duty on  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/Methodologies-for- identification-of-ciis  12 Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of  individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. http://eur- lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:l14012  13 Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of  personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and  electronic communications). http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?qid=1440673681836&uri=CELEX:32002L0058  14 Directive 2009/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of clean  and energy-efficient road transport vehicles. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?qid=1440673932348&uri=CELEX:32009L0033  15 Directive 2008/57/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the interoperability of the  rail system within the Community. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32008L0057  16 Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2010 on the framework for the  deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of  transport. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1440674103143&uri=CELEX:32010L0040  17 Art.2(1), Directive 2010/40/EU  18 Art.10, Directive 2010/40/EU  19 Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL concerning measures to ensure a  high common level of network and information security across the Union (COM/2013/048 final - 2013/0027 (COD)).  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52013PC0048  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/Methodologies-for-identification-of-ciis https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/Methodologies-for-identification-of-ciis http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:l14012 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:l14012 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1440673681836&uri=CELEX:32002L0058 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1440673681836&uri=CELEX:32002L0058 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1440673932348&uri=CELEX:32009L0033 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1440673932348&uri=CELEX:32009L0033 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32008L0057 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1440674103143&uri=CELEX:32010L0040 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52013PC0048  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  15  operators of critical infrastructures (including transport) to manage the risks posed to the security of the  networks and information systems which they control and use in their operations.20 While this Directive will  apply to IPT operators, the level of impact is uncertain as again it is not primarily focussed on the operation  of IPT.21  At the national level, while Member States need to ensure these Directives are incorporated into their  respective legal systems, they are free to go beyond existing EU legislation by establishing additional  national measures to promote IPT and cyber security.22  Running parallel with these Directives are a number of important EU policy documents acting to drive the  future development of IPT. These have appeared with regularity since the late 2000’s focussing on  Intelligent Transport and its integration within Smart Cities, and they indicate the importance being  assigned to these topics at the EU level. These policy documents include the following:23   Action Plan for the Deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in Europe: This Action Plan aims  to accelerate and coordinate the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) in road  transport, including interfaces with other transport modes.16   Internet of Things - An action plan for Europe: Sets out 14 “Lines of Action” regarding the future  design of objects/systems falling under the Internet of Things (IoT).24   A Digital Single Market Strategy Europe: Sets out the Commission’s strategy for creating a Digital  Single Market whereby the free movement principles of goods, services, people and capital are  translated and implemented into EU cyber space.25   European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities: Strategic Implementation  Plan: Presents the Strategic Implementation Plan for creating Smart Cities produced by the High  Level Group of the European Innovation Partnership for Smart Cities and Communities.26   Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area – Towards a competitive and resource efficient  transport system: Focus is on how to remove barriers and bottlenecks so as to complete the  internal market for transport by creating a competitive and sustainable transport market within  the EU.27  20 Art.14(1), Proposed NIS Directive  21 When multiple operators (including IPT operators) are integrated into the architecture of a Smart City it is  uncertain to what extent they control any shared network and information systems. Additionally the scope assigned  to transport as critical infrastructure within the proposed Directive as currently drafted in Annex II of the draft NIS  Directive does not clearly apply to road-based IPT operators (i.e. busses).  22 For example, it was noted during the final validation workshop that the French Agence nationale de la sécurité des  systèmes d’information (ANSSI) is working with Vital Importance Operators such as public transport and railways to  establish laws related to cyber security.  23 See Annex 1: Key EU legislation and policy/strategy documents affecting IPT, for more details on these documents.  24 Internet of Things - An action plan for Europe - COM(2009) 278 final. http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0278:FIN:EN:PDF  25 A Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe - COM(2015)192 final. http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single- market/docs/dsm-communication_en.pdf  26 European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities: Strategic Implementation Plan.  http://ec.europa.eu/eip/smartcities/files/sip_final_en.pdf  27 Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area – Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system -  COM(2011) 144 final. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:tr0054  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0278:FIN:EN:PDF http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0278:FIN:EN:PDF http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/docs/dsm-communication_en.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/docs/dsm-communication_en.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/eip/smartcities/files/sip_final_en.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:tr0054  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  16   Rolling plan for ICT Standardisation: This Rolling Plan provides a multi-annual overview of the  needs for preliminary or complementary ICT standardisation activities to undertake in support of  EU policy activities.28   Smart Cities and Communities – European Innovation Partnership: These are partnerships across  the areas of energy, transport and information and communication with the objective to catalyse  progress in areas where energy use, mobility and transport, and ICT are intimately linked.29  What is most telling is that many of the EU policy and strategy documents within IPT have moved beyond  simply seeking to educate the reader about IPT and/or justifying the development of this capability, and on  to promoting concrete actions and outcomes through the use of action plans and/or the setting of specific  objectives. This represents the level of acceptance IPT has achieved within the EU.  However, an EU policy specific to the development and security of IPT as a whole is still lacking. Instead the  focus of these documents is primarily to promote the uptake and development of ITS, IoT, ICT, Smart  Cities. Yet, there is no related policy on the cyber security requirements for the operators of such systems.  2.3 Critical business and societal functions and assets for intelligent public transport  2.3.1 Asset groups  In order to identify the key IPT assets, based on the field work we have extrapolated key functions and  their relevant specific assets from a business and societal prospective. Successfully managing an IPT  business requires identifying and protecting those functions that are critical to the effective, continued  operation of that business: i.e. business critical functions. Given the role and importance of IPT networks to  citizens and societies, there are also functions that are critical from a societal perspective; i.e. societal  critical functions. Within each of these business and societal functions are individual assets related to the  provision of that function. Through the survey, interviews as well as desktop research covering key  documents, the following five business and five societal functions were identified.  Business functions:   Traffic and vehicle management defines IPT through the use of ICT, and underlies its goals of  increasing efficiencies and productivity through the linking of systems and employing data. As a  result this function contains a long list of related assets covering the full digital-physical spectrum.  This mirrors the societal function “sustainable urban mobility”.   Transportation safety and security focuses on ensuring the effective cyber/physical security and  safety of IPT infrastructures (including both physical and digital entities) attached to the business  operations of the IPT operator. As such the assets range from cyber protection measures (i.e.  ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and communications) to access  controls to both physical and digital assets.   Sales, fees and charges are essential to the continuing financial viability of an IPT operator,  whether privately or publically owned. Protecting the payment system assets is therefore of  fundamental importance.  28 Rolling plan for ICT Standardisation. https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/rolling-plan-ict-standardisation- 0  29 Smart Cities and Communities – European Innovation Partnership - COM(2012) 4701 final.  http://ec.europa.eu/eip/smartcities/files/ec_communication_scc.pdf  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/rolling-plan-ict-standardisation-0 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/rolling-plan-ict-standardisation-0 http://ec.europa.eu/eip/smartcities/files/ec_communication_scc.pdf  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  17   Resilient management structure allows an IPT operator to respond effectively to, and overcome,  the range of threats IPT networks are subject to, including: acts of nature, cyber attacks, physical  attacks, energy supply problems, etc. Staff and business reputation are important assets here.   Energy and environment concerns have a direct impact on the operation of IPT networks.  Operators need to ensure the sufficient and continuous supply of energy to meet their network’s  needs. While at the same time they must manage energy usage to control costs and mitigate any  negative environmental impacts arising from their transport network. This function also mirrors the  societal function “sustainable environment”.  Societal functions:   Sustainable urban mobility networks are fundamental to the efficient operation of a city, providing  a wealth of social and economic benefits. Incorporating ICT into the operation of traditional  mobility networks to create IPT acts to maximise the efficiency, operation and sustainability of  these mobility networks. This is fundamental in differentiating IPT from the traditional silo-based  model of an urban public transport system. This infusion of ICT into the physical infrastructure and  assets of different operators enables the integration of wider systems and processes. The critical  assets to this function now include the digital infrastructure and integrated systems as well as  physical infrastructures.   Passenger safety and security focuses on ensuring the effective cyber/physical security and safety  of passengers using urban public transport networks. Achieving acceptable levels of safety and  security are fundamental prerequisites for passengers to trust and willingly choose to use such  networks. Providing the safety and (cyber) security of passengers on IPT networks requires a range  of assets, from technological safety systems and surveillance (CCTV) capabilities, through to trained  staff and the real-time ability to communicate with passengers.   Data protection and privacy are digital rights valued by societies, as well as representing EU legal  requirements which apply to the operation of IPT networks (see Section 2.2). Mature IPT operators  recognise that the data/information they hold constitutes one of their most valuable assets.   Sustainable environment recognises the impact of traffic networks on the wider city environment  through vectors including; air quality, noise pollutions, traffic flow, user safety, sustainable energy  grids, and the economic impact for both end-users and local businesses.30  Because of the different nature and focus of these two viewpoints (i.e. business and societal), business  assets tend to focus more on individual components of IPT, while societal assets tend to be concerned  more with integrated and broader elements of IPT systems cutting across several operators.  2.3.2 Main critical assets for intelligent public transport  Figure 3 below set out the business and societal functions grouped together with associated assets as  identified through the survey, interviews and desktop research of related documents.31 These were also  evaluated to identify those that are critical. The resulting five critical functions and 21 critical assets are  30 Scottish Government, “Smart Cities Maturity Model and Self-Assessment Tool”, January 2015  31 Key documents here included: EC, COM(2011)144 final, “Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area”, March  2011.

In addition, Annex 2 provides an easily referable table  listing those functions, assets and threats identified as critical.  Figure 3: Critical functions and assets for IPT  Assessing the nature and distribution of those assets prioritised within IPT, which act to connect IPT to the  wider Smart City networks, produces key insights into both the “physical-digital” nature of those assets  distributed throughout an IPT network, as well as their security requirements. Three key insights on the  nature of IPT assets and security requirements are set out below.  Transportation safety  and security  Identity management systems  Integrity and availability of data  and communication  Access control mechanisms  Data storage systems/facilities  Sensors, signals and detectors  Hardware  Human-machine interface devices  Trackside equipment  On-board equipment  Physical infrastructure  Networking/communication components  Cloud based services/platforms  Physical  Networking  Digital  Passenger safety systems  Traffic and vehicle  management  Sustainable urban  mobility  SCADA  Traffic management systems  Digital infrastructure  Signalling systems  Vehicles and physical infrastructure  Operational Control Centres  Physical  Networking  Communication systems  Radio telecommunication  Internet/networking  Digital  Video surveillance  Information distribution systems  Public communication and social media  Safety systems  Availability of law enforcement  Trained staff  Passenger safety and security  IPT: Functions and Assets  Societal functions and associated assets Business functions and associated assets  Data  Traffic fluidity capabilities  Software/applications  Operating systems  Power distribution systemEnergy and  environment  Power distribution grid  Payment systemsSales, fees and  charges  Staff  Reputation  Financial viability  Resilience management  structure  Data protection and  privacy  Data/information  Confidentiality  Sustainable  environment  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  19  2.3.3 Three key insights on the nature of intelligent public transport assets   Individual IPT assets combine multiple components: IPT assets are more complex than similar  assets in traditional silo-based transport systems, as they combine multiple assets into one. For  example, a bus is no longer just a public transport vehicle – it is also a data collection and recording  system, an information dissemination asset, mobile Wi-Fi hub, and a source of real-time intelligence  for optimising the transport network. This is especially true for those assets linked to societal  functions.   The cyber/physical divide disappears within IPT assets: IPT assets fuse together both physical and  digital components. The resulting assets are now cyber-physical hybrids.   IPT assets are linked together to form individual systems and systems-of-systems shared amongst  multiple stakeholders: Through the use of ICT, the individual assets of a traditional silo-based  transport network are linked together to form a transport operators IPT system. A Smart City links  these assets further by integrating the systems of multiple operators and/or other stakeholders and  providers, forming a system-of-systems.  2.3.4 Three key insights on security for intelligent public transport assets   IPT assets are subject to a greater range of security threats: When assets become cyber-physical  hybrids, they become susceptible to both physical attacks and cyberattacks.   Cyber security and physical safety can no longer be treated as separate concerns: When attackers  can affect the physical operation of ICT-enabled vehicles or other physical assets,32 network cyber  security and physical safety become interdependent.   Determining where an IPT operator’s (security) responsibilities end is no longer clear: By  integrating IPT into the wider Smart City through the sharing of assets, data and ICT networks with  3rd parties, the boundary of the transport operator’s network is no longer clear. If an organisation  cannot accurately map the network they control, this has important implications for how they  conduct their network risk assessments.  32 Chris Valasek and Charle Miller, Adventures in Automotive Networks and Control Units, 2014.  http://www.ioactive.com/pdfs/IOActive_Adventures_in_Automotive_Networks_and_Control_Units.pdf  http://www.ioactive.com/pdfs/IOActive_Adventures_in_Automotive_Networks_and_Control_Units.pdf  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  20  2.4 Intelligent public transport environment and elements  In order to discuss IPT it makes sense to place it in the urban context that both justifies the need for  developing IPT systems, as well as provides the necessary cyber-physical infrastructure that enables public  transport to become intelligent. This environment is the Smart City. Producing IPT systems (as opposed to  traditional public transport systems) within this Smart City environment requires the successful integration  of cyber-physical technologies and urban infrastructure. This entails the linking and integration of  (physical) infrastructures and (digital) processes which are not always well connected.27, 33 Figure 4 depicts  the different stakeholders operating within Smart Cities34 that can be integrated into the networks and  cyber-physical architecture of IPT operators.

A need to secure intelligent public transport  This section focuses on the threats, vulnerabilities and risks that are faced by IPT networks and operators  and their impact on both businesses and society. To this end we employ the following definitions35 when  discussing these terms.   Threat: is the potential cause of an incident that may result in harm to an IPT system or IPT  organisation.   Vulnerability: is a weakness within an IPT asset that can be exploited by the threats.   Risk: is the potential that a given threat will successfully exploit vulnerabilities within an IPT asset  and thereby result in harm to the businesses and/or society as a whole.   Challenges: are current limitations faced by stakeholders on the security status of IPT (as  expressed during the survey and the interviews).  3.1 Threats  3.1.1 Threat model  For the purpose of this study, a practical IPT based threat-taxonomy has been developed. The threats  included in the suggested threat model are all applicable to the IPT assets presented in the previous  section. The presented threat taxonomy covers mainly cyber-security threats; that is, threats applying to  information and communication technology assets. Additional non-IT threats have also been included in  order to cover threats to physical assets that are necessary for the operation of the considered ICT-assets.  Threats appear to be multifaceted and can be directed against specific assets, ranging from IPT systems to  data, through to broad organisational structures and entire IPT infrastructures. Furthermore, due to IPT  assets blurring the lines between digital and physical layers (see Section 3.2), IPT operators lean more  towards multifaceted threats affecting complex assets having both physical and digital characteristics.  This threat taxonomy draws upon the key findings from the survey, interviews and desktop research.  Previous ENISA studies have also been employed as a basis for the taxonomy (e.g. ENISA Threat Landscape  and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure 2015,36 ENISA Threat Landscape 201337 and the Smart  Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide).38 In order to keep a practical focus we propose a threat  model that regroups threats into seven threat categories. These groups define the origin of the threat with  each category having its own implications over the security of IPT. However, it must be noted that these  seven threat categories represent a generalised model. The threats each IPT operator must address will  vary depending on multiple factors, including the size of the operator and the contextual nature of their  35 These are contextually modified definitions of those from ETSI TS 102 165-1 V4.2.3 “Telecommunications and  Internet converged Services and Protocols for Advanced Networking (TISPAN); Methods and protocols; Part 1:  Method and preforms for Threat, Risk, Vulnerability Analysis”, March 2011.  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102100_102199/10216501/04.02.03_60/ts_10216501v040203p.pdf  36 ENISA, “Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure”.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic- landscapes/threat-landscape-of-the-internet-infrastructure  37 ENISA, “ENISA Threat Landscape 2013: Overview of current and emerging cyber threats”.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013- overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats  38 ENISA, “Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide”. http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk- management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102100_102199/10216501/04.02.03_60/ts_10216501v040203p.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic-landscapes/threat-landscape-of-the-internet-infrastructure https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic-landscapes/threat-landscape-of-the-internet-infrastructure http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  22  operating environment. As such it is essential IPT operators conduct individualised risk assessments to  identify the specific threats that they need to address.  The identified seven threat categories are as follows:   Physical and large scale attacks are intentional offensive actions, which aim to achieve maximum  distraction, disruption, destruction, exposure, alteration, theft or unauthorised accessing of assets  such as infrastructure, hardware, or ICT connections. This threat group has general application,  thus covers the entire spectrum of cyber-physical infrastructure.   Acts of nature and/or environmental incidents are serious disruptions of the functioning of a  society and can be divided into those natural disasters not directly triggered by humans, and  environmental disasters caused by humans. These threats apply to assets in general, hence also to  IPT infrastructures. Typical threats include: earthquakes, floods, wildfires, pollution, dust and  corrosion.   Accidental errors/malfunctions/failures are related to the condition of not functioning and/or  insufficient functioning of any IT infrastructure assets. Examples include; failures or disruptions of  network devices or systems, software bugs, and configuration errors.   Disruption and/or outages are unexpected disruptions of services or significant decreases in  expected quality, and can affect all kind of IPT assets. Disruption and outages may be triggered by  a range of different reasons.   Nefarious activities and/or abuse are intentional actions that target IPT assets, ranging from  systems and infrastructure to networks, by means of malicious acts with the aim to steal, alter, or  destroy a specified target. This group contains those common threats generally referred to as  cyber attacks, but also related actions that do not have a digital asset as a direct target.   Unintentional damage refers to the destruction, harm, or injury of property or people by accident.  Damage includes both physical and non-physical damage.   Insider threats are similar to nefarious activities, but originate from within the organisation being  attacked or targeted. The perpetrator is often an employee or officer of an organisation or  enterprise. An insider threat does not have to be a present employee or stakeholder, but can also  be a former employee, board member, or anyone who at one time had access to proprietary or  confidential information from within the organisation.  3.1.2 List of threats to public transport  This section presents the most relevant threats to IPT structures based on the desktop research, survey  and interviews, and arranges them according to the categories described in Section 3.1.1. Respondents to  the survey and interviews further evaluated these threats to identify those they consider to be critical. The  top 15 they identified are highlighted red and presented in bold in Figure 5.39  39 On the importance of operators and user errors see: Michael G.

The list of threats is non- exhaustive and could be complemented at a later date by a more in-depth study. The association between  the threats (both threat groups and individual threats) from Figure 5 and the top asset types from Figure 3  is established through Table 2 below (see Annex 3 for a more detailed table showing all the asset types). As  such, Table 2 shows the relationship between the identified critical threats and the asset types/functions  to which these threats apply.  This information is important for identifying countermeasures that will reduce the exposure surface of  assets. This threat-to-assets association is made on the basis of the field work and initial assessment done  within the project. Since IPT assets tend to blur the lines between digital and physical layers, the same  threat can affect multiple assets. The association performed in this study is non-exhaustive and subject to  refinements, according to particular transport and threat environments.  environmental disasters see: US Department of Transportation, “Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)”.

initial reflections are provided on IPT vulnerabilities. By implementing cyber-physical  systems into critical infrastructures, IPT brings benefits but also introduces a new set of vulnerabilities and  risks to operators and society as a whole.40 Historically, cyber and physical systems have operated fairly  independently of one another41, however, IPT is leading to an integration of both domains and therefore to  a situation where the exploitation of cyber vulnerabilities can result in physical consequences. This brings  both new vulnerabilities and risks. Since IPT is relatively new and on the making, information on IPT  vulnerabilities mainly originates from research, requirements and generic assumptions.42  3.2.1 General vulnerabilities   Common to other IT systems: This category relates to areas that communally affect other IT systems  (i.e. customer privacy and personal data, customer security and physical security and publicly  accessible devices).43 This also includes vulnerabilities in commercially available mainstream IT  products and systems.   Wireless and cellular communication: Wireless communication44 and cellular services introduce all the  typical vulnerabilities in the area of communication conducted between points not connected by an  40 US Department of Homeland Security, “The Future of Smart Cities: Cyber-Physical Infrastructure Risk”, August  2015.  41 This meant that the impact of a cyber-system disruption was contained within the cyber domain, while physical  disruption was contained in the physical domain.  42 This is mainly because there are not very many such infrastructures that have been operational for a sufficient  period such that experiences have been gained, analysed and shared  43 See: Gideon Mbiydzenyuy, Jan A Persson and Paul Davidsson, “Threat, Vulnerability, and Risk Analysis for Intelligent  Truck Parking, a Pre-study”, ETAP III Project Report,  https://www.bth.se/com/intelligent_truck_parking.nsf/attachments/Del_6_Security_pdf/$file/Del_6_Security.pdf  ETSI, “Intelligent Transport Systems”; and Edward Fox,” An Introduction to Cybersecurity Issues in Modern  Transportation Systems”, ITE Journal, July 2013.  http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.377.199&rep=rep1&type=pdf  44 It was noted by operators that the threat “Interruption and/or disruption of frequency” identified above is  considered as a major risk for transport operators as most of their moving assets are linked to their central  equipment via wireless connections. Such connections could be significantly disturbed with few resources (e.g. it is  quite simple to develop a frequency jammer that could block a major station).  https://www.bth.se/com/intelligent_truck_parking.nsf/attachments/Del_6_Security_pdf/$file/Del_6_Security.pdf http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.377.199&rep=rep1&type=pdf  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  27  electrical conductor. For example, inadequate security protocols, inadequate authentication  mechanisms, energy constrain, poor security and unreliable communication.45   Integration of physical and virtual layers: The physical and virtual layers are becoming increasingly  permeable as cyber and physical systems become networked and remotely accessible. “Increased  connectivity, faster speeds, and multi-directional data flows diversify access points into critical  infrastructure, changing and stretching the borders that must be secured.”46   Cohabitation between legacy and new systems: IPT evolves at different rates among operators  because of several factors including; resource availability, user preferences, and scale and  accessibility. Inconsistency of IPT technologies introduces new vulnerabilities. Blind-spots may emerge  in areas where legacy equipment and infrastructures are still used.46   Increased automation: While the process of removing or limiting human interaction for IPT systems  through increased automation improves safety by removing the possibility of human error, it also  introduces new potential vulnerabilities. These include, but are not limited to: an increased number of  system access points and, therefore, potential attack vectors; skill atrophy; cascading failures; and  changes in emergency response plans. 46  3.2.2 Specific vulnerabilities   Scale and complexity of transportation networks: This refers to the difficulty of mapping the entire  IPT system (i.e. due to the loss of visibility for all parts of a system) and the difficulty of securing the  connectivity of mobile devices within transportation networks. Other issues include; the need to trust  components and participants within the network, working with teams with different skills and  competences, and the effective involvement of multiple stakeholders.47   Applying networked technology across large transport systems: This leads to a large number of  system access points stemming from the presence of networked technology across these large  systems, which in turn increase both the difficulty and cost of properly securing each system device.48   Multiple interdependent systems: This refers to the burden of ensuring the smooth interfacing,  communication, and security among interdependent systems. These diverse systems include; sensors,  computers, payment systems, financial systems, emergency systems, ventilation systems, automated  devices, power relays, etc. 46   Access to real-time data: IPT requires nonstop access to real-time data which in turn leads to higher  costs associated with maintenance and service downtime and therefore increased vulnerability. 46   Higher volumes of passengers and freight: This refers to logistical and security hurdles of physically  accommodating enormous volumes of passengers and freight, along with the reality that security  breaches could result in public safety risks. 46  45 C.K.

The inferred vulnerabilities are listed below and presented in Figure 6, whereby these vulnerabilities are  mapped (based on the desktop analysis) on an axis system with axes general vulnerabilities (i.e. applicable  beyond IPT) and specific vulnerabilities (i.e. those specific to IPT); and internal vulnerabilities (i.e.  originating from and controlled by a few operators) versus external vulnerabilities (i.e. those originating  from operators’ interdependence and controlled by multiple operators).  This mapping allows for the identification of “quick wins”, defined as improvements that will impart  significant benefits to transport operators but are relatively easy and inexpensive to implement. These are  vulnerabilities that are internal and hence more likely to be under the direct control of the operator thus  allowing for more impactful interventions, and those that are general which imply more affordable  solutions (i.e. through off-the shelf products and/or greater competition between solution providers).

Specific actions are needed to recover operations, usually in a limited timeframe.   Loss of revenue: In the case of an incident, operations can become limited or suspended, which  leads to a loss revenues. Moreover, responsibilities in case of an incident can also lead to loss of  revenue (fines…).   Impact on reputation / loss of trust: In the case of major service disruptions, risks can also cover  reputational damage and the loss of revenue which can directly impact a company’s bottom line.51   Non-compliance with the regulation on data protection: The disclosure of personal data,  voluntarily or not, is covered by regulation. This risk is usually associated with loss of revenue (due  to fines and mitigation action) and loss of trust (from passengers, clients and municipalities).   Risks on hardware and software: Risks related to the manipulation or destruction of IPT  components, hardware and software (see Section 3.1 Threats) impact the stability and availability  of the IPT systems. This can lead to the disruption of services, inferior passenger and freight  experience, loss of sensitive data and fraud.52   Reliance on invalid information: The area of multiple interdependent systems is also becoming a  more relevant source of concern as traffic operators become more interconnected with each other  and with other smart operators. Using invalid information is a risk as it may limit the quality of the  service.  49 In risk management methodologies risk is interpreted as “the risk factor”, which is calculated based upon the  likelihood of a particular threat being successful and the impact that a successful threats would have on the system.  In this study we do not use risk as a risk factor but instead in more general term as the negative impact produced by a  successful threats.  50 Ahmed Abdel Rahim and Ybette Ochoa “A Framework to Analyze the Survivability and Vulnerability of Intelligent  Transportation System Networks”, Journal of Intelligent Transportation and Urban Planning, Jan 2014, Vol. 2 Issue 1,  pp. 22-29  51 Transport for London , “Strategic Risk Management and Assurance Annual Report 2013/14”, July 2013  52 US Department of Homeland Security , “The Future of Smart Cities”.  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  30   Lack of security of dependencies: The more IPT is moving towards “a system of systems”, the  more important is to understand the dependencies among involved components.53 Hence, the  output of individual vulnerability and risk assessments will depend on the particular mix of  components, processes and infrastructure involved in a particular scenario. For example, with the  increasing proliferation of mobile devices in traffic systems mobile security becomes another  important component of the complex traffic infrastructure.   Unavailability of a dependency: The IPT service depends on several internal and external  dependencies (e.g. power supply, mobile telecommunications…). Hence, the IPT service may suffer  from the unavailability of a dependency and become unavailable.  3.3.2 Societal risks  Similarly to business risk, societal risks are mainly triggered by the manipulation and destruction of IPT  components (see Section 3.1 Threats).54  Effective transportation systems are essential to European society: not only do they enable the mobility of  citizens and goods, they also have significant impacts on economic growth, social development and the  environment.55 Although the expectation is that IPT will cut costs, improve environmental quality and  enhance traditional safety (i.e. by reducing road accidents), it could also amplify old and open up new  societal risks.55   Unavailability of the IPT service: Given the nature of societal assets,56 these components tend to  be integrated systems which are shared among multiple stakeholders. This amplifies the  interdependency effect and consequently increases the risk that such events will lead not only to  interrupted and disrupted transport services for a single IPT operator but also to the unavailability  of transport systems (i.e. network gridlock) with consequent secondary effects for other sectors,  and increases in traffic accidents.57   Disruption to the society: The IPT service is used by citizens to carry out their daily lives. Incident  on the transport system will bring disruption to the society with several impacts on the economy  and the life of the citizens. In case of severe network gridlocks, societal financial losses and slower  economic growth could also occur.   Passengers’ health and safety: Passengers safety in IPT is the priority of all actors. Yet, specific  incidents may impact the transport system and bring a risk to health and safety (e.g. derailing  train…). Furthermore, the international context has changed in recent years: the sustained threat  from terrorism is real and needs to be accounted for when protecting IPT infrastructures.58  53 Steven H.

For example,  vehicles may emit higher pollutants than their expected levels. 59   Confidentiality and privacy: The increased use of sensing, tracking, real-time behavior evaluation  and automated decisions within IPT raises new risks against the confidentiality and privacy of  citizens. 60  3.4 Challenges  This section summarises eight identified key challenges facing cyber security within IPT. Challenges are  identified based on criticisms and/or shortcomings of the existing status quo that were collected during  the survey and the interviews with stakeholders.  While they are numbered 1 to 8 below, these challenges have not been ranked according to any measure  of importance.  3.4.1 Challenge 1: Difficulties to integrate security for safety  While there is a tendency in other contexts to combine safety and security into a single category, within  transport these two concepts are traditionally very separate. Manufacturers and IPT operators usually  prioritise the need for safety requirements, due to the fact that IPT operators experience difficulties in  understanding the concept of (cyber) security, acquiring the necessary skills and developing the necessary  measures to integrate security for safety in their systems.  3.4.2 Challenge 2: Inadequate importance and spending being afforded to cyber security  A key finding from the survey and interviews (see Figure 7) indicates that transport organisations still do  not grant the necessary importance to cyber security within their company. Spending on cyber security  also appears to be inadequate in response to the range of multifaceted cyber threats affecting IPT.  Figure 7: Cyber security spending  3.4.3 Challenge 3: Inadequate checking for countermeasures  The majority of transport organisations do not measure the effectiveness of their countermeasures (see  Figure 8 below presenting findings from the survey and interviews).61 This in turn produces a lack of  59 Even though not directly applied to IPT, the Volkswagen emission scandal shows that emission levels of vehicles can  be modified by software https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal  60 Steinfeld, Aaron, “Ethics and Policy Implications for Inclusive Intelligent Transportation Systems”, Second  International Symposium on Quality of Life Technology, 2010.  61 Please note that the respondents could select multiple relevant answers.

The question of measuring the value of security in a transport organisation is also important when security  teams ask the business to invest in security. The inability to answer this question can often explain why the  business is reluctant to invest.62  Figure 8: Measuring Effectiveness in Cyber security Measures  3.4.4 Challenge 4: Unwillingness to collaborate and exchange information on cyber security  Overall, transport organisations are less than willing to collaborate on and exchange information about  cyber security with other industry players, most likely because of the reputational costs, competitive  pressures and other indirect losses related to cyber crime. Additionally, they may not have implemented  the necessary systems/measures to collect the necessary information to be shared (see Figure 9 below  presenting finding from the survey and interviews). Furthermore, they also have low awareness of any  collaboration and information-sharing activities pertaining to cyber security being carried out within the  sector. However, operators are open to collaborate and exchange information with national Computer  Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA).  62 Ashford Warwick, “How can businesses measure the effectiveness of their IT security teams to ensure they are  getting value?”, http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Security-Think-Tank-How-can-businesses-measure-the- effectiveness-of-their-IT-security-teams  0%  5%  10%  15%  20%  25%  30%  35%  40%  45%  http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Security-Think-Tank-How-can-businesses-measure-the-effectiveness-of-their-IT-security-teams http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Security-Think-Tank-How-can-businesses-measure-the-effectiveness-of-their-IT-security-teams  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  33  Figure 9: Cyber security Information Exchange  3.4.5 Challenge 5: Slow phasing out of legacy systems  The existence and use of legacy systems can weaken cyber security. Legacy systems have security controls  typically focused on the simple necessity of reducing the risk of physical product tampering or theft.  However, the security and threat environment within IPT is beginning to shift towards connected  transportation systems as they become increasingly interconnected to the wider world.63  3.4.6 Challenge 6: Inadequate data exchange between IPT and Smart Cities operators  Data exchanges between IPT and different Smart Cities operators (i.e. railways, LEA, local government,  etc.) tend to be restricted, uncoordinated and ad-hoc. These interactions also vary depending on the  context and/or business model adopted by the operators.64 The potential implications of this uneven data  exchange include weaker security as threats are not being communicated and there is uncertainty over  who is responsible for the security of individual components within systems that integrate multiple  stakeholders.  3.4.7 Challenge 7: Weak situational awareness of cyber threats  Due to the fast moving and interconnect nature of IPT, transport organisations are struggling to achieve a  full awareness of the range of cyber threats and boundaries for securing the IPT landscape.65  3.4.8 Challenge 8: Resistance to security adoption  One finding from the field work indicates that some countermeasures are widely adopted even though  they are not considered effective (e.g. monitoring ICT systems for hardware and software faults), while  others that are considered effective are frequently not deployed (e.g. privacy-by-design, building-in  redundancy and shut down procedures). This underlines a resistance to adapt within the IPT sector and a  culture where things are done because operators are told to do them and/or have always done them  rather than because they work.  63 Steven H. Bayless, Sean Murphy and Anthony Shaw, “Connected Vehicle Assessment. Cybersecurity and  Dependable Transportation”, Connected Vehicle Technology Scan Series, 2012-2014.  64 For example electrified transport systems report good integration with energy suppliers. Some data exchanges are  happening between infrastructure providers, law enforcement and emergency services (and to a less extent with  local government, transport industry associations, e.g. UITP, and government/regulatory bodies) in relation to  criminal incidents and emergency events yet other stakeholders/elements such as banks and social media are often  not well integrated.  65 US Department of Homeland Security, “The Future of Smart Cities”.

Good practices for securing intelligent public transport  This section sets out existing good practices for securing IPT networks as identified through both an  analysis of existing good practice documentation complemented by interviews with a range of  stakeholders, including; transport operators, Smart City municipalities, risk managers and cyber security  experts. By good practices we are referring to effective security measures that should be implemented if  they address weaknesses identified during a risk assessment of your business operation. The inclusion of  these good practices reflects our intention that this study should operate as a practical guide for IPT  operators, one that will assist in supporting their internal processes.  One point that must be remembered when considering the good practices discussed here is that this  section only deals with existing good practices as identified during the desktop research and the survey  and interviews. Gaps in the current suite of existing good practices are not addressed here, but are  identified and discussed in Section 5.  This section provides a brief description of each individual good practice identified to secure IPT. They are  presented and arranged into three categories according to their inherent nature:   Technical good practices;   Policies and standards;   Organisational, people and processes.  These good practices are effective to counter threats before, during and/or after an attack. For more  information, Annex 4 details these good practices by presenting them as a checklist to assist stakeholders  in their assessment and implementation.  4.1 Technical good practices  Conduct security-focused risk assessments: Each operator should conduct regular risk assessments  covering physical, cyber and information security that entail mapping the scope of their business  operations, identifying the critical business functions, and then identifying the assets critical to these  functions. Regular risk assessments are required to identify changes in the threat landscape and thereby  ensure that the correct threats to the business are identified and efficiently addressed.66  Employ appropriate physical security, access controls and protection measures: Physical security is  required to protect both the physical and digital assets of an IPT network by preventing unauthorised  physical access to sensitive locations, whether deliberate and unintentional. The nature of the physical  security employed should be commensurate to the assets being protected67 (i.e. from simple locks for  areas designated low risk/value to layered security, such as multi-factor authentication systems potentially  combined with guards/CCTV, for high risk/value areas).68  66 See Cristin Goodwin and Paul Nicholas, “Developing a City Strategy for Cybersecurity: A seven-step guide for local  governments”, October 2014. http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/B/3/1B3C6BE3-8FA4-40BD-9BD6- 640FD2F1F648/City%20Strategy%20for%20Cybersecurity.pdf  67 A Risk Assessment will be required to differentiate between areas of high risk/value and low risk/value.  68 Ross Anderson, “Security Engineering (2nd Edition)”, 2008.  http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/B/3/1B3C6BE3-8FA4-40BD-9BD6-640FD2F1F648/City%20Strategy%20for%20Cybersecurity.pdf http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/B/3/1B3C6BE3-8FA4-40BD-9BD6-640FD2F1F648/City%20Strategy%20for%20Cybersecurity.pdf  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  35  Employ secure digital access controls to networks and data: To complement physical security measures,  IPT operators must ensure they employ robust digital access controls to their networks and stored data  (whether in local servers or cloud-based) so as to prevent attackers accessing these via ICT due to the  prevalent of these attacks on both large and small businesses.69 70 Common measures include: firewalls;  password controls; multi-factor authentication; use of firewall based VPNs.71 72  Employ alarms/surveillance for protecting physical and digital assets: Closely linked to the monitoring  and recording of activity is the need to install alarms and surveillance systems across the cyber/physical  network of an IPT operator to secure that network. Alarms and surveillance systems designed to focus the  attention of operators on specific locales or events are necessary requirements. This is because the size  and complexity of an IPT network distributed across a city demands the implementation of systems  enabling a limited security team to effectively monitor the entire network.  Encryption: Operators need to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive data (e.g. customer/employee  financial details, intellectual property, etc.) that they both hold (either internally or on external  servers/clouds) and communicate across networks, due to the prevalence of cyber attacks.68 In effect, IPT  operators should work on the assumption their digital systems will be successfully accessed by attackers.  To this end they should employ industry-recognised encryption standards,73 use VPNs,74 and if available  make use of national cyber security agencies to guide on encryption methods.  Develop secure and private communication networks: Operators need to ensure the security of their  communication networks and the privacy of the data traveling across these networks as they represent a  target for attacker. As IPT communication networks include both physical and digital elements, a  combination of protection methods are required, including; tamper-resistant devices, access controls,  firewalled VPNs, encryption, message integrity provisions, network intrusion detection systems, etc.75  Employ intrusion detection systems (IDSs): IDSs aid in monitoring a network to inform on internal and  external attacks, malicious network communications and usage of computer systems. Common methods  include anomaly detection and misuse (signature) detection.76 IDSs are needed to supplement firewalls  69 HM Government, “2015 Information Security Breaches Survey”, June 2015.  http://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs-technical-report-blue-03.pdf  70 Mariana Carroll and Paula Kotzé, “Secure Cloud Computing: Benefits, Risks and Controls”, Information Security  South Africa, 2011. http://researchspace.csir.co.za/dspace/bitstream/10204/5184/1/Kotze4_2011.pdf  71 HM Government, “Cyber Essentials Scheme: Requirements for basic technical protection from cyber attacks”, June  2014.  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/317481/Cyber_Essentials_Require ments.pdf  72 Government of the HKSAR, “VPN Security”, February 2008.  http://www.infosec.gov.hk/english/technical/files/vpn.pdf  73 See for example: ENISA, “Algorithms, key size and parameters report – 2014”, November 2014; ANSSI,  “Mécanismes cryptographiques, V2.03” 2014; BSI “Kryptographische Verfahren: Empfehlungen und Schlussellangen:  BSI TR-02102-1”, February 2015.  74 Ye Yan, Yi Qian, Hamid Sharif and David Tipper, “A survey on Cyber Security for Smart Grid Communications”,  Communication Surveys & Tutorials, IEEE, Vol.14(4), 2012, pp.998-1010.  75 Hung-Jen Liao, Chun-Hung Richard Lin, Ying-Chih Lin and Kuang-Yuan Tung, “Intrusion detection system: A  comprehensive review”, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, Vol.36, 2013, pp.16-24.  76 Chih-Fong Tsai, Yu-Feng Hsu, Chia-Ying Lin, and Wei-Yang Lin, “Intrusion detection by machine learning: A review”,  Expert Systems with Applications, Vol.36, 2009, pp.11994-12000.  http://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs-technical-report-blue-03.pdf http://researchspace.csir.co.za/dspace/bitstream/10204/5184/1/Kotze4_2011.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/317481/Cyber_Essentials_Requirements.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/317481/Cyber_Essentials_Requirements.pdf http://www.infosec.gov.hk/english/technical/files/vpn.pdf  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  36  and virus scanners as there is no network security measure that will ensure perfect cyber security. Hence  IPT operators should employ multiple protection measures through a defence-in-depth approach.  Employ identity management and authentication systems: To secure IPT requires restricting access to  both physical spaces and digital networks, such that only authorised individuals can access these spaces.  This requires the implementation of measures, such as multifactor (i.e. two and three-factor)  authentication systems, for confirming that the person seeking access is who they claim to be. Additionally  there is the need to link activity within a network to the identity of the actor to prevent repudiation:  measures such as digital signatures, access controls, and audit trails should be employed here.77  Integrate shut-down procedures/remote deactivation of capabilities, for assets: Malfunctioning,  compromised or stolen assets may be in geographically remote locales on a transport network. To enable  prompt reactions by IPT operators, the ability to either remotely shut-down or deactivate certain  capabilities/functionalities of these assets can minimise damage/loss. Operators can use SCADA systems to  issue such supervisory commands to field devices/assets.78  Operate in degraded mode of operation: In case of a failure, the system might still operate at with a  reduced level of service. In these conditions, the IPT system manages to ensure certain critical functions at  a minimum level. For that purpose, IPT operators have to determine which key performance indicators can  be relaxed until the normal service is recovered.  4.2 Policies and standards  Employ security by design: Physical/cyber infrastructure should incorporate security requirements  upstream during the engineering process to minimise the potential and impact of breaches. As per these  requirement, employing security by design improves the security capabilities of products and helps  mitigate the likelihood of the costly retrofitting of security protections.79  Establish disaster recovery processes and maintain back-ups: It is imperative to develop and establish a  disaster recovery processes, and to maintain back-ups of business data preferably in a remote secure  location to minimising the likelihood of collateral damage. These actions acknowledge the reality that  despite an operator’s best security efforts, it is inevitable that incidents will occur,80 whether through  deliberate attacks, user errors, accidents and/or environmental incidents.  Define degraded modes of operation: The definition of degraded modes of operation contributes to  enhancing the resilience of the IPT system by ensuring a minimum level of service. One of several  degraded modes can be defined in function of the systems impacted and the dependencies identified. For  example, degraded modes of operation are applied in air traffic management in order to ensure safety.81  77 Thomas Calabrese, “Information Security Intelligence: Cryptographic Principles and Applications”, 2004.  78 Bonnie Zhu, Anthony Joseph and Shankar Sastry, “A Taxonomy of Cyber Attacks on SCADA Systems”, Internet of  Things (iThings/CPSCom), 2011 International Conference on and 4th International Conference on Cyber, Physical and  Social Computing, pp.380-388, October 2011.  79 Ann Cavoukian and Marc Chanliau, “Privacy and Security by Design: A Convergence of Paradigms”, January 2013.  https://www.ipc.on.ca/images/resources/pbd-convergenceofparadigms.pdf  80 A.

It emphasises the need for information security to all staff members, and reflects  the commitment of the organisation to operate in a controlled, secure manner and achieve information  security.82 Failure to develop and implement an information security policy undermines the operator’s  ability to focus their information security activities consistently across their organisation.  Forecasting, early warning systems and risk analysis: IPT operators possess finite security resources,  hence it is essential they can direct these resources appropriately so as to maximise their impact. Knowing  of, or predicting the risk of, threats in advance of their emergence enables the stakeholder to efficiently  allocate their resources and to take pre-emptive steps to mitigate damages.  Separate critical systems from non-critical systems: Critical systems (i.e. those controlling steering,  braking, etc.) should not be accessible though other non-critical systems installed within the same vehicle  (e.g. information displays, entertainment systems, etc.). Successful attacks on critical systems in smart  vehicles where access was gained through non-critical systems demonstrates the safety and security  imperatives of keeping these systems separate.83 84 Similarly, networks linking critical systems and/or those  essential to the provision of critical services should be separated (either physically or virtually) from  networks linking non-critical systems/services.85  Enhance physical security protecting critical physical infrastructure: Risk assessments should be used to  identify which infrastructure is critical to the IPT operator and, enhanced physical protection measures  should be implemented as a result.86 Each operator will have their own unique assets requiring protection,  and this two-step process ensures resources are allocated on an evidence basis.  Implement a security control centre with real-time monitoring: A centralised control centre for directing  and coordinating security resources to respond to threats as they are identified enables the efficient  allocation of resources, and provides a recognisable point of contact for liaising with LEA, CSIRTs and other  Smart City stakeholders.  Ensure redundancy for critical systems: Building redundancy into critical systems reduces the likelihood  that the failure of a single or small number of components, or an isolated incident within the network, will  result in the failure of the entire network. While this good practice is applicable to all critical systems, two  specific instances were highlighted by respondents as being particularly critical for IPT, these being;  communication systems and power systems.  Create resilient communication systems: Communication systems are essential components of IPT  systems with the integration of ICT into public transport defining IPT. At its extreme, the failure of the  communication system will halt an IPT network, and these communication systems are susceptible to a  multitude of physical and cyber attacks, acts of nature and environmental incidents. Hence it is essential to  82 Karin Hone and J.H.P Eloff, “What Makes an Effective Information Security Policy?”, Network Security, Vol.6(1),  2002, pp.14-16.  83 BBC News, “Fiat Chrysler recalls 1.4 million cars after Jeep hack”, 24 July 2015.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33650491  84 BBC News, “Car hack uses digital-radio broadcasts to seize control”, 22 July 2015.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33622298  85 See Eric D. Knapp and Joel Langill, “Industrial Network Security: Securing Critical Infrastructure Networks for Smart  Grid, SCADA, and Other Industrial Control Systems (2nd edition)”, 2015.  86 This is not to say that non-critical infrastructure should be unprotected; merely that critical infrastructure should be  assessed for additional protections.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33650491 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33622298  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  38  build redundancy into IPT communication systems so no single failure will break the network. When public  telecommunication networks are used, this resilience can be contractual if specified in the Service Level  Agreement established with communication providers.  Create resilient power systems: IPT infrastructure (including some vehicles) require electricity to operate.  Nevertheless, these power systems are susceptible to a multitude of physical and cyber attacks, strikes,  acts of nature and environmental incidents which can lead to disruptions and outages. Hence it is essential  to build redundancy into IPT power networks so that no single point of failure exists. This resilience can be  contractual if specified in the Service Level Agreement established with power suppliers.  4.3 Organisational, people and processes  Monitor and record activity: Operators need to implement technologies to monitor and record both  physical activity at high value locations (e.g. CCTV, authentication logging, etc.) and digital activity (e.g.  activity logs) on their networks as part of a cohesive Security Management System.87 These measures are  required for multiple purposes including: ensuring safety, providing security, the gathering of forensic  evidence, system recovery processes, training purposes, identifying insider threats, data for risk analyses,  maintaining system stability, etc.88  Define security requirements during procurement processes: During the procurement process “security”  needs to be afforded the same importance as “functionality”. This enhancing of the status of security at  this early stage is to decrease business risks posed by cyber and physical threats, and acts to mitigate the  likelihood of the costly retrofitting of security protections.89  Coordinate with LEAs and CSIRTs: IPT operators should coordinate with LEAs/CSIRTS. The level of  coordination can include sharing threat/good practice information, developing and running online training  programmes, and conducting live drills.90 This level of coordination is necessary as LEA/CSIRTs occupy  privileged positions to see emerging and/or applicable threats from other stakeholders outside of IPT.  Raise awareness on cyber threats to all levels of staff including management: Cyber threats keep evolving  at fast pace. It is important to raise awareness among staff by informing them periodically about current  and top threats targeting IT systems and assets of the organisation. Highlighting security good practices to  protect against these threats is also important. In order to improve the awareness level efficiently, all staff  including non-technical staff and in particular management shall be informed. In particular, informing  management on existing governance models is likely to help integrating cyber security in the organisation.  Engage in staff training: IPT staff are valuable assets for protecting the network against both physical and  digital threats. They are also a potential source of threats to the network through accidently introducing  viruses and malware, as spearfishing victims, etc. To maximise benefits and minimise risks, pre-emptive  training programmes complemented by post-event training (to incorporate “lessons learnt”) are essential.  87 Giovanni Bocchetti, Francesco Flammini, Concetta Pragliola and Alfio Pappalardo, “Dependable integrated  surveillance systems for the physical security of metro railways”, Third ACM/IEEE International Conference on  Distributed Smart Cameras, 2009.  88 Preeti Tuli and Priyanka Sahu, “System Monitoring and Security Using Keylogger”, International Journal of  Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.2 (3), March 2013, pp.106-111.  89 Robert Newby, “Security Think Tank: Procurement and security are uneasy bedfellows”, ComputerWeekly.com,  November 2013.  90 See Cristin Goodwin and Paul Nicholas, “Developing a City Strategy for Cybersecurity: A seven-step guide for local  governments”, October 2014.  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  39  Develop organisational and operational procedures and guidelines: The development and  implementation of operational guidelines and procedures should be integrated into the culture of an IPT  via staff training. Without this process, good practices, lessons learnt from prior incidents and corporate  knowledge cannot be retained and applied throughout an organisation in a systematic fashion.  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  40  5. Gap analysis  This section provides an analysis of the main gaps in relation to cyber security in IPT as identified during  the field work. Gaps were elicited from the comparison between the identified threats, vulnerabilities and  risk, and good practices.  Gaps to be addressed are widespread and focused not just on technology but also on other areas, such as:  organisational gaps, policy and standardisation issues, and the need to develop more comprehensive and  integrated tools. This section summaries eight identified key cyber security gaps in IPT. While they are  numbered 1 to 8 below, these gaps have not been ranked according to any measure of importance.  5.1 Gap 1: Lack of a common EU approach to Intelligent Public Transport Security  There is currently no common EU approach specific to either intelligent or standard public transport, or  related framework that specifically address IPT cyber security needs (see Section 2.2 for an analysis on EU  legislation).91 Potentially the proposed NIS Directive might have an impact on addressing elements of this  gap, above all in relation to cyber threat reporting, but may need to be expanded to encompass  requirements for IPT cyber security within both urban transport networks and national/international rail  networks.  5.2 Gap 2: No integration of security in current EU guidelines for IPT  Although there are EU guidelines on cyber security, very little is specifically designed for intelligent  transport.92 A gap here exists for EU common guidelines that deal more closely with intelligent transport  above all in relation to enhancing the cyber security of IPT systems and the implementation of appropriate  processes with a suitable cyber security focus.93 Furthermore, although some initial developments in  relation to an EU-wide strategy for intelligent transport have been put in place in recent years, via the  action plan for the Deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in Europe94 and the Directive  2010/40/EU95 requiring MS to develop their own strategy for implementing transport, these attempts do  not focus on cyber security.96 Therefore there is still a gap in relation to comprehensive and integrated  guidelines or strategies tailored to secure IPT from cyber threats. Such guidelines could define the action  of different stakeholders involved on IPT cyber security (e.g. coordination, responsibilities…).  5.3 Gap 3: Lack of common definitions and formalised cyber security policies  The field work indicates that definitions for IPT are not widely used or adopted (see Figure 10) within  transport organisations. Furthermore, the majority of transport organisations do not have a formalised  91 While Directive 2008/57/EC is a partial exception here covering the interoperability of EU railways, this Directive  also has nothing to say on cyber security needs.  92 See: ENISA, “Good Practice Guide for Incident Management”, 2010; and ENISA, “Technical Guidelines on Security  Measures”, October 2014.  93 More mature IPT implies the coordination and cooperation among different operators and users in different  countries , hence the EU focus is a paramount.  94 EC, “Action Plan for the Deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in Europe - COM(2008) 886 final/2 –  CORRIGENDUM”, 2008.  95 EC, “Directive 2010/40/EU on the framework for the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of  road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport”, 2010.  96 In addition they only address road vehicles, therefore other major modes of transportation of IPT are not covered.  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  41  cyber security policy in place and/or list of critical assets that need to be protected by cyber threats (see  Figure 11). There is need for common definitions and the adoption of more formalised security  strategies.97 This will lead to greater security and collaboration within and among transport organisations.  Figure 10: Use of definition of Intelligent Transport  Figure 11: Cyber security policy and definitions for critical assets  5.4 Gap 4: Lack of corporate governance for IPT security98  An effective governance framework for IPT security within organisations, setting out clear responsibilities  and objectives is still missing.99 By allocating clear cyber security responsibilities with an organisation, this  governance framework (covering common training programmes, the identification and advance warning of  threats, support and advice, etc.) would also greatly facilitate cyber security collaboration between IPT and  smart city operators on the one hand, and governments, LEA and national CSIRTs on the other.  5.5 Gap 5: No specific security standards for IPT  There is a lack of specific security standards for IPT that can address the specific context and security  threats faced by IPT assets. Generic standards, such as the ISO27000 series, are not sufficiently useful for  the complex reality of IPT and are poorly related to the security environment within which transport  organisations interact and operate today. It is important that standards are able to accommodate new IPT  functionalities and concepts as they become relevant, while being able to remain dynamic, extensible and  flexible.100  5.6 Gap 6: Lack of advanced interdependent analysis tools  Given the highly interconnected and complex nature of transportation networks, there is the need for  more sophisticated analysis tools that can capture asset interdependence and cascade-effects among all  97 ISO, “Smart Cities. Preliminary Report 2014”, ISO/IEC publication, 2015.  http://www.iso.org/iso/smart_cities_report-jtc1.pdf  98 While we have avoided ranking either the identified gaps or challenges, during the validation workshop for this  research, practitioners were of the consensus that the lack of corporate governance currently represents the most  important gap/challenge facing IPT.  99 ESADEgeo and Zurich, “Global cyber governance: preparing for new business risks”, Risk Nexus, April 2015.  100 The recent work on IPT standards from ETSI and the US Department of Transportation aim at filling this gap at the  European and US level.

These tools will help capture how interdependencies  operate and will heighten impacts in order to develop procedures and policies to improve recovery.101  5.7 Gap 7: Lack of advanced risk assessment tools  Risk assessment methodologies that can deal with multiple networked stakeholders working in  collaboration need to be developed. This requires a different mind-set for existing risk management  approaches, which often begin by scoping a system (i.e. defining its borders) prior to a risk assessment  based on the individual elements. However, in interconnected systems this clear border does not exist. To  address this gap we need to redesign risk management systems/approaches so that they operate from a  stakeholder perspective rather than border perspective.102 103  5.8 Gap 8: Lack of advanced real-time and multi-stakeholder-enabled security  technologies  Due to the number of networked technologies applied across the transportation systems, often belonging  to different operators and displaying multiple interdependence,104 105 there is a need for more advanced  security IT infrastructures that allow for multi-stakeholder penetration testing, and provide real-time  authentication among both trusted and un-trusted users in a multi-stakeholder environment.105  101 Rae Zimmerman and Carlos E.

Recommendations  This final section of the study provides nine recommendations on how to enhance cyber security within  IPT. Recommendations are directed towards different groups of stakeholders, specifically: decision  makers; transport operators; and manufactures and solution providers. The recommendations try to  accommodate both the rigorous requirements coming from the study and the more practical matters of  short-range implementation by practitioners. Each recommendation draws upon the information and  analysis presented in earlier sections and has been validated by a range of different stakeholders. Below  each recommendation are brief explanatory notes.  Figure 12 summarizes the above mentioned challenges and gaps and allocates them across four areas:  Figure 12: Challenges and gaps   Gaps and challenges that are mainly related  to technology;   Gaps and challenges that are mainly related  to organisation, people and process;   Gaps and challenges mainly concerning  policy and standard; and   Gaps and challenges concerning a mix of all  the previous areas (i.e. affecting all the  previously mentioned areas).106  As the figure indicates, challenges and gaps  tend to concentrate in both the technology and  tools area and policy and standards area.  Challenges  C1 Difficulties to integrate security for safety  C2 Inadequate importance and spending being  afforded to cyber security  C3 Inadequate checking for countermeasures  C4 Unwillingness to collaborate and exchange  information on cyber security  C5 Slow phasing out of legacy systems  C6 Inadequate data exchange between IPT and SC  operators  C7 Weak situational awareness of cyber threats  C8 Resistance to security adoption  Gaps  G1: Lack of a common EU approach to IPT  G2: No integration of security in current guidelines  or strategies for IPT  G3: Lack of common definitions and formalised  cyber security policies  G4: Lack of corporate governance for IPT security  G5: No specific security standards for IPT  G6: Lack of advanced interdependent analysis tools  G7: Lack of advanced risk assessment tools  G8: Lack of advanced real-time and multi- stakeholder-enabled security technologies  106 The allocation was based on desktop research, survey and interviews  Technology Organisation, people & process  All Policy & standard  C1  C2  C3  C6  C5  C4  C8  C7  G1 G2  G3  G6  G5  G4  G8  G7  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  44  6.1 For decision makers107  6.1.1 EC and MS institutions should promote public/private collaboration on IPT cyber security at  national level and EU-wide  This requires EC and MS institutions to actively promote greater collaboration, information exchange and  knowledge on IPT cyber security across-borders via appropriate measures. For instance, this could take the  form of establishing EU multi-stakeholder fora, engaging in regular consultations, conducting awareness  campaigns, etc. The objectives of such initiatives will be: to set up cross-border and multi-stakeholder  collaboration on cyber security; develop and implement awareness campaigns to educate end-users on  risks in smart environments; and share best practices and information about cyber threats, attacks and  cyber measures. Regarding this last objective, voluntary reporting of threat incidents to a trusted third  party within the EU could be a viable tool for identifying and quantifying threat levels. At the moment in  transport there is no real coordination on cyber security across national borders. This recommendation  directly addresses challenges C4 and C7 as identified in Figure 12 above, while also having a positive  impact on challenges C2, C3, C6 and C8.  6.1.2 EC institutions and agencies should promote and facilitate the development of a common EU  approach to IPT security  Relevant EC institutions and agencies (e.g. ETSI, CEN, CENELEC, ENISA, DG MOVE) must play an important  role in facilitating and promoting integrated industry efforts via open IPT coordination initiatives, whereby  standards and common guidelines tailored for cyber security in IPT are produced by interested parties  across Europe through a transparent, open and consensus-based process. Transport operators,  manufactures and vendors will be consulted in order to gain their support and buy-in for these new  standards and guidelines. Existing initiatives on EC standards, led by ETSI, CEN and CENELEC108, could be  further developed and expanded to include wider participation from public and private partnerships,  and/or industry stakeholders. In addition, the cross-exchange of knowledge and practices between  transport and other sectors (e.g. telecommunication, finance, etc.) should be developed to leverage  lessons learned and existing good practices. Taken together, these actions would enable the identification  of common standards and guidelines for IPT in areas where these are currently less effective and mature  (e.g. minimum cyber security requirements and good practices that should be in place; implementation of  security by design; minimum security requirements for data exchange and collaborative IPT systems  among operators, etc.). Such guidelines could be based on the work of ENISA and/or national CSIRTs. This  recommendation directly addresses challenges C3-C8 as well as gap G2, while also having a positive impact  on gaps G1 and G4-G7.  6.1.3 EC institutions and agencies should develop a comprehensive EU strategy and framework for  cyber security in IPT  This suggests that EC institutions should further develop the existing EU cyber security strategy and  framework with a greater focus on IPT in order to provide a much more comprehensive, focused and  integrated approach to IPT cyber security across Europe. This goes hand-in-hand with efforts to develop an  ongoing dialogue with stakeholders to inform on policymaking and to ensure effective implementation of  107 By “decision makers” we are referring primarily to publically elected/appointed officials with decision-making  powers that impact on IPT at both the EU and Member States levels.  108 These organisations were given a mandate to develop European standards to provide interoperability,  compatibility and continuity for the deployment and operational use of ITS (see Directive 2010/40/EU of the  European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2010 and Directive 98/34/EC)  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  45  the endorsed strategy. The anticipated NIS is an initial step in this direction and a building block for a  comprehensive framework. This recommendation directly addresses gaps G1 and G8.  6.1.4 EC and MS should integrate and converge security efforts made in other sectors of activity  IPT operators share similarities with other operators in the usage of systems (e.g. ICS/SCADA) and  operations. Efforts have already been made in other sectors of activity to enhance their security (e.g.  Smart Grids). In order to benefit from these existing efforts, Policy Makers from the European Commission  and from Member States should assess which measures can be integrated to IPT. Moreover, it is important  to converge the efforts when possible, through collaboration and experience sharing. This  recommendation directly addresses gaps G1-G3 and challenge C6 and C8.  6.1.5 EC and MS should foster the development of harmonised cyber security standards for IPT  The lack of a dedicated cyber security standard for IPT is an obstacle to the adoption of good security  principles by IPT operators, manufacturers and solution vendors. With the support of the EC and MS, the  industry (private and public sector) should ensure the development and adoption of harmonised standards  adapted to the particularities. One or several completing standards could be developed to cover cyber  security from various points of views (e.g. technical, organisational, validation of security practices, etc.) as  it has been proposed in other domains (e.g. Smart Grids). This recommendation directly addressed gaps  G1-G3 and challenges C1 and C3.  6.2 For transport operators  6.2.1 IPT operators should integrate cyber security in their corporate governance  This leads transport operators to define the roles and responsibilities of top management as well as the  integration of cyber risks into their budgetary, risk and project management operational processes. This  does not necessarily mean that transport operators need to develop a new governance framework, but  integraty cyber security roles into its current one. The objective is to integrate within the current  framework the budget and responsibilities to meet cyber security objectives (e.g. training, awareness  raising, acquisition, etc.). This recommendation directly addresses challenges C1, C2, C3, C4 and C8, and  gaps G3 and G4.  6.2.2 IPT operators should develop and implement an integrated corporate strategy addressing  holistically cyber security and safety risks  This requires transport operators develop effective cyber security policies for cyber security in order to  start formalising cyber security processes both internally and with the other operators they  interact/collaborate with. The policy should also make clear the relationship between security and safety,  the minimum security requirements for collaborative IPT initiatives with other operators and the need to  report and exchange information and know-how on cyber security with relevant agencies and other  operators. If transport operators do not have a clear policy spelling out their objectives for cyber security,  and if a senior manager is not clearly responsible for the final outcome within the organisation(s) involved  in sharing IPT infrastructures (i.e. responsible for management of the cyber risk), then this final outcome  will not happen. This recommendation directly addresses challenges C1, C2, C4, C6 and C8, and gaps G6  and G7, while also having a positive impact on challenges C5 and C7.  6.2.3 IPT operators should implement risk management for cyber security in multi-stakeholder  environments including external contractors and dependencies  This entails that transport operators should have tailored risk management processes in place for cyber  security which involve all the relevant participating operators and are integrated into their corporate risk  frameworks. These processes shall also include external contractors that interact with the IPT operators.  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  46  This will improve standardisation and consistency on how to manage cyber security risks within all the  participant organisations, while supporting managers with cyber security responsibilities in doing their  jobs. Transport operators should also think of involving other external stakeholders, such as end-users and  civil society, as part of their approach to managing cyber risk. These external stakeholders could bring  valuable, external insights and a customer or citizen point of view, which are necessary for the effective  management of cyber risks. This recommendation directly addresses challenge C7 and gaps G3 and G4,  while also having a positive impact on challenge C4.  6.2.4 IPT operators should clearly and routinely specify their cyber security requirements  This suggests that transport operators should routinely and clearly specify their cyber security  requirements for all their transports initiatives and projects as part of their risk management processes.  Such activities should not be “one-off events”, rather they should be a part of regular cyber security  reviews. These cyber security requirements can then be incorporated into the beginning of project-cycles  through the use of security by design. They also provide a guide for enhancing the cyber security of future  infrastructure developments when planning the phasing-out of legacy systems. This recommendation  directly addresses challenges C5 and C8.  6.2.5 IPT operators should annually review organisational cyber security processes, practices and  infrastructures  This suggests that transport operators should check and review their internal processes, practices and  infrastructures for cyber security every year as part of the organisation’s corporate review and  performance management procedures. It also feed into the goal of creating/strengthening a cyber security  practice knowledge base among IPT stakeholders. This annual review should be done in parallel with the  review of overall risk management procedures. Senior managers discuss and assess how well the  organisation has performed in relation to its cyber security objectives, and assess whether the  implemented cyber security processes, practices, training, infrastructures and tools have been adequate.  This review provides a systematic and periodic process for assessing the organisation’s cyber security  performance in relation to certain pre-established criteria and organisational objectives, while identifying  needs for further enhancement and next steps. This recommendation directly addresses challenges C3,  while also having a positive impact on challenges C5 and C8, and gaps G3-G5.  6.3 For manufacturers and solution providers  6.3.1 Manufacturers and solution providers should create products/solutions that match the cyber  security requirements of IPT end-users  Manufacturers and providers should increase their collaboration with end-users in relation to R&D, while  aligning their solutions much more closely to the cyber security requirements, needs and affordability  concerns of end-users. Solutions should be specifically tailored to address both existing gaps and the needs  of end-users that the end-users themselves have identified via their own risk analyses (examples here may  include; the development of advanced interdependent analysis tools, improving real-time capabilities,  developing advanced risk assessment tools that can operate in multi-stakeholder environments, and  technologies that enable security). Products should also be developed by employing security by design  principles including; defence in depth, separation of privilege, securing the weakest link, promoting  privacy, etc. At the moment solutions tend to be too general and do not reflect the contextual reality of IPT  offerings. This recommendation directly addresses gaps G3-G5.  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  47  6.3.2 Manufacturers and solution providers should collaborate in the development of IPT-specific  standards and apply them to IPT solutions  This recommends that manufacturers and providers should collaborate in the development of security  standards tailored for IPT by participating in open IPT coordination initiatives (see recommendation in  Section 6.1.2), while also meeting all applicable EU and international standards in the development of their  products and solutions (e.g. ETSI, Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS); Security; Security header and  certificate formats, 2015 and US government, Federal Information Security Management Act - FISMA,  2002). This recommendation directly addresses gap G2.  6.3.3 Manufacturers and solution providers should develop a trusted information sharing platform on  risks and vulnerabilities  A trusted information sharing platform offers the possibility to its participants to exchange knowledge on  risks and vulnerabilities. The trust aspect of such platform is necessary to ensure good participation, as it  constitutes an incentive to share about incidents and solutions. For Intelligent Public Transports, it is  recommended that manufacturers and solution providers participate to the development of such a trusted  information sharing platform. The objective is to understand existing vulnerabilities in IPT systems, the  risks associated to IPT as well as to promote possible solutions in order to improve the readiness level of  the participants. This recommendation directly addresses challenges C4 and C7 as well as gap G3.  6.3.4 Manufacturers and solution providers should provide security guidance for your systems,  products and solutions  IPT operators who integrate new systems needs guidance to do it securely. Manufacturers and service  providers should provide security guidance to describe proper procedures and parameters for secure  configuration, operation and maintenance. Such guidance should lead IPT operators to improve their  awareness and clarify liabilities. For instance, one possible guidance regarding patch management could  explain the consequences on patching systems in relation to compatibility and availability. This  recommendation directly addresses challenges C6 and C7 as well as gaps G6 and G7.  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  48  Annexes  A.1 Key EU legislation and policy/strategy documents affecting IPT  Table 3 describes the legislation and policies that combine to form the legal and policy environment  governing IPT at the EU level.  Table 3: EU legislation and policy documents  EXISTING EU LEGISLATION  Title General Description Impact on IPT  Directive 95/46/EC  on the protection of individuals  with regard to the processing of  personal data and on the free  movement of such data  Under this Directive, MS shall protect the  fundamental rights and freedoms of  citizens, and in particular their right to  privacy with respect to the processing of  personal data, as well as ensuring the free  movement of such data between MS.  This Directive (together with Directive  2002/58/EC) sets out rules protecting  fundamental rights and freedoms of  individuals, specifically in relation to data  privacy, security and the re-use of  information. This includes passengers on  IPT networks.  Directive 2002/58/EC  concerning the processing of  personal data and the protection  of privacy in the electronic  communications sector (Directive  on privacy and electronic  communications)  Directive 2002/58/EC complements  Directive 1995/46/EC. It concerns the  protection of privacy with respect to the  processing of personal data in the  electronic communication sector, as well  as ensuring the free movement of such  data between MS.  This Directive (together with Directive  1995/46/EC) sets out rules protecting  fundamental rights and freedoms of  individuals, specifically in relation to  consent, privacy, security and the re-use  of information. Services provided to the  public within IPT networks via electronic  communications will need to have regard  for this Directive. Use of location data  linked to user’s devices, provision of  security, use of cookies, and  recording/storage of data are all possible  issues here.  Directive 2009/33/EC  on the promotion of clean and  energy-efficient road transport  vehicles  This Directive requires applicable  authorities, entities and operators to take  into account lifetime energy and  environmental impacts when purchasing  road transport vehicles. This includes  energy consumption and emissions of CO2  and of certain pollutants.  Directive (2009/33/EC) applies to public  transport, including; railways, automated  systems, tramways, trolley buses, and  buses. However, the focus is very narrow  covering only a specific set of  environmental vehicle specifications.  Directive 2010/40/EU  on the framework for the  deployment of Intelligent  Transport Systems in the field of  road transport and for interfaces  with other modes of transport  This Directive establishes a framework to  support the coordinated, coherent  deployment and use of Intelligent  Transport Systems (ITS) within the EU. It  also provides for the development of  specifications and necessary standards  within areas including; ITS road safety and  security, linking vehicles with transport  infrastructure, optimal use of data, and  continuity of service.  Defines ITS. Enables the EC to adopt  specifications necessary to ensure the  compatibility, interoperability and  continuity for the deployment and  operational use of ITS. Also, promotes the  development of necessary standards in  these areas. Sets out rules on privacy,  security and the reuse of information.  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  49  Directive 2008/57/EC  on the interoperability of the rail  system within the Community  This Directive concerns the provisions  relating to the interoperability  constituents, the interfaces and  procedures, as well as the conditions of  overall compatibility of the rail systems  across the EU, that are required to  achieve its interoperability.  This Directive establishes Technical  Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs)  for the subsystems that comprise the  trans-European rail system. No specific  mention of ITS, however, the  development of interoperability across  national rail networks provides a  convenient common platform for  developers of ITS to utilise and link into.  FUTURE EU LEGISLATION  Title General Description Impact on IPT  Proposed NIS Directive109  concerning measures to ensure a  high common level of network  and information security across  the Union  The aim of the proposed Directive is to  ensure a high common level of network  and information security (NIS). This means  improving the security of the Internet and  the private networks and information  systems underpinning the functioning of  EU societies and economies.  Operators of critical infrastructures,  including transport, will be required to  manage cyber security risks and report  serious incidents to their national  competent authorities.  PRINCIPLE EU POLICY & STRATEGY DOCUMENTS  Title General Description Impact on IPT  Action Plan for the Deployment  of Intelligent Transport Systems  in Europe - COM(2008) 886  final/2 – CORRIGENDUM  This Action Plan aims to accelerate and  coordinate the deployment of Intelligent  Transport Systems (ITS) in road transport,  including interfaces with other transport  modes.  While the overall focus of this Action Plan  is wider than just security and resilience  of ITS, specific actions identified within  this plan are applicable. These include: the  optimal use of traffic/travel data; road  safety and security; integration of the  vehicle into the transport infrastructure;  data security and protection and liability  issues; and European ITS cooperation and  coordination.  Internet of Things - An action  plan for Europe - COM(2009) 278  final  This action plan sets out 14 “Lines of  Action” regarding the future design of  objects/systems falling under the Internet  of Things (IoT) umbrella. Specifically this  introduces questions of privacy, the  monitoring of individuals, and the storage  of personal data. Also issues of design  standardisation are raised.  The IoT will become integrated into the  ICT networks of Smart Cities and IPT  systems. This action plan is useful in that  it raises a number of issues yet to be  addressed. As the IoT develops and  becomes integrated elements of this  action plan will take on increased  significance.  109 EC, “EU Cybersecurity plan to protect open internet and online freedom and opportunity - Cyber Security strategy  and Proposal for a Directive”. http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open- internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  Cyber Security and Resilience of Intelligent Public Transport  December 2015  50  Title General Description Impact on IPT  A Digital Single Market Strategy  for Europe - COM(2015) 192 final  The overall aim is to develop a Digital  Single Market across EU cyber space  whereby the principle of free movement  of people, goods, services and capital is  translated and applied online.  This Strategy has the potential to impact  the technical operation of ICT networks,  create a more joined-up approach to the  development of online network security  solutions, and boost the development of  standards for interoperability in the  transport sector.  European Innovation Partnership  on Smart Cities and  Communities: Strategic  Implementation Plan  Presents the Strategic Implementation  Plan for creating Smart Cities produced by  the High Level Group of the European  Innovation Partnership for Smart Cities  and Communities.  This plan places strong emphasis on urban  mobility (i.e. map public transport) and  the integration of infrastructure assets  and processes across energy, ICT and  transport to improve the efficiency and  sustainability of cities (i.e. creating IPT).  Roadmap to a Single European  Transport Area – Towards a  competitive and resource  efficient transport system -  COM(2011) 144 final  Focus is on how to remove barriers and  bottlenecks so as to complete the internal  market for transport by creating a  competitive and sustainable transport  market within the EU.  While the focus is limited the Roadmap  does specifically mention the  development of smart mobility systems  such as intelligent transport systems, and  the need for regulatory frameworks to  protect privacy and personal data in  parallel with the wider use of information  technology tools. Highlights  standardisation and interoperability as  keys to avoiding the technological  fragmentation of the European transport  market.  Rolling plan for ICT  Standardisation  This Rolling Plan provides a multi-annual  overview of the needs for preliminary or  complementary ICT standardisation  activities to undertake in support of EU  policy activities.  Within Intelligent Transport Systems, this  document sets out the standards  developments that have occurred and the  legislation and policy documents at the  European and (to a lesser extent) at the  MS level.  Smart Cities and Communities –  European Innovation Partnership  - COM(2012) 4701 final  Covering Smart Cities and Communities  European Innovation Partnerships; these  are partnerships across the areas of  energy, transport and information and  communication with the objective to  catalyse progress in areas where energy  use, mobility and transport, and ICT are  intimately linked.

Table 3 provides a reference guide of the current good practices identified for IPT whereby the practices are described according to both the  business/societal functions identified in Section 2.3, and the different threat groups identified in Section 3.1.1. In addition these good  practices are assessed according to when they should be applied using the following three categories: 110   Pre-attack good practices: Focus is on identifying threats to, and weaknesses within, an IPT network and increasing the preparedness  and resilience of that network prior to attacks such that threats can be reduced or even negated.   During attack good practices: Focuses on both measures that will enable the operator to identify that an attack is occurring, as well  as measures to be implemented once an ongoing attack is detected so as to halt and/or mitigate the consequences of that attack.   Post-attack good practices: Focuses on system monitoring practices that will enable the operator to identify that an attack has  occurred, returning the network to its pre-attack state, gathering evidence on the nature and perpetrators of the attacks, and  identifying lessons-learnt for improving the security of the network to resist future similar attacks.

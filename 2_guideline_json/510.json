Many critical sectors operating in the  European Member States such as the energy, transportation or financial sectors rely on critical information  infrastructure (CII). The Threats to CII, which stem from different sources ranging from national actors to  criminal hackers, have increased in recent years. In order to fully meet the emerging threats to CII, ENISA  offers assistance to EU Member States and the EU Commission.  This study contributes to the improvement of the protection of critical infrastructure in Member States by  taking stock of and analysing existing measures deployed in the field across several EU Member States. The  goal is to provide a set of good practices and recommendations to national authorities and lawmakers which  will contribute to stronger and more resilient CII in EU Member States and decrease the risk of disruption or  failure of critical infrastructure.  The introduction identifies six action areas for Member States, which contribute to an effective national  protection of CII (CIIP). These action areas include comprehensive policies and legislations, but also effective  national governance structures during day-to-day operations and in cases of emergency. Information sharing  between the private and the public sector and threat intelligence constitute important elements in CIIP,  since critical information infrastructure is mainly owned by the private sector.  This study presents some key findings, uncovers the different governance structures for CIIP in seventeen  EU Member States and one EFTA country along with different good practices. In addition, it presents general  findings, based on collected information via interviews and online surveys:   Surveyed EU Member States have delegated responsibility to cyber security authorities, emergency  agencies or national regulators. Only a minority of the examined Member States have tasked intelligence  agencies or information security forums with CIIP   Almost all national authorities for CIIP are responsible for operational tasks (for example: PoC for  incident reporting, organising exercises, incident response). Two thirds of the authorities are responsible  for additional tasks on the strategic or political level, such as the development of strategy papers,  supervision of the national CSIRT or the proposing legislation.   Cooperation with the private sector tends to be high, but only around 56 Percent of the examined  Member States have established institutionalised forms of cooperation in forms of public-private  partnerships   Legalisation and corresponding obligations for CII-operators vary across sectors. The critical sectors  with the strongest regulations across all analysed Member States are the Telecommunications, Finance  and Energy sectors   The majority of countries have conducted a risk assessment on a national level (or are planning to do  so). Other countries have decided that risk assessment is the responsibility of sector-specific agencies or  of the individual operators.   Three profiles of CIIP-governance have been identified: A centralised, a decentralised and a co- regulation approach.  Finally, the study makes general recommendations to EU Member States and the EU Commission on how to  improve CIIP in the European Union. The recommendations are the following:  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  06  Member States   Recommendation 1: Increase institutionalised cooperation with private stakeholders   Recommendation 2: Align management structure for CIIP with existing national crisis and emergency  management structures   Recommendation 3: Participate in or host international exercises   Recommendation 4: Establish mandatory security incident reporting   Recommendation 5: Conduct national risk assessment   Recommendation 6: Utilize best legal framework practices for CIIP across critical sectors   Recommendation 7: Examine if positive incentives can be provided to operators of CII to invest in  security measures  European Commission   Recommendation 8: Define baseline requirements in order to support the development of CIIP in MS   Recommendation 9: Develop and conduct a maturity assessment of Member States’ CIIP readiness   Recommendation 10: Support information sharing and the exchange of knowledge between EU  Member States’ national CSIRTs   Recommendation 11: Identify European Critical Information Infrastructure  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  07  List of Figures  Figure 1-1 – CIP/CIIP/Cybersecurity 11  Figure 1-2 – Action Areas of CIIP 12  Table 1 – Critical Sectors per Country 20  Figure 2-1 – National Authorities 21  Figure 2-2 – Responsibilities of National Authorities 22  Figure 2-3 – Forms of Cooperation between Public and Private Stakeholders 23  Figure 2-4 – Risk Assessment 24  Figure 2-5 – National Computer Security Incident Response Team 25  Figure 2-6 – Security Incident Reporting 25  Figure 2-7 – Security Measures 26  Figure 2-8 – Security Audits 27  Figure 2-9 – Decentralised Approach 29  Figure 2-10 – Centralised Approach 30  Figure 2-11 – Corregulation 32  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  08  List of Abbreviations  ABBREVATION DESCRIPTION  ANSSI Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d'information (France)  CERT Computer Emergency Response Team  CII Critical Information Infrastructures  CIIP Critical Information Infrastructure Protection  CIP Critical Infrastructure Protection  CIWIN Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network  Crisis Act Act no. 240/2000 Coll., on Crisis Management  CSIRT Computer Security Incident Response Team  ECI European Critical Infrastructure  EFTA European Free Trade Association  ENISA European Network and Information Security Agency  EPCIP European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection  EU European Union  ICS Industrial Control Systems  ICT Information and Communication Technology  ISAC Information Sharing and Analysis Centre  IWWN International Watch and Warning Network  LPM Military Programming Law (France)  MS Member States (EU)  MSB Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (Sweden)  NASK The Research and Academic Computer Network (Poland)  NCSC National Cyber Security Centre (Netherlands)  NCTV National Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism (Netherlands)  NIS Network and Information Security  OIV Operators of vital importance (France)  PoC Point of Contact  PPPs Public-private partnerships  PTS Swedish Post and Telecom Agency  SAMFI Cooperation Group for Information Security (Sweden)  SCADA Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  09  1. Introduction  Overview  The internet and other digital technologies as well as its underlying network and information systems are  the backbone of the European Society and the Digital Single Market. Millions of EU citizens and many  businesses rely on the information and communication infrastructure for a variety of services. These range  from energy and telecommunications to e-government, healthcare, and logistics. That is why disruption or  failure of this “critical infrastructure” can have dire consequences, ranging from the loss of money and  reputation for companies to the disruption of the provision of goods and essential services to the general  population.  In order to fully meet the emerging threats to critical information infrastructures (CII), ENISA offers  assistance to EU Member States and the EU Commission. The agency helps to understand the current threat  landscape with regard to CII, Smart Grids and ICS-SCADA (Industrial Control Systems-Supervisory Control and  Data Acquisition) among others. Furthermore, Cyber Europe has become an important multi-national and  multi-stakeholder cyber exercises for EU Member States. Many Member States in the European Union have  started to develop and implement different measures for the protection of critical information infrastructure  in their country. These measures range from the establishment of national coordinating bodies to the  development of national emergency plans or the adoption of specific legal frameworks. ENISA has supported  these efforts in the past by defining good practices in areas like cyber security strategies and national  contingency plans or by analysing different methods for the identification of critical infrastructure123.  This study contributes to the improvement of the protection of critical infrastructure in Member States by  taking stock of and analysing existing measures in this field across several EU Member States. The goal is to  provide a set of good practices and recommendations to national authorities, lawmakers and the European  Commission which will contribute to a stronger and resilient CII in EU Member States and decrease the risk  of disruption or failure of critical infrastructure.  Policy context  The EU aims to support its Member States in the protection of critical infrastructure. In order to align efforts  and foster cooperation, the EU has adopted specific programmes and directives:  The protection of critical infrastructure was first put on the agenda in June 2004, when the European Council  asked for the preparation of an overall strategy. At that time, the main concern was the protection against  terrorist attacks. In November 2005, the Commission adopted a Green Paper on a European Programme for  Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP) (European Commission 2005). On request of the Justice and Home  Affairs Council in December 2005, the EU Commission made a proposal for an EPCIP (European Commission  2006): Purpose of the EPCIP is the improvement of the protection of critical infrastructure in the EU against  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber- security-strategies-an-implementation-guide  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cce/cyber_exercises/national- exercise-good-practice-guide  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/Methodologies-for- identification-of-ciis  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  10  different types of threats (all-hazard approach). The legislative framework of the EPCIP consists of measures  designed to facilitate the implementation of EPCIP. This includes an EPCIP action plan, the Critical  Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CIWIN), the setting up of Critical Infrastructure Protection  (CIP) expert groups at EU level, CIP information sharing processes, and the identification and analysis of  interdependencies. A key component is the procedure for identifying and designating European Critical  Infrastructure (ECI). This has been implemented by means of the 2008 Directive on European Critical  Infrastructures (Council of the European Union 2008)4, which however only applies to the energy and  transport sectors. An updated approach to the EU CIP policy is currently under development and preliminary  results have been summarised in the 2013 Staff Working Document5 on a new approach to the European  Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (European Commission 2013a).  In order to strengthen the critical infrastructure against the various threats and to uphold the trust of the  EU citizens, the European Commission has proposed the Network and Information Security Directive (NIS  Directive) in 2013 (European Commission 2013b). The NIS Directive is currently in negotiations between the  European Parliament and the Council. The aim is to improve the EU Member States’ national cybersecurity  capabilities, enhancing the cooperation between the Member States, the public and the private sector while  also requiring companies in critical sectors to report major incidents to national authorities and to adopt risk  management practices.  A legal framework for attacks against information systems has been set by the Council Framework Decision  2005 (Council of the European Union 2005) and its replacement Directive 2013/40/EU (European Parliament,  Council of the European Union 2013)6. The objectives of this frameworks are to approximate the criminal  law of the EU Member States in this area. For this purpose the Directives establish definitions of criminal  offenses and sanctions. Furthermore, cooperation between law enforcement agencies and EU Agencies and  bodies such as Eurojust, Europol and its European Cyber Crime Centre, and ENISA shall contribute to this  improvement through measures such as the exchange of information.  Scope of the document  This study focuses on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP), rather than Critical Infrastructure  Protection (CIP). Both terms are often used interchangeably, which creates difficulties for researchers and  policy makers to clearly distinguish between them. In general, CIIP can be seen as an essential part of the  comprehensive efforts for CIP. While CIP covers the protection of a nation’s infrastructure across various  sectors, CIIP focusses on the protection of the underlying information infrastructure. CII is comprised of a  physical component (networks, wires, satellites, computers etc.) and an immaterial component, which is the  actual information transported by and through the physical components.  CIIP is also an integral part of many cyber and information security strategies. Cybersecurity covers a broad  spectrum of ICT-related security issues, of which the protection the CII is an integral part (Myriam Dunn  Cavelty 2012).  4 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32008L0114&from=EN  5 http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/pdf/policies/crisis_and_terrorism/epcip_swd_2012_190_final.pdf  6 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32013L0040&from=EN  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32008L0114&from=EN  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  11  Figure 1-1 – CIP/CIIP/Cybersecurity. Adapted from: Dunn Cavelty, The Art of CIIP Strategy 2012. p. 207  Because of the conceptual overlap between CIP, CIIP and cyber/information security, data gathering and  analysis of policies and documents was conducted in all areas.  In order to analyse CIIP, this study makes use of a holistic understanding of CIIP that includes different  aspects. CIIP in a national context is understood as an interplay of different areas of action that contribute  to an effective national CIIP. These action areas are:   Policy   Governance structure   Legislation   Risk management and mitigation measures   Emergency preparedness   Threat intelligence and information sharing  Policy means the development of strategic, policy or other white papers that outline strategic priorities, focal  points, goals, measures and defined roles and responsibilities of public and private stakeholders.  The Governance structure refers to the implementation of the defined roles and responsibilities in the area  of CIIP. This includes the development of public agencies with responsibility for CIIP or the extension of  existing authorities. It also includes the establishment of communication channels and cooperation  mechanisms between public and private agencies.  Legal obligations and requirements are an important tool for Member States to ensure that public and  private operators of CII adhere to a certain security standard. These can include mandatory security  standards, incident reports or audits.  Emergency preparedness refers to different measures to ensure appropriate incident handling in case of  national information security incidents. Regular exercises for CIIP, national risk assessments and national  incident management systems are all part of appropriate emergency preparedness. Computer Emergency  Response Teams are an essential pillar of CIIP on an operational level and offer expertise and advise to  operators of CII.  7 In the study we are trying to understand how CIIP is conceived on a national level. Nevertheless, critical information  infrastructures are not only national infrastructures.  National  Information  Infrastructures  Critical  Information  Infrastructures  Critical Infrastructures  CybersecurityCIIPCIP  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  12  Threat intelligence and information sharing is carried out by the respective national authorities and the asset  owners and refers to the monitoring of the threat landscape with regards to the cyber threats and threats  to CI. Information about threats have to be disseminated to the relevant stakeholders such as operators of  CII.  All action areas contribute to strong national CIIP.  The goal of this study is twofold: The first step is to take stock of existing practices and policies in the different  described areas of CIIP amongst Member States. The second step is to analyse the data with the goal of  identifying good practices and to create different profiles of the national CIIP measures. Based on the  analysis, a list of recommendations on how to improve national CIIP will be created. The overall goal is to  contribute to the improvement of CIIP amongst Member States and thus of the European Union.  Figure 1-2 – Action Areas of CIIP  Target audience  The target audience is governmental authorities, the European Commission and the CIIP community at large.  This document is specifically aimed at Member States that are at the beginning of CIIP structure  development or are looking to further improve existing structures. Decision makers in mandated national  agencies with responsibilities in the area of CIIP and lawmakers in charge of drafting legal frameworks with  the goal of protecting critical information infrastructure can benefit from the insights and results offered by  this study.  Structure of this document  This document is structured as follows:   Chapter 1 – Introduction and general overview  Policy  Governance structure  Legislation  Risk management and mitigation measures  Emergency  preparedness  Threat intelligence and information  sharing  CIIP  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  13   Chapter 2 – Describes the analytical framework and the process of data gathering   Chapter 3 – Presents the key findings: The governance of CIIP and good practices in EU MS   Chapter 4 – Identifies different CIIP profiles among the EU MS   Chapter 5 – Presents the lessons learnt and final recommendation of the study  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  14  Methodology  In accordance with the methodology named above, stock taking and information gathering has been  performed for seventeen different EU Member States and one EFTA country by the use of desk research,  online surveys and personal interviews. To facilitate comparison, the protection of CII has been analysed by  means of the following categories:   Framework for CIIP   Preparation for emergencies on a national level   Governmental authorities and other relevant actors   Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)   Legal obligations and requirements  “Framework for CIIP” includes research on national strategies or comparable policy papers for CIIP that have  been developed and put in place. It is assessed whether threats and risks to CII are outlined in an official  document and if strategic goals and objectives are set out on an official basis. In addition, a methodology for  the identification of CII should have been developed and applied and a framework for CIIP, i.e. through  regulations, guidelines, measures good practices etc., should have been established.  “Preparation for emergencies on a national level” examines if a risk assessment plan for CII-related security  incidents on a national level has been developed. It is also checked whether the roles and responsibilities of  various actors during a national crisis or security incident are defined and if regular trainings and exercises  for CIIP are carried out. To support information exchange on a national level, a multisource information  platform for CII awareness, crisis management and emergency response could be used.  “Governmental authorities and other relevant actors” evaluates if roles and responsibilities of governmental  agencies and the private sectors are defined. A governmental agency should have been designated to act as  the main national authority for CIIP, which includes authorisation to issue binding instructions to companies  and governmental authorities. In addition, it is assessed whether institutionalised forms of cooperation  between the public and private sector as well as between different authorities or institutions with a role in  CII protection have been established. Beyond this, awareness raising or similar training programmes related  to CIIP should also have been developed and put in place.  “Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)” determines if CIIP has been assigned to a national or  governmental CSIRT or if one has been set up for this purpose, as well as if the CSIRTs are under the  supervision of a national authority.  “Legal obligations and requirements” focuses on the operators of CII and analyses whether they are  obligated to notify an authority about security incidents as well as to implement appropriate technical and  organisational security measures. It is also evaluated if they are pledged to undergo an external security  audit and/or conformity or compliance tests and if incentives could be given to CII operators to invest in  security.  Key findings: The collected data will be analysed and interpreted. We will look for similarities and differences  in measures for CIIP. The focus will be on measures in the described action areas (see Figure 2).  Profile development: The focus here is on the governance structure of CIIP in the individual Member States.  We will analyse roles and responsibilities of public and private actors, as well as modes of governance and  steering in the issue area of CIIP.  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  15  Online Survey  ENISA developed an online survey to assess protection measures for CII in different EU Member States. The  survey consists of fifteen questions, which are to some extent dependant on one another. The survey covers  similar broader topics like the organisational structure of authorities or agencies, mechanisms for incident  reporting and investigation, national exercises for CIIP, cooperation mechanisms and obligations and  incentives. For the full survey form, refer to Appendix A.  The survey took place between May and July 2015. It was made available via an online platform provided by  EUSurvey, and has been answered by representatives of thirteen EU Member States.  Interview Questionnaire  ENISA has developed an interview questionnaire to assess protection measures for CII in different EU  Member States. The questionnaire contains seventeen questions which cover the five described categories.  For the full interview questionnaire, refer to Appendix B.  Interviews were conducted between May and August 2015. They took place in the form of personal  conversations or were answered in written form. In total, representatives of the national authorities for CIIP  of sixteen EU Member States were interviewed.  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  16  2. Key Findings  The key findings are the result of a detailed analysis made on the different governance structures for CIIP  in fifteen EU Member States and one EFTA country. The specific analysis can be found on a separate report  under the title: “CIIP Governance in the EU Member States”.  2.1 Good Practices  This chapter identifies exemplary good practices in CIIP among EU Member States in the areas of information  sharing schemes between public and private actors, CII emergency preparations, and obligations and  requirements for operators of CII.  Examples of Member States that have developed good practice in a certain area or field will be provided.  The list of examples is not exhaustive and should only serve as an inspiration for other EU Member States.  2.1.1 Partnership with Private Stakeholders  ICT structures across sectors are mostly owned by private companies, which means that cooperation of  public institutions with CII operators is essential in order to ensure the knowledge on current threats is up  to date and to ensure quick support in incident response, if needed.  The Netherlands are a good example for strong partnership with the private sector. The National Cyber  Security Centre (NCSC) serves as a focal point for a number of public-private partnerships. Within the NCSC,  several partnerships have been established for the purpose of Detection, Response and Analysis of threats.  In addition, the Cyber Security Council, made up of representatives from public and private parties, serves  as an independent advisory board. Thereby, the NSCS ensures a close partnership with private stakeholders  on a strategic and operational level (2015h).  Another example for close collaboration with the private sector is Austria. Austria has set up a Cyber Security  Platform, which is comprised of representatives of private and public operators of CII as well as relevant  public agencies. It aims to facilitate communications between its participants. On an operational level,  GovCERT has been set up as the main governmental CSIRT. It is run by the Federal Chancellery in cooperation  with CERT.at (a private initiative) (2015a).  2.1.2 Information Sharing Schemes  Many EU Member States have developed information sharing schemes in order to disseminate important  information between relevant public agencies and private operators. However, forms of cooperation can  differ between countries. Information sharing schemes ensure that all relevant stakeholders are informed  on current threats and risks and can take appropriate measures. It can also strengthen cooperation and  coordination of actions and thus foster the effective usage of resources.  Germany has established a number of wide-ranging information sharing schemes between public and  private sector agencies. Information sharing between law enforcement and intelligence agencies is realised  through the National Cyber Response Centre8, where the participants inform each other in daily meetings  and workshops. Information sharing with the private sector is fostered through UP KRITIS and the Alliance  for Cyber Security: UP KRITIS9 is a public-private partnership and its main task is to establish CIIP related  8 http://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/Themen/IT-Netzpolitik/IT- Cybersicherheit/Cybersicherheitsstrategie/Cyberabwehrzentrum/cyberabwehrzentrum_node.html  9 http://www.kritis.bund.de/SubSites/Kritis/EN/Home/home_node.html  http://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/Themen/IT-Netzpolitik/IT-Cybersicherheit/Cybersicherheitsstrategie/Cyberabwehrzentrum/cyberabwehrzentrum_node.html http://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/Themen/IT-Netzpolitik/IT-Cybersicherheit/Cybersicherheitsstrategie/Cyberabwehrzentrum/cyberabwehrzentrum_node.html http://www.kritis.bund.de/SubSites/Kritis/EN/Home/home_node.html  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  17  communication and cooperation between the private and public stakeholders on strategic and operational  level. While UP KRITIS focuses on cooperation with companies of the critical sectors, the Alliance for Cyber  Security has a broader scope and includes all relevant institutions in the area of cyber security. In order to  strengthen the security of all stakeholders, the alliance offers a general “information pool”, regular threat  reports and knowledge exchange between its participants (Federal Office for Information Security 2013,  2015a).  Sweden’s Cooperation Group for Information Security (SAMFI)10 is another example for a good practice in  information sharing. Unlike Germany, the focus is not on law enforcement and intelligence agencies but  rather on authorities with responsibilities in societal information security. Within SAMFI, the different  authorities not only share information on recent threats but also discuss strategical issue as well as national  and international developments. Representatives from the different authorities meet several times a year  and work together in working groups on current issues (Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) 2015).  2.1.3 Development of a CSIRT-Community  In most countries a variety of CSIRTs with different competencies exist. Developing a strong community  between the different national CSIRTs, including the division of responsibilities and sharing of information,  can lead to mutual benefits, such as increased knowledge and a more efficient use of resources.  A good example for a strong community between CSIRTs is Poland. In Poland, no CSIRT has been designated  as the national CSIRT. Instead, a community of different CSIRTs shares the responsibilities. CERT.gov.PL is  the main CSIRT for public agencies, but also offers its services to CI operators based on formal agreements.  CERT Polska was the first CSIRT in Poland and is part of the Research and Academic Computer Network  (NASK). It holds special expertise in the analysis and research of security incidents and provides information  on threats and incidents. The information is available on a database that can be used by private and public  entities. CERT.gov.PL and CERT Polska work together closely, for example in operating a database dedicated  to honeypots. Furthermore, they cooperate with a number of sectorial CSIRTs, such as MilCERT and CERT  Orange (telecommunications sector) (2015b).  Other examples for good practices in the development of CSIRT-communities are the Netherlands or  Germany. In Germany, the “CERT-Verbund” is an alliance of different German public CSIRTs (CERT-Bund, the  military CERTBw and several CERTs of the federal states), private CSIRTs of major companies, and CSIRTs of  private information security providers, among others. Every CSIRT is still responsible for its own  constituency, but participants share information and support each other in incident handling. CERT-Verbund  is the institutional foundation for this cooperation. The organisation is open to all kinds of German CSIRTs.  The participants have defined standardised technical and organisational interfaces for the exchange of  information. A key part is the statistical evaluation of the shared data and the provision of strategic insights  (Federal Office for Information Security 2015b).  2.1.4 Risk Assessment  Risk Assessment includes the identification of potential threats, consequences of these threats (impact) and  their likelihood.11 The analysis of risks is a necessary step for crisis and incident preparation and  management. In some countries, a national risk assessment is conducted by a national authority across all  10 http://rib.msb.se/Filer/pdf/26177.pdf  11 For an analysis of approaches to national-level risk assessment see:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/nlra- analysis-report  http://rib.msb.se/Filer/pdf/26177.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/nlra-analysis-report https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/nlra-analysis-report  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  18  relevant sectors. Other countries, especially those with a more decentralised approach in CIIP, leave risk  assessment the sector-specific authorities or to the operators of CI.  Examples for centralised national risk assessments are Sweden. The Swedish MSB has been commissioned  to continue the work on a national risk assessment which began in 2011. It developed a risk assessment  methodology, identified 27 particularly serious (national) events and developed eleven scenarios based on  a selection of these events (2015c).  Denmark does not follow a national risk assessment plan, because sectoral risk management is seen as a  more successful way to mitigate risks. A Cyber Threat Assessment Unit has been set up, which consists of  personnel from the different sectoral public authorities. The Unit’s goal is to conduct risk assessments for  the different sectors (2015d).  An example for a decentralised approach is Switzerland. Switzerland uses an approach with a strong focus  on individual self-responsibility. The critical subsectors are in charge of identifying the cyber-risks for their  processes and systems. It is believed that the subsectors have the best knowledge on their own processes  and systems. The government supports this process if requested (2015e).  2.1.5 Cyber Crisis Management  Good cyber crisis management includes the definition of roles and responsibilities in cases of cyber  emergencies and coordination and decision-making procedures between relevant stakeholders with the  necessary competencies and expertise. Furthermore, cyber crisis management needs to be aligned with  other existing national emergency and crisis management systems.12  A good example for good practice in this field is the cyber crisis management structure in the Netherlands.  For decision-making, the National Manual on Decision-making in Crisis Situation is applied (National  Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism 2013). In case of emergency related to ICT the national crisis  organisation is handled by the Director of Cyber Security of the National Coordinator for Security and  Counterterrorism (part of the Ministry of Security and Justice). Operational coordination and crisis response  measures are offered by the National Cyber Security Centre.  Cyber crisis management is conducted in close cooperation with the private sector. In case of a cyber-related  crisis the ICT Response Board becomes activated. The Board is set up as a public-private partnership and  includes ICT experts from the affected sectors. It offers advice and recommendations. In addition, the NCSC  has established agreements with public and private stakeholders on the method of crisis cooperation  (National Cyber Security Centre 2015a).  2.1.6 Comprehensive Legal Framework  Some countries have drafted new laws and regulation in order to tackle the problem of increasing threats  to CII. These legal frameworks are often tailored for operators of CI across all relevant sectors and are not  limited to specific ones.  These legal frameworks often include mandatory implementation of technical and organisational security  measures according to national or international standards. Other requirements can include mandatory  incident notification and regular external security audits. These laws ensure a consistent security level across  sectors and, in cases of mandatory security reporting, give governments the possibility to analyse the  12 For a comparative study on cyber crisis management and general crisis management, see ENISA’s Report on Cyber  Crisis Cooperation and Management ENISA 2014.  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  19  incoming incidents reports, monitor threats levels, issue warnings to threatened operators of CI and offer  support if necessary  An example of good practice in this area is France. The Military Programming Law (LPM13) obliges “operators  of vital importance” (OIVs) to report cybersecurity incident to the Agence nationale de la sécurité des  systèmes d'information (ANSSI) and implement technical and organisational measures for information  security. In addition, OIVs are obligated to undergo cybersecurity audits, performed either by ANSSI or a  service provider qualified by ANSSI (French Senate 2013).  Similar obligations can be found in Germany which has recently enacted the IT Security Act14. The newly  passed law obligates operators to implement adequate organisational and technical measures for  information security as far as it is necessary for the availability of their critical services. Furthermore  organizations are to conduct security audits, to establish a contact point within their organisation and to  report major IT security incidents if they could possibly affect the availability of their critical services (Federal  Office for Information Security 2015c).  13  http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=D18929C424710499FAE3092CB887BD8D.tpdjo09v_2?cidTex te=JORFTEXT000028338825&categorieLien=id  14 http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/040/1804096.pdf  http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=D18929C424710499FAE3092CB887BD8D.tpdjo09v_2?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000028338825&categorieLien=id http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=D18929C424710499FAE3092CB887BD8D.tpdjo09v_2?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000028338825&categorieLien=id http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/040/1804096.pdf  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  20  2.2 Key Findings  Based on information collected (interviews and online surveys), some key findings have been identified. The  key findings are presented along the different categories of the analytical framework. The total number of  analysed countries per category can vary between twelve and eighteen depending on the feedback we  received via the interviews and online survey.  Some of the key findings refer to critical sectors. Not all countries identify the same sectors as critical. The  table below gives an overview of the mapping of the critical sectors identified by each country. The table is  adapted from ENISA’s study “Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure  assets and services” from December 2014 (ENISA 2014).

National authorities fall within the following  categories:   EMR: Emergency or CIP agency   INT: Intelligence or security service   ISA: Information security agency   ISF: Information security forum   NRA: National regulator or agency   MIN: Ministry  Most of these categories are self-explanatory, however some remarks on the distinction between ISA and  ISF are necessary. Information security agencies are public agencies with a strong focus on the security of  information and telecommunications infrastructure. In many cases, they are the host of the national or  governmental CSIRT. They are usually either independent agencies or subdivisions of ministries with a high  degree of autonomy. Information security forums in comparison with ISAs, are set up as institutions where  different agencies can cooperate closely together. With this model, the responsibilities and competencies  of each existing agency largely remains intact. The ISF itself is usually not authorised to issue binding  instructions to operators of CII. ISFs are often developed in countries that follow the principle of subsidiarity  or decentralisation.  It should be noted that not all countries have developed a main or leading authority for CIIP. Especially  Member States that follow a principle of subsidiarity leave responsibility with the individual ministries and  operators of CII. In these cases we have identified the agency with the most responsibility or the strongest  involvement in CIIP. In some Member States, responsibility for CIIP is shared between two agencies. In these  cases, both agencies have been considered separately.  The following figure shows the number of the different types of governmental authorities for CIIP in 17 EU  Member States and one EFTA country.  Figure 2-1 – National Authorities  Countries examined have assigned responsibility for CIIP to various national authorities. However, the figure  shows that most countries tend to task their Information Security Authorities with CIIP. This seems to  indicate that CIIP is seen as closest related to the issue of information security. CIIP is also a subcategory of  general CIP, which might be the reason why five countries have decided to let their national EMR take  7  5 4  2 2 2  0  2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16  18  ISA EMR NRA ISF INT MIN  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  22  responsibility for it. CIIP also requires strong knowledge of information technology and the “landscape of  private operators”. Usually, NRAs combine these two traits, which could be the reason why four countries  have assigned CIIP to them. Only a small minority of countries has assigned INT with the responsibility for  CIIP. In two cases Ministries are complementing the tasks of another national authority.  2.2.2 Responsibilities of National Authorities  We examined the responsibilities and tasks assigned to national authorities in the area of CIIP for 12  countries (11 EU MS and one EFTA country):  Figure 2-2 – Responsibilities of National Authorities  The figure shows that the majority of tasks are on the operational level (dark blue). Only seven to eight  countries have additional responsibilities on a strategical or political level, such as the development of  strategies, proposing legislations or the supervision of the national CSIRT (light blue). Only one third of the  examined countries has been tasked with the supervision of institutions other than CSIRTs (red). These  include mainly regulatory tasks.  2.2.3 Forms of Cooperation between Public and Private Stakeholders  The Member States examined have developed different forms of cooperation with the private sector with  varying degrees of institutionalisation. Public-Private partnerships are an institutionalised form of  cooperation between public and private actors. They are usually characterised through a long-term  commitment of the different stakeholders, a contractual agreement or a joint statement, which defines the  goals and responsibilities of the partnership, and shared responsibility for the produced output. A less  institutionalised form of cooperation are working groups and contact forums, which are often temporary  and demand less resources and commitment from the different stakeholders.  The following figure shows how many countries have developed different forms of cooperation with private  stakeholders. Eighteen countries (seventeen Member States and one EFTA country) have been examined in  total:  4  7  7  7  8  8  10  11  11  12  0 5 10  Supervision of other institutions  Monitoring the implementation of security measures  Supervision of national CSIRT  Issuing guidelines or proposing legislations  Monitoring the security of national CII  Development of strategy or policy papers  Incident response  Advisory to operators of CII (private and public sector)  Organise and conduct CIIP-related exercises and training  Point of contact for incident reporting  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  23  Figure 2-3 – Forms of Cooperation between Public and Private Stakeholders  Ten of the eighteen examined countries have established formal Public-Private Partnerships for the purpose  of CIIP. Six countries are relying on less institutionalised forms of cooperation such as working groups or  networks. Some of these countries are currently in the process of developing PPPs as required by their cyber  security strategies. Two countries communicated with private stakeholders via informal ways.  2.2.4 Institutionalised Forms of Cooperation between Public Agencies  All of the sixteen examined countries have established some form of institutionalised cooperation between  public agencies for the purpose of CIP beyond the usual communication channels. The institutional settings  range from advisory boards, steering groups, forums, councils, cyber centres or expert meeting groups.  However, the purpose is always to share information and to coordinate the actions of the different agencies.  The majority of countries have developed new kinds of cooperation mechanism for the specific purpose of  CIP. Some countries have instead extended the scope of existing institutions, which are responsible for  emergency management or the security of the supply of infrastructure and services.  2.2.5 Risk Assessment  Risk Assessment includes the identification of threats, potential consequences of these threats (impact) and  their likelihood. In some countries, a national risk assessment is conducted by a national authority across all  relevant sectors. Other countries, especially those with a more decentralised approach in CIIP, leave risk  assessment the sector-specific authorities or to the operators of CI.  The following figure shows how many countries are conducting what kind of risk assessment, or a leaving  risk assessment to the individual operators.  106  2  PPP Working groups (or similar) Informal  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  24  Figure 2-4 – Risk Assessment  The majority of the sixteen examined countries (fifteen Member States and one EFTA country) have  conducted risk assessments on a national level or are planning to do so in the future. In four countries, risk  assessment is conducted by the sector-specific agencies or ministries. In five countries, no national or  sectorial risk assessment is being conducted. Instead, risk assessment is seen as the responsibility of private  operators. However, this does not necessarily mean that governments are obligating operators to conduct  risk assessments. This can be seen as an indicator on which level a government believes the problem should  be best tackled: On the national level, the sectorial or the operator level.  2.2.6 Cyber Security Exercises  All of the examined countries are conducting regular CIIP-related exercises. There a three different kinds of  CIIP-related exercises:   Sector-specific exercises   Cross-sectorial exercises   International exercises  Most sector-specific and cross-sectorial exercises are being conducted in the financial, energy and the  telecommunications sector. Other important sectors are public administrations, transport and logistics and  healthcare.  The international exercises which were most commonly visited were NATO’s exercises Locked Shields and  Cyber Coalition and exercises of ENISA’s Cyber Europe program. Other international exercise of importance  were Cyberstorm IV (International Watch and Warning Network (IWWN)), ENISA’s table top exercise Cyber  Atlantic, NATO’s Crisis Management Exercise CMX and the Nordic Cyber Security Exercise.  2.2.7 National Computer Security Incident Response Team  CSIRTs can be distinguished by their constituencies. Governmental CSIRTs usually offer their services to the  public administration and agencies. National CSIRTs have a wider scope, because their constituency consists  of operators of critical infrastructure and sometimes individual citizens. However, in some cases  responsibilities between both types of CSIRTs might exist.  4  3  4  5  National National (under development) Sectorial Operators  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  25  Figure 2-5 – National Computer Security Incident Response Team  Fourteen of the examined countries have established National CSIRTs. In two of these cases, the national  CSIRT also serves as the Governmental CSIRT. Four countries have not developed dedicated national CSIRTs,  however, either a national CSIRT is under development or the responsibility is shared by a community of  private and sector-specific CSIRTs (as it is the case in Germany for example).  2.2.8 Security Incident Reporting  The majority of the examined countries have implemented mandatory incident reporting in the  telecommunications sector,15 but only a minority has implemented it across all sectors. The scope of  reporting schemes vary greatly. Some countries obligate operators of CII to report security incidents  regardless of the sector, as long as they have been assessed to be critical. Other countries have implemented  mandatory reporting only for specific sectors.  The following figure shows the scope of mandatory security incident reporting across the examined  countries (Sixteen Member States and one EFTA country):  Figure 2-6 – Security Incident Reporting  15 All Member States have implemented mandatory incident reporting in the telecommunications sector to be in line  with the article 13a requirements. Moreover, Sweden intends to introduce mandatory incident reporting for the  public institutions  12  4  Established Not Established  5  10  2  -1  1  3  5  7  9  11  13  15  17  All sectors Limited to specific sectors  None  Most common  sectors are:  Telecommunication  Finance  Energy  Public Administration  Military  Healthcare  Transport  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  26  Five countries have established mandatory security incident reporting across all sectors, with Germany being  the most recent one. Most EU Member States have only developed mandatory incident reporting for some  sectors. All of the ten countries that are limiting incident reporting to specific sectors, have established such  obligations for the telecommunications sector. Other important sectors are Finance, Public Administration  and Energy. Only two countries have not established mandatory reporting in any sector. The Netherlands  are currently preparing a new law which will include obligatory incident reporting. The details of the law  (e.g. the installation of enforcement mechanisms) depend on the content of the final NIS-Directive.  2.2.9 Security Measures  A similar picture can be observed for mandatory security measures.16 The same five Member States that  have implemented mandatory incident reporting across all sectors, have also implemented mandatory  security measures across all sectors.  Figure 2-7 – Security Measures  Before CIIP became an important part of the political agenda, most countries had already established  mandatory security measures in some sectors. Specifically sectors, which were already strongly relying on  information technology or were providing crucial services to the population (for example the  telecommunications, energy or finance sector). This explains why most countries have only implemented  mandatory security measures in specific sectors. Countries with no mandatory security measures, usually  consider security as the responsibility of private companies. However, there seems to be a slight tendency  of countries to establish more comprehensive legislation for CIIP that covers all critical sectors.  2.2.10 Security Audits  Security audits seems to be either of the lowest priority or the hardest to implement for EU countries: Six  countries have not implemented mandatory security audits and only five are obligating operators across all  sectors to undergo audits.  16 Article 13a also implies mandatory security measures for the telecommunications sector.  5  10  2  -1  1  3  5  7  9  11  13  15  17  All sectors Limited to specific sectors  None  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  27  Figure 2-8 – Security Audits  The same five countries that have implemented mandatory security measures, have also implemented  mandatory security audits. The analyses indicates that security audits are either of less a priority or harder  to implement for the Member States’ governments.  2.2.11 Incentives to Invest  In theory, countries can give an impetus to operators of CII to invest in security by creating incentives, such  as subsidies or tax benefits. In areas such as environmental and ecological issues, tax benefits have proven  to be successful in creating incentives for companies to implement environmental standards. However,  almost none of the examined Member States have such incentives for CIIP-security in place. Some countries  believe that market pressure will, in the long run, give operators of CII enough incentive to invest in  additional security measures. An exception is Finland, where companies that invest in operational security  measures are eligible for tax breaks under certain conditions.  5 6 6  -1  1  3  5  7  9  11  13  15  17  All sectors Limited to specific sectors  None  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  28  2.3 CIIP Governance Profiles  This chapter describes three profiles of CIIP governance among the examined sixteen EU Member States.  CIIP governance refers to all structures and processes associated with the steering in the area of CIIP  undertaken by public (e.g. public administration or law enforcement agencies) or private actors (e.g.  associations, operators of CII, sectorial CSIRTs). It can refer to the decision-making processes, but also the  operational measures in the protection of CII.  The different profiles illustrate specific forms of CIIP governance, which are defined by their shared  characteristics. The profiles are not exclusive types, but are rather points on a spectrum. For example, the  centralism of CIIP-governance displayed by a country will vary and while some countries can be described as  either centralised or decentralised, others fall in between these two points. The same is true for the degree  of private-sector involvement. In the following section examples of Member States that fit a profile or the  defining characteristics of it are presented.  These profiles can help to understand how CIIP is organised in the individual Member States and what CIIP- measures and actions can possibly be transferred from one Member State to another. Some measures  undertaken by Member States with a centralised approach in CIIP might not work in countries that follow a  decentralised approach (and vice versa), because of different responsibilities, processes and relations  between relevant stakeholders. Likewise, measures undertaken by Member States with a high degree of  private sector participation might not be transferable to states in which CIIP is primarily steered by  emergency or law enforcement agencies (and vice versa). However, Member States with similar  characteristics in CIIP-governance might be better suited for the exchange of good practices and effective  CIIP-measures.  The governance of CIIP is a key feature in understanding how CIIP is organised in different Member States  and to what degree measures are transferable between them.  2.3.1 Profile 1: Decentralised Approach  The decentralised approach is characterised by:   Principle of subsidiarity   Strong cooperation between public agencies   Sector-specific legislation  Sector-Responsibility  Instead of establishing a strong CIIP-agency with responsibility across all or several critical sectors, the  decentralised approach follows the principle of subsidiarity. This means that the responsibility for CIIP is  either in the hands of the sector-specific authority or the companies and operators of the CII themselves.  Therefore, many Member States that fit this profile are lacking a centralised authority for the purpose of  CIIP, but have placed the responsibility for CIIP on the sector-specific authorities.  Strong Cooperation between Public Agencies  Because of the variety of public agencies involved in CIIP, many Member States have developed cooperation  schemes in order to coordinate the work and efforts of the different stakeholders. These cooperation  schemes can take the form of informal networks or more institutionalised forums or councils. However,  these cooperation schemes only serve the purpose of information exchange and coordination between the  different public agencies, but have no authority over them.  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  29  Sector-specific Legislation  The countries that follow the decentralised approach often refrain from drafting legislation for the purpose  of CIIP across critical sectors. Instead, the adoption of laws and regulations remains sector-specific and  therefore can vary greatly between sectors.  Figure 2-9 – Decentralised Approach  Examples for the Decentralised Approach  Sweden is a good example for a country that follows a decentralised approach in CIIP. The country uses a  “system perspective”, which means that the main tasks of CIIP, such as the identification of vital services  and critical infrastructures, the coordination and support of operators, regulatory tasks as well as measures  for emergency preparedness are the responsibility of different agencies and municipalities. Among these  agencies are the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), the Swedish Post and Telecom Agency (PTS),  and several Swedish Defence, Military and law enforcement agencies (2015c).  In order to coordinate the actions between the different agencies and public entities, the Swedish  government has developed a cooperative network comprised of authorities “with specific societal  information security responsibilities”. This Cooperation Group for Information Security (SAMFI), consists of  representatives of the different authorities and meets several times a year to discuss issues related to  national information security. SAMFI’s subject areas are mainly to be found in political-strategic areas and  cover topics such as technical issues and standardization, national and international development in the field  of information security, or management and prevention of IT incidents (Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency  (MSB) 2015).  Sweden has not published a central law for CIIP applicable for operators of CII across sectors. Instead, issuing  legislation with obligations for companies within specific sectors is the responsibility of the respective public  authorities. For example, the MSB has the right to issue regulations for government authorities in the area  of information security, while the PTS can obligate operators to implement certain technical or  organisational security measures based on secondary legislation.  Another example for a country that display characteristics of this profile is Ireland. Ireland follows a “doctrine  of subsidiarity”, where each Ministry is responsible for the identification of CII and risk assessment within its  own sector. Furthermore, no specific regulations for CIIP at the national level have been enacted. Legislation  remains sectorial and exists mainly for the energy and telecommunications sector (2015f). Other examples  are Austria, Cyprus, Finland and Switzerland.  Public  Agency  Public  Agency  Sector Sector  Council  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  30  2.3.2 Profile 2: Centralised Approach  The centralised approach is characterised by:   Central authority across sectors   Comprehensive legislation  Central Authority across Sectors  Member States that follow a centralised approach have developed authorities with responsibilities and wide  competencies across several or all critical sectors, or have extended the powers of existing authorities. These  main authorities for CIIP combine several tasks such as contingency planning, emergency management,  regulatory tasks and supporting private operators. In many cases, the national or governmental CSIRT is part  of the main CIIP-authority.  Comprehensive Legislation  A comprehensive legislation creates obligations and requirements for all operators of CII across all sectors.  This can be achieved through new comprehensive laws, or through complementing existing sector-specific  regulations.  Figure 2-10 – Centralised Approach  Examples for the Centralised Approach  France is a good example for an EU Member State with a centralised approach. France’s ANSSI has been  declared the main national authority for the defence of the information systems in 2011. ANSSI has a strong  supervisory role for “operators of vital importance” (OIVs): The agency can order OIVs to comply with  security measures and is authorised to perform security audits on them. Furthermore, it is the main Single  Point of Contact for OIVs, which are obligated to report security incident to the agency (2015g).  In cases of security incidents, ANSSI acts as a contingency agency for CIIP and decides on the measures that  operators must take to respond to the crisis. The government’s actions are coordinated within ANSSI’s  Public  Agency  Public  Agency  Public  Agency  Sector Sector Sector  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  31  operations centre. Detection of threats and incident response on an operational level is performed by CERT- FR, which is part of ANSSI.  France has established a comprehensive legal framework for CIIP. In 2006, the Prime Minister ordered to  establish a list of sectors of critical infrastructure. Based on this list, which identified twelve vital sectors, the  government has defined around 250 OIVs. In 2013, the Military Programming Law (LPM) was promulgated,  which sets different obligations for OIVs, such as incident reporting or implementation of security measures.  These requirements are mandatory for all OIVs across all sectors (French Senate 2013).  Among the analysed EU Member States, the centralised approach is the exception. Most countries are  following a cooperative, decentralised approach. However, France is not the only country, which displays  characteristics of a centralised approach. Other examples of countries with characteristics of the centralised  approach are the Czech Republic (central authority) and Germany (comprehensive legislation).  2.3.3 Profile 3: Co-Regulation with the Private Sector  The co-regulation approach is characterised by:   Institutionalised cooperation with the private sector   Horizontal relationship between public and private parties  Institutionalised Cooperation with the Private Sector  A typical form of institutionalised cooperation between the public and private sector are public-private  partnerships (PPPs) which are usually based on contractual agreement between the parties. Public and  private actors can provide different resources to the partnerships: For example, the government can offer  political legitimacy and funds, while private actors can add special expertise and efficiency. Through PPPs,  governments have the possibility for regulation in areas where it is lacking expertise.  Horizontal Relationship between Public and Private Parties  Although not exclusively, PPPs are often characterised by a horizontal relationship between the public and  private parties, meaning that both are on equal footing and make joint decisions. The decision making  process is based on negotiations rather than hierarchical command structures.17  In some cases, this kind of relationship is also reflected in a compliance structure which is not based on a  strong regulatory framework and enforcement mechanisms but is based on voluntary action and trust.  17 For a good practice guide on Cooperative Models for Effective PPPs see:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/national-public-private- partnerships-ppps/good-practice-guide-on-cooperatve-models-for-effective-ppps  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/national-public-private-partnerships-ppps/good-practice-guide-on-cooperatve-models-for-effective-ppps https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/national-public-private-partnerships-ppps/good-practice-guide-on-cooperatve-models-for-effective-ppps  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  32  Figure 2-11 – Corregulation  Examples for Co-Regulation with the Private Sector  An example for co-regulation in the area of CIIP can be found in the Netherlands. The major CIP agency is  the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). It is set up as a central information hub and a centre of expertise  for cyber security within the National Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism (NCTV). The NCSC  consists of several partnerships between public and private actors, such as various Information Sharing and  Analysis Centres (ISACs) and the ICT Response Board which analyses the situation during a large-scale IT crisis  or threat. The NCSC emphasises that cooperation with private stakeholders is based on equality and trust  (National Cyber Security Centre 2015b).  In addition, the Dutch Cyber Security Council offers advice on a strategic and political level. The council is  comprised of representatives from different Ministries, academia and the private sector and has a strong  public-private character.  Participation in the various Information Sharing and Analysis Centres is based on confidentiality, meaning  that members are not forced or obligated to share information with the other participants but do so on a  voluntary basis. All representatives are expected to respect the mutual agreement and treat information on  threats, risks and other sensitive issues in a confidential manner.  Legal obligations and requirements in the Netherlands tend to be stronger for the telecommunications and  nuclear sector. However, Dutch companies are not obliged to report security incidents and a lot of incident  notification is done voluntarily (2015h).  Public  Agency  Sector  PPP Private  Actors  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  33  3. Recommendations  Based on the key findings of this study, ENISA presents the following recommendations for the European  Member States and the European Commission.  3.1 Member States  Recommendation 1: Increase institutionalised cooperation with private stakeholders  EU Member States have established different kinds of cooperation with private stakeholders. These  primarily include the private operators of CII, but also private associations, sectorial CSIRTs or academia.  Some countries are relying on public-private partnerships while others are cooperating with the private  actors in less formalised, temporary working groups and similar formats.  Threats to CII are likely to increase in the coming years and therefore the necessity for cooperation with  private stakeholders will increase as well. Member States should establish institutionalised and long-term  partnerships or equivalent cooperation schemes with private stakeholders for different tasks such as  detection, response and analysis of threats to CII. Existing working groups or forums can provide a good  starting point to develop stronger cooperation.  Related to this is the development of a strong CSIRT-community. Member States should foster the  cooperation between government and sectorial CSIRTs in order to distribute tasks and responsibilities and  gain from increased knowledge and a more efficient use of existing resources.  Recommendation 2: Align management structure for CIIP with existing national crisis and  emergency management structures  Most Member States have general management structures for emergencies or incidents on a national level  in place. The issue of CIIP should be integrated into the existing management structures. Alternatively, CIIP- management structures should be aligned and made compatible with existing management structures. This  includes the definition of roles and responsibilities of the different public agencies in cases of emergency,  but also in day-to-day operations.  Recommendation 3: Participate in or host international exercises  Threats to CI are not bound by national borders and often transcend them. This means that Member States  and private actors often need to cooperate with their counterparts in other Member States or countries  beyond the European Union. In order to strengthen international cooperation, Member States should  maintain participation in international CIIP-related exercises and consider hosting equivalent exercises in  their home country.  Recommendation 4: Establish mandatory security incident reporting  In order to gain an overview of the national risk situation and on potential threat scenarios, the state is  dependent on the input from operators of CII. Only with comprehensive data are governments able to gain  knowledge on current dangers to CII. This data constitutes the basis for a national risk assessment (see  Recommendation 5) and for the development and adjustment of strategies, policies, the drafting of  legislation and the allocation of resources.  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  34  For this purpose, Member States should establish mandatory security incident reporting for all operators of  CII. ENISA could play a significant role in this process by providing support in the execution of aligned  reporting schemes at EU level. With the help of ENISA a consistent implementation of incident reporting  would make it easier for providers and users to operate across the different Member States. Monitoring of  IT-infrastructure can be conducted by the operators themselves or, in cases of smaller operators with limited  financial resources, by third parties. If needed, operators should be supported in the development of the  capacities for monitoring and incident reporting by public agencies.  Mandatory security incident reporting should also include obligations for public agencies to report back to  the affected operators and inform about security threats and other CIIP-related issues. This will create  additional incentives for operators to cooperate with the government on incident reporting and ensure that  vulnerable operators are informed quickly about potential threats.  Operators of CI are often reluctant to report incidents to public agencies because they fear that public  disclosure of these incidents will damage their companies’ reputation. A means of increasing trust between  the government and private operators could be the installation of “clearing houses”. These institutions could  receive incidents reports and other threat-related information from operators and anonymise them, before  forwarding them to the responsible public agencies.  Recommendation 5: Conduct national risk assessment  Member States currently conduct risk assessments on different levels. Some governments believe that the  risk assessments should be conducted by the individual operators, since they have the best knowledge of  their processes and structures. However, the results of the identification and assessment of risks conducted  by a national government and a private company can differ. National governments are responsible to ensure  that the population has access to all necessary services and goods. A private companies’ focus is limited to  its own business and the interests of their stakeholders.  Because of these different perspectives, the government should conduct risk assessments from a national  perspective, which identifies and assesses risks and impacts for a nation’s general population. Furthermore,  Governments should adopt an open, transparent and collaborative approach to national risk assessment,  involving all relevant stakeholders.  Recommendation 6: Utilize best legal framework practices for CIIP across critical sectors  Some sectors, like the financial or the energy sector, are stronger regulated than others. This means that  obligations and requirements can vary greatly across the sectors and thus for the different operators of CI.  Furthermore, mandatory security measures are not always compatible with certain companies or sectors.  Member States should evaluate and asses their legal frameworks for CIIP in different critical sectors. This  will ensure that all operators of CII are facing applicable risk based obligations and will contribute to the  alignment of security standards across sectors.  Recommendation 7: Examine if positive incentives can be provided to operators of CII to invest  in security measures  Almost none of the examined Member States in this study have implemented incentives to invest in CIIP- related security measures for operators of CII. Incentives like tax breaks or financial subsidies have been  used by some governments in other policy areas as a “soft” steering tool. The goal is to refrain from laws or  regulations, but to encourage companies through positive incentives to implement certain policies. This  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  35  strategy has been used successfully in other areas such as environmental issues. Such incentives should not  be limited to the capital expenditures of security measures, but also include the operational expenditures of  processes and continuing operations.  Other possible forms of positive incentives include supporting measures by government institutions, such as  post-incident support. Public agencies could help operators with forensic investigations and recovery  measures.  3.2 European Commission  Recommendation 8: Ensure that MS collectively agree baseline requirements in order to support  the development of CIIP in MS  The European Commission should require the MS to collectively define baseline requirements for an  adequate level of national CIIP-capabilities. These baseline requirements can serve as a guideline for the EU  Member States that are in the process of developing or extending CIIP. The baseline requirements should  be comprehensive and cover all relevant action areas: Policy, governance structure, legislation, risk  management and mitigation measures, emergency preparedness, threat intelligence and information  sharing. The baseline requirements should be generic and contain objectives and controls. Ideally, they can  be used to evaluate the maturity level of CIIP in EU Member States and help to identify gaps.  The Network and Information Security Directive, proposed by the Commission in 2013, is expected to fill this  gap. It is currently in the final stages of negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council and  will lay down different measures to ensure a high common level of network and information security within  Member States (European Commission 2013b).  The EU Commission should actively promote the different measures outlined in the NIS Directive and  support implementation efforts.  Recommendation 9: Develop and conduct a maturity assessment of Member States’ CIIP  readiness  The European Commission should develop a method for maturity assessment of Member States’ critical  information infrastructure protection and conduct those assessment on a regular basis.  The defined baseline requirements (see recommendation 8) can serve as a basis for the development of key  process areas and defined goals. Development of such a model will allow the EU Commission to assess the  national CIIP measures of the individual EU Member States and compare them with each other.  Based on these results, the EU Commission can make individual recommendations to EU Member States on  how to improve national CIIP.  Recommendation 10: Support information sharing and the exchange of knowledge between EU  Member States’ national CSIRTs  The EU Commission should foster information sharing and the exchange of knowledge between EU Member  States’ national CSIRTs. If a CII-related incident occurs in a certain country, other CSIRTs should be notified  about the risk and possible incident solutions in order to take appropriate operational preparations.  Permanent forums and working groups, as well as technical platforms and interfaces for threat information  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  36  sharing should be developed. Since threats to CII often transcend national borders, information sharing  platforms can also serve to coordinate actions of the different national CSIRTs.  Similar EU-wide information sharing networks for national CIIP-authorities as well as private operators  should be considered.  Recommendation 11: Identify European Critical Information Infrastructure  A part of EU Information Infrastructure is potentially critical, such as the information and communications  systems of the institutions and agencies of the European Union or assets such as the global navigation  satellite system Galileo, which is currently under development.  The EU should identify EU Critical Information Infrastructure and take appropriate security measures. CIIP- measures of EU assets can also be delegated to hosting Member States.

Many critical sectors operating in the  European Member States such as the energy, transportation or financial sectors rely on critical information  infrastructure (CII). The Threats to CII, which stem from different sources ranging from national actors to  criminal hackers, have increased in recent years. In order to fully meet the emerging threats to CII, ENISA  offers assistance to EU Member States and the EU Commission.  This study contributes to the improvement of the protection of critical infrastructure in Member States by  taking stock of and analysing existing measures deployed in the field across several EU Member States. The  goal is to provide a set of good practices and recommendations to national authorities and lawmakers which  will contribute to stronger and more resilient CII in EU Member States and decrease the risk of disruption or  failure of critical infrastructure.  The introduction identifies six action areas for Member States, which contribute to an effective national  protection of CII (CIIP). These action areas include comprehensive policies and legislations, but also effective  national governance structures during day-to-day operations and in cases of emergency. Information sharing  between the private and the public sector and threat intelligence constitute important elements in CIIP,  since critical information infrastructure is mainly owned by the private sector.  This study presents some key findings, uncovers the different governance structures for CIIP in seventeen  EU Member States and one EFTA country along with different good practices. In addition, it presents general  findings, based on collected information via interviews and online surveys:   Surveyed EU Member States have delegated responsibility to cyber security authorities, emergency  agencies or national regulators. Only a minority of the examined Member States have tasked intelligence  agencies or information security forums with CIIP   Almost all national authorities for CIIP are responsible for operational tasks (for example: PoC for  incident reporting, organising exercises, incident response). Two thirds of the authorities are responsible  for additional tasks on the strategic or political level, such as the development of strategy papers,  supervision of the national CSIRT or the proposing legislation.   Cooperation with the private sector tends to be high, but only around 56 Percent of the examined  Member States have established institutionalised forms of cooperation in forms of public-private  partnerships   Legalisation and corresponding obligations for CII-operators vary across sectors. The critical sectors  with the strongest regulations across all analysed Member States are the Telecommunications, Finance  and Energy sectors   The majority of countries have conducted a risk assessment on a national level (or are planning to do  so). Other countries have decided that risk assessment is the responsibility of sector-specific agencies or  of the individual operators.   Three profiles of CIIP-governance have been identified: A centralised, a decentralised and a co- regulation approach.  Finally, the study makes general recommendations to EU Member States and the EU Commission on how to  improve CIIP in the European Union. The recommendations are the following:  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  06  Member States   Recommendation 1: Increase institutionalised cooperation with private stakeholders   Recommendation 2: Align management structure for CIIP with existing national crisis and emergency  management structures   Recommendation 3: Participate in or host international exercises   Recommendation 4: Establish mandatory security incident reporting   Recommendation 5: Conduct national risk assessment   Recommendation 6: Utilize best legal framework practices for CIIP across critical sectors   Recommendation 7: Examine if positive incentives can be provided to operators of CII to invest in  security measures  European Commission   Recommendation 8: Define baseline requirements in order to support the development of CIIP in MS   Recommendation 9: Develop and conduct a maturity assessment of Member States’ CIIP readiness   Recommendation 10: Support information sharing and the exchange of knowledge between EU  Member States’ national CSIRTs   Recommendation 11: Identify European Critical Information Infrastructure  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  07  List of Figures  Figure 1-1 – CIP/CIIP/Cybersecurity 11  Figure 1-2 – Action Areas of CIIP 12  Table 1 – Critical Sectors per Country 20  Figure 2-1 – National Authorities 21  Figure 2-2 – Responsibilities of National Authorities 22  Figure 2-3 – Forms of Cooperation between Public and Private Stakeholders 23  Figure 2-4 – Risk Assessment 24  Figure 2-5 – National Computer Security Incident Response Team 25  Figure 2-6 – Security Incident Reporting 25  Figure 2-7 – Security Measures 26  Figure 2-8 – Security Audits 27  Figure 2-9 – Decentralised Approach 29  Figure 2-10 – Centralised Approach 30  Figure 2-11 – Corregulation 32  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  08  List of Abbreviations  ABBREVATION DESCRIPTION  ANSSI Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d'information (France)  CERT Computer Emergency Response Team  CII Critical Information Infrastructures  CIIP Critical Information Infrastructure Protection  CIP Critical Infrastructure Protection  CIWIN Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network  Crisis Act Act no. 240/2000 Coll., on Crisis Management  CSIRT Computer Security Incident Response Team  ECI European Critical Infrastructure  EFTA European Free Trade Association  ENISA European Network and Information Security Agency  EPCIP European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection  EU European Union  ICS Industrial Control Systems  ICT Information and Communication Technology  ISAC Information Sharing and Analysis Centre  IWWN International Watch and Warning Network  LPM Military Programming Law (France)  MS Member States (EU)  MSB Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (Sweden)  NASK The Research and Academic Computer Network (Poland)  NCSC National Cyber Security Centre (Netherlands)  NCTV National Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism (Netherlands)  NIS Network and Information Security  OIV Operators of vital importance (France)  PoC Point of Contact  PPPs Public-private partnerships  PTS Swedish Post and Telecom Agency  SAMFI Cooperation Group for Information Security (Sweden)  SCADA Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  09  1. Introduction  Overview  The internet and other digital technologies as well as its underlying network and information systems are  the backbone of the European Society and the Digital Single Market. Millions of EU citizens and many  businesses rely on the information and communication infrastructure for a variety of services. These range  from energy and telecommunications to e-government, healthcare, and logistics. That is why disruption or  failure of this “critical infrastructure” can have dire consequences, ranging from the loss of money and  reputation for companies to the disruption of the provision of goods and essential services to the general  population.  In order to fully meet the emerging threats to critical information infrastructures (CII), ENISA offers  assistance to EU Member States and the EU Commission. The agency helps to understand the current threat  landscape with regard to CII, Smart Grids and ICS-SCADA (Industrial Control Systems-Supervisory Control and  Data Acquisition) among others. Furthermore, Cyber Europe has become an important multi-national and  multi-stakeholder cyber exercises for EU Member States. Many Member States in the European Union have  started to develop and implement different measures for the protection of critical information infrastructure  in their country. These measures range from the establishment of national coordinating bodies to the  development of national emergency plans or the adoption of specific legal frameworks. ENISA has supported  these efforts in the past by defining good practices in areas like cyber security strategies and national  contingency plans or by analysing different methods for the identification of critical infrastructure123.  This study contributes to the improvement of the protection of critical infrastructure in Member States by  taking stock of and analysing existing measures in this field across several EU Member States. The goal is to  provide a set of good practices and recommendations to national authorities, lawmakers and the European  Commission which will contribute to a stronger and resilient CII in EU Member States and decrease the risk  of disruption or failure of critical infrastructure.  Policy context  The EU aims to support its Member States in the protection of critical infrastructure. In order to align efforts  and foster cooperation, the EU has adopted specific programmes and directives:  The protection of critical infrastructure was first put on the agenda in June 2004, when the European Council  asked for the preparation of an overall strategy. At that time, the main concern was the protection against  terrorist attacks. In November 2005, the Commission adopted a Green Paper on a European Programme for  Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP) (European Commission 2005). On request of the Justice and Home  Affairs Council in December 2005, the EU Commission made a proposal for an EPCIP (European Commission  2006): Purpose of the EPCIP is the improvement of the protection of critical infrastructure in the EU against  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber- security-strategies-an-implementation-guide  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cce/cyber_exercises/national- exercise-good-practice-guide  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/Methodologies-for- identification-of-ciis  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  10  different types of threats (all-hazard approach). The legislative framework of the EPCIP consists of measures  designed to facilitate the implementation of EPCIP. This includes an EPCIP action plan, the Critical  Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CIWIN), the setting up of Critical Infrastructure Protection  (CIP) expert groups at EU level, CIP information sharing processes, and the identification and analysis of  interdependencies. A key component is the procedure for identifying and designating European Critical  Infrastructure (ECI). This has been implemented by means of the 2008 Directive on European Critical  Infrastructures (Council of the European Union 2008)4, which however only applies to the energy and  transport sectors. An updated approach to the EU CIP policy is currently under development and preliminary  results have been summarised in the 2013 Staff Working Document5 on a new approach to the European  Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (European Commission 2013a).  In order to strengthen the critical infrastructure against the various threats and to uphold the trust of the  EU citizens, the European Commission has proposed the Network and Information Security Directive (NIS  Directive) in 2013 (European Commission 2013b). The NIS Directive is currently in negotiations between the  European Parliament and the Council. The aim is to improve the EU Member States’ national cybersecurity  capabilities, enhancing the cooperation between the Member States, the public and the private sector while  also requiring companies in critical sectors to report major incidents to national authorities and to adopt risk  management practices.  A legal framework for attacks against information systems has been set by the Council Framework Decision  2005 (Council of the European Union 2005) and its replacement Directive 2013/40/EU (European Parliament,  Council of the European Union 2013)6. The objectives of this frameworks are to approximate the criminal  law of the EU Member States in this area. For this purpose the Directives establish definitions of criminal  offenses and sanctions. Furthermore, cooperation between law enforcement agencies and EU Agencies and  bodies such as Eurojust, Europol and its European Cyber Crime Centre, and ENISA shall contribute to this  improvement through measures such as the exchange of information.  Scope of the document  This study focuses on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP), rather than Critical Infrastructure  Protection (CIP). Both terms are often used interchangeably, which creates difficulties for researchers and  policy makers to clearly distinguish between them. In general, CIIP can be seen as an essential part of the  comprehensive efforts for CIP. While CIP covers the protection of a nation’s infrastructure across various  sectors, CIIP focusses on the protection of the underlying information infrastructure. CII is comprised of a  physical component (networks, wires, satellites, computers etc.) and an immaterial component, which is the  actual information transported by and through the physical components.  CIIP is also an integral part of many cyber and information security strategies. Cybersecurity covers a broad  spectrum of ICT-related security issues, of which the protection the CII is an integral part (Myriam Dunn  Cavelty 2012).  4 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32008L0114&from=EN  5 http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/pdf/policies/crisis_and_terrorism/epcip_swd_2012_190_final.pdf  6 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32013L0040&from=EN  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32008L0114&from=EN  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  11  Figure 1-1 – CIP/CIIP/Cybersecurity. Adapted from: Dunn Cavelty, The Art of CIIP Strategy 2012. p. 207  Because of the conceptual overlap between CIP, CIIP and cyber/information security, data gathering and  analysis of policies and documents was conducted in all areas.  In order to analyse CIIP, this study makes use of a holistic understanding of CIIP that includes different  aspects. CIIP in a national context is understood as an interplay of different areas of action that contribute  to an effective national CIIP. These action areas are:   Policy   Governance structure   Legislation   Risk management and mitigation measures   Emergency preparedness   Threat intelligence and information sharing  Policy means the development of strategic, policy or other white papers that outline strategic priorities, focal  points, goals, measures and defined roles and responsibilities of public and private stakeholders.  The Governance structure refers to the implementation of the defined roles and responsibilities in the area  of CIIP. This includes the development of public agencies with responsibility for CIIP or the extension of  existing authorities. It also includes the establishment of communication channels and cooperation  mechanisms between public and private agencies.  Legal obligations and requirements are an important tool for Member States to ensure that public and  private operators of CII adhere to a certain security standard. These can include mandatory security  standards, incident reports or audits.  Emergency preparedness refers to different measures to ensure appropriate incident handling in case of  national information security incidents. Regular exercises for CIIP, national risk assessments and national  incident management systems are all part of appropriate emergency preparedness. Computer Emergency  Response Teams are an essential pillar of CIIP on an operational level and offer expertise and advise to  operators of CII.  7 In the study we are trying to understand how CIIP is conceived on a national level. Nevertheless, critical information  infrastructures are not only national infrastructures.  National  Information  Infrastructures  Critical  Information  Infrastructures  Critical Infrastructures  CybersecurityCIIPCIP  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  12  Threat intelligence and information sharing is carried out by the respective national authorities and the asset  owners and refers to the monitoring of the threat landscape with regards to the cyber threats and threats  to CI. Information about threats have to be disseminated to the relevant stakeholders such as operators of  CII.  All action areas contribute to strong national CIIP.  The goal of this study is twofold: The first step is to take stock of existing practices and policies in the different  described areas of CIIP amongst Member States. The second step is to analyse the data with the goal of  identifying good practices and to create different profiles of the national CIIP measures. Based on the  analysis, a list of recommendations on how to improve national CIIP will be created. The overall goal is to  contribute to the improvement of CIIP amongst Member States and thus of the European Union.  Figure 1-2 – Action Areas of CIIP  Target audience  The target audience is governmental authorities, the European Commission and the CIIP community at large.  This document is specifically aimed at Member States that are at the beginning of CIIP structure  development or are looking to further improve existing structures. Decision makers in mandated national  agencies with responsibilities in the area of CIIP and lawmakers in charge of drafting legal frameworks with  the goal of protecting critical information infrastructure can benefit from the insights and results offered by  this study.  Structure of this document  This document is structured as follows:   Chapter 1 – Introduction and general overview  Policy  Governance structure  Legislation  Risk management and mitigation measures  Emergency  preparedness  Threat intelligence and information  sharing  CIIP  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  13   Chapter 2 – Describes the analytical framework and the process of data gathering   Chapter 3 – Presents the key findings: The governance of CIIP and good practices in EU MS   Chapter 4 – Identifies different CIIP profiles among the EU MS   Chapter 5 – Presents the lessons learnt and final recommendation of the study  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  14  Methodology  In accordance with the methodology named above, stock taking and information gathering has been  performed for seventeen different EU Member States and one EFTA country by the use of desk research,  online surveys and personal interviews. To facilitate comparison, the protection of CII has been analysed by  means of the following categories:   Framework for CIIP   Preparation for emergencies on a national level   Governmental authorities and other relevant actors   Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)   Legal obligations and requirements  “Framework for CIIP” includes research on national strategies or comparable policy papers for CIIP that have  been developed and put in place. It is assessed whether threats and risks to CII are outlined in an official  document and if strategic goals and objectives are set out on an official basis. In addition, a methodology for  the identification of CII should have been developed and applied and a framework for CIIP, i.e. through  regulations, guidelines, measures good practices etc., should have been established.  “Preparation for emergencies on a national level” examines if a risk assessment plan for CII-related security  incidents on a national level has been developed. It is also checked whether the roles and responsibilities of  various actors during a national crisis or security incident are defined and if regular trainings and exercises  for CIIP are carried out. To support information exchange on a national level, a multisource information  platform for CII awareness, crisis management and emergency response could be used.  “Governmental authorities and other relevant actors” evaluates if roles and responsibilities of governmental  agencies and the private sectors are defined. A governmental agency should have been designated to act as  the main national authority for CIIP, which includes authorisation to issue binding instructions to companies  and governmental authorities. In addition, it is assessed whether institutionalised forms of cooperation  between the public and private sector as well as between different authorities or institutions with a role in  CII protection have been established. Beyond this, awareness raising or similar training programmes related  to CIIP should also have been developed and put in place.  “Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)” determines if CIIP has been assigned to a national or  governmental CSIRT or if one has been set up for this purpose, as well as if the CSIRTs are under the  supervision of a national authority.  “Legal obligations and requirements” focuses on the operators of CII and analyses whether they are  obligated to notify an authority about security incidents as well as to implement appropriate technical and  organisational security measures. It is also evaluated if they are pledged to undergo an external security  audit and/or conformity or compliance tests and if incentives could be given to CII operators to invest in  security.  Key findings: The collected data will be analysed and interpreted. We will look for similarities and differences  in measures for CIIP. The focus will be on measures in the described action areas (see Figure 2).  Profile development: The focus here is on the governance structure of CIIP in the individual Member States.  We will analyse roles and responsibilities of public and private actors, as well as modes of governance and  steering in the issue area of CIIP.  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  15  Online Survey  ENISA developed an online survey to assess protection measures for CII in different EU Member States. The  survey consists of fifteen questions, which are to some extent dependant on one another. The survey covers  similar broader topics like the organisational structure of authorities or agencies, mechanisms for incident  reporting and investigation, national exercises for CIIP, cooperation mechanisms and obligations and  incentives. For the full survey form, refer to Appendix A.  The survey took place between May and July 2015. It was made available via an online platform provided by  EUSurvey, and has been answered by representatives of thirteen EU Member States.  Interview Questionnaire  ENISA has developed an interview questionnaire to assess protection measures for CII in different EU  Member States. The questionnaire contains seventeen questions which cover the five described categories.  For the full interview questionnaire, refer to Appendix B.  Interviews were conducted between May and August 2015. They took place in the form of personal  conversations or were answered in written form. In total, representatives of the national authorities for CIIP  of sixteen EU Member States were interviewed.  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  16  2. Key Findings  The key findings are the result of a detailed analysis made on the different governance structures for CIIP  in fifteen EU Member States and one EFTA country. The specific analysis can be found on a separate report  under the title: “CIIP Governance in the EU Member States”.  2.1 Good Practices  This chapter identifies exemplary good practices in CIIP among EU Member States in the areas of information  sharing schemes between public and private actors, CII emergency preparations, and obligations and  requirements for operators of CII.  Examples of Member States that have developed good practice in a certain area or field will be provided.  The list of examples is not exhaustive and should only serve as an inspiration for other EU Member States.  2.1.1 Partnership with Private Stakeholders  ICT structures across sectors are mostly owned by private companies, which means that cooperation of  public institutions with CII operators is essential in order to ensure the knowledge on current threats is up  to date and to ensure quick support in incident response, if needed.  The Netherlands are a good example for strong partnership with the private sector. The National Cyber  Security Centre (NCSC) serves as a focal point for a number of public-private partnerships. Within the NCSC,  several partnerships have been established for the purpose of Detection, Response and Analysis of threats.  In addition, the Cyber Security Council, made up of representatives from public and private parties, serves  as an independent advisory board. Thereby, the NSCS ensures a close partnership with private stakeholders  on a strategic and operational level (2015h).  Another example for close collaboration with the private sector is Austria. Austria has set up a Cyber Security  Platform, which is comprised of representatives of private and public operators of CII as well as relevant  public agencies. It aims to facilitate communications between its participants. On an operational level,  GovCERT has been set up as the main governmental CSIRT. It is run by the Federal Chancellery in cooperation  with CERT.at (a private initiative) (2015a).  2.1.2 Information Sharing Schemes  Many EU Member States have developed information sharing schemes in order to disseminate important  information between relevant public agencies and private operators. However, forms of cooperation can  differ between countries. Information sharing schemes ensure that all relevant stakeholders are informed  on current threats and risks and can take appropriate measures. It can also strengthen cooperation and  coordination of actions and thus foster the effective usage of resources.  Germany has established a number of wide-ranging information sharing schemes between public and  private sector agencies. Information sharing between law enforcement and intelligence agencies is realised  through the National Cyber Response Centre8, where the participants inform each other in daily meetings  and workshops. Information sharing with the private sector is fostered through UP KRITIS and the Alliance  for Cyber Security: UP KRITIS9 is a public-private partnership and its main task is to establish CIIP related  8 http://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/Themen/IT-Netzpolitik/IT- Cybersicherheit/Cybersicherheitsstrategie/Cyberabwehrzentrum/cyberabwehrzentrum_node.html  9 http://www.kritis.bund.de/SubSites/Kritis/EN/Home/home_node.html  http://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/Themen/IT-Netzpolitik/IT-Cybersicherheit/Cybersicherheitsstrategie/Cyberabwehrzentrum/cyberabwehrzentrum_node.html http://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/Themen/IT-Netzpolitik/IT-Cybersicherheit/Cybersicherheitsstrategie/Cyberabwehrzentrum/cyberabwehrzentrum_node.html http://www.kritis.bund.de/SubSites/Kritis/EN/Home/home_node.html  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  17  communication and cooperation between the private and public stakeholders on strategic and operational  level. While UP KRITIS focuses on cooperation with companies of the critical sectors, the Alliance for Cyber  Security has a broader scope and includes all relevant institutions in the area of cyber security. In order to  strengthen the security of all stakeholders, the alliance offers a general “information pool”, regular threat  reports and knowledge exchange between its participants (Federal Office for Information Security 2013,  2015a).  Sweden’s Cooperation Group for Information Security (SAMFI)10 is another example for a good practice in  information sharing. Unlike Germany, the focus is not on law enforcement and intelligence agencies but  rather on authorities with responsibilities in societal information security. Within SAMFI, the different  authorities not only share information on recent threats but also discuss strategical issue as well as national  and international developments. Representatives from the different authorities meet several times a year  and work together in working groups on current issues (Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) 2015).  2.1.3 Development of a CSIRT-Community  In most countries a variety of CSIRTs with different competencies exist. Developing a strong community  between the different national CSIRTs, including the division of responsibilities and sharing of information,  can lead to mutual benefits, such as increased knowledge and a more efficient use of resources.  A good example for a strong community between CSIRTs is Poland. In Poland, no CSIRT has been designated  as the national CSIRT. Instead, a community of different CSIRTs shares the responsibilities. CERT.gov.PL is  the main CSIRT for public agencies, but also offers its services to CI operators based on formal agreements.  CERT Polska was the first CSIRT in Poland and is part of the Research and Academic Computer Network  (NASK). It holds special expertise in the analysis and research of security incidents and provides information  on threats and incidents. The information is available on a database that can be used by private and public  entities. CERT.gov.PL and CERT Polska work together closely, for example in operating a database dedicated  to honeypots. Furthermore, they cooperate with a number of sectorial CSIRTs, such as MilCERT and CERT  Orange (telecommunications sector) (2015b).  Other examples for good practices in the development of CSIRT-communities are the Netherlands or  Germany. In Germany, the “CERT-Verbund” is an alliance of different German public CSIRTs (CERT-Bund, the  military CERTBw and several CERTs of the federal states), private CSIRTs of major companies, and CSIRTs of  private information security providers, among others. Every CSIRT is still responsible for its own  constituency, but participants share information and support each other in incident handling. CERT-Verbund  is the institutional foundation for this cooperation. The organisation is open to all kinds of German CSIRTs.  The participants have defined standardised technical and organisational interfaces for the exchange of  information. A key part is the statistical evaluation of the shared data and the provision of strategic insights  (Federal Office for Information Security 2015b).  2.1.4 Risk Assessment  Risk Assessment includes the identification of potential threats, consequences of these threats (impact) and  their likelihood.11 The analysis of risks is a necessary step for crisis and incident preparation and  management. In some countries, a national risk assessment is conducted by a national authority across all  10 http://rib.msb.se/Filer/pdf/26177.pdf  11 For an analysis of approaches to national-level risk assessment see:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/nlra- analysis-report  http://rib.msb.se/Filer/pdf/26177.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/nlra-analysis-report https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/nlra-analysis-report  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  18  relevant sectors. Other countries, especially those with a more decentralised approach in CIIP, leave risk  assessment the sector-specific authorities or to the operators of CI.  Examples for centralised national risk assessments are Sweden. The Swedish MSB has been commissioned  to continue the work on a national risk assessment which began in 2011. It developed a risk assessment  methodology, identified 27 particularly serious (national) events and developed eleven scenarios based on  a selection of these events (2015c).  Denmark does not follow a national risk assessment plan, because sectoral risk management is seen as a  more successful way to mitigate risks. A Cyber Threat Assessment Unit has been set up, which consists of  personnel from the different sectoral public authorities. The Unit’s goal is to conduct risk assessments for  the different sectors (2015d).  An example for a decentralised approach is Switzerland. Switzerland uses an approach with a strong focus  on individual self-responsibility. The critical subsectors are in charge of identifying the cyber-risks for their  processes and systems. It is believed that the subsectors have the best knowledge on their own processes  and systems. The government supports this process if requested (2015e).  2.1.5 Cyber Crisis Management  Good cyber crisis management includes the definition of roles and responsibilities in cases of cyber  emergencies and coordination and decision-making procedures between relevant stakeholders with the  necessary competencies and expertise. Furthermore, cyber crisis management needs to be aligned with  other existing national emergency and crisis management systems.12  A good example for good practice in this field is the cyber crisis management structure in the Netherlands.  For decision-making, the National Manual on Decision-making in Crisis Situation is applied (National  Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism 2013). In case of emergency related to ICT the national crisis  organisation is handled by the Director of Cyber Security of the National Coordinator for Security and  Counterterrorism (part of the Ministry of Security and Justice). Operational coordination and crisis response  measures are offered by the National Cyber Security Centre.  Cyber crisis management is conducted in close cooperation with the private sector. In case of a cyber-related  crisis the ICT Response Board becomes activated. The Board is set up as a public-private partnership and  includes ICT experts from the affected sectors. It offers advice and recommendations. In addition, the NCSC  has established agreements with public and private stakeholders on the method of crisis cooperation  (National Cyber Security Centre 2015a).  2.1.6 Comprehensive Legal Framework  Some countries have drafted new laws and regulation in order to tackle the problem of increasing threats  to CII. These legal frameworks are often tailored for operators of CI across all relevant sectors and are not  limited to specific ones.  These legal frameworks often include mandatory implementation of technical and organisational security  measures according to national or international standards. Other requirements can include mandatory  incident notification and regular external security audits. These laws ensure a consistent security level across  sectors and, in cases of mandatory security reporting, give governments the possibility to analyse the  12 For a comparative study on cyber crisis management and general crisis management, see ENISA’s Report on Cyber  Crisis Cooperation and Management ENISA 2014.  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  19  incoming incidents reports, monitor threats levels, issue warnings to threatened operators of CI and offer  support if necessary  An example of good practice in this area is France. The Military Programming Law (LPM13) obliges “operators  of vital importance” (OIVs) to report cybersecurity incident to the Agence nationale de la sécurité des  systèmes d'information (ANSSI) and implement technical and organisational measures for information  security. In addition, OIVs are obligated to undergo cybersecurity audits, performed either by ANSSI or a  service provider qualified by ANSSI (French Senate 2013).  Similar obligations can be found in Germany which has recently enacted the IT Security Act14. The newly  passed law obligates operators to implement adequate organisational and technical measures for  information security as far as it is necessary for the availability of their critical services. Furthermore  organizations are to conduct security audits, to establish a contact point within their organisation and to  report major IT security incidents if they could possibly affect the availability of their critical services (Federal  Office for Information Security 2015c).  13  http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=D18929C424710499FAE3092CB887BD8D.tpdjo09v_2?cidTex te=JORFTEXT000028338825&categorieLien=id  14 http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/040/1804096.pdf  http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=D18929C424710499FAE3092CB887BD8D.tpdjo09v_2?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000028338825&categorieLien=id http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=D18929C424710499FAE3092CB887BD8D.tpdjo09v_2?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000028338825&categorieLien=id http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/040/1804096.pdf  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  20  2.2 Key Findings  Based on information collected (interviews and online surveys), some key findings have been identified. The  key findings are presented along the different categories of the analytical framework. The total number of  analysed countries per category can vary between twelve and eighteen depending on the feedback we  received via the interviews and online survey.  Some of the key findings refer to critical sectors. Not all countries identify the same sectors as critical. The  table below gives an overview of the mapping of the critical sectors identified by each country. The table is  adapted from ENISA’s study “Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure  assets and services” from December 2014 (ENISA 2014).

National authorities fall within the following  categories:   EMR: Emergency or CIP agency   INT: Intelligence or security service   ISA: Information security agency   ISF: Information security forum   NRA: National regulator or agency   MIN: Ministry  Most of these categories are self-explanatory, however some remarks on the distinction between ISA and  ISF are necessary. Information security agencies are public agencies with a strong focus on the security of  information and telecommunications infrastructure. In many cases, they are the host of the national or  governmental CSIRT. They are usually either independent agencies or subdivisions of ministries with a high  degree of autonomy. Information security forums in comparison with ISAs, are set up as institutions where  different agencies can cooperate closely together. With this model, the responsibilities and competencies  of each existing agency largely remains intact. The ISF itself is usually not authorised to issue binding  instructions to operators of CII. ISFs are often developed in countries that follow the principle of subsidiarity  or decentralisation.  It should be noted that not all countries have developed a main or leading authority for CIIP. Especially  Member States that follow a principle of subsidiarity leave responsibility with the individual ministries and  operators of CII. In these cases we have identified the agency with the most responsibility or the strongest  involvement in CIIP. In some Member States, responsibility for CIIP is shared between two agencies. In these  cases, both agencies have been considered separately.  The following figure shows the number of the different types of governmental authorities for CIIP in 17 EU  Member States and one EFTA country.  Figure 2-1 – National Authorities  Countries examined have assigned responsibility for CIIP to various national authorities. However, the figure  shows that most countries tend to task their Information Security Authorities with CIIP. This seems to  indicate that CIIP is seen as closest related to the issue of information security. CIIP is also a subcategory of  general CIP, which might be the reason why five countries have decided to let their national EMR take  7  5 4  2 2 2  0  2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16  18  ISA EMR NRA ISF INT MIN  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  22  responsibility for it. CIIP also requires strong knowledge of information technology and the “landscape of  private operators”. Usually, NRAs combine these two traits, which could be the reason why four countries  have assigned CIIP to them. Only a small minority of countries has assigned INT with the responsibility for  CIIP. In two cases Ministries are complementing the tasks of another national authority.  2.2.2 Responsibilities of National Authorities  We examined the responsibilities and tasks assigned to national authorities in the area of CIIP for 12  countries (11 EU MS and one EFTA country):  Figure 2-2 – Responsibilities of National Authorities  The figure shows that the majority of tasks are on the operational level (dark blue). Only seven to eight  countries have additional responsibilities on a strategical or political level, such as the development of  strategies, proposing legislations or the supervision of the national CSIRT (light blue). Only one third of the  examined countries has been tasked with the supervision of institutions other than CSIRTs (red). These  include mainly regulatory tasks.  2.2.3 Forms of Cooperation between Public and Private Stakeholders  The Member States examined have developed different forms of cooperation with the private sector with  varying degrees of institutionalisation. Public-Private partnerships are an institutionalised form of  cooperation between public and private actors. They are usually characterised through a long-term  commitment of the different stakeholders, a contractual agreement or a joint statement, which defines the  goals and responsibilities of the partnership, and shared responsibility for the produced output. A less  institutionalised form of cooperation are working groups and contact forums, which are often temporary  and demand less resources and commitment from the different stakeholders.  The following figure shows how many countries have developed different forms of cooperation with private  stakeholders. Eighteen countries (seventeen Member States and one EFTA country) have been examined in  total:  4  7  7  7  8  8  10  11  11  12  0 5 10  Supervision of other institutions  Monitoring the implementation of security measures  Supervision of national CSIRT  Issuing guidelines or proposing legislations  Monitoring the security of national CII  Development of strategy or policy papers  Incident response  Advisory to operators of CII (private and public sector)  Organise and conduct CIIP-related exercises and training  Point of contact for incident reporting  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  23  Figure 2-3 – Forms of Cooperation between Public and Private Stakeholders  Ten of the eighteen examined countries have established formal Public-Private Partnerships for the purpose  of CIIP. Six countries are relying on less institutionalised forms of cooperation such as working groups or  networks. Some of these countries are currently in the process of developing PPPs as required by their cyber  security strategies. Two countries communicated with private stakeholders via informal ways.  2.2.4 Institutionalised Forms of Cooperation between Public Agencies  All of the sixteen examined countries have established some form of institutionalised cooperation between  public agencies for the purpose of CIP beyond the usual communication channels. The institutional settings  range from advisory boards, steering groups, forums, councils, cyber centres or expert meeting groups.  However, the purpose is always to share information and to coordinate the actions of the different agencies.  The majority of countries have developed new kinds of cooperation mechanism for the specific purpose of  CIP. Some countries have instead extended the scope of existing institutions, which are responsible for  emergency management or the security of the supply of infrastructure and services.  2.2.5 Risk Assessment  Risk Assessment includes the identification of threats, potential consequences of these threats (impact) and  their likelihood. In some countries, a national risk assessment is conducted by a national authority across all  relevant sectors. Other countries, especially those with a more decentralised approach in CIIP, leave risk  assessment the sector-specific authorities or to the operators of CI.  The following figure shows how many countries are conducting what kind of risk assessment, or a leaving  risk assessment to the individual operators.  106  2  PPP Working groups (or similar) Informal  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  24  Figure 2-4 – Risk Assessment  The majority of the sixteen examined countries (fifteen Member States and one EFTA country) have  conducted risk assessments on a national level or are planning to do so in the future. In four countries, risk  assessment is conducted by the sector-specific agencies or ministries. In five countries, no national or  sectorial risk assessment is being conducted. Instead, risk assessment is seen as the responsibility of private  operators. However, this does not necessarily mean that governments are obligating operators to conduct  risk assessments. This can be seen as an indicator on which level a government believes the problem should  be best tackled: On the national level, the sectorial or the operator level.  2.2.6 Cyber Security Exercises  All of the examined countries are conducting regular CIIP-related exercises. There a three different kinds of  CIIP-related exercises:   Sector-specific exercises   Cross-sectorial exercises   International exercises  Most sector-specific and cross-sectorial exercises are being conducted in the financial, energy and the  telecommunications sector. Other important sectors are public administrations, transport and logistics and  healthcare.  The international exercises which were most commonly visited were NATO’s exercises Locked Shields and  Cyber Coalition and exercises of ENISA’s Cyber Europe program. Other international exercise of importance  were Cyberstorm IV (International Watch and Warning Network (IWWN)), ENISA’s table top exercise Cyber  Atlantic, NATO’s Crisis Management Exercise CMX and the Nordic Cyber Security Exercise.  2.2.7 National Computer Security Incident Response Team  CSIRTs can be distinguished by their constituencies. Governmental CSIRTs usually offer their services to the  public administration and agencies. National CSIRTs have a wider scope, because their constituency consists  of operators of critical infrastructure and sometimes individual citizens. However, in some cases  responsibilities between both types of CSIRTs might exist.  4  3  4  5  National National (under development) Sectorial Operators  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  25  Figure 2-5 – National Computer Security Incident Response Team  Fourteen of the examined countries have established National CSIRTs. In two of these cases, the national  CSIRT also serves as the Governmental CSIRT. Four countries have not developed dedicated national CSIRTs,  however, either a national CSIRT is under development or the responsibility is shared by a community of  private and sector-specific CSIRTs (as it is the case in Germany for example).  2.2.8 Security Incident Reporting  The majority of the examined countries have implemented mandatory incident reporting in the  telecommunications sector,15 but only a minority has implemented it across all sectors. The scope of  reporting schemes vary greatly. Some countries obligate operators of CII to report security incidents  regardless of the sector, as long as they have been assessed to be critical. Other countries have implemented  mandatory reporting only for specific sectors.  The following figure shows the scope of mandatory security incident reporting across the examined  countries (Sixteen Member States and one EFTA country):  Figure 2-6 – Security Incident Reporting  15 All Member States have implemented mandatory incident reporting in the telecommunications sector to be in line  with the article 13a requirements. Moreover, Sweden intends to introduce mandatory incident reporting for the  public institutions  12  4  Established Not Established  5  10  2  -1  1  3  5  7  9  11  13  15  17  All sectors Limited to specific sectors  None  Most common  sectors are:  Telecommunication  Finance  Energy  Public Administration  Military  Healthcare  Transport  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  26  Five countries have established mandatory security incident reporting across all sectors, with Germany being  the most recent one. Most EU Member States have only developed mandatory incident reporting for some  sectors. All of the ten countries that are limiting incident reporting to specific sectors, have established such  obligations for the telecommunications sector. Other important sectors are Finance, Public Administration  and Energy. Only two countries have not established mandatory reporting in any sector. The Netherlands  are currently preparing a new law which will include obligatory incident reporting. The details of the law  (e.g. the installation of enforcement mechanisms) depend on the content of the final NIS-Directive.  2.2.9 Security Measures  A similar picture can be observed for mandatory security measures.16 The same five Member States that  have implemented mandatory incident reporting across all sectors, have also implemented mandatory  security measures across all sectors.  Figure 2-7 – Security Measures  Before CIIP became an important part of the political agenda, most countries had already established  mandatory security measures in some sectors. Specifically sectors, which were already strongly relying on  information technology or were providing crucial services to the population (for example the  telecommunications, energy or finance sector). This explains why most countries have only implemented  mandatory security measures in specific sectors. Countries with no mandatory security measures, usually  consider security as the responsibility of private companies. However, there seems to be a slight tendency  of countries to establish more comprehensive legislation for CIIP that covers all critical sectors.  2.2.10 Security Audits  Security audits seems to be either of the lowest priority or the hardest to implement for EU countries: Six  countries have not implemented mandatory security audits and only five are obligating operators across all  sectors to undergo audits.  16 Article 13a also implies mandatory security measures for the telecommunications sector.  5  10  2  -1  1  3  5  7  9  11  13  15  17  All sectors Limited to specific sectors  None  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  27  Figure 2-8 – Security Audits  The same five countries that have implemented mandatory security measures, have also implemented  mandatory security audits. The analyses indicates that security audits are either of less a priority or harder  to implement for the Member States’ governments.  2.2.11 Incentives to Invest  In theory, countries can give an impetus to operators of CII to invest in security by creating incentives, such  as subsidies or tax benefits. In areas such as environmental and ecological issues, tax benefits have proven  to be successful in creating incentives for companies to implement environmental standards. However,  almost none of the examined Member States have such incentives for CIIP-security in place. Some countries  believe that market pressure will, in the long run, give operators of CII enough incentive to invest in  additional security measures. An exception is Finland, where companies that invest in operational security  measures are eligible for tax breaks under certain conditions.  5 6 6  -1  1  3  5  7  9  11  13  15  17  All sectors Limited to specific sectors  None  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  28  2.3 CIIP Governance Profiles  This chapter describes three profiles of CIIP governance among the examined sixteen EU Member States.  CIIP governance refers to all structures and processes associated with the steering in the area of CIIP  undertaken by public (e.g. public administration or law enforcement agencies) or private actors (e.g.  associations, operators of CII, sectorial CSIRTs). It can refer to the decision-making processes, but also the  operational measures in the protection of CII.  The different profiles illustrate specific forms of CIIP governance, which are defined by their shared  characteristics. The profiles are not exclusive types, but are rather points on a spectrum. For example, the  centralism of CIIP-governance displayed by a country will vary and while some countries can be described as  either centralised or decentralised, others fall in between these two points. The same is true for the degree  of private-sector involvement. In the following section examples of Member States that fit a profile or the  defining characteristics of it are presented.  These profiles can help to understand how CIIP is organised in the individual Member States and what CIIP- measures and actions can possibly be transferred from one Member State to another. Some measures  undertaken by Member States with a centralised approach in CIIP might not work in countries that follow a  decentralised approach (and vice versa), because of different responsibilities, processes and relations  between relevant stakeholders. Likewise, measures undertaken by Member States with a high degree of  private sector participation might not be transferable to states in which CIIP is primarily steered by  emergency or law enforcement agencies (and vice versa). However, Member States with similar  characteristics in CIIP-governance might be better suited for the exchange of good practices and effective  CIIP-measures.  The governance of CIIP is a key feature in understanding how CIIP is organised in different Member States  and to what degree measures are transferable between them.  2.3.1 Profile 1: Decentralised Approach  The decentralised approach is characterised by:   Principle of subsidiarity   Strong cooperation between public agencies   Sector-specific legislation  Sector-Responsibility  Instead of establishing a strong CIIP-agency with responsibility across all or several critical sectors, the  decentralised approach follows the principle of subsidiarity. This means that the responsibility for CIIP is  either in the hands of the sector-specific authority or the companies and operators of the CII themselves.  Therefore, many Member States that fit this profile are lacking a centralised authority for the purpose of  CIIP, but have placed the responsibility for CIIP on the sector-specific authorities.  Strong Cooperation between Public Agencies  Because of the variety of public agencies involved in CIIP, many Member States have developed cooperation  schemes in order to coordinate the work and efforts of the different stakeholders. These cooperation  schemes can take the form of informal networks or more institutionalised forums or councils. However,  these cooperation schemes only serve the purpose of information exchange and coordination between the  different public agencies, but have no authority over them.  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  29  Sector-specific Legislation  The countries that follow the decentralised approach often refrain from drafting legislation for the purpose  of CIIP across critical sectors. Instead, the adoption of laws and regulations remains sector-specific and  therefore can vary greatly between sectors.  Figure 2-9 – Decentralised Approach  Examples for the Decentralised Approach  Sweden is a good example for a country that follows a decentralised approach in CIIP. The country uses a  “system perspective”, which means that the main tasks of CIIP, such as the identification of vital services  and critical infrastructures, the coordination and support of operators, regulatory tasks as well as measures  for emergency preparedness are the responsibility of different agencies and municipalities. Among these  agencies are the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), the Swedish Post and Telecom Agency (PTS),  and several Swedish Defence, Military and law enforcement agencies (2015c).  In order to coordinate the actions between the different agencies and public entities, the Swedish  government has developed a cooperative network comprised of authorities “with specific societal  information security responsibilities”. This Cooperation Group for Information Security (SAMFI), consists of  representatives of the different authorities and meets several times a year to discuss issues related to  national information security. SAMFI’s subject areas are mainly to be found in political-strategic areas and  cover topics such as technical issues and standardization, national and international development in the field  of information security, or management and prevention of IT incidents (Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency  (MSB) 2015).  Sweden has not published a central law for CIIP applicable for operators of CII across sectors. Instead, issuing  legislation with obligations for companies within specific sectors is the responsibility of the respective public  authorities. For example, the MSB has the right to issue regulations for government authorities in the area  of information security, while the PTS can obligate operators to implement certain technical or  organisational security measures based on secondary legislation.  Another example for a country that display characteristics of this profile is Ireland. Ireland follows a “doctrine  of subsidiarity”, where each Ministry is responsible for the identification of CII and risk assessment within its  own sector. Furthermore, no specific regulations for CIIP at the national level have been enacted. Legislation  remains sectorial and exists mainly for the energy and telecommunications sector (2015f). Other examples  are Austria, Cyprus, Finland and Switzerland.  Public  Agency  Public  Agency  Sector Sector  Council  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  30  2.3.2 Profile 2: Centralised Approach  The centralised approach is characterised by:   Central authority across sectors   Comprehensive legislation  Central Authority across Sectors  Member States that follow a centralised approach have developed authorities with responsibilities and wide  competencies across several or all critical sectors, or have extended the powers of existing authorities. These  main authorities for CIIP combine several tasks such as contingency planning, emergency management,  regulatory tasks and supporting private operators. In many cases, the national or governmental CSIRT is part  of the main CIIP-authority.  Comprehensive Legislation  A comprehensive legislation creates obligations and requirements for all operators of CII across all sectors.  This can be achieved through new comprehensive laws, or through complementing existing sector-specific  regulations.  Figure 2-10 – Centralised Approach  Examples for the Centralised Approach  France is a good example for an EU Member State with a centralised approach. France’s ANSSI has been  declared the main national authority for the defence of the information systems in 2011. ANSSI has a strong  supervisory role for “operators of vital importance” (OIVs): The agency can order OIVs to comply with  security measures and is authorised to perform security audits on them. Furthermore, it is the main Single  Point of Contact for OIVs, which are obligated to report security incident to the agency (2015g).  In cases of security incidents, ANSSI acts as a contingency agency for CIIP and decides on the measures that  operators must take to respond to the crisis. The government’s actions are coordinated within ANSSI’s  Public  Agency  Public  Agency  Public  Agency  Sector Sector Sector  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  31  operations centre. Detection of threats and incident response on an operational level is performed by CERT- FR, which is part of ANSSI.  France has established a comprehensive legal framework for CIIP. In 2006, the Prime Minister ordered to  establish a list of sectors of critical infrastructure. Based on this list, which identified twelve vital sectors, the  government has defined around 250 OIVs. In 2013, the Military Programming Law (LPM) was promulgated,  which sets different obligations for OIVs, such as incident reporting or implementation of security measures.  These requirements are mandatory for all OIVs across all sectors (French Senate 2013).  Among the analysed EU Member States, the centralised approach is the exception. Most countries are  following a cooperative, decentralised approach. However, France is not the only country, which displays  characteristics of a centralised approach. Other examples of countries with characteristics of the centralised  approach are the Czech Republic (central authority) and Germany (comprehensive legislation).  2.3.3 Profile 3: Co-Regulation with the Private Sector  The co-regulation approach is characterised by:   Institutionalised cooperation with the private sector   Horizontal relationship between public and private parties  Institutionalised Cooperation with the Private Sector  A typical form of institutionalised cooperation between the public and private sector are public-private  partnerships (PPPs) which are usually based on contractual agreement between the parties. Public and  private actors can provide different resources to the partnerships: For example, the government can offer  political legitimacy and funds, while private actors can add special expertise and efficiency. Through PPPs,  governments have the possibility for regulation in areas where it is lacking expertise.  Horizontal Relationship between Public and Private Parties  Although not exclusively, PPPs are often characterised by a horizontal relationship between the public and  private parties, meaning that both are on equal footing and make joint decisions. The decision making  process is based on negotiations rather than hierarchical command structures.17  In some cases, this kind of relationship is also reflected in a compliance structure which is not based on a  strong regulatory framework and enforcement mechanisms but is based on voluntary action and trust.  17 For a good practice guide on Cooperative Models for Effective PPPs see:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/national-public-private- partnerships-ppps/good-practice-guide-on-cooperatve-models-for-effective-ppps  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/national-public-private-partnerships-ppps/good-practice-guide-on-cooperatve-models-for-effective-ppps https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/public-private-partnership/national-public-private-partnerships-ppps/good-practice-guide-on-cooperatve-models-for-effective-ppps  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  32  Figure 2-11 – Corregulation  Examples for Co-Regulation with the Private Sector  An example for co-regulation in the area of CIIP can be found in the Netherlands. The major CIP agency is  the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). It is set up as a central information hub and a centre of expertise  for cyber security within the National Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism (NCTV). The NCSC  consists of several partnerships between public and private actors, such as various Information Sharing and  Analysis Centres (ISACs) and the ICT Response Board which analyses the situation during a large-scale IT crisis  or threat. The NCSC emphasises that cooperation with private stakeholders is based on equality and trust  (National Cyber Security Centre 2015b).  In addition, the Dutch Cyber Security Council offers advice on a strategic and political level. The council is  comprised of representatives from different Ministries, academia and the private sector and has a strong  public-private character.  Participation in the various Information Sharing and Analysis Centres is based on confidentiality, meaning  that members are not forced or obligated to share information with the other participants but do so on a  voluntary basis. All representatives are expected to respect the mutual agreement and treat information on  threats, risks and other sensitive issues in a confidential manner.  Legal obligations and requirements in the Netherlands tend to be stronger for the telecommunications and  nuclear sector. However, Dutch companies are not obliged to report security incidents and a lot of incident  notification is done voluntarily (2015h).  Public  Agency  Sector  PPP Private  Actors  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  33  3. Recommendations  Based on the key findings of this study, ENISA presents the following recommendations for the European  Member States and the European Commission.  3.1 Member States  Recommendation 1: Increase institutionalised cooperation with private stakeholders  EU Member States have established different kinds of cooperation with private stakeholders. These  primarily include the private operators of CII, but also private associations, sectorial CSIRTs or academia.  Some countries are relying on public-private partnerships while others are cooperating with the private  actors in less formalised, temporary working groups and similar formats.  Threats to CII are likely to increase in the coming years and therefore the necessity for cooperation with  private stakeholders will increase as well. Member States should establish institutionalised and long-term  partnerships or equivalent cooperation schemes with private stakeholders for different tasks such as  detection, response and analysis of threats to CII. Existing working groups or forums can provide a good  starting point to develop stronger cooperation.  Related to this is the development of a strong CSIRT-community. Member States should foster the  cooperation between government and sectorial CSIRTs in order to distribute tasks and responsibilities and  gain from increased knowledge and a more efficient use of existing resources.  Recommendation 2: Align management structure for CIIP with existing national crisis and  emergency management structures  Most Member States have general management structures for emergencies or incidents on a national level  in place. The issue of CIIP should be integrated into the existing management structures. Alternatively, CIIP- management structures should be aligned and made compatible with existing management structures. This  includes the definition of roles and responsibilities of the different public agencies in cases of emergency,  but also in day-to-day operations.  Recommendation 3: Participate in or host international exercises  Threats to CI are not bound by national borders and often transcend them. This means that Member States  and private actors often need to cooperate with their counterparts in other Member States or countries  beyond the European Union. In order to strengthen international cooperation, Member States should  maintain participation in international CIIP-related exercises and consider hosting equivalent exercises in  their home country.  Recommendation 4: Establish mandatory security incident reporting  In order to gain an overview of the national risk situation and on potential threat scenarios, the state is  dependent on the input from operators of CII. Only with comprehensive data are governments able to gain  knowledge on current dangers to CII. This data constitutes the basis for a national risk assessment (see  Recommendation 5) and for the development and adjustment of strategies, policies, the drafting of  legislation and the allocation of resources.  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  34  For this purpose, Member States should establish mandatory security incident reporting for all operators of  CII. ENISA could play a significant role in this process by providing support in the execution of aligned  reporting schemes at EU level. With the help of ENISA a consistent implementation of incident reporting  would make it easier for providers and users to operate across the different Member States. Monitoring of  IT-infrastructure can be conducted by the operators themselves or, in cases of smaller operators with limited  financial resources, by third parties. If needed, operators should be supported in the development of the  capacities for monitoring and incident reporting by public agencies.  Mandatory security incident reporting should also include obligations for public agencies to report back to  the affected operators and inform about security threats and other CIIP-related issues. This will create  additional incentives for operators to cooperate with the government on incident reporting and ensure that  vulnerable operators are informed quickly about potential threats.  Operators of CI are often reluctant to report incidents to public agencies because they fear that public  disclosure of these incidents will damage their companies’ reputation. A means of increasing trust between  the government and private operators could be the installation of “clearing houses”. These institutions could  receive incidents reports and other threat-related information from operators and anonymise them, before  forwarding them to the responsible public agencies.  Recommendation 5: Conduct national risk assessment  Member States currently conduct risk assessments on different levels. Some governments believe that the  risk assessments should be conducted by the individual operators, since they have the best knowledge of  their processes and structures. However, the results of the identification and assessment of risks conducted  by a national government and a private company can differ. National governments are responsible to ensure  that the population has access to all necessary services and goods. A private companies’ focus is limited to  its own business and the interests of their stakeholders.  Because of these different perspectives, the government should conduct risk assessments from a national  perspective, which identifies and assesses risks and impacts for a nation’s general population. Furthermore,  Governments should adopt an open, transparent and collaborative approach to national risk assessment,  involving all relevant stakeholders.  Recommendation 6: Utilize best legal framework practices for CIIP across critical sectors  Some sectors, like the financial or the energy sector, are stronger regulated than others. This means that  obligations and requirements can vary greatly across the sectors and thus for the different operators of CI.  Furthermore, mandatory security measures are not always compatible with certain companies or sectors.  Member States should evaluate and asses their legal frameworks for CIIP in different critical sectors. This  will ensure that all operators of CII are facing applicable risk based obligations and will contribute to the  alignment of security standards across sectors.  Recommendation 7: Examine if positive incentives can be provided to operators of CII to invest  in security measures  Almost none of the examined Member States in this study have implemented incentives to invest in CIIP- related security measures for operators of CII. Incentives like tax breaks or financial subsidies have been  used by some governments in other policy areas as a “soft” steering tool. The goal is to refrain from laws or  regulations, but to encourage companies through positive incentives to implement certain policies. This  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  35  strategy has been used successfully in other areas such as environmental issues. Such incentives should not  be limited to the capital expenditures of security measures, but also include the operational expenditures of  processes and continuing operations.  Other possible forms of positive incentives include supporting measures by government institutions, such as  post-incident support. Public agencies could help operators with forensic investigations and recovery  measures.  3.2 European Commission  Recommendation 8: Ensure that MS collectively agree baseline requirements in order to support  the development of CIIP in MS  The European Commission should require the MS to collectively define baseline requirements for an  adequate level of national CIIP-capabilities. These baseline requirements can serve as a guideline for the EU  Member States that are in the process of developing or extending CIIP. The baseline requirements should  be comprehensive and cover all relevant action areas: Policy, governance structure, legislation, risk  management and mitigation measures, emergency preparedness, threat intelligence and information  sharing. The baseline requirements should be generic and contain objectives and controls. Ideally, they can  be used to evaluate the maturity level of CIIP in EU Member States and help to identify gaps.  The Network and Information Security Directive, proposed by the Commission in 2013, is expected to fill this  gap. It is currently in the final stages of negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council and  will lay down different measures to ensure a high common level of network and information security within  Member States (European Commission 2013b).  The EU Commission should actively promote the different measures outlined in the NIS Directive and  support implementation efforts.  Recommendation 9: Develop and conduct a maturity assessment of Member States’ CIIP  readiness  The European Commission should develop a method for maturity assessment of Member States’ critical  information infrastructure protection and conduct those assessment on a regular basis.  The defined baseline requirements (see recommendation 8) can serve as a basis for the development of key  process areas and defined goals. Development of such a model will allow the EU Commission to assess the  national CIIP measures of the individual EU Member States and compare them with each other.  Based on these results, the EU Commission can make individual recommendations to EU Member States on  how to improve national CIIP.  Recommendation 10: Support information sharing and the exchange of knowledge between EU  Member States’ national CSIRTs  The EU Commission should foster information sharing and the exchange of knowledge between EU Member  States’ national CSIRTs. If a CII-related incident occurs in a certain country, other CSIRTs should be notified  about the risk and possible incident solutions in order to take appropriate operational preparations.  Permanent forums and working groups, as well as technical platforms and interfaces for threat information  Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs  36  sharing should be developed. Since threats to CII often transcend national borders, information sharing  platforms can also serve to coordinate actions of the different national CSIRTs.  Similar EU-wide information sharing networks for national CIIP-authorities as well as private operators  should be considered.  Recommendation 11: Identify European Critical Information Infrastructure  A part of EU Information Infrastructure is potentially critical, such as the information and communications  systems of the institutions and agencies of the European Union or assets such as the global navigation  satellite system Galileo, which is currently under development.  The EU should identify EU Critical Information Infrastructure and take appropriate security measures. CIIP- measures of EU assets can also be delegated to hosting Member States.

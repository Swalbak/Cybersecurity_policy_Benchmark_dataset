CSD’s standards, guidelines, tools and references are developed  in an open, transparent, traceable and collaborative manner that enlists broad expertise from around the world. While developed  for federal agency use, these resources are voluntarily adopted by other organizations because they are effective and accepted  globally.  The need for cybersecurity standards, best practices, tools and references that also address interoperability, usability  and privacy continue to be critical for the Nation. CSD aligns its resources to enable greater development and application of  practical, innovative security technologies and methodologies that enhance our ability to address current and future computer  and information security challenges. Our foundational research and applied cybersecurity programs continue to advance in  many areas, including cryptography, automation, roots of trust, identity and access management, advanced security testing and  measurement, Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems, and public safety networks.  Trust is crucial to the broad adoption of our standards and guidelines, including our cryptographic standards and guidelines.  To ensure that our cryptography resources have been developed according the highest standard of inclusiveness, transparency  and security, NIST conducted an internal and external formal review of our cryptographic standards development efforts in  2014. We documented and solicited public comment on the principles and rigorous processes we use to engage stakeholders  and experts in industry, academia, and government to develop and revise these standards. The final report is now published and  serves as a basis for all CSD’s cryptographic development efforts.  Increasing the trustworthiness and resilience of the IT infrastructure is a significant undertaking that requires a substantial  investment in the architectural design and development of our systems and networks. A disciplined and structured set of  systems security engineering processes that starts with and builds on well-established international standards provides an  important starting point. Draft Special Publication 800-160, Systems Security Engineering: An Integrated Approach to Building  Trustworthy Resilient Systems, which was issued in May 2014, helps organizations to develop a more defensible and survivable  information technology infrastructure. This resource, coupled with other NIST standards and guidelines, contributes to systems  that are more resilient in the face of cyber attacks and other threats.  Strong partnerships with diverse stakeholders are vital to the success of our technical programs. In February 2014, NIST  issued the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity as directed in Executive Order 13636. The Framework,  created through collaboration between industry and government, consists of standards, guidelines, and practices to promote  the protection of the critical infrastructure. Its approach helps owners and operators of the critical infrastructure to manage  cybersecurity-related risk.  Active engagement with diverse stakeholders continues to be critical to our success. In the federal space, this interaction  is most prominent in our strengthened collaborations with the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and  the Committee on National Security Systems to establish a common foundation for information security across the Federal  Government. Our cybersecurity awareness, training, and education programs also exemplify the importance of engagements  with academic institutions, federal agencies, small and medium businesses and others to increase awareness and enhance the  overall cybersecurity posture of the Nation.  CSD’s work with Health and Human Services, Department of Transportation, Federal  Communications Commission and others are all examples of an active and strong engagement, applying security to multiple  government mission areas.  For many years, CSD, in collaboration with our global partners across industry, academia, standards bodies, and  government, has made great contributions to help secure the nation’s critical information and infrastructure. We look forward to  strengthening these relationships as we lead the development and practical application of scalable and sustainable information  security standards and practices.

OVERVIEW: The Cryptographic Technology Group’s (CTG) work in  the field of cryptography includes researching, analyzing  and standardizing cryptographic technology, such as hash  algorithms, symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic  techniques, key management, authentication, and random  number generation. The CTG’s goal is to identify and  promote methods to protect communications and storage  through cryptographic technologies, encouraging inno-  vative development and helping technology users to  manage risk.  In FY 2015, the CTG continued to collaborate with  national and international government agencies, academic  and research organizations, industry partners, and stan-  dards bodies to develop interoperable security standards  and guidelines, and to make an impact in the field of  cryptography. One example is the culmination of an eight- year standardization effort that led to the publication of  Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 202, SHA- 3 Standard: Permutation-Based Hash and Extendable-  Output Functions, announced in the Federal Register on  August 5, 2015.  The CTG’s cryptographic standards program focuses  on cryptographic primitives, algorithms, and schemes; the  developed standards and guidelines are specified in FIPSs,  NIST Special Publications (SPs), and NIST Interagency or  Internal Reports (NISTIRs). Such standards and guidelines  have been considered or adopted by the information  technology (IT) industry and standards development  organizations, such as the International Organization for  Standardization (ISO), the Internet Engineering Task Force  (IETF), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  (IEEE), and the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), and have  been implemented on a variety of platforms.  The CTG is committed to the development of its  standards using an open and transparent process -  conducting workshops and requesting input and comments  from government agencies, private industry, academia and  the global cryptographic community. The CTG also examines  each of its standards to determine if they need to be revised,  withdrawn or re-opened for public comment.  The CTG continues to develop expertise in several  critical research areas, such as post-quantum cryptography  (PQC), elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), privacy-enhancing  cryptography, and lightweight cryptographic schemes for  constrained environments. It has collaborated with many  universities internationally and presented research results  in major cryptography conferences and journals. In addition,  it organized workshops on PQC, ECC standards, and  lightweight cryptography to discuss research results and  develop standardization roadmaps.  The CTG also published several guidelines on crypto- graphic applications, including key management, public  key certificate policies, and trusted platforms. The CTG also  participated in the cybersecurity projects of other CSD  groups, such as the Personal Identity Verification (PIV)  standards, the Federal Cloud Credential Exchange (FCCX),  the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP),  and the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).

OVERVIEW: The SCMG’s security research focuses on the develop-  ment and management of foundational building-block  security mechanisms and techniques that can be integrated  into a wide variety of mission-critical U.S. information  systems. The group’s work spans the spectrum from near- term hardening and improvement of systems, to the design  and analysis of next-generation, leap-ahead security  capabilities. Computer security depends fundamentally on  the level of trust of computer software and systems. This  work, therefore, focuses strongly on assurance-building  activities ranging from the analysis of software configuration  settings, to advanced trust architectures, and to testing tools  that identify flaws in software modules. This work also focuses  significantly on increasing the applicability and effectiveness  of automated techniques, wherever feasible. The SCMG  conducts collaborative research with government, industry,  and academia. Outputs of this research consist of prototype  systems, software tools, demonstrations, guidelines, and  other documentary resources.

OVERVIEW: SSAG’s security research focuses on identifying emerg-  ing and high-priority technologies, and on developing  security solutions that will have a high impact on U.S.  critical infrastructure. The group conducted research and  development related to both public and private sector use  cases. The research considered many aspects of the system’s  lifecycle from the earliest stages of technology develop- ment through proof-of-concept, reference and prototype  imple-mentations, and demonstrations. In addition, the  group worked to transfer new technologies to industry; to  produce new standards and guidance for federal agencies  and industry; and to develop tests, test methodologies,  and assurance methods.  SSAG investigated security concerns associated  with such areas as mobile devices, cloud computing and  virtualization, identity management, access control and  authorization management, and software assurance.  SSAG’s research helps to meet federal information security  requirements that may not be fully addressed by existing  technology. The group collaborated extensively with  government, academia, and private sector entities.  Example successes from this work include:  • Tools for access control policy testing;  •  New concepts in access control and policy enforce- ment;  •  Several Personal Identity Verification (PIV) documents  to support interagency use of the PIV Card;  •  Methods for architecting a secure cloud ecosystem in a  capability-oriented approach;  •  Guidance and tools for orchestrating a secure cloud  ecosystem;  •  Guidance for secure deployment of virtualized infra- structure components – Hypervisor, Virtual Machines  (VMs) and Virtual Network;  •  Methods for achieving comprehensive policy enforce- ment and data interoperability across enterprise data  services; and  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

In particular, the SSAG led the NIST Security and  Forensics Working Group that published draft NISTIR 8006,  NIST Cloud Computing - Security Reference Architecture,  that aggregates forensics challenges in a cloud ecosystem.  The working group has been working on developing a draft  of SP 800-173, Guidance for Applying the Risk Management  Framework to Federal-based Information Systems (target  release date: spring/summer 2016).  In response to the rapid-  ly emerging use of virtualization in enterprise data  centers for supporting both in-house mission-critical  applications and for providing cloud services, two guidance  documents were published: Draft SP 800-125A, Security  Recommendations for Hypervisor Deployment, and Draft  SP 800-125B, Secure Virtual Network Configuration for  Virtual Machine (VM) Protection. In support of the revised  FIPS 201, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal  Employees and Contractors, two new PIV-related SP  800-series were released and five SP 800 documents  were revised. One of the new publications, SP 800-157,  Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity Verification (PIV)  Credentials, guides the implementation and deployment  of PIV credentials for mobile devices. In addition, the PIV  team participated in the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) cybersecurity Sprint effort with a goal to strengthen  the cybersecurity of federal networks, systems, and data  through multi-factor authentication using the PIV Card. To  improve access to new technologies, the group also chaired,  edited, and participated in the development of a wide variety  of national and international security standards.

OVERVIEW: The U.S. economy, citizens, and government rely on  information technology (IT), so the protection of IT and the  information infrastructure is critical. SOIG leverages broad  cybersecurity and risk management expertise to develop,  integrate, and promote security standards, guidelines, tools,  technologies, methodologies, tests, and measurements to  address cybersecurity needs in many areas of national and  international importance.  The SOIG collaborates with stakeholders to address  cybersecurity considerations in many diverse program areas,  including the Information and Communications Technologies  (ICT) supply chain, Smart Grid, Electronic Voting, Cyber  Physical and Industrial Control Systems, Health Information  Technology, and the National Public Safety Broadband  Network. The group produces standards and guidelines  through the Federal Information Security Management Act  (FISMA) implementation program to help federal agencies  build strong cybersecurity risk management programs. In  each of these program areas, the group extends outreach  to stakeholders across federal, state, and local governments;  industry; academia; small businesses; and the public. The  SOIG also leads several broad cybersecurity awareness,  training, education, and outreach efforts, including the  National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE),  the Federal Computer Security Managers’ Forum, and the  Federal Information Systems Security Educators’ Association  (FISSEA).  Key to the group’s success is the ability to interact  with a broad constituency to ensure that SOIG’s program is  consistent with national objectives related to or impacted  by information security. Through open and transparent  public engagement, collaboration, and cooperation, the  group works to address critical cybersecurity challenges,  enable greater U.S. industrial competitiveness, and facilitate  the practical implementation of scalable and sustainable  information security standards and practices.

OVERVIEW: Federal agencies, industry, and the public rely on  cryptography for the protection of the information and  communications used in electronic commerce, the critical  infrastructure, and other application areas. The STVMG  supports the testing and validation of the underlying  cryptographic modules and cryptographic algorithms  based upon established standards. These cryptographic  modules and algorithms enable products and systems to  provide security services, such as confidentiality, integrity  protection, and authentication. Although cryptography  provides security, poor designs or weak algorithms can  render a product insecure and place highly sensitive  information at risk. When protecting sensitive data, federal  agencies require assurance that cryptographic products  meet established security requirements and use only tested  and validated cryptographic modules.  STVMG’s testing-focused activities include validating  cryptographic algorithm implementations, cryptographic  modules, and Security Content Automation Protocol  (SCAP)-enabled products; developing test suites and test  methods; providing implementation guidance and technical  support to industry forums; and conducting education,  training, and outreach programs.  STVMG’s validation programs work together with  independent cryptographic and security testing laboratories  accredited by the NIST National Voluntary Laboratory  Accreditation Program (NVLAP). Based on the independent  laboratory test report and test evidence, the Validation  Program validates an implementation under test. NIST  publishes lists of awarded validations through public  websites.

Title III of the E-Government Act, entitled  the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)  of 2002, included the duties and responsibilities for the  National Institute of Standards and Technology, Information  Technology Laboratory, Computer Security Division (CSD).  In December 2014, the 113th Congress updated FISMA as the  Federal Information Security Modernization Act (Public Law  113-283). NIST CSD responsibilities were unchanged in the  update. In 2015, CSD addressed its assignments through the  following activities:  •  One final Federal Information Processing Standard  (FIPS) was issued: FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permu- tation-Based Hash and Extendable-Output Functions,  which specifies the Secure Hash Algorithm-3 (SHA-3)  family of functions on binary data. Each of the SHA- 3 functions is based on an instance of the Keccak  algorithm that NIST selected as the winner of the  SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm Competition.  (Note: FIPS 186 4, Digital Signature Standard (DSS),  which was published in 2013, was updated in 2015 to  require the implementation of either FIPS 186 or FIPS  202 wherever a secure hash algorithm is required for  Federal applications.)  •  Thirty draft and final NIST Special Publications (SP)  were issued that provide management, operational,  and technical security guidelines in areas such as trust- worthy email, media sanitization, protecting controlled  unclassified information, supply chain risk manage- ment, assessing security and privacy controls, cryp- tographic algorithms and key lengths, key manage- ment systems, cyber threat information sharing, virtual  machine protection, secure hypervisor deployment,  random number generation, personal identity verifica- tion (PIV) (interfaces, credentials,  card application and  middleware), industrial control systems, the national  checklist program, vetting the security of mobile appli- cations, a biometric conformance testing methodology  framework, attribute-based access control, access  management for electric utilities, and securing elec- tronic health records on mobile devices.  •  Eighteen draft and final NIST Interagency/Internal  Reports (NISTIR) were issued on a variety of topics,  including the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in  Cyberspace (NSTIC) pilots for catalyzing the identity  ecosystem, the proceedings of a symposium for cyber- security for direct digital manufacturing, a summary  of the executive technical workshop on improving  cybersecurity and consumer privacy and the next steps  in the process, risk management for replication devices,  considerations for identity management in public-safe- ty mobile networks, a summary of a public-safety  mobile-application security requirements workshop,  privacy risk management, cardholder authentication  for the PIV digital signature key, derived PIV creden- tials proof-of-concept research, an advanced metering  infrastructure smart meter upgradeability test frame- work, a report on strategic U.S. Government engage- ment in international standardization to achieve U.S.  objectives for cybersecurity, guidelines for the creation  of interoperable software identification (SWID) tags, a  security content automation protocol (SCAP) Version  1.2 content style guide about best practices for creating  and maintaining SCAP 1.2 content, de-identification  of personally identifiable information, the security of  interactive and automated access management using  secure shell (SSH), a proof-of-concept implementation  of trusted geolocation in the cloud, and fundamentals  of small business information security.  •  Continued the successful collaboration with the  Department of Defense (DOD), the Intelligence Com- munity (IC), and the Committee on National Security  Systems (CNSS), in partnership with the Joint Task  Force (JTF) Transformation Initiative. Five Special Pub- lications are currently recognized as JTF publications,  and the JTF partners continue to develop and update  key cybersecurity guidelines for protecting federal  information and information systems as part of the  Unified Information Security Framework through CSD’s  FISMA Implementation Project.  •  Continued to develop expertise in several critical  research areas, such as post-quantum cryptography  (PQC), elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), privacy-en- hancing cryptography, and lightweight cryptographic  schemes for constrained environments.  •  Performed research and conducted outreach on stan- dards, practices, and technologies to enable prompt  and effective threat information sharing, hardware  roots of trust for mobile devices, Internet of things,  combinatorial testing techniques, cloud computing and  virtualization, risk management, identity management,  access control and authorization management, and  software assurance.

This EO directed NIST to work with  stakeholders to develop a voluntary framework – based on  existing standards, guidelines, and practices − for reducing  cybersecurity risks to the critical infrastructure.  The Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) that was develop-  ed provides a prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance- based, and cost-effective approach to help critical  infrastructure owners, operators and other interested  entities identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity-related  risk, while protecting business confidentiality, individual  privacy, and civil liberties.  In FY 2015, NIST continued to work with a diverse stake- holder community to support CSF use and understanding.  This process included:  •  Hosting a workshop at the University of South Florida  in Tampa to share initial CSF experiences;  •  Updating the CSF Web site with a catalog of industry  resources, upcoming NIST speaking events, and an  extensive frequently-asked-question knowledge base;  •  Coordinating with critical infrastructure owners and  operators, regulators, and other industry organizations  through a variety of meetings and industry events to  ensure understanding and use;  •  Analyzing various industry work products, such as  mapping documents, for CSF correctness;  •  Consulting with state and local governments, and the  governments of other nations regarding their align- ment with both the principles and the cybersecurity  outcomes of the CSF;  •  Consulting with international organizations and stan- dards bodies to demonstrate and ensure continued  alignment with voluntary international standards; and  •  Working with both industry and regulatory organiza- tions to apply the CSF in ways that bring efficiencies to  the regulatory process.  Since the release of the Framework, NIST’s primary  goal has been to raise awareness of the Framework and  encourage its use as a tool to help industry sectors and  organizations manage cybersecurity risks. NIST has  strengthened its collaboration with critical infrastructure  owners and operators, industry leaders, government  partners, and other stakeholders, building on previous  years’ interactions that were crucial to the Framework’s  development.  In FY 2016, NIST will continue to conduct stakeholder  outreach and will work collaboratively to further understand  stakeholder needs regarding tools and resources to enable  more effective use of the Framework.  NIST will also publish  guidance on how NIST’s Risk Management Framework  (SP 800-37 revision 1) and the Cybersecurity Framework  complement each other. Additionally, NIST will formally  gather stakeholder input about Framework use, evolution,  and future management through a request for information  (RFI).  Following the RFI, NIST will conduct a public  workshop at NIST in Gaithersburg, Maryland on April 6  and 7, 2016. Periodic program updates will be provided  through the Framework website.

(see http://www.iec.ch/about/).  Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) was formed by ISO  and IEC to be responsible for international standardization in  the field of Information Technology (see http://www.iso.org/ iso/jtc1_home.html). JTC 1 develops, maintains, promotes,  and facilitates the IT standards required by global markets,  meeting business and user requirements concerning:  •  Design and development of IT systems and tools;  •  Performance and quality of IT products and systems;  •  Security of IT systems and information;  •  Portability of application programs;  •  Interoperability of IT products and systems;  •  Unified tools and environments;  •  Harmonized IT vocabulary; and  •  User-friendly and ergonomically designed user inter- faces.  JTC 1 consists of a number of subcommittees (SCs) and  working groups that address specific technologies. SCs that  produce standards relating to IT security include:  •  SC 06 - Telecommunications and Information Exchange  Between Systems;  •  SC 17 - Cards and Personal Identification;  •  SC 27 - IT Security Techniques; and  •  SC 37 – Biometrics (Note: Fernando Podio, NIST CSD,  served as Chair).  JTC 1 also has:  •  Technical Committee 68 – Financial Services;  •  SC 2 - Operations and Procedures, including Security;  •  SC 4 – Securities;  •  SC 6 - Financial Transaction Cards, Related Media and  Operations;  •  SC 7 – Software and Systems Engineering; and  •  SC 38 – Distributed application platforms and services  (DAPS).  The American National  Standards  Institute (ANSI)  The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is a  private, nonprofit (501(c)(3)) organization that administers  and coordinates the U.S. voluntary standardization  and conformity assessment system, and facilitates the  development of American National Standards (ANSs) by  accrediting the procedures of SDOs.  ANSI promotes the use of U.S. standards internationally,  advocates U.S. policy and technical positions in international  and regional standards organizations, and encourages the  adoption of international standards as national standards  where they meet the needs of the U.S. user community.  ANSI is the sole U.S. representative and dues-paying  member of the two major non-treaty international standards  organizations: ISO and, via the United States National  Committee (USNC), the IEC.  INCITS is an ANSI-accredited SDO that serves as  the ANSI Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for ISO/IEC  Joint Technical Committee 1. INCITS is sponsored by the  Information Technology Industry (ITI) Council, a trade  association representing the leading U.S. providers of  information technology products and services.  INCITS is organized into Technical Committees that  focus on the creation of standards for different technology  areas. Technical committees that focus on IT security and IT  security-related technologies, or that may require separate  security standards include:  •  B10 – Identification Cards and Related Devices;  •  CS1 – Cyber Security (Dan Benigni, NIST CSD, Chair; Sal  Francomacaro, NIST CSD, Vice Chair and NIST Principal  Voting Member);  •  E22 – Item Authentication;  •  M1 – Biometrics (Fernando Podio, NIST CSD, Chair);  •  T3 – Open Distributed Processing (ODP);  •  T6 – Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Technology;  •  GIT1 – Governance of IT; and  •  DAPS38 – Distributed Application Platforms and Ser- vices.  As a technical committee of INCITS, CS1 develops  national, ANSI-accredited standards in the area of  cybersecurity. Its scope encompasses:  •  Management of information security and systems;  •  Management of third-party information security service  providers;  •  Intrusion detection;  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Several members of NIST’s CSD staff contribute to  CS1’s national and international IT security standards efforts  through its membership in CS1.  CSD’s Role in  Cybersecurity  Standardization  CSD’s cybersecurity research also plays a direct role  in the Cybersecurity Standardization efforts of CS1 at the  national level. The following is a description of the national- level progress achieved during FY 2015 by CSD and CS1.  The NIST Policy Machine research and development  effort has resulted in three ongoing national standards  projects in CS1 in the early stages of development. They  include:  •  Next Generation Access Control –Functional Architec- ture (NGAC-FA), project number INCITS 499-2013, was  published in FY 2013 and is recently beginning an early  revision.  •  Next Generation Access Control – Generic Operations  & Abstract Data Structures (NGAC-GOADS). Serban  Gavrila, NIST CSD, is the editor. The project is assigned  project number 2195-D, and the document (planned for  publication in FY 2016) has successfully completed two  public review periods.  •  Next Generation Access Control -Implementation  Requirements, Protocols and API Definitions (NGAC-IR- PADS). Project number is 2193-D has been assigned.  Sal Francomacaro also served as cybersecurity stand- ards coordinator in CSD.

CSD actively partici- pates in the INCITS B10 committee, which is focused on the  interoperability of Identification Cards and Related Devices.  CSD has contributed and provided valuable feedback to  many INCITS B10 standards during the development process.  In addition, CSD also actively participates in the B10.8 and  B10.12 committees.  The INCITS/B10.8 committee works on International  Driver’s License standards and serves as the U.S. Technical  Advisory Group (TAG) to the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 Working  Group (WG) 10 efforts on the International Standardization  of Driver’s License documents. The B10.12 committee  develops interoperable standards for Integrated Circuit  Cards with Contacts, and serves as the U.S. TAG for the  international ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 17 Working Groups 4 and 11.  During FY 2015, Mr. Francomacaro served as the U.S. Head  of delegation to ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 17 WG4 and WG11.  CSD provides technical and editorial support in the  development of national and international standards.  Specifically, Mr. Ketan Mehta, a CSD staff member, serves  as the technical editor of ANSI 504-1, Generic Identity  Command Set (GICS). GICS enables PIV, PIV-Interoperable  (PIV-I) and Common Access Card (CAC) applications, and  others, to be built from a single platform. GICS defines  an open platform where identity applications can be  instantiated, deployed, and used in an interoperable way  between the credential issuers and credential users. During  FY 2015, an amendment process was started on INCITS 504  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

CSD staff also provided significant input to the standards  of major interest to U.S. government agencies and U.S.  markets. CSD played a role in the development and revision  of:  •  ISO/IEC 7816 (Identification Cards, Integrated Circuit  Cards);  •  ISO/IEC 18013 (Personal Identification, ISO Compliant  Driving License);  •  ISO/IEC 19286 (Identification cards, Privacy-enhancing  protocols and services);  •  Doc 9303-10 LDS 2 (Machine Readable Travel Docu- ments Logical Data Structure for Storage of Data in  Contactless Interface);  •  ISO/IEC 24727 (Identification Cards, Integrated Circuit  Card Programming Interfaces); and  •  ISO/IEC 24787 (Biometrics “Match On Card” Compari- son).  During FY 2016, the INCITS B10 committee, along with  the active collaboration of CSD staff, plans to:  •  Publish Part 3 of INCITS 504;  •  Complete the amendment process for INCITS 504 Part  1 and 2;  •  Contribute to the publication of several revisions of the  ISO/IEC 7816 family of standards (all relevant to FIPS  201 specifications);  •  Pursue the standardization and harmonization of iden- tity standards developed in the U.S.;  •  Develop requirements and identify standards gaps for  Mobile Driving Licenses;  •  Enhance the Machine Readable Travel Documents  (ePassport) data model to address privacy and security  concerns; and  •  Contribute to the development of privacy-enhanced  security protocols.  CSD staff will continue to actively support relevant ID  management standard initiatives, such as ISO/IEC 19286  (Integrated Circuit Card (ICC) Privacy-enhancing protocols  and services) and ISO/IEC 18328 (ICC managed Devices).  CSD’s investment in these activities is motivated by new  technical ideas that emerge from these ISO standards. For  example, INCITS 504 is an ID platform that leverages the FIPS  201 infrastructure to support a large number of government  and enterprise initiatives. In particular, INCITS 504 aims to  support initiatives such as the National Strategy for Trusted  Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC). ISO/IEC 24727 aims to  create an interoperability framework that increases the  resilience and scalability of identity management solutions  and to foster domestic and international interoperability.

Where  international standards are needed, NIST works closely  with U.S. industry, standards developers, other government  agencies, and leaders in the global standards community  to develop standards that will support secure cloud  computing.  As part of this program, Ms. Annie Sokol, CSD, provides  technical and editorial representation in the development  of national and international standards in both SC 27 and  SC38. She was the convener for ISO/IEC 17788 Information  technology – Cloud Computing Overview and vocabulary,  which is the normative reference to other published and  under-development.

These  efforts bring consistent testing of cryptographic modules  to the global community by providing ISO-equivalent  standards representing FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements  for Cryptographic Modules and Derived Test Requirements  [DTR] for FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements for Crypto- graphic Modules.  ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 Working Group (WG) 3 completed  and published revisions of ISO/IEC 19790:2006 and ISO/ IEC 24759:2008, for which Mr. Randall J. Easter of CSD  was the principal editor. The revision of ISO/IEC 19790  was published on August 15, 2012. The revision of ISO/IEC  24759 was published on January 31, 2014. Both ISO/IEC  standards were also adopted by the American National  Standards Institute (ANSI). The two ISO/IEC revisions were  developed with international support and the collaboration  of governments, industry and academia. Revised corrections  of both standards were published on December 15, 2015.  The revision of ISO/IEC 19790:2012 addresses new  security areas such as: defined software module boundaries;  degraded modes of operation; trusted channels; two- factor authentication; software security; mitigation of fault  induction and side-channel attacks; operational self-tests  for algorithms; and life-cycle assurance from design to  end-of-life.  Figure 2 is a chart of the ISO/IEC standards,  as explained above, in which CSD has played a part during  the development process.  In addition to the aforementioned standards, the  Technical Standard (TS) ISO/IEC TS 30104:2015, Physical  Security Attacks, Mitigation Techniques and Security  Requirements, for which Mr. Easter was the editor, was  published on May 15, 2015.  Physical security mechanisms are employed by  cryptographic modules where the protection of the module’s  sensitive security parameters are desired. ISO/IEC 30104  addresses how to express security assurance for products  where the risk of the security environment requires the  support of such mechanisms. This Technical Specification  addresses the following topics:  •  A survey of physical security attacks directed against  different types of hardware embodiments, including  a description of known physical attacks, ranging from  simple attacks that require minimal skill or resources, to  complex attacks that require trained, technical people  and considerable resources;  •  Guidance on the principles, best practices and tech- niques for the design of tamper protection mechanisms  and methods for the mitigation of those attacks; and  •  Guidance on the evaluation or testing of hardware tam- per protection mechanisms and references to current  standards and test programs that address hardware  tamper evaluation and testing.

CSD’s contributions to the development of these  international standards create a strong foundation for the  adoption of and migration from currently used national  standards. In particular, this adoption will promote  international harmonization for the implementation and  testing of cryptographic algorithms and modules, while  accommodating individual country preferences in the choice  of approved security functions. CSD published a Federal  Register notice in August 2015 seeking public comment  for migrating from FIPS 140-2 to ISO/IEC 19790:2012.  The  comment period ended September 2015 (see https:// federalregister.gov/a/2015-19743).  For More Information, See:  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/  CONTACT: Mr. Randall J.

During FY 2015, the CSD FISMA Implementation project  continued to strengthen collaboration through the Joint Task  Force (JTF) Transformation Initiative, which includes the  Department of Defense (DOD), the Intelligence Community  (IC), and the Committee on National Security Systems  (CNSS), and other federal agencies. The JTF partners  continue to develop and update key cybersecurity guidelines  for protecting federal information and information systems  as part of the Unified Information Security Framework.  Previously, the JTF developed common security guidance  in the critical areas of security controls for information  systems and organizations, security assessment procedures  to demonstrate security control effectiveness, security  authorizations for risk acceptance decisions, and continuous  monitoring activities to ensure that decision makers receive  the most up-to-date information on the security state of  their information systems. In addition, CSD worked with  the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Risk  and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), a  government-wide program that provides a standardized  approach to security assessment, authorization, and  continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. The  team developed a high-impact security control baseline  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

In FY 2015, the CSD FISMA Implementation project staff  worked on the following initiatives:  •  Risk Management Guidelines: SP 800-53 Revision 4,  Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information  Systems and Organizations, provides organizations  with the security controls necessary to appropriately  strengthen their information systems and the environ- ments in which those systems operate, and provides a  process for selecting the appropriate controls, which  contributes to systems that are resilient in the face of  attacks and other threats. This “Build It Right” strategy  is reinforced with the ongoing work on the Second  Public Draft of SP 800-160, Systems Security Engineer- ing: An Integrated Approach to Building Trustworthy  Resilient Systems. The implementation of SPs 800-53  and 800-160, combined with the implementation of  SP 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Management  Framework to Federal Information Systems, and SP  800 137, Information Security Continuous Monitoring  for Federal Information Systems and Organizations,  provide organizations with near real-time information  that is essential for senior leaders making ongoing  risk-based decisions affecting their critical missions and  business functions.  •  Guidelines for a Role-Based Information Security  Training Model: SP 800 16, A Role-Based Model for  Federal Information Technology/Cybersecurity Train- ing, describes a process for developing information  technology/cybersecurity role-based training. Its pri- mary focus is to provide a comprehensive, yet flexible,  methodology for the development of training courses  or modules for personnel who have been identified as  having significant information technology/cybersecu- rity responsibilities within agencies.  Agencies can use  SP 800-16 to tailor the Role-Based Security Training to  meet the needs of their own organization.  •  FISMA Outreach Activity to Public and Private Sector  Organizations: Cybersecurity outreach briefings were  conducted and support provided to all levels of govern- ment (federal, state and local), as well as private sector  organizations, on multiple information security topics  of interest. These include, for example, effective imple- mentation of the NIST RMF, contingency planning, in- terconnection security agreements, and information se- curity for small businesses. In addition, the CSD FISMA  implementation project staff conducted outreach activ- ities with academic institutions, providing information  on NIST’s security standards and guidelines, exploring  new areas of cybersecurity research and development,  and serving on cybersecurity advisory panels.  •  Collaboration with JTF partners and other federal  organizations: CSD staff worked closely with JTF part- ners on continued cooperation and planning to ensure  that the five JTF publications remain current, and on  the designation of additional special publications as  JTF guidance. The CSD FISMA implementation project  staff also collaborated with DOD, IC, the Department  of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Emergen- cy Management Agency (FEMA), the Government  Accountability Office (GAO), OMB, GSA, the Small Busi- ness Administration (SBA), and the Inspector Generals  (IGs) on multiple projects to ensure consistency with  FISMA-related guidance and to protect information in a  way that is commensurate with risk.  In FY 2015, the CSD FISMA Implementation project staff  completed the following activities:  •  Published the final version of SP 800-53A, Revision  4, Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal  Information Systems and Organizations;  •  Published both Initial Public Draft (IPD) and final ver- sions of SP 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified  Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and  Organizations, to provide guidance to federal agencies  for the protection of Controlled Unclassified Informa- tion when such information is resident in nonfederal  information systems and organizations;  •  Published an errata version of SP 800-53, Revision 4 to  make necessary clarifications and ensure consistency  with subsequently published/revised NIST SPs and  new/updated federal policy requirements;  •  Continued collaboration with DHS to develop a multi- ple-volume Interagency Report on Automation Support  for Ongoing Assessments, which is based on NIST stan- dards and guidelines; and  •  Continued the development of preliminary drafts of SP  800-18 Revision 2, Guide for Developing Security Plans  for Federal Information Systems and Organizations  and SP 800-60 Revision 2, Guide for Mapping Types  of Information and Information Systems to Security  Categories.  In FY 2016, CSD FISMA Implementation project staff  intend to:  •  Finalize SP 800-160, Systems Security Engineering: An  Integrated Approach to Building Trustworthy Resilient  Systems;  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

These test tools are  developed to promote the adoption of these standards  and to support users that require conformance to selected  biometric standards, product developers and testing labs.  CSD’s project team contributes to the development of  biometric standards and participates in the INCITS Technical  Committee M1 – Biometrics and ISO/IEC Joint Technical  Committee (JTC) 1 Subcommittee (SC) 37 – Biometrics  standards bodies. CSD plans to continue this work in FY 2016.  In FY 2015, Biometric Conformance Test Software  (BioCTS) for ANSI/NIST-ITL (which targets biometric  transactions based on NIST SP 500-290, and SP 500-290  Revision 1 - Data Format for the Interchange of Fingerprint,  Facial & Other Biometric Information) received a substantial  update. Version 2.0 of the testing software was released and  added support for testing for the remaining traditionally  encoded record types not previously supported (+12 for  ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2011, and +18 for ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2011  Update: 2013). Version 2.0 now supports all traditionally  encoded biometric record types between the two versions  of the published ANSI/NIST-ITL standards. Additionally,  Version 2.0 added many enhanced editing features for  traditionally encoded biometric transactions – some new  features include: adding and removing records and fields,  arranging records and fields, automatically sorting records,  displaying the biometric sample image, and enhanced  binary data editing features. In addition to the enhanced  editing features, BioCTS for ANSI/NIST-ITL received many  usability enhancements, as well as updates to some core  software functionality, providing a more usable and robust  testing tool.  As illustrated in Figure 3, a new feature of BioCTS is the  display of the biometric sample, when possible, so that the  user can get visual feedback on the biometric data that is  under test. The update provides a rich editing environment  for binary/traditionally encoded transactions and files,  which are difficult for humans to read. Version 2.0 provides  a user-friendly way to see each field within a transaction/ file, associated test results, and allows for the modification  of data (as shown in Figure 4.)  All of the new features are  detailed in the BioCTS for ANSI/NIST-ITL v2 User Guide (see:  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/BiomResCenter/CTA_BETA/ BioCTS_AN_ITL_v2_Guide.pdf).

A number of technical contributions towards the  development of ANSI/NIST and international standards  were submitted. They included technical contributions on  international biometric data interchange formats and their  associated conformance testing methodologies, as well  as on SP 500-290 Revision 1 and the associated National  Information Exchange Model (NIEM) Extensible Markup  Language (XML) Schema (see https://tools.niem.gov).  Outreach efforts in FY 2015 in support of biometric  standards development and conformity assessment  included test tool contributions for the standards developers  (in support of ongoing development projects), and  presentations on ANSI/NIST and international biometric  standards and related conformity assessment activities.  The  work included the development of technical publications,  the review of research papers for external publications,  and participation in conference program committees.

Specifically, CSD supports the  effort by providing cybersecurity and privacy experts who  help leverage existing resources and address CPS-specific  cybersecurity and privacy challenges. Such challenges are  related to personalized health care, emergency response,  traffic flow management, and electric power generation  and delivery, and many other emerging technical areas.  Other phrases that are often referenced along with CPS  technologies include:  • Internet of Things (IoT);  • Industrial Internet;  • Smart Cities;  • Smart Grid; and  •  “Smart” Anything (e.g., Cars, Buildings, Homes, Manu- facturing, Hospitals, Appliances) (see http://www.nist. gov/cps/).  Composed of heterogeneous, potentially distributed  components and systems, CPS provides a promise of  increased efficiency and interaction between the digital and  physical worlds. However, assuring that these emerging and  evolving systems are reliable, robust, resilient, trustworthy,  secure, and that they protect the privacy of information  (to only list a few concerns) poses a unique cybersecurity  challenge.  CPS present unique challenges, including the need  for integration with legacy components and allowance for  emerging technologies, and real-time response in support of  extremely high availability, predictability, and reliability.  Cybersecurity is an important crosscutting discipline  that is critical to the safe and resilient design, development  and operation of CPS. Addressing the opportunities  and challenges of CPS requires a broad collaboration to  develop a common foundation, including a consensus  definition, vocabulary, reference architecture, and a  shared understanding of the essential roles of timing,  cybersecurity and data interoperability. CSD is researching  the cybersecurity needs of the broader landscape of CPS  by leveraging CSD’s expertise in cybersecurity in different  domains and applications of CPS (such as industrial control  systems, the smart grid, hardware-enabled security, and  embedded systems).  In June 2014, NIST established the CPS Public Working  Group (PWG), which is open to all, to foster and capture  inputs from those involved in CPS, both nationally and  globally. CSD is working in collaboration with NIST’s  Engineering Laboratory (EL) Smart Grid and Cyber-Physical  Systems Program Office, NIST’s Physical Measurement  Laboratory Time and Frequency Division, ITL’s Software  and Systems Division and ITL’s Advanced Networking  Technologies Division to lead a working group of govern- ment, academic, and industry stakeholders. The CPS PWG  consists of five technical subgroups:  • Definition, Vocabulary, and Reference Architecture;  • Use Cases;  • Cybersecurity and Privacy;  • Data Interoperability; and  • Timing and Synchronization.  Each subgroup consists of co-leaders from academia,  industry and NIST. CSD co-leads the Cybersecurity and  Privacy subgroup that is focused on identifying strategies  for cybersecurity and privacy in CPS, and is working  collaboratively with the other subgroups to ensure that  cybersecurity is included as a design principle during  development.  In September 2015, the CPS PWG published the Draft  Framework for CPS that includes the work of the five  technical subgroups. The document reflects more than a  year’s effort by the CPS PWG, which includes a few hundred  members drawn primarily from industry, academia and  government. In 2016, the CPS PWG will collect and analyze  the comments to the draft and publish the next version of the  CPS Framework. The CPS PWG deliverables are technology  and business-model neutral, and freely available online and  intended for open use by all stakeholders.  Additionally, in 2015, CSD, in conjunction with NIST’s  Engineering Laboratory, Intelligent Systems Division,  finalized SP 800-82 Revision 2, Guide to Industrial Control  Systems Security. CSD will also continue to participate in the  International Society of Automation (ISA) 99 Committee,  which develops and establishes standards, recommended  practices, technical reports, and related information that  define procedures for implementing electronically secure  industrial automation and control systems and security  practices, and for assessing electronic security performance.

CSD remained committed to the value of  communicating its R&D efforts to other federal colleagues  and identifying the opportunities to support R&D efforts  throughout the Federal Government.  In FY 2015, the NITRD Cyber Security and Information  Assurance (CSIA) Interagency Working Group (IWG)  monthly meetings provided an opportunity to learn and  share information about NIST’s ongoing research with  federal program managers of cybersecurity research (see  https://www.nitrd.gov/nitrdgroups/index.php?title=Cyber_ Security_and_Information_Assurance_Interagency_ Working_Group_(CSIA_IWG)#title). The Cybersecurity  Enhancement Act of 2014 requested the development of  a new federal cybersecurity research and development  strategic plan, and NIST was a consistent presence at the  regular development meetings for the new plan that is  intended for release during the month of February 2016.  (see Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 https:// www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1353/ text, and see strategic plan https://www.whitehouse.gov/ sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/2016_Federal_ Cybersecurity_Research_and_Development_Stratgeic_ Plan.pdf).  FY 2015 also included the development of a National  Privacy Research Strategy by the members of the National  Privacy Research Forum (see https://www.nitrd.gov/ cybersecurity/nationalprivacyresearchstrategy.aspx).  Naomi Lefkowitz, Senior Privacy Policy Advisor at NIST, and  Simson Garfinkel, Senior Advisor in the Information Access  Division, shared NIST’s focus on privacy and brought their  expertise to the development process for the privacy R&D  plan that will be published in FY 2016.  NIST regularly attended the NITRD CSIA Senior  Steering Group meetings to share and stay connected with  opportunities that supported the development of the new  strategic plan for cybersecurity R&D and participated in  panel presentations to which the SSG was invited to describe  federal directions in cybersecurity R&D at relevant forums  and conferences (see https://www.nitrd.gov/nitrdgroups/ index.php?title=Cyber_Security_Information_Assurance_ Research_and_Development_Senior_Steering_Group_ (CSIA_R%26D_SSG)#title).  CSD is also a regular participant in the coordination  activities of the federal Special Cyber Operations  Research and Engineering (SCORE) Committee. SCORE  enables technology transfer through the sharing of NIST  cybersecurity expertise and publications with researchers  throughout the Federal Government. The SCORE committee  interacts with federal leaders and reports to the National  Science & Technology Council’s Committee on Homeland &  National Security. In FY 2015, NIST expertise in supply chain  risk management and cryptography was included in SCORE  reports.

HAVA established the Election  Assistance Commission (EAC) and the Technical Guidelines  Development Committee (TGDC), chaired by the Director of  NIST. HAVA directs NIST to provide technical support to the  EAC and TGDC in efforts related to human factors, security,  and laboratory accreditation. As part of NIST’s efforts,  CSD supports the activities of the EAC related to voting  equipment security.  In the past year, NIST continued to support the EAC  in finalizing changes to the Voluntary Voting System  Guidelines (VVSG) 1.1. These changes sought to improve  the auditability of voting systems, provide greater software  integrity protections, expand and improve access-control  requirements, and help ensure that cryptographic security  mechanisms are implemented properly. The EAC approved  these updates to the VVSG in March 2015.  In addition, NIST  completed a set of draft test assertions for the security  requirements in the VVSG.

Initial efforts on the next-generation of the VVSG have  already begun.  In February, NIST and the EAC sponsored  the second Future of Voting Systems Symposium.  This  symposium brought together election officials, voting  system manufacturers, voting system test laboratories,  standards developers, academics, and federal, state, and  local government officials to discuss emerging trends in  voting.  The discussions at this workshop are being used  to define the scope and priorities for the next-generation  guidelines.  In FY 2016, NIST and the EAC will establish a set of  public working groups to inform the development of a new  version of the VVSG.  NIST and EAC goals are to accelerate  the development and adoption of the VVSG by leading these  working groups in close consultation with election officials,  the federal and private sectors, standards bodies and EAC  committees, academic researchers, and other members  of the public. These working groups will focus on voting  system technology areas, including accessibility, usability,  interoperability, security, and testing and certification.

HIT leads to improvements in healthcare quality,  reduced medical errors, increased efficiencies in health care  delivery and administration, and improved health for the  general population. Central to reaching these goals is the  assurance of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of  health information. CSD works with government, industry,  academia, and others to provide security tools, technologies,  and methodologies that provide for the security and privacy  of health information.  NIST CSD continued its HIT security outreach efforts  in FY 2015. NIST and the Department of Health and Human  Services’ (DHHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) co-hosted the  eighth annual Health Insurance Portability and Accountability  Act (HIPAA) Security Rule conference, Safeguarding Health  Information: Building Assurance through HIPAA Security, in  September 2015 in Washington, D.C. The conference offered  important sessions that focused on broad topics of interest  to the healthcare and health IT security community. Over  600 in-person and virtual attendees from federal, state,  and local governments, academia, HIPAA-covered entities  and business associates, industry groups, and vendors  heard from, and interacted with, healthcare, security, and  privacy experts on technologies and methodologies for  safeguarding health information and for implementing the  requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule. Presentations and  panel discussions covered a variety of security management  and technical assurance topics, including:  •  Collaborative approaches for securing medical devices;  •  Vulnerabilities in medical devices and control systems;  •  Business associate liability;  •  Information sharing and threat intelligence;  •  Data recovery and security plans; and  •  Securing electronic health records on mobile devices.  The keynote addresses were delivered by Jocelyn  Samuels, Director, DHHS/OCR, and Dr. Cris Ewell, Chief  Information Security Officer at Seattle Children’s Hospital.  In FY 2016, NIST will work with diverse healthcare  stakeholders, including partners in government and  industry, to support security capabilities in new areas,  such as the Precision Medicine Initiative, and identify  opportunities to strengthen the sector’s cybersecurity risk  management efforts through the application of the NIST  Cybersecurity Framework.

These  technologies increasingly rely on a supply-chain ecosystem  that is long, complex, variable, interconnected, globally  distributed, and geographically diverse. Outsourcing the  development, maintenance, management, and disposal of  data and ICT is increasingly common.  These trends have caused organizations acquiring  technology to experience a lack of visibility throughout the  supply chain (see Figure 5). Such organizations need a better  understanding of how the technology being acquired was  developed, integrated and deployed. These organizations  also need to better understand the processes, procedures,  and practices used to assure the integrity, security, resilience,  and quality of the products and services being obtained. This  lack of visibility and understanding, in turn, has decreased  the acquiring organization’s ability to effectively manage  risk inherited from the supply chain.  The Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) program  seeks to provide organizations with a standardized and  repeatable toolkit of technical and intelligence resources to  strategically manage supply-chain risk throughout the entire  lifecycle of systems, products and services.  In FY 2015, CSD finalized and published NIST SP 800- 161, Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal  Information Systems and Organizations. This document  builds on existing NIST guidance to help federal departments  and agencies identify, assess and mitigate ICT supply-chain  risk at all organizational levels.  When NIST researched and developed the Framework  for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, which  was published in February 2014, cyber supply-chain risk  management (CSCRM) was identified as an area needing  further research and guidance (see the NIST Roadmap  for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, also  published in February 2014). In FY 2015, CSD initiated a  project on industry best practices for CSCRM. Initial research  was developed into company case studies spanning multiple  business sectors. The studies will be analyzed to support a  workshop, and a final publication is planned for FY 2016.

The working group  evolved from the White House’s Comprehensive National  Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) 11, Develop a Multi-Pronged  Approach for Global Supply Chain Risk Management, which  ended in 2014. In FY 2015, the co-chairs began the process  of formalizing the working group under the auspices of the  CNSS.  CSD continued working with partners through the  Software and Supply Chain Assurance (SSCA) Forum, co- sponsoring four multi-day workshops. The SSCA Working  Group (WG) is a key public-private partnership that meets  quarterly to discuss current projects, tools, resources, and  lessons learned regarding CSCRM. The SSCA WG is co- sponsored by NIST, GSA, DoD and DHS.  In FY 2016, CSD will:  •  Continue working on Industry Best Practices for Cyber  Supply Chain Management, including hosting a two- day workshop, developing cyber supply-chain stan- dards mappings to the Cybersecurity Framework, as  well as a strategy to better integrate the supply-chain  management and information security functions in or- ganizations; the various pieces of the research project  will culminate in a draft guidance document;  •  Continue to co-chair the interagency working group on  cyber supply-chain risk management;  •  Begin research to demonstrate cause and effect rela- tionships between cyber supply-chain capability/ma- turity levels and organizational performance outcomes  over time; and  •  Research metrics for use in supply chain risk manage- ment.

One portion  of this legislation calls for the  establishment of a nationwide,  interoperable public-safety broad- band network based on the  3rd Generation Partnership Project’s  (3GPP) Long-Term Evolution (LTE)  technology. The network will be  deployed and operated by the First  Responder Network Authority  (FirstNet). The planned NPSBN will  “create a much needed nationwide interoperable broadband  network that will help police, firefighters, emergency medical  service professionals and other public safety officials stay  safe and do their jobs.” (see http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ category/public-safety). NIST is directed to establish a list  of certified devices and required components to be used  by public-safety officials, vendors, and other interested  parties for interacting with the nationwide network. NIST  is also directed to conduct research and development  that supports the acceleration and advancement of the  nationwide network.  In FY 2015, CSD supported the joint National  Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)  and NIST Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR)  program with efforts in public-safety mobile-application  security, identity management, and enabling cybersecurity  capabilities on the PSCR 700 MHz LTE network located in  Boulder, Colorado (see http://www.pscr.gov). In June 2015,  CSD, in cooperation with the Association of Public-Safety  Communications Officials (APCO) International and FirstNet,  held a half-day workshop titled “Identifying and Categorizing  Data Types for Public Safety Mobile Applications.” The  outcome of that workshop will be captured in a forthcoming  NIST publication in FY 2016. At PSCR’s Annual Public Safety  Broadband Stakeholder Conference, CSD organized a  panel titled “Applied Public Safety Cybersecurity Research”  highlighting PSCR’s cybersecurity activities over the previous  twelve months in the areas of identity management, mobile  application security, and LTE infrastructure cybersecurity.

In  addition, CSD developed an informational survey on mobile  application vetting services titled “Mobile Application  Vetting Services for Public Safety” and Draft NISTIR 8080,  Usability and Security Considerations for Public Safety  Mobile Authentication.  CSD participated in the standards development process  for LTE technology within the 3GPP, supporting security  requirements for public safety that are related to Proximity  Services (ProSe), Group Communication System Enablers  (GCSE), and Mission Critical Push-To-Talk (MCPTT). In  addition, CSD broadened its scope within the IETF to include  efforts related to public safety.  In FY 2016, CSD will continue representing public  safety in international standardization efforts, such as the  IETF and 3GPP. CSD will work to implement and exercise  LTE cybersecurity infrastructure capabilities in the PSCR  700 MHz LTE network, conduct research into mobile  authentication solutions to support public-safety, and  investigate mobile application-security services and  solutions to support the security requirements of public- safety mobile applications and devices. CSD will continue  to engage the public-safety communications community by  organizing workshops and conferences; and participating  in events such as APCO’s Annual Meeting, PSRC’s Annual  Public Safety Broadband Stakeholder Conference, and the  International Wireless Communications Expo (IWCE).

The  infrastructure is used to send command information across  the electric grid from generation systems to distribution  systems, and to exchange usage and billing information  between utilities and their customers. Key to the successful  deployment of the smart grid infrastructure is the  development of the cybersecurity strategy that includes  cybersecurity as a design consideration for new and  emerging systems, and an approach to adding cybersecurity  into existing systems. The electric grid is critical to the  economic and physical well-being of the nation, and  emerging cyber threats targeting power systems highlight  the need to integrate advanced  security to protect critical assets.  The Smart Grid Inter- operability Panel (SGIP) became  a membership-supported organi- zation in January 2013. The SGIP  Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG) was renamed the  Smart Grid Cybersecurity Committee (SGCC), and continues  to be led by Ms. Suzanne Lightman of the CSD in support of  responsibilities identified in the Energy Independence and  Security Act of 2007. The SGCC chair is a voting member of  the SGIP Technical Committee, and serves as an ex-officio  Director of the Board.  During the last year, staff from CSD and ITL’s Software  and Systems Division (SSD) worked on developing network  security tools that are specifically designed to support next- generation electrical power systems. They concentrated on  authenticating the provenance of multicast data streams  from emerging power system sensors, called Phasor  Measurement Units.  By authenticating the sensors to the  utility, the utility may trust that sensor measurements are  coming from the correct sensors and have not been hijacked.  Multicast authentication of sensor data is challenging,  due to the need for low security overhead, tolerance  of lossy networks, time-criticality, and high data rates.  Researchers augmented an existing authentication scheme  to accommodate high-data-rate sensor transmissions that  are unbounded in length (no session expiration). Using  dual offset key chains to reduce the authentication delay  and computational overhead associated with key chain  commitment, they developed a new protocol called inf- TESLA that meets the performance requirements imposed  by the physical dynamics of the power system.  Their key disclosure mechanism, as well as com- parative studies showing a cumulative reduction in the  communication overhead and computational cost over  existing methods, are outlined in a paper to appear at the  Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Symposium  on Applied Computing.  Significant effort was made to integrate their  authentication protocol into existing network simulation  software, specifically OPNET, thus providing potential users  the ability to evaluate the protocol on their own networks  and for their own applications.  Furthermore, in an effort to address the growing interest  in co-optimizing cyber and physical components to work  together as a system, CSD staff developed mathematical  formalism to tradeoff the sensitivity of a dynamic system  to attack or perturbation against the authentication  overhead incurred by their protocol. This formalism was  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

In FY 2016, CSD will coordinate with NIST’s Engineering  Laboratory (EL) and Smart Grid Program Office on the  further development of a Cybersecurity Smart Grid Test  Lab, part of the NIST Smart Grid Testbed Facility now  under construction. CSD will also collaborate with SSD on  cybersecurity research in relation to the IEEE 1588, Precision  Time Protocol, a time synchronization standard that is used  for the electric grid and other special-purpose industrial  automation and measurement networks.

NICE is responsive to President Obama’s declaration that  the “cyber threat is one of the most serious economic  and national security challenges we face as a nation” and  “America’s economic prosperity in the 21st century will  depend on cybersecurity.”  The NICE program seeks to foster, energize, and  promote a robust network and an integrated ecosystem  of cybersecurity education, training, and workforce  development.  CSD is leading the NICE program, working from  the strengths and energy of more than twenty federal  departments and agencies, leveraging each of their  relationships with academia and industry sectors to ensure  coordination, cooperation, focus, public engagement, tech- nology transfer and sustainability. NIST will highlight these  activities, engage various stakeholder groups and create  forums for sharing information and leveraging best practices.  The NICE Program Office focuses on the following  activities:  •  Accelerate learning and skills development by invoking  a sense of urgency in both the public and private sec- tors to address the shortage of a skilled cybersecurity  workforce;  •  Nurture a diverse learning community through  strengthening education and training across a multi- farious ecosystem that prioritizes learning, emphasizes  outcomes, and celebrates diversity; and  •  Guide Career Development and Workforce Planning  that supports job seekers and employers in addressing  market demands and maximizing talent management.  The NICE Program Office staff promoted NICE act- ivities through contributions to many events, symposia,  forums, competitions, educational outreach meetings, and  workshops. The staff continued its leadership to achieve  the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Cross-Agency  Priority Goal: “Closing Skills Gaps” for the IT/Cybersecurity  workforce. The staff focused on reducing cybersecurity  workforce gaps and supported the goals of the White  House’s “Ready to Work” initiative. In addition, the staff took  leadership of the NICE Working Group, a group established  to provide a mechanism in which public and private sector  participants can develop concepts, design strategies, and  pursue actions that advance cybersecurity education,  training, and workforce development.  In FY 2015, the NICE Program Office announced that  a grant will be awarded to support the development  of a visualization tool to show the demand for and  availability of critical cybersecurity jobs across the nation.  This cybersecurity jobs “heat map” will be developed  in partnership with Computing Technology Industry  Association (CompTIA) and Burning Glass Technologies.  The map will provide data to help employers, job seekers,  policy makers, training providers, and guidance counselors  in order to meet today’s increasing demand for cyber- security workers.  NICE also provided grant support for the  NICE 2015 Conference and Expo, the inaugural National  Cybersecurity K-12 Cybersecurity Education Conference, the  Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) Community Meeting,  and the NICE Challenge Project.  In FY 2016, the NICE Program Office will continue to  promote the coordination of existing and future cyber- security education, training, and workforce activities.

CSRC encourages  the broad sharing of information security tools and practices,  provides a resource for information security standards  and guidelines, and identifies and links key security web  resources to support industry and government users. CSRC  is an integral component of all of the work that CSD conducts  and produces. It is CSD’s repository for anyone wanting to  access these documents and other valuable security-related  information. During FY 2015, CSRC had more than 5.9 million  page views and downloads.  CSRC is the primary gateway for gaining access to NIST  computer security publications, standards, and guidelines,  and serves as a vital link to CSD’s customers. Publications  are organized to help users locate relevant information  quickly and are arranged by topic, relevant security control  family, and legal requirements.  In addition to CSRC, CSD maintains a publication  announcement mailing list. This free e mail list notifies  subscribers about publications that have been posted to the  CSRC website, along with announcing new CSD-sponsored  events and important news and/or announcements. The  e-mail list is a valuable tool for more than 59,000 subscribers  from the Federal Government, industry, academia, and  individuals with a personal interest in IT security worldwide.  Individuals who are interested in subscribing to this list  should visit http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/subscribe.html  for more information.  During FY 2015, the CSRC has been updated on a daily  basis with new information, such as the publication of draft  and final documents (FIPS, SPs, NISTIRs and ITL Bulletins)  and various project and program webpage updates.  An improvement made to the CSRC homepage was to  add a new section titled “Draft Publications Request for  Comments Deadlines”. This section will help our customers  that are interested in submitting comments to our technical  publications find the deadline dates for submitting  comments to certain publications.  The CSRC website is expected to be redesigned during  FY 2016 to provide an improved and flexible user interface.

Federal  Computer  Security Managers’  (FCSM) Forum  The Federal Computer Security Managers’ (FCSM)  Forum is sponsored by NIST to promote the sharing of  security-related information among federal agencies. The  Forum, which serves more than 1,100 members, strives to  provide an ongoing opportunity for managers of federal  information security programs to exchange information  security materials in a timely manner, build upon the  experiences of other programs, and reduce possible  duplication of effort. It provides a mechanism for NIST to  share information directly with federal agency information  security managers in fulfillment of NIST’s leadership  mandate under FISMA. It assists NIST in establishing  and maintaining relationships with other individuals or  organizations that are actively addressing information  security issues within the Federal Government. CSD’s Patricia  Toth serves as the Chairperson and Peggy Himes serves as  the Secretariat.  The Forum maintains an extensive email subscription  service. Participation in the service is only open to Federal  Government employees who participate in the management  of their organization’s information system security  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Willingness to share  products, information, and experiences is all that is required  to become a FISSEA member. A working group meets  monthly to administer business activities.  FISSEA maintains a website, a mailing list, and  participates in a social networking site as a means of  communication for its members. CSD assists FISSEA with  its operations by providing staff support for several of its  activities and by being FISSEA’s host agency.  The 28th Annual FISSEA Conference occurred March 24- 25, 2015 at NIST. The FISSEA audience included managers  responsible for information systems security awareness,  training, certifications, workforce identification, compliance,  etc. in federal agencies; contractors providing awareness  and training support; and faculty members of accredited  educational institutions who are involved in information  security training and education.  Pat Toth, Peggy Himes,  and Judy Barnard (NIST), as well as Gretchen Morris (DB  Consulting/NASA), and other members of the FISSEA  Working Group, were integral to the effort to support the  conference.  This year’s theme was “Changes, Challenges, and  Collaborations: Effective Cybersecurity Training”. Attendees  gained new techniques for developing/conducting training,  cost-effective practices, workforce development, and free  resources and contacts.  Over 200 cybersecurity training  professionals attended the two-day conference.  NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL)  Director, Charles Romine, welcomed attendees to the event.  We were honored to have Dr. Neil Grunberg, Professor  of Military and Emergency Medicine, Uniformed Services  University, who provided an inspiring keynote presentation,  “Information Security System Educators Must be Leaders.”  His talk addressed the leadership and communication skills  needed by Cybersecurity Educators  Presenters represented NIST, DHS, the Department of  State (DoS), the National Security Agency (NSA), private  industry, and academia. Attendees had an opportunity to  visit 16 vendors and federal agencies on the second day to  share and tell about their specific awareness and training  programs.  FISSEA conferences include Pecha Kucha (Lightning  Rounds) sessions. Speakers have 6 minutes 40 seconds for  their presentations, and the challenge is in limiting one’s  talk to only 20 slides. It’s challenging to do as a speaker and  quite fun for the audience to watch, so the Pecha Kucha fast- paced talks proved to be entertaining and educational.  The FISSEA Educator of the Year Award was established  to recognize and honor a contemporary who is making  special efforts to create, build, manage, or inspire an  information systems security awareness, training, or  education program.  Sam Maroon presented the FISSEA  2014 Educator of the Year posthumously to Shon Harris of  Logical Security. Mr. Maroon shared Ms. Harris’ contributions  to the cybersecurity education industry by characterizing  her contributions in three ways: as a writer, a trainer, and a  thought leader. Ms. Harris’ friends and colleagues, Michael  Lester and Hamid Dehghan accepted the plaque on her  behalf.

The conference continues to be a valuable  forum for individuals from government, industry, and  academia who are involved with information systems/ cybersecurity workforce development. Attendees gain  insights regarding information security awareness, training,  education, certification, and professionalization. Attendees  also learn of ongoing and planned training and education  programs and cybersecurity initiatives.  It provides NIST  the opportunity to provide assistance to departments and  agencies as they work to meet their FISMA responsibilities.  The FISSEA website provides links to the Conference  Program, and also links to presentations (http://csrc.nist. gov/fissea).  The next conference will be held at NIST on March 15-16,  2016.

The Board plays a central and unique role  in providing the government with expert advice concerning  information security and privacy issues that may affect  federal information systems. Title III of the E-Government  Act of 2002 reaffirmed the need for this Board by giving it  an additional responsibility: to thoroughly review all of the  proposed information technology standards and guidelines  developed under Section 20 of the National Institute of  Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S. Code (U.S.C.) 278g- 3), as amended.  The ISPAB is a federal advisory committee with specific  statutory objectives to identify emerging managerial,  Figure 7: Friends and colleagues accepting the  FISSEA Educator of the Year on behalf of Ms. Harris  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

The Board  was originally created by the Computer Security Act of  1987 (P.L. 100-235) as the Computer System Security and  Privacy Advisory Board (CSSPAB) within the Department  of Commerce. The CSSPAB was chartered in May 1988 in  accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act,  as amended. The 2002 FISMA legislation amended the  statutory authority of the Board and provided its current  name.  The duties of the Board, as stipulated in FISMA, include:  •  Identification of emerging managerial, technical, ad- ministrative, and physical safeguard issues relative to  information security and privacy;  •  Advising NIST and the Director of the Office of Man- agement and Budget on information security and  privacy issues pertaining to Federal Government  information systems (including the thorough review of  proposed standards and guidelines developed under 15  U.S.C. 278g-3 - Computer Standards Program); and  •  Annually reporting its findings to the Secretary of  Commerce, the Director of the Office of Management  and Budget, the Director of NSA, and the appropriate  committees of Congress.  Congress indicated the long-term need for the Board by  setting the term of Board members to four years. The charter  requires that the NIST Director appoint the Chairperson and  all twelve members of the Board. They are selected for their  preeminence in the information technology industry or  related disciplines.  The 15 U.S.C. 278g-4 charter stipulates that Board  members be selected from three main categories, with  each category providing four members. Category 1 includes  members from outside the Federal Government who are  eminent in the information technology industry, at least  one of whom is a representative of small or medium-sized  companies in such industries. Category 2 also includes  members from outside the Federal Government who are  eminent in the field of information technology or related  disciplines, but who are not employed by or representative  of a producer of information. Category 3 includes those from  the Federal Government who are experienced in information  system management, including those with experience in  information security and privacy, at least one of whom should  be from the National Security Agency. The categorization  of Board members is intended to meet ISPAB’s statutory  objectives. Federal members bring a detailed understanding  of the federal processing environment; industry brings  concerns and experiences regarding product development  and market formation, while private computer security  experts are able to bring their experiences of commercial  cost-effective security measures into Board discussion.  Dr. Peter Weinberger is currently the Chair of ISPAB.  Dr. Weinberger, a Computer Scientist from Google, joined  the Board in 2008 and assumed the responsibilities of the  Chair in January 2015.  He is also a Co-Chair of a National  Academies study on fundamental work in cybersecurity, and  a member of the National Academies study on Presidential  Policy Directive (PPD) 28, Signals Intelligence Activities.  He is well supported by the following Board members (see  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/membership.html):  Figure 8:  From Left to Right – Annie Sokol (Designated Federal Officer, CSD, NIST), Greg Garcia, Ed Roback, Toby Levin,  Jeffrey Greene, John Centafont, Dr. Kevin Fu, Dr. Peter Weinberger (Chair, ISPAB), Matt Scholl (Chief, CSD, NIST)  Members not included in this picture: Chris Boyer, Dr. Ana Anton, David Cullinane, Gale Stone, and J.

A computer failure or system breach  could jeopardize the company’s reputation and may result  in significant damage and recovery cost, or going out  of business. The small business owner who recognizes  the threat of computer crime and takes steps to deter  inappropriate activities is less likely to become a victim.  The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) reports  that over 27 million U.S. companies - more than 99 percent of  all U.S. businesses - are SMBs of 500 employees or fewer (see  http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/allprofiles12.pdf).  While the threats to individual SMBs may not be significantly  different from those facing larger organizations, an SMB  frequently has fewer resources available to protect systems,  detect attacks, or respond to security issues. A vulnerability  common to a large percentage of SMBs could pose a threat  to the nation’s information infrastructure and economic  base.  To help address information security risk, these busi-  nesses require assistance with the identification of security  mechanisms and with practical, cost-effective training.  Training helps SMB’s use their limited resources most  effectively to address relevant and serious threats. In  response to this need, NIST, the SBA, and the Federal Bureau  of Investigation (FBI) InfraGard program co-sponsor a series  of cybersecurity training workshops for small businesses.  These workshops provide an overview of cybersecurity  threats, vulnerabilities, and corresponding protective tools  and techniques, with a special emphasis on information that  small business personnel can apply directly.  In FY 2015, six SMB outreach workshops were provided  in Reno, Nevada; Fresno, California; Modesto, California;  Fairmont, West Virginia; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and  McHenry, Maryland. Additionally, the SMB Cybersecurity  Outreach Program was briefed to the InfraGard National  Congress.  In collaboration with the SBA and the FBI, planning  is underway to identify locations and plan cybersecurity  workshops in FY 2016.

The competition ended on October 2,  2012 when NIST announced the selection of Keccak as the  winning algorithm for standardization as the new SHA- 3 Standard. NIST consulted with the Keccak designers  and the cryptographic community, and developed a SHA- 3 standardization plan that was presented at numerous  cryptography conferences and posted at the NIST hash  website, indicated below, for public feedback.  NIST announced Draft FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard:  Permutation-Based Hash and Extendable-Output Functions,  in the Federal Register (79 FR 30549) on May 28, 2014  and requested comments (see https://federalregister. gov/a/2014-12336). The announcement also proposed a  revision of the Applicability Clause of the Announcement  Section of FIPS 180-4, Secure Hash Standard, to allow the  use of hash functions specified in either FIPS 180-4 or FIPS  202, modifying the original mandate to use only the hash  functions specified in FIPS 180-4. The other sections of FIPS  180-4 remain unchanged. A ninety-day public comment  period was provided, which ended on August 26, 2014.  NIST received seven comments on Draft FIPS 202 and  one comment on the Draft Revision of the Applicability  Clause of FIPS 180-4. All comments received are posted  at the NIST hash website. None of the comments opposed  the adoption of the SHA-3 Standard or the revision of the  Applicability Clause of FIPS 180-4. NIST also received public  feedback at the 2014 SHA-3 Workshop and afterwards. All  of the comments were carefully reviewed, and changes were  made to FIPS 202, where appropriate. NIST made additional  editorial changes to improve FIPS 202.  FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based Hash and  Extendable-Output Functions, and the revised Applicability  Clause of FIPS 180-4 were approved by the Secretary of  Commerce and announced in the Federal Register (80  FR 46543) on August 5, 2015 (see https://federalregister. gov/a/2015-19181). FIPS 202 and FIPS 180-4 are available at:  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html.

For example, random numbers  are used to generate the keys needed for encryption and  digital signature applications.  In March 2007, CSD published SP 800-90,  Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using  Deterministic Random Bit Generators, which contained four  deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) mechanisms,  two based on hash functions, one based on the use of block  cipher algorithms and one based on the use of elliptic curves.  This recommendation was revised as SP 800-90A in January  2012 to include additional capabilities and in June 2015 to  remove the DRBG based on the use of elliptic curves, i.e.,  the DUAL_EC_DRBG, since its security has been in question.  Two additional documents (SP 800-90B,  Recommendation for the Entropy Sources Used for Random  Bit Generation, and SP 800-90C, Recommendation for  Random Bit Generator (RBG) Constructions) are under  development, and the initial drafts were made available for  public comment in 2012.  SP 800-90B addresses the development and testing of  entropy sources, including descriptions of the tests for NIST’s  Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program to validate  candidate entropy sources. An entropy source depends on  a noise source, which is the root of security for the entropy  source. During FY 2015, the CTG developed and tested  additional methods for estimating the amount of entropy  per noise-source output. An overview of the methodology  and preliminary results of new estimators, called predictors,  were presented at ShmooCon in the talk “How Random is  Your RNG?” Further details and results were published in the  paper “Predictive Models for Min-Entropy Estimation” at the  Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (CHES  2015) workshop. A new draft of SP 800-90B will be provided  for another public comment period in early FY 2016.  SP 800-90C provides basic guidance on the construc- tion of RBGs from the entropy sources validated against the  requirements of SP 800-90B and the DRBG mechanisms  of SP 800-90A. The CTG plans to provide a new version of  this document for public comment prior to the end of the SP  800-90B public-comment period.

A block cipher  transforms some fixed-length binary data (i.e., a “block”)  into seemingly random data of the same length. The  transformation is determined by the choice of some secret  data called the “key.” The same key is used to reverse the  transformation and recover the original block of data. A  cryptographic technique that is constructed from a block  cipher is called a mode of operation. Several modes of  operation have been specified in the SP 800-38 series of  publications.  The CTG has nearly completed the development of two  AES modes of operation for format-preserving encryption  (FPE), based on proposals that were submitted from the  private sector. A format can be a sequence of decimal digits,  such as a credit card number or a social security number;  formats can also be defined for other sets of characters  besides decimal digits. FPE is expected to facilitate the  retrofitting of encryption to existing applications. For  example, FPE could be applied to database systems, so  that sensitive data could be targeted for encryption without  disrupting the underlying data fields/pathways.  The two modes of operation for FPE, called FF1 and  FF3, will be specified in Special Publication 800-38G,  Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation:  Methods for Format-Preserving Encryption, which will be  completed in FY 2016.  In the coming year, the CTG plans to consider technical  changes to two other Special Publications in the 800-38  series. In particular, the CTG plans: 1) to solicit public comment  on requirements for the generation of non-repeating IVs  for the Galois/Counter Mode, specified in SP 800-38D,  Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation:  Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) and GMAC; and 2) to revisit  the combinations of encryption and authentication that are  approved in SP 800-38F, Recommendation for Block Cipher  Modes of Operation: Methods for Key Wrapping.

CSD  began to provide guidance in managing the keys used for  cryptographic applications in the late 1990s to early 2000s.  Several guidance and recommendation documents have  been and continue to be developed in the form of NIST  Special Publications (SP), which have been periodically  updated to address new algorithms and handling procedures.  These documents are coordinated with federal agencies and  with the cryptographic community, including national and  international organizations, industry, and academia. During  FY 2015, the following publications were either created or  revised.  SP 800-57, Recommendation for Key Management,  Part 3: Application-Specific Key Management Guidance,  was first published in 2009. This document addresses the  key-management issues of currently available cryptographic  mechanisms, including the use of Public Key Infrastructures  (PKI) and several commonly used security protocols and  applications. A revision of this document was provided for  public comment in May 2014 that updated the guidance  provided in the 2009 version, included an additional  section on the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, and substituted  a reference to SP 800-52, Revision 1, Guidelines for the  Selection, Configuration, and Use of Transport Layer  Security (TLS) Implementations, for the TLS section. After  the comment period, the draft revision was revised, and  published in January 2015.  SP 800-57, Recommendation for Key Management, Part  1: General, was first published in 2005, and later revised in  2007 and 2012. Another revision was provided for public  comment in FY 2015 that includes information on and  references to recent work performed by CSD; removed  references to the Dual_EC_DRBG, which was removed  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

The revision  was provided for public comment in September 2015 and  should be completed in early FY 2016.  SP 800-131A, Transitions: Recommendation for  Transitioning the Use of Cryptographic Algorithms and  Key Lengths, was originally published in January 2011. This  document provides specific guidance for transitions to  the use of stronger cryptographic keys and more robust  algorithms. An update of SP 800-131A was provided  for public comment and completed in November 2015.  This update removes approval for the Dual_EC_DRBG,  deprecates the use of non-approved key-establishment  schemes, disallows the use of non-approved key-wrapping  methods after 2017, and indicates that the use of the SHA-3  family of hash functions as acceptable.  SP 800-152, A Profile for U.S. Federal Cryptographic  Key Management Systems (CKMS), provides guidance  on the CKMSs to be used by the Federal Government.  This document provides refinements of the requirements  for CKMS designers that are specified in SP 800-130, A  Framework for Designing Cryptographic Key Management  Systems. SP 800-152 also provides requirements and  recommendations for the service providers of CKMSs used  by federal agencies and their contractors, as well as guidance  for the federal agencies in selecting a CKMS that supports  the security and management policies of those agencies. A  draft of this document was provided for public comment in  FY 2013, and a workshop was held in March 2013 to discuss  the draft. A second draft was provided for comment in FY  2015, and a final version addressing the received comments  was published in October 2015.  A new NIST publication is under development  that provides guidance on the security strength of a  cryptographic key that is used to protect data (i.e., a data- protection key), given the manner in which the key was  generated and handled. This document, SP 800-158, Key  Management: Obtaining a Targeted Security Strength,  involves a considerable amount of new research, since it  is an area that has not been fully addressed to date. This  publication will be available for public comment in FY 2016.  Additional key-management work to be conducted in FY  2016 includes revision(s) to SP 800-56A, Recommendation  for Pair-Wise Key-Establishment Schemes Using Discrete  Logarithm Cryptography, and SP 800-56B, Recommenda- tion for Pair-Wise Key-Establishment Schemes Using Integer  Factorization Cryptography, to allow the use of larger key  sizes.

TLS is a widely used cryptographic  protocol that provides communication security for a variety  of network applications, such as email, e-commerce, and  healthcare.  SP 800-52 was first published in 2005, and SP 800-52  Revision 1 was published in April 2014. Since the revision, CTG  has been following developments in TLS implementations,  including updates and attacks. In FY 2016, a second revision  will be published that considers these developments.  This second revision will be a minor update to SP 800-52  Revision 1.  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is actively  developing extensions that can be used to add functionality  to TLS. CSD will continue to review updates and additions to  the TLS protocol in FY 2016.

NIST has standardized elliptic curve cryptography  for digital signature algorithms in FIPS 186 and for key  establishment schemes in SP 800-56A.

However, the provenance of the  curves is not fully specified in the standard, leading to recent  public concerns that there could be a hidden weakness in  these curves. NIST is not aware of any vulnerability in these  curves when they are implemented correctly and used as  described in NIST standards and guidelines.  However, more than fifteen years have passed since  these curves were developed, and the community now  knows more about the security of elliptic curve cryptography  and practical implementation issues. Advances within the  cryptographic community have led to the development of  new elliptic curves and algorithms whose designers claim  to offer better performance and are easier to implement  in a secure manner. Some of these curves are under  consideration in voluntary, consensus-based Standards  Developing Organizations.  In June 2015, NIST hosted a workshop on Elliptic Curve  Cryptography Standards to discuss possible approaches to  promote the adoption of secure, interoperable and efficient  elliptic curve mechanisms. Workshop participants expressed  significant interest in the development, standardization and  adoption of new elliptic curves. As a result of this input,  NIST is considering the addition of new elliptic curves to  the current set of recommended curves in FIPS 186-4. In FY  2016, NIST will solicit comments on possible improvements  to FIPS 186-4, which may lead to a workshop held later in  the year.

If large- scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to  break the existing infrastructure of public-key cryptography.  The focus of the Post-Quantum Cryptography project is  to identify candidate quantum-resistant systems that are  secure against both quantum and classical computers, as  well as the impact that such post-quantum algorithms will  have on current protocols and security infrastructures.  In FY 2015, NIST researchers held regular seminars. The  presentation topics included the latest published results; a  synopsis of the security analysis; and status reports in the  areas of quantum computation, hash-based signatures,  coding-based cryptography, lattice-based cryptography,  and multivariate cryptography. Through these presentations  and discussions, the team made significant progress in  understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the existing  cryptographic schemes in each category. The project team  is planning to create evaluation criteria for post-quantum  cryptography schemes for standardization.  The NIST team continues to be productive in post- quantum cryptography research. The results have been  published at the major conferences, such as PQCrypto  2014, and Eurocrypt 2015. NIST researchers have given  presentations at conferences and workshops to increase  awareness of the upcoming migration. NIST researchers have  contributed to the European Telecommunications Standards  Institute (ETSI) whitepaper on quantum-safe cryptography.  NIST has also sponsored other research, education, and  research events.  NIST held the Workshop on Cybersecurity in a Post- Quantum World in March of 2015. The workshop was  attended by approximately 140 participants from around  the world. Presentations given at the workshop included  new proposals for quantum-safe cryptosystems, ideas for  how to modify protocols (such as TLS) to include these new  cryptosystems, discussions on how to standardize hash- based signatures and key-management issues, as well as  new ideas on the cryptanalysis of the many post-quantum  systems.  In FY 2016, NIST will continue to explore the security  and feasibility of purported quantum-resistant technologies,  with the ultimate goal of uncovering the fundamental  mechanisms necessary for efficient, trustworthy, and cost- effective information assurance in the post-quantum era.  Upon the successful completion of this phase of the project,  NIST will be prepared for possible standardization efforts in  this area.

In practice, it  is important to be able to minimize the size of these  circuits. This problem is closely related to designing small  combinational circuits. These circuits use only binary AND,  XOR and NEGATION gates, i.e., multiplication, addition, and  “+1” in arithmetic modulo 2. A combinational circuit on four  variables (X1, X2, X3, and X4) using AND and XOR gates is  depicted in Figure 9.  The project team has shown that finding optimal  combinational circuits is MAX-SNP Complete. In practice, this  means that it is necessary to settle for methods that design  “good” circuits, as opposed to provably optimal circuits.  The CTG has developed and implemented new solutions for  the circuit-minimization problem. Two patents have been  granted related to this work, the last one in FY 2014. These  are held jointly between NIST and the University of Southern  Denmark.  The CTG is also researching circuit-based security  metrics for cryptographic functions. For a function to be  secure (in particular, one-way), it must be the case that any  circuit that implements it is sufficiently complex. In particular,  a function is insecure if it can be implemented by a circuit  containing too few Boolean AND gates. This security metric,  namely the number of AND gates necessary and sufficient  to implement a function, is referred to as its multiplicative  complexity. Unfortunately, determining multiplicative  complexity is extremely hard (very recently, Magnus Find  proved computational intractability conditioned on the  existence of one-way functions). Mathematicians attempted  to determine multiplicative complexity in the 1970s, but the  effort had been largely abandoned by the 1980s. However, the  CTG has published circuits that are provably optimal or close  to optimal (with respect to multiplicative complexity) for  important classes of functions. In the process, we developed  tools that have wide applicability for both theoretical and  applied research in security and cryptography.  Multiparty computation is a technique that allows  a group of people to compute a function of their inputs  without revealing the inputs themselves. Examples of this  are: i) holding an election; ii) conducting closed-bid auctions  in which only the winning bid is determined; iii) proving to a  third party that a person’s encrypted attributes satisfy some  requirement, such as “over 21 and (U.S. citizen or Canadian  citizen)”. The protocols that solve multiparty computation  problems often encrypt bits using arithmetic modulo 2. The  complexity of such protocols largely depends on the number  of multiplications required. Hence, expressing functions as  circuit computations with only a few multiplication (AND)  gates is important. Some of the published circuits are now  the standard reference for benchmarking tools in multiparty  computation.  The following is a partial list of new results by our team:  •  The smallest known circuits were constructed for multi- plication in several small finite fields.  •  The smallest known circuits were constructed for  binary multiplication (i.e., multiplication of polynomials  of degree n over the Galois Field with two elements).  This yields important speed increases in elliptic curve  cryptography.  •  Optimal circuits were constructed - with respect to  multiplicative complexity - for all predicates on four  bits (see the example below). There are 65,536 such  predicates. Surprisingly, the multiplicative complexity  of all these functions turned out to be at most three.  Additionally, our circuits use no more than seven  non-linear gates (XOR, XNOR). This is quite hard. Con- sider the following predicate (arithmetic is modulo 2):  f = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x1x2 + x1x3 + x1x4 + x2x3 +x2x4 + x1x2x3  + x1x2x4 + x1x2x3x4.  Computing the last term requires three multiplications.  So, it is quite surprising that the full expression can be  Figure 9: Combinational Boolean Circuit  The red nodes are AND gates; the yellow nodes are XOR gates.

But, we  have shown this to be true for f  and all other pred- icates on four bits. The circuit on the previous page  computes f using three multiplications and six addi- tions.  •  A proof was developed that the maximum multipli- cative complexity of predicates on five bits (there are  more than 4 billion such predicates) is four. The proof is  constructive, meaning that the circuits can actually be  built.  •  A proof was developed that an explicit function  requires at least 3.01n gates. This constitutes the only  improvement on this problem for more than 30 years.  The result is due to Magnus Find, in collaboration with  mathematicians from New York University (NYU) and  from the Steklov Institute, St. Petersburg, Russia.

Examples of these areas  include: sensor networks, distributed control systems, the  Internet of Things, cyber physical systems, and the smart  grid. Security and privacy can be very important in all of  these areas. Because the majority of current cryptographic  algorithms were designed for desktop/server environments,  implementing many of these algorithms with constrained  resources can be extremely challenging. If current algorithms  can be made to fit into the limited resources of constrained  environments, their performance is typically not acceptable.  CTG staff are examining applications in constrained  environments to determine whether NIST should develop  lightweight cryptographic standards. CTG is communicating  with industry experts to understand challenges, limitations  and work from other standardization bodies in this area. In  FY 2015, CTG organized a NIST workshop on Lightweight  Cryptography in Gaithersburg, MD, July 20-21, 2015 to  discuss issues related to the security and resource  requirements of applications in constrained environments  and potential future standardization of lightweight primitive  algorithms. The workshop included two invited talks, twenty- four presentations and a panel discussion.  In FY 2015, CTG staff further engaged the international  cryptographic community by providing presentations at  the Fourth International Workshop on Lightweight Crypto- graphy for Security and Privacy in Bochum, Germany, at  the Fast Software Encryption Workshop in Istanbul, Turkey  and at the Lightweight Crypto Day, in Haifa Israel. Project  summaries and challenges ahead were presented at the  Cybersecurity Innovation Forum and to ITL’s Cyber-Physical  Systems (CPS) group.  In FY 2016, CTG will continue to analyze the resource  requirements and performance characteristics of lightweight  primitives, and study their use as building blocks to perform  various cryptographic objectives. Additionally, CTG is  planning to publish a report that describes the current state  and challenges in target application areas.

The service is available at https://beacon.nist.gov/home. It  uses two independent, commercially available sources of  randomness, each with an independent hardware entropy  source and SP 800-90A-approved components.  The NIST Beacon is designed to provide unpredictability,  autonomy, and consistency. Unpredictability means that  users cannot algorithmically predict bits before they are  made available by the source. Autonomy means that the  source is resistant to attempts by outside parties to alter the  distribution of the random bits. Consistency means that a set  of users can access the source in such a way that they are  confident of receiving the same random string.  The NIST Beacon posts bit-strings in blocks of 512 bits  every 60 seconds. Each such value is time-stamped and  signed, and includes the hash of the previous value to chain  the sequence of values together. This prevents all parties,  even the source, from retroactively changing an output  packet without being detected.

At any point in time, the full history of  outputs is available to users.  Tables of random numbers have probably been used for  multiple purposes at least since the Industrial Revolution.  In the digital age, algorithmic pseudorandom number  generators (PRNGs) have largely replaced these tables. The  NIST Beacon expands the use of randomness to multiple  scenarios in which neither tables nor PRNGs can be used.  The extra functionalities stem mainly from three features.  First, the Beacon-generated numbers cannot be predicted  before they are published. Second, the public, time-bound,  and authenticated nature of the Beacon allows a user  application to prove to anybody that it used truly random  numbers not known before a certain point in time. Third, this  proof can be presented offline and at any point in the future.  Although commercially available physical sources of  randomness are adequate as entropy sources for currently  envisioned implementations of the NIST Beacon, we are  working on developing a source of verifiably random  sequences. In collaboration with NIST physicists from the  Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML), we aim to use  quantum non-locality to build an entropy source whose  unpredictability is guaranteed by the laws of physics. This  project is funded by NIST’s Innovations in Measurement  Science (IMS) Program. IMS funds highly competitive  projects designed to explore high-risk, leading-edge  research concepts that anticipate the future measurement  and standards needs of industry and science. For more  information on this collaboration see http://www.nist.gov/ pml/div684/random_numbers_bell_test.cfm.  As of the end of FY 2015, the NIST Beacon has been  functioning without interruption for more than two years.  NIST encourages the community at large to research and  publish novel ways in which this tool can be used. A few  examples of applications are unpredictable sampling,  new authentication mechanisms, and secure multi-party  computation.

The ability to generate  strong cryptographic keys is directly related to having  access to unpredictable random data, but generating truly  unpredictable random data on computing devices is hard  and unreliable. As a result, weak keys are widely used in  cryptographic applications compromising the security of  sensitive data protected by them with potentially disastrous  consequences.  A primary goal of this project is to provide high-quality,  truly unpredictable random data to devices on the Internet  to enable them to generate strong cryptographic keys and  attest the strength of the keys used to protect data in transit  or at rest, thereby enabling cryptographic system strength  attestation. Achieving this goal would provide a solid basis  for addressing the problems targeted by Cryptographic  System Validation (see the next section: Validated Programs,  the first project in this section).  Random data obtained from sources of true randomness  that are based on unpredictable physical phenomena, such  as quantum effects, is much better suited for cryptographic  applications. CSD is collaborating with the NIST Physical  Measurement Laboratory (PML) to build a quantum source.  The aim is to use quantum effects to generate sequences  that are guaranteed to be unpredictable, even if an attacker  has access to the random source. For more information on  this collaboration, see http://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/ random_numbers_bell_test.cfm.  This project aims to develop a system and protocols  for obtaining random data with high entropy from one or  more remote sources. The high-level architecture is shown in  Figure 10 (see next page). The architecture of the Entropy-as- a-Service system consists of two main parts: the client-side  and the server-side.  The critical components of the system  are the quantum device, the EaaS server and a secure device  in the client systems capable of providing strong isolation  and protection for the cryptographic keys stored inside the  device and offering a set of basic cryptographic services.  Client devices mix this data with locally available random  data to seed random number generators to generate strong  cryptographic keys and other random values independently  from the remote sources.

The project team have developed a working prototype  and demonstrated it at high-profile cybersecurity forums  and academic conferences. The team is continuing to  develop the system aiming to stand up a publicly accessible  NIST EaaS instance in the near future. In addition, the team is  also planning to publish the server and client code on GitHub  and invite the public to voluntarily adopt it. Related to this,  the project team is planning to work on developing public  criteria for reputable EaaS hosts.

In such  a heterogeneous network, a mobile device may switch its  connection between different wireless technologies, such  as between cellular and WiFi networks. The procedure for  conducting such a switch is called a “handover.” Media- independent handover (MIH) is a set of services specified  in IEEE 802.21 to assist the handover. When the services  provided by the pervasive heterogeneous networks  are extended to other applications, such as Smart Grid  applications, the MIH needs to be processed by a group  of wireless nodes, such as smart meters, for balancing the  network load and for reliability. In this case, the information  may need to be delivered to a group of smart meters using a  multicast message, which is used to deliver the information.  That is, the multicast message is sent from one point-of- service (PoS) to multiple wireless nodes. In some of the  application environments, such as sensor networks, the  groups are formed dynamically; new nodes can be added  to the group, and some nodes in the group may need to  be removed. Such groups are managed through multicast  signals.  Amendment 2 of IEEE 802.21 provides protection  mechanisms for unicast messages − mechanisms that  protect messages between a PoS and a single mobile  node. In FY 2015, CSD continued work with IEEE 802.21 to  develop security solutions for group management in Task  Group D of IEEE 802.21. The solutions, specified in IEEE  802.21 Amendment 4, include the mechanisms to distribute  group keys and for the protection of multicast messages.  Amendment 4 of IEEE 802.21 was published in FY 2015.  In FY 2016, CSD will continue to contribute to a broader  scope of IEEE 802 wireless standards.

The OMB memorandum defines four levels of assurance that  a federal agency must select, based on a risk assessment  to determine the impact of an authentication failure. This  guideline covers the remote authentication of users (such as  private individuals) interacting with government IT systems  over the Internet. It defines technical requirements for  each of the four levels of assurance in the areas of identity  proofing, tokens, credential binding, management processes,  authentication protocols and assertion characteristics. Since  the initial release of SP 800-63, the CSD has released two  revisions to address changes in modern technology and  lessons learned from practical implementations by federal  departments and agencies.  Several recent developments have an impact on the way  that agencies fulfill their e Authentication requirements:  •  Executive Order 13681, Improving the Security of Con- sumer Financial Transactions, issued by the adminis- tration in October 2014, requires “…that all agencies  making personal data accessible to citizens through  digital applications require the use of multiple factors  of authentication and an effective identity proofing  process, as appropriate.” (see http://www.whitehouse. gov/the-press-office/2014/10/17/executive-order-im- proving-security-consumer-financial-transactions)  •  CSD published The Framework for Improving Critical  Infrastructure Cybersecurity in February 2014 in re- sponse to Executive Order (EO) 13636, Improving Crit- ical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (for the Framework,  see http://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/; for the  EO 13636, see http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press- office/2013/02/12/executive-order-improving-criti- cal-infrastructure-cybersecurity). The accompanying  roadmap cites the need for NIST to “…conduct identity  and authentication research complemented by the pro- duction of Special Publications that support improved  authentication practices.” (see http://www.nist.gov/ cyberframework/upload/roadmap-021214.pdf)  •  The National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyber- space (NSTIC), which was released in 2011, charts a  course for both public and private sectors to collab- orate to raise the level of trust associated with the iden- tities of individuals, organizations, networks, services,  and devices involved in online transactions through an  Identity Ecosystem (see http://www.nist.gov/nstic/).  NSTIC calls for the Federal Government to “lead by  example and implement the Identity Ecosystem for the  services it provides internally and externally.” As the  Identity Ecosystem starts to take shape, NIST guide- lines should reflect and support it.  In addition, market forces have resulted in an inflexion  point in how departments and agencies authenticate users.  NIST and our private sector partners have observed that  some public and private sector identity assurance standards  have become outdated or have simply not been adopted.

Innovation  has offered new perspectives in how trusted identities  can be established. Practical implementations of SP 800- 63 have informed us of areas of strengths, weaknesses,  and techniques not utilized by federal agencies or the  private sector. In addition, federal agencies are the only  organizations required to follow NIST SPs. However, as the  Federal Government evolves to accept credentials offered  by private sector organizations, the applicability of SP 800- 63 has expanded beyond agency use. NIST has an obligation  to service the expansion of the original SP 800-63 target.  Therefore, in April of 2015, NIST issued a call for  comments on the current published version, SP 800-63-2,  in order to identify specific topics that could be addressed  in a future revision of SP 800-63 (see http://csrc.nist.gov/ groups/ST/eauthentication/sp800-63-2_call-comments. html). NIST received over 40 submissions from individuals,  academia, and the public and private sectors. Over 300  distinct comments were identified from these submissions. In  addition to the comments that NIST received, vulnerabilities  have been discovered in existing online authentication  services, specifically in the area of remote identity proofing,  which has warranted an accelerated consideration of  updated guidance for the Federal Government.  In FY 2016, CSD expects its authentication work to be  driven by the needs of the ongoing rapid expansion of online  service delivery, commercially available authentication  services, results and metrics from NSTIC pilots, and the  availability of multi-factor tokens to consumers. Breaches  of personal information and the relative availability of  personal information has necessitated that NIST reconsider  approaches to identity proofing, both in-person and  remotely. The paradigm where the starting assumption was  that personal data was hard to find has now changed to one  where it is acknowledged that this data is readily available  online; existing guidance needs to be adjusted to offer  organizations cost-effective, yet secure, identity proofing  capabilities. The NSTIC pilots have tested innovative  alternatives to high-assurance remote proofing, necessita- ting that SP 800-63 be considerate of these advances in the  marketplace. In addition, commercial advances in physical  document validation and verification, the proliferation of  high-resolution video cameras on commodity computing  devices, including mobile phones, as well as new offerings  in the delivery of in-person proofing, will influence potential  updates to requirements at all levels of assurance.  As many types of biometric sensors become ubiquitous  in personal mobile devices, and more and more individuals  leverage biometrics in commercial use cases such as  mobile payment and online authentication to private  sector services, CSD will re-examine the current position of  remote, unattended biometric authentication.  The existing  publication does allow local biometric authentication to  unlock a token – a secure technique currently used by  popular mobile handset manufacturers. Yet the comments  CSD received reveal that some believe this is insufficient,  and that centralized biometric authentication used in  single- or multi-factor schemes should be allowed in a future  revision. CSD will pursue detailed research in the security  of remote biometric authentication, examine the efficacy  of standardization efforts related to presentation attack  detection, and contemplate the long-term impacts of the  en-masse theft of biometrics before expanding the current  requirements of SP 800-63-2.  The user experience of online authentication will also be  a significant consideration in a potential update of SP 800- 63. The CSD has observed that the user experience has a  direct relationship with individual uptake of authentication  services as well as the overall security of any authentication  scheme. While CSD does not intend to weaken requirements  to accommodate a favorable user experience, understanding  the impact of e-Authentication requirements on the user,  and to design requirements that do not degrade security but  upgrade the user experience, is imperative.  The CSD, therefore, plans to actively consider revisions  to SP 800-63-2 in response to the issues noted above and  other issues that can be dealt with in time to assist in the  intense ongoing efforts to expand online services.

Poor  implementations of these standards or specifications may  render a particular product insecure, potentially placing  sensitive information at risk. CSD operates several validation  programs that help provide a level of assurance that products  meet established security requirements and conform to  published specifications. To that end, the Security Testing,  Validation, and Measurement Group (STVMG) develops test  suites and test methods; provides implementation guidance  and technical support to industry forums; and conducts  education, training, and outreach programs.  STVMG’s validation programs work together with  independent laboratories that are accredited by the National  Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP).  Based on the independent laboratory test report and test  evidence provided by the labs, the validation programs  described below validate the implementation under test.  CSD subsequently publishes lists of the validations awarded  on public websites.  Cryptographic System Val idation Current validation programs focus on providing a known  level of assurance for cryptographic algorithms and modules.  These modules are used within the context of a larger system  to provide cryptographic services as a method of protecting  the data within the system. As information systems continue  to become more complex, the methods used to implement  cryptographic services have also increased in complexity.  Problems with the use of cryptography are often introduced  through the interaction of cryptographic components with  the operating environment. This program seeks to specify  how cryptographic components are used as part of a defined  cryptographic system to solve problems with a measureable  level of assurance, and to introduce automated methods of  quantifying the level of assurance that has been provided.  In FY 2016, this program will begin the research required  to define a reference cryptographic systems architecture  and example use cases where cryptographic systems are  built from known cryptographic components that cooperate  through trust relationships to provide a measureable level of  assurance. The architecture should begin at the lowest level  with a hardware-based root of trust, and each cryptographic  component should be added in successive layers to  provide assurance in a systematic way. This should allow  the development of tests that would measure the correct  implementation of cryptographic components as part of a  larger system.  This program will perform research and experimentation  in applicable technologies and techniques that will enable  the efficient testing of the cryptographic capabilities of each  layer, and enable the continuous monitoring capabilities of  each cryptographic component, providing the necessary  interfaces to establish trust relationships with other  cryptographic components. Techniques could include such  items as:  •  Embedding XML data elements and standard inter- faces to query those data elements during the design  and implementation of cryptographic components that  would enable automated testing capabilities;  •  Using cryptographic techniques to embed values into  the module that would increase the verifiability and  assurance that the module provides; and  •  Using industry-based secure development techniques  to increase the level of trust inherent in software mod- ules, starting with design and implementation.  Research into this area of cryptographic system  validation holds the promise of automating the validation of  all cryptographic components, providing a higher assurance  with less manual effort. The program will use an approach  that was developed for the SCAP product validation effort  to embed data elements that instrument the test harnesses  used to validate cryptographic systems. This would also  provide the instrumentation that could be leveraged to  enable a greater level of situational awareness and security  measurement, and potentially, to enable continuous  monitoring of cryptographic systems.

Through  these programs, NIST and CSE work with international  government, public and private sectors as a part of the  cryptographic community to achieve standards-based  security and assurance of correct implementation. The  goal of these programs is to provide federal agencies  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

The  testing carried out by independent third-party laboratories  accredited by NVLAP, and the validations performed by  the CAVP and CMVP programs provide this metric. Federal  agencies, industry, and the public can choose cryptographic  modules and/or products containing cryptographic modules  from the CMVP Validated Modules List and have confidence  in the claimed level of security and assurance of correct  implementation.  Cryptographic algorithm and cryptographic module  testing and validation are based on published NIST  standards. Since federal agencies are required to use  validated cryptographic modules for the protection of  sensitive unclassified information, the validated modules and  the validated algorithms that the modules contain represent  the culmination and delivery of CSD’s cryptography-based  work to the end user.  The CAVP and the CMVP are separate collaborative  programs. The CAVP and the CMVP validate algorithms and  modules, respectively, which are used in a wide variety of  products, including Internet browsers, radios, smart cards,  space-based communications, munitions, security tokens,  mobile phones, network and storage devices, and products  supporting the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and electronic  commerce. A module may be a standalone product, such  as a virtual private network (VPN) or smart card, or it  could be a module embedded in many products, such as a  cryptographic-based toolkit. As a result, a small number of  modules may be incorporated within hundreds of products.  The CAVP validates cryptographic algorithms that may be  integrated in one or more cryptographic modules. Figure 11  provides a flow of the CMVP testing and validation process.

For the  CAVP, the validation system documents are designed for  each FIPS-approved or NIST-recommended cryptographic  algorithm. See the website for a listing (see http://csrc.nist. gov/groups/STM/cavp/). Security requirements for the  CMVP are found in FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements for  Cryptographic Modules, and the associated test metrics  and methods in Derived Test Requirements for FIPS 140- 2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules.  The four Annexes to FIPS 140-2 reference the underlying  cryptographic algorithm standards or methods. The CMVP- developed Implementation Guidance for FIPS 140-2 and the  Cryptographic Validation Program provides programmatic  and implementation guidance across all of the referenced  documents. The information provided in the Derived  Test Requirements (DTR) and Implementation Guidance  (IG) documents ensures the repeatability of tests and the  equivalency of results across the testing laboratories. The IG  provides clarity, consistency of interpretation, and insight for  successful conformance testing, validation, and revalidation.  The unique position of the validation programs gives the  CAVP and CMVP the opportunity to acquire insight during  the validation review activities and results in practical, timely,  and up-to-date guidance that is needed by the testing  laboratories and vendors to move their modules out to the  user community in a timely and cost-effective manner and  with the assurance of third-party conformance testing. This  knowledge and insight provide a foundation for current and  future standards and tools development.  The CMVP reviews the cryptographic module validation  requests from the testing laboratories and, as a byproduct  of the review, is attentive to emerging and/or changing  technologies.  Starting with FY 2015, the Security Testing, Validation,  and Measurement (STVM) group created a research team  whose mission is to conduct research to assist developers  of cryptographic modules, testing laboratories, and the  user community when developing new standards. The  insights from this research into the evolution of operating  environments and complex systems allow the CMVP to  perform research and development on evolving test metrics  and methods and future requirements for cryptographic  modules.  The CAVP and the CMVP have stimulated the improved  quality and security assurance of cryptographic algorithm  implementations and modules. By the end of FY 2015, the  CMVP had validated and issued a total of 2,380 crypto- graphic module validation certificates to more than 475  domestic and international vendors.  As shown in Figure 12,  the CMVP awarded 197 certificates in FY 2015. The left portion  of the graphic illustrates the distribution by submission type,  based upon the modification scenarios described in the  CMVP Implementation Guidance, including:  •  1SUB - Modifications made to hardware, software or  firmware components that did not affect any FIPS 140-1  or FIPS 140-2 security relevant items (e.g., a mainte- nance activity);  •  3SUB - Modifications that include changes that affect  some of the FIPS 140-2 security-relevant items and  require revalidation, but drew upon previous submis- sions; and,  •  5SUB - Significant changes to hardware, software, or  firmware components and, therefore, were considered  a new module requiring full validation testing.  The right portion of the diagram shows the number of  certificates awarded, based upon each of the four increasing  levels of security specified in the FIPS that may be satisfied  by a cryptographic module.  Likewise, to date, the CAVP has issued approximately  19,578 validations, representing the algorithm validations of  approximately 17 approved algorithms.

The increase in validations is  attributed to other outside programs now requiring CAVP  validated implementations (e.g., NIAP).  The CMVP issued 197 module validation certificates in  FY 2015. The number of algorithms and modules submitted  for validation continues to grow, representing significant  growth in the number of validations expected to be available  in the future.

The CAVP is responsible for providing  assurance that the cryptographic algorithm implementations  contained in cryptographic modules are implemented  according to the specifications in the standards. The CAVP  accomplishes this by designing and developing conformance  testing specific to each cryptographic algorithm.  The conformance testing consists of a suite of validation  tests for each approved cryptographic algorithm. These  validation tests exercise the algorithmic requirements and  mathematical formulas detailed in the algorithm to assure  that the detailed specifications are implemented correctly  and completely. If the implementer deviates from the  specifications in the standard or excludes any part of these  specifications or requirements, the validation test will detect  the deviations and fail. The validation testing will indicate that  the algorithm implementation does not function properly or  is incomplete.  The cryptographic algorithm validation tests designed  and developed by the CAVP are used by independent third- party laboratories accredited by the NVLAP. The laboratory  works with vendors to validate their cryptographic  algorithm implementations. The suite of validation tests for  each algorithm ensures the repeatability of tests and the  equivalency of results across the testing laboratories.  There are several types of validation tests, all designed  to satisfy the testing requirements of the cryptographic  algorithms and their specifications. These include, but are  not limited to, Known-Answer Tests, Monte Carlo Tests,  and Multi-Block Message Tests. The Known-Answer Tests  are designed to examine the individual components of  the algorithm by supplying known values to the variables  and verifying the expected result. Negative testing is also  performed by supplying known incorrect values to assure  that the implementation recognizes values that are not  allowed. The Monte Carlo Test is designed to exercise the  entire implementation under test (IUT). This test is designed  to detect the presence of implementation flaws that are not  detected with the controlled input of the Known-Answer  Tests. The types of implementation flaws detected by  this validation test include pointer problems, insufficient  allocation of space, improper error handling, and incorrect  behavior of the IUT. The Multi-Block Message Test (MMT)  is designed to test the ability of the implementation to  process multi-block messages, which requires the chaining  of information from one block to the next.  During the last few years, the CTG has expanded its  publications to contain not only the algorithm’s specifica- tions, but also requirements for an algorithm’s use. Many  of these usage requirements do not fall within the scope  of the CAVP, because the CAVP focuses on the correctness  of the instructions within the algorithm’s boundary. If these  additional algorithm usage requirements are not considered  applicable to the algorithm’s implementation, they cannot  be tested at the algorithm level by the CAVP, but may be  tested by the Cryptographic Module Validation Program  (CMVP) if the requirements are considered applicable to  the cryptographic module. However, some of these usage  requirements may be considered to be outside the scope  of both the algorithm implementation and cryptographic  module. In this latter case, the fulfillment of the requirements  is the responsibility of entities using, installing, or configuring  applications or protocols that use the cryptographic  algorithms. For example, depending on the design of a  cryptographic module, it may not be possible for the module  to determine whether a specific key is used for multiple  purposes, a situation that is strongly discouraged.  The CAVP currently has algorithm validation testing for  the following cryptographic algorithms:  TABLE 1:  CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS & NIST TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS (FIPS & SPS)  CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHM/COMPONENT FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING  STANDARD (FIPS) OR SPECIAL PUBLICATION  (SP)  Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES)  SP 800-67, Recommendation for the Triple Data  Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) Block Cipher, and  SP 800-38A, Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of  Operation–Methods and Techniques  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) FIPS 197, Advanced Encryption Standard, and  SP 800-38A, Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of  Operation–Methods and Techniques  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Conformance testing is necessary  because SCAP is a complex collection of eleven individual  specifications that work together to support various use  cases. A single error in product implementation could result  in undetected vulnerabilities or policy noncompliance within  an organization’s networks.

In  general, vendors may opt for product validation for one or  more SCAP capabilities or operating systems. Currently, the  program offers testing on Microsoft Windows and Red Hat  Enterprise Linux platforms. Figure 16 illustrates the SCAP  1.2 Validation Process. The validation process starts when  a vendor voluntarily submits an SCAP-enabled product to  an NVLAP-accredited laboratory. Once the lab completes  product testing, the lab submits a test report to the SCAP  Validation Program at NIST for review. NIST reviews the  test report and awards a validation if all requirements have  been met. Once a validation is awarded, the SCAP Validation  Record is sent to the lab, and the information about the  newly validated product is posted on the SCAP Validated  Products web page.  The SCAP Validation Program resources web page  provides the public with a centralized location for all  resources and information necessary for preparing products  for SCAP 1.2 validation. Resources include: documentation,  a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), the SCAP  validation-test content, and tools for validating and  processing SCAP data streams. The SCAP validation-test  content should be used by vendors for quality assurance  testing prior to entering formal SCAP testing with an  NVLAP-accredited laboratory. The open-source tools that  are available for download may be used by SCAP content  authors for testing SCAP source content. The SCAP Content  Validation Tool (SCAPVal) may be used to determine if the  content conforms to the SCAP specification. Open-source  SCAP reference implementation tools, such as the SCAP  Reference Implementation Tool, may be used to process  SCAP data streams.  End users may use information on the SCAP Validation  web page to learn about SCAP validation and find products  that have been awarded validations. The validation  records that are posted on the SCAP Validated Products  page identify the product versions that were tested in the  laboratory, along with details about each validation, such as  the tested platforms, SCAP capabilities, the validation test  suite version, and the lab that performed the product test.  In FY 2015, five products successfully completed testing  and were awarded validations, bringing the total number  of SCAP 1.2-validated products to twelve. This provides  coverage for 80 percent of the market space. Several  products are in various stages of validation testing and are  expected to be awarded validations in FY 2016. The current  list of SCAP 1.2-validated products may be found on the  SCAP Validated Products list at https://nvd.nist.gov/SCAP- Validated-Tools.  In FY 2016, the SCAP Validation Program plans to  expand the validation test suite, adding new operating  system support and introducing module testing. SCAP  module testing enables the “SCAP Inside” labeling program.  Products using the “SCAP Inside” label have incorporated an  SCAP-validated module; however, the consumer product as  a whole has not completed validation testing by an NVLAP  accredited laboratory. Additions to the SCAP Validation  Program will be defined in NISTIR 7511 Revision 4.

The two PIV  components that come under the scope of NPIVP are the  PIV Smart Card Application and the PIV Middleware. NPIVP  test facilities that perform the two types of tests are the  Cryptographic and Security Testing (CST) Laboratories  that have been accredited by the NVLAP. As of September  2015, there were nine such facilities (see http://csrc.nist.gov/ groups/SNS/piv/npivp/testing_facilities.html).  The interface specifications for the PIV Smart Card  Application and PIV Middleware are found in a FIPS  201-associated document, namely, SP 800-73-4, Interfaces  for Personal Identity Verification. The conformance tests  for these specifications are detailed in SP 800-85A-2, PIV  Card Application and Middleware Interface Test Guidelines.  To implement these tests and to generate conformance test  reports, CSD also developed an integrated toolkit called  “PIV Interface Test Runner,” which conducts tests on both  PIV Card Application and PIV Middleware products, and  provides the toolkit to accredited NPIVP test facilities.

HSPD-12 called  for the creation of a new identity credential for federal  employees and contractors. FIPS 201 is the technical  specification for both the PIV identity credential and the PIV  system that produces, manages, and uses the credential.  Within NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL),  this work is a collaborative effort of the Information Access  Division (IAD) and CSD. CSD activities in FY 2015 directly  supported the recently revised FIPS 201-2 by updating  the relevant publications associated with FIPS 201-2 and  by developing two new publications. CSD performed the  following activities during FY 2015 in support of HSPD-12:  •  Published SP 800-157, Guidelines for Derived Personal  Identity Verification (PIV) Credentials, in December  2014. SP 800-157 defines the technical details for  implementing and deploying derived PIV credentials  on mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets.  As intended by FIPS 201-2, a derived PIV credential is  a PIV credential that can be provisioned directly to a  mobile device to enable remote enterprise access from  the device. The use of Derived PIV Credentials greatly  improves the usability of electronic authentication from  mobile devices to remote IT resources, while at the  same time maintaining the goals of HSPD-12 for com- mon identification that is secure, reliable, and interop- erable government wide.  •  Organized and hosted a workshop in March 2015 on  upcoming Special Publications supporting FIPS 201-2  (PIV).  The event drew over 160 in-person attendees  and about 75 webcast remote attendees from gov- ernment, industry, and academia representing a wide  range of implementers and professionals in cyberse- curity and physical security. Topics covered included  physical access control with the PIV Card, PIV card- holder interagency record exchange, and derived PIV  credentials.  •  Published SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity  Verification, in June 2015, after two public comment  periods. The three-part SP details the new, optional PIV  Card capabilities introduced in FIPS 201-2, including a  virtual contact interface (VCI), a secure channel proto- col, and an on-card biometric comparison mechanism.  SP 800-73-4 also requires new PIV Cards to enforce a  minimum PIN length of six digits.  •  Published SP 800-78-4, Cryptographic Algorithms and  Key Sizes for Personal Identity Verification, in June  2015, after two public comment periods. The document  has been modified to align with SP 800-73-4, and  Figure 17: Government Employees Use PIV Cards for  Facility Access  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Cryptographic algo- rithm validation testing requirements were also added.  •  Published Draft SP 800-85A-4, PIV Card Application  and Middleware Interface Test Guidelines (SP 800-73-4  Compliance), in June 2015, to align the testing require- ments with FIPS 201-2, SP 800-73-4, and SP 800-78-4.  •  Published NISTIR 7863, Cardholder Authentication for  the PIV Digital Signature Key, in June 2015. The docu- ment provides clarification for the requirement in FIPS  201-2 that a PIV cardholder perform an explicit user  action prior to each use of the digital signature key  stored on the card. NISTIR 7863 clarifies the require- ment for “explicit user action” and specifies a range of  PIN caching options that maintains the goal of “explicit  user action” while adhering to a consistent and reliable  level of security.  •  Published SP 800-79-2, Guidelines for the Authoriza- tion of Personal Identity Verification Card Issuers (PCI)  and Derived PIV Credential Issuers (DPCI), in July 2015.  The document incorporates changes required by FIPS  201-2 to accredit PIV Card Issuers and includes a set of  issuer controls for Derived PIV Credentials Issuers.  In FY 2016, CSD will continue to focus on updating the  relevant publications associated with FIPS 201-2, including SP  800-116, A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials  in Physical Access Control Systems (PACS), and developing  two new publications: SP 800-156, Representation of PIV  Chain-of-Trust for Import and Export, and SP 800-166,  Guidelines for Testing Derived Personal Identity Verification  (PIV) Credentials. CSD will also continue to provide technical  and strategic inputs to the PIV-related initiatives.

CSD tracks software security vulnerabilities (in  the National Vulnerability Database), seeks techniques for  the measurement of security vulnerabilities, and also seeks  techniques to reduce the impact and prevalence of security  vulnerabilities in newly developed products or in new  versions of existing products.  One approach to reducing the number of security  vulnerabilities in software is to improve the development  tools that are available. By identifying languages and  software development tools that support a reduction of  vulnerabilities and, by stimulating the creation of better  tools and tool usage techniques, the approach should help  developers produce applications with fewer vulnerabilities.  While it is impossible to assure the total absence of security  vulnerabilities in this way, it might well be possible to rule  out specific, significant classes of vulnerabilities that today  provide the basis for many serious exploits.  CSD is developing an empirical, competitive approach  to finding the most effective and usable combinations of  tools to produce software systems that are relatively free of  exploitable vulnerabilities. Multiple competitions are planned  that will be based on an idea developed during the Designing  a Secure Systems Engineering Competition Workshop that  was conducted by National Science Foundation in 2010. The  workshop proposed a competition for the development of a  set of tools to help non-security-expert developers to rapidly  build a significant application with zero vulnerabilities, as  detected by an extensive public test suite.  The participants in the planned competitions would  implement software systems to solve challenge problems  using software development tool chains (“toolchains”)  of their own choosing, within specified time periods. The  toolchains may include existing technologies (e.g., existing  software libraries and frameworks, code generators, reusable  source code, or bug-finding tools), novel technologies, or  any combination thereof.  Each competition would apply  a time pressure by simulating a deadline in the software  development process, increasing the likelihood of an  introduction of security flaws. The objective of the toolchains  will be to detect or prevent security flaws while still supporting  a quick-paced software development of applications with  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Through the demonstration of security  flaw avoidance in a time-constrained setting, CSD seeks to  show that wide-scale improvements in the overall security  of software products can be realized without sacrificing  time-to-market.  The competitions, which will be open to  all interested parties, will aim to provide a level playing field  for the application and measurement of the full spectrum  of commercial and research software development,  composition, and reuse techniques.  In FY 2015, CSD and its contractors developed 8  challenge problems for the competition.  A challenge problem  is comprised of three parts: 1) a functional specification of a  program to develop (during the competition), 2) a security  policy that the program must enforce, typically including  confidentiality and integrity requirements, and 3) a challenge- problem-specific test suite including 20 fully-automated  pass/fail functionality tests, 20 fully-automated pass/fail  security tests, and extensive application of random inputs  (i.e., fuzz testing).  The challenge problems span three initial  program types: command-line interface programs, mobile  applications (i.e., cell phone apps), and web applications  (browser-based apps). In FY 2015, CSD and its contractors  also developed a testing infrastructure for the competition  and performed testing to exercise the tools and to assess the  suitability of the challenge problems.  In FY 2016, CSD plans to re-engineer portions of the  testing infrastructure in response to issues uncovered by  testing, to perform a second round of testing, and to publicly  announce the first toolchain competition.

Virtualization  is a foundational technology that facilitates the use of a  computing infrastructure for cloud-computing services. At  the core of a virtualized infrastructure is the virtualized  host that provides an abstraction of the hardware (e.g.,  CPU, memory) and that enables multiple computing stacks  (comprised of the operating system, middleware, and  applications) to be run on a single physical machine, creating  dynamically provisioned, elastic compute resources. The  efficiency of such a dynamic and distributed processing  environment is counter-balanced by the interoperability,  portability, and security challenges inherent in this  computing environment. CSD is working in parallel on several  projects (introduced below) that aim to accelerate the  Federal Government’s adoption of secure cloud computing.  CSD subject matter experts collaborate with national and  international standards setting organizations, and both  the public and private sectors in developing security,  interoperability and portability standards and guidance.  CSD Role in  the NIST Cloud Computing  Program  During FY 2015, the NIST Cloud Computing Team  continued to promote the development of publications,  national and international standards, and specifications in  support of the U.S. Government’s (USG) effective and secure  use of cloud computing, as well as providing technical  guidance to federal agencies for secure and effective cloud- computing adoption. CSD supports many of the technical  standards activities hosted by the NIST Cloud Computing  Program, with a particular focus on cloud-computing  security and forensic science. Activities include the leading  role for the development of the following documents:  •  SP 800-173, Guide for Applying the Risk Manage- ment Framework to Cloud-based Federal Information  Systems (draft). This publication provides guidance  in using the Risk Management Framework described  in SP 800-37 Revision 1 to issue an authorization to  operate for cloud-based information systems. The draft  document will be posted for public comment in the  first quarter of FY 2016.  •  SP 800-174, Security and Privacy Controls for Cloud- based Federal Information Systems (internal draft).  The document will provide a cloud overlay of the SP  800-53 Revision 4 security controls for cloud-based  ecosystems.  •  Define the cloud forensics use cases that address the  top four challenges identified in NISTIR 8006, NIST  Cloud Computing Forensic Science Challenges.  CSD staff members organized the security and forensics  tracks of the eighth NIST Cloud Computing Forum and  Workshop, which was held in July 2015.  In support of U.S. cloud-computing mandates, CSD  staff members provided leadership for several public cloud  working groups operating under the NIST Cloud Computing  Program. These working groups focus on meeting the  high-priority requirements described in SP 500-293, U.S.  Government Cloud Computing Technology Roadmap.  CSD staff chaired or co-chaired several significant cloud  computing efforts in 2015:  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

The working group’s activities were  ceased in mid FY 2015.  CSD staff members participated in various standards  development organizations, all listed in the section of this  report dedicated to international standards.  In FY 2015, CSD members of the NIST cloud-computing  team continued research in key areas of cloud security,  cloud interoperability and portability, cloud metrics, cloud  services, and cloud Service Level Agreements (SLAs). They  also presented the results of cloud-computing research and  development, introduced the standards and specifications  under development, and provided the status of the NIST  Cloud-Computing Program in a variety of domestic and  international conferences and workshops. CSD staff  continues to engage industry and federal agencies for  inputs and collaborative work through working groups,  publications, and networking.

This included the publication of a revised Policy Machine  specification as NISTIR 7987 Revision 1, Policy Machine:  Features, Architecture, and Specification, in September 2015.  NIST and other members of an Ad Hoc INCITS working  group are developing a three-part Policy Machine standard  under the title of Next Generation Access Control (NGAC),  under three sub-projects:  •  Project 2193–D: Next Generation Access Control – Im- plementation Requirements, Protocols and API Defini- tions;  •  Project 2194–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Functional Architecture; and  •  Project 2195–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Generic Operations & Abstract Data Structures.  The Policy Machine’s architecture was the basis for the  NGAC work within INCITS. An initial standard from Project  2194–D was published in 2013 and is now available from the  ANSI e-standards store as INCITS 499, NGAC Functional  Architecture (NGAC–FA). The standard resulting from  Project 2195–D: INCITS 526, NGAC Generic Operations and  Abstract Data Structures (NGAC-GOADS), is in the approval  process and is expected to be published in the fall of 2015.  In FY 2016, CSD plans to issue a new version of its open- source distribution to reflect new features and enhanced  performance, revise INCITS 499, and publish SP 800-178, A  Comparison of Extensible Access Control Markup Language  (XACML) and NGAC Attribute Based Access Control  Standards for Data Services.

The objective of this project is to analyze  various configuration options in the deployment of these  components and to provide guidance in the form of security  recommendations. The project builds upon previous research  that included: (a) the identification of security requirements  for various use cases when a virtualized infrastructure is  offered for cloud services and (b) the analysis of configura- tion options for Secure Hypervisor Deployment and  providing security recommendations.  In FY 2015, the focus of research was the secure  configuration of virtual networks for the protection of VMs.  VM Security forms the primary goal in virtual network  configuration due to the following: (a) VMs are the compute- engines of the virtualized infrastructure on which mission  critical applications of the enterprise run, and (b) VMs are  the end-nodes of the virtual network. Research included the  following configuration areas:  • Network segmentation;  • Network path redundancy;  • Firewall deployment architecture; and  • VM traffic monitoring.  Research included the analysis of the security  advantages and disadvantages of various configuration  options in each of these areas, forming the basis for security  recommendations. The research resulted in the following  publications during FY 2015:  •  The conference paper entitled, Analysis of Network  Segmentation Techniques in Cloud Data Centers; and  •  Draft SP 800-125B, Secure Virtual Network Configura- tion for Virtual Machine (VM) Protection.  Cybersecurity for  Emerging  Technologies  Technology is advancing at an amazing rate, with  rapid technological advances in manufacturing, healthcare,  nanotechnology, cyber physical systems, and the “Internet  of things.” This project scans the environment for  developing technologies that may be currently at risk from a  cybersecurity perspective, or potentially at risk in the future  as the technology improves.  In FY 2015, CSD conducted research on cybersecurity  in the field of additive manufacturing or three-dimensional  (3D) printing. On February 3, 2015, CSD hosted a symposium  on Cybersecurity for Direct Digital Manufacturing, which  involves fabricating physical objects from a data file using  computer-controlled processes with little to no human  intervention, such as in additive manufacturing and 3D  printing. During the symposium, attendees representing  government, industry, and academic organizations discussed  relevant cybersecurity risks, challenges, and solutions, as  well as the implications for information and communications  technology supply-chain risk management. Attendees  identified several opportunities in the area and generally  agreed that the time is right for building cybersecurity into  these technologies. The proceedings of the symposium  were published in April 2015 in NISTIR 8041, Proceedings of  the Cybersecurity for Direct Digital Manufacturing (DDM)  Symposium.  Along the same lines, CSD researched risk management  practices for securing a set of technologies called Replication  Devices (RDs). As a result of this research, CSD published  NISTIR 8023, Risk Management for Replication Devices, in  April 2015 to help organizations protect the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of information processed, stored,  or transmitted on RDs. An RD is any device that reproduces  (e.g., copies, prints, or scans) documents, images, or objects  from an electronic or physical source.  For the purposes  of NISTIR 8023, RDs include copiers, printers, 3D printers,  scanners, and 3D scanners, as well as multifunction  machines when used as a copier, printer, or scanner. RDs in  use within organizations run the gamut in terms of age and  functionality, with some devices being relatively simple and  others quite complex and sophisticated.

Cyber threat  information includes indicators (i.e., artifacts or observable  events that suggest that an attack is imminent, that an  attack is underway, or that a compromise may have already  occurred); information about the tactics, techniques, and  procedures (TTPs) of actors; recommended courses of  action, and other information that is used to characterize  threats. Because threat actors often use the same TTPs  against multiple targets, exchanging cyber threat informa- tion allows organizations to leverage the collective  knowledge, experience, and analysis capabilities of their  peers, thereby increasing the overall awareness and security  of an entire sharing community. Through the exchange of  cyber threat information, organizations can gain a more  complete understanding of their threat environment by  correlating their observations with those of others.  When one organization observes an attack that may  affect or be used against other organizations, information  sharing and coordination can make it possible to reduce the  impact of the attack, speed recovery operations, and maintain  a higher level of operational security. By integrating cyber  threat information sharing into its existing cybersecurity and  risk management practices, an organization can reduce the  likelihood or mitigate the impact of successful cyber attacks,  more effectively protect its systems, detect and anticipate  the actions of threat actors, respond to cyber attacks, and  recover to rapidly deploy effective countermeasures.  In FY 2014, CSD worked with DHS to develop SP 800- 150, Guide to Cyber Threat Information Sharing (Draft),  which provides guidance to organizations seeking to  establish and participate in cyber threat information sharing  communities. The draft publication was released for public  comment on October 28, 2014. The goal of this publication  is to help organizations prepare for an exchange of cyber  threat information, both consuming cyber threat information  from external sources and producing information for other  organizations to use. Because each organization may have  substantially different capabilities for detecting threats,  responding to attacks, diagnosing causes, and handling  sensitive incident-related information, this guidance is  intended to help organizations collaborate and exchange  cyber threat information despite these organizational  differences.  CSD’s cyber threat information sharing initiative is  focused on providing guidance on how an organization can  establish information sharing and coordination capabilities  that enhance or augment their existing cybersecurity  practices. The guidance covers threat-informed detection,  protection and response capabilities; data privacy and  sensitivity; data collection and retention practices; the use of  open standards for information exchange; de-identification  and anonymization; and guidance on how an organization  can establish, participate in, and maintain coordination and  information sharing relationships. The guidance will help  incident responders, network defenders, and operations  personnel consider what information is sharable, the  circumstances under which sharing is permitted, with whom  the information may be shared, and how the information  should be protected.  In early FY 2016, CSD plans to release the second draft  to Draft SP 800-150, based on the input received during the  public comment period of the first draft, which was released  October 2014.

Recommendations have included the usage of passwords in  enterprises, biometrics, and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)  solutions. In FY 2015, CSD researched the classification of  general authentication features. This investigation was  prompted by the general call to move away from passwords  towards the growing number of alternative authentication  methods (e.g. biometrics, smart cards, etc.). In the early part  of this investigation, it became clear that an ontology of  authentication was needed.  A draft taxonomy (see Figure 19) was developed  to better describe current and emerging authentication  mechanisms. This taxonomy covers a wide assortment  of commonly used methods to cover human-machine,  machine-machine, and attribute attestation. It does not  address identity management - which typically happens  before authentication occurs, or access control - which  typically happens after.  As a result of this research, several patterns and gaps  were identified. For example, there are similar technologies  used to support the various mechanisms. One of the greatest  challenges is in defining a set of common metrics to assess  authentication technologies. Two areas identified as needing  metrics include authentication strength and the suitability of  the method to the environment. The strength measurements  should include security and usability. This provides a way  to monitor a common complaint of designers – usability  being a tradeoff to security. However, security and usability  is not sufficient to address the suitability of implementing  a particular authentication mechanism in a particular  environment. By adding in measures for deployability and  manageability it should be possible to address the suitability  of an authentication mechanism.

As shown in Figure 20 (previous page),  this framework will support integration of security with  deployability, usability and manageability of authentication.  This work will also be used to better identify the needs  and dependencies for proper interaction with identity  management and access control processes.

Although these mobile devices are relatively  small and inexpensive, they can be used for voice calls,  simple text messages, sending and receiving emails,  browsing the web, online banking and e-commerce, social  networking, and many functions once limited to laptop  and desktop computers. Smart phones and tablet devices  have specialized built-in hardware, such as cameras,  accelerometers, Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers,  and removable media readers. They also employ a wide range  of wireless interfaces, including infrared, Wireless Fidelity  (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, Near Field Communications (NFC), and  one or more types of cellular interfaces that provide network  connectivity across the globe.  Smart phones present new capabilities, but also a  number of new security and privacy challenges. One such  challenge concerns securing smartphone applications. To  address this issue, NIST is conducting research in software- assurance methodologies for smart phone applications (or  “apps”) and is working with other government agencies and  industry to bridge the security gaps present with today’s  smart phones. For example, NIST developed the AppVet  mobile app-vetting system and framework for managing  an organization’s app-vetting process with respect to the  organization’s security and privacy policies. This system was  used by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  (DARPA) to vet apps prior to being deployed on thousands of  mobile devices for use in Afghanistan, the 2013 Presidential  Inauguration, and the 2014 Boston Marathon.  NIST’s work in mobile security has earned the 2014  Government Computer News (GCN) award for Information  Technology Excellence and the 2013 U.S. Department of  Commerce Gold Medal Award. In FY 2016, NIST will be  transitioning AppVet to the Department of Homeland  Security as part of their Carwash program, which provides  government development teams with a continuous  integration build, testing, source code management, and  issue tracking system.

The primary  motivations for the development of IPv6 were to increase  the number of unique IP addresses available for use and to  handle the needs of new Internet applications and devices.  In addition, IPv6 was designed with the following goals:  increased ease of network management and configuration,  expandable IP headers, improved mobility and security, and  the quality of service controls. IPv6 has been, and continues  to be, developed and defined by the IETF.  FY 2012 was a significant year for the deployment  of IPv6 in the United States Government (USG). OMB’s  Memo of September 10, 2010, Transition to IPv6, required  all government agencies to “upgrade public/external facing  servers and services (e.g., web, email, Domain Name System  (DNS), and Internet Service Provider (ISP) services) to  operationally use IPv6 by the end of FY 2012.” NIST worked  with the U.S. Government IPv6 (USGv6) Task Force and with  individual government agencies to achieve this goal. NIST  developed an online monitor to demonstrate which high- level government domains have met this goal with respect  to Domain Name System (DNS) services, email, web servers,  and Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC).  In FY 2013, NIST and OMB continued to use this monitor to  measure USGv6 compliance with OMB’s requirement.

Agencies were required to “upgrade internal  client applications that communicate with public Internet  servers and supporting enterprise networks to operationally  use IPv6 by the end of FY 2014.” NIST developed online  diagnostic tools to help agencies verify compliance to this  requirement.  The NIST IPv6 Test Program, whose goal is to provide  assurance on IPv6 product conformance and interoperability,  continues to operate. In FY 2015, NIST continued to manage  and evolve the USGv6 Test Program and to help federal  agencies fulfill OMB mandates and monitor compliance to  those mandates. In FY 2016, NIST is planning to update SP  500-267, A Profile for IPv6 in the U.S. Government, Version  1.0. This document is the basis for the USGv6 Test Program  and for USG IPv6-compliant device evaluation and purchase.  The NIST program is a collaboration between CSD and the  ITL Advanced Networking Technology Division.

Practical and conceptual guidance for  these topics is needed.  In FY 2015, the following research was accomplished for  this project:  •  Enhanced the unified enforcement mechanism of data  services for use by a Policy Machine (PM) for an enter- prise computing environment;  •  Enhanced the capabilities of the Access Control Policy  Tool (ACPT);  •  Enhanced the capabilities of the Access Control Rule  Logic Circuit Simulation (ACRLC) tool;  •  Studied an Attribute Assurance mechanism for access  authentication and authorization;  •  •  Published a conference paper for Big Data Processing  access control and distributed systems; and  •  Studied efficient test case generation methods for  Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) policy testing.  In FY 2016, CSD will continue the above research. CSD  expects that this project will:  •  Promote (or accelerate) the adoption of community  computing that utilizes the power of shared resources  and common trust-management schemes;  •  Provide guidance for implementing access control  models and mechanisms for standalone or network  systems;  •  Increase the security and safety of static (connected)  distributed systems by applying the testing and verifi- cation tool for the AC policies;  •  Assist system architects, security administrators, and  security managers whose expertise is related to access  control or privilege policy in managing their systems  and in learning the limitations and practical approaches  for their applications; and  •  Provide accurate and efficient fault detection and  correction technology for implementing AC rules and  policies.

Faulty policies,  misconfigurations, or flaws in software implementation can  result in serious vulnerabilities. The specification of access  control policies is often a challenging problem. Often, a  system’s privacy and security are compromised due to the  misconfiguration of access control policies, instead of the  failure of cryptographic primitives or protocols. This problem  becomes increasingly severe as software systems become  more and more complex, and are deployed to manage a large  amount of sensitive information and resources organized  into sophisticated structures. Identifying discrepancies  between policy specifications and their properties (their  intended function) is crucial because correct implementation  and enforcement of policies by applications is based on the  premise that the policy specifications are correct. As a result,  policy specifications must undergo rigorous verification and  validation through systematic testing to ensure that the  policy specifications truly encapsulate the desires of the  policy authors.  To formally and precisely capture the security properties  that AC should adhere to, access control models are usually  written to bridge the rather wide gap in abstraction between  policy and mechanism. Thus, an access-control model  provides unambiguous and precise expression, as well as  a reference for the design and implementation of security  requirements. Techniques are required for verifying whether  an access-control model is correctly expressed in the access- control policies, and whether the properties are satisfied in  the model.  Most research on AC model or policy verification  techniques is focused on one particular model, and almost  all of the research is in applied methods, which require the  completed AC policies as the input for verification or test  processes to generate fault reports. Even though correct  verification is achieved, and counter-examples may be  generated when faults were found, those methods provide  no information about the source of faults that might allow  conflicts in privilege assignment, the leakage of privileges, or  conflict of interest permissions. The difficulty in finding the  source of faults is increased, especially when the AC rules  are intricately covering duplicated variables to a degree of  complexity. The complexity is due to the fact that a fault  might not be caused by one particular rule. Thus, it requires  manually analyzing each rule in the policy in order to find the  correct solution for the fault.  To address the issue, CSD developed the Access Control  Property Tool (ACPT), shown in Figure 22 (next page),  which allows a user to compose, verify, test, and generate  access control policies. CSD also researched the AC Rule  Logic Circuit Simulation (ACRLCS) technique, which enables  the AC authors to detect a fault when the fault-causing AC  rule is added to the policy, so the fix can be implemented in  real time before adding other rules that further complicate  the detecting effort, rather than checking by retracing the  interrelations between rules after the policy is completed.  In FY 2015, CSD accomplished the following:  •  Published a conference paper for policy tool evaluation  and analysis: Evaluating and Capability and Perfor- mance of Access Control Policy Verification Tools;  •  Developed verification oracles for policy test bench- marking, which embed policy faults for committee,  university, hospital, and bank policy test scenarios;  •  Developed a Small Business Innovation Research  (SBIR) solicitation for access control tool development;  •  Enhanced the ACRLCS − the Access Control Rule Logic  Circuit Simulation System;  •  Published a conference paper for policy test case gen- eration: Pseudo-exhaustive Testing of Attribute-Based  Access Control Rules;  •  Worked with industrial and academic organizations in  exploring new capabilities that helped to improve the  usability of the AC tools (ACPT and ACRLCS), resulting  in additional usage; ACPT was downloaded by 343  users and organizations; and,  •  Enhanced the capability of ACPT by improving policy  combination algorithms and adding test oracles for  basic access control models.  In FY 2016, CSD is planning to conduct further research  on the new capabilities and enhance the performance of the  ACPT and ACRLCS.  Figure 22 (next page) shows the system architecture  of the NIST access control policy tool: ACPT, which allows  access control policy authors to compose, verify, and test  access control policy implementation.  This project is expected to:  •  Provide a generic paradigm and framework of access  control model/property conformance testing;  •  Provide templates for specifying access control rules  in popular access control models, such as the Attribute  Based, Multilevel, and Workflow models;  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

ABAC  represents a point on the spectrum of logical access control,  from simple access control lists to more capable role-based  access (RBAC), and finally, to a highly flexible method for  providing access based on the evaluation of attributes.

The research also includes  technologies such as attribute assurance, attribute  engineering/management, identity system integration,  attribute federation, situational awareness (real-time or  contextual) mechanisms, policy management, and natural- language policy translation to digital policy. Figure 23  illustrates the interaction of many of these components. The  goal of this research is to improve information sharing, while  maintaining control of that information for federal agencies.  In FY 2015, CSD published two ABAC papers: Attribute- Based Access Control for IEEE Computing magazine, and  Implementing and Managing Policy Rules in Attribute- Based Access Control for IEEE International Conference on  Information Reuse and Integration. CSD also wrote a draft  Special Publication document for ABAC formal models  research: A Comparison of XACML and NGAC Attribute  Based Access Control Standards, which compares the  characteristics of two ABAC implementation mechanisms:  XACML and NGAC. CSD continued research on the Attribute  Assurance of ABAC in partnership with the National  Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), and  the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE).  CSD developed a draft Special Publication based on the  mechanism for defining the veracity, security, and readiness  levels of assurance of ABAC attributes.  In FY 2016, CSD will continue the research of ABAC  formal models, as well as details and extended topics of  ABAC capabilities, such as attribute assurance, ABAC  implementation examples, ABAC mechanisms, and ABAC  standards. The ABAC project will pursue the following  objectives:  •  Provide readers with the terminology and a basic un- derstanding of ABAC;  •  Provide readers with an overview of the current state  of logical access control, a working definition of ABAC,  and an explanation of the core and enterprise ABAC  concepts;  Figure 23: ABAC Access Control Mechanism Chart  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

These IT environments are under  constant threat of attack and are frequently undergoing  change, with new and updated software being deployed  along with updated configurations. The wide variety of  computing products, the dynamic nature of software, the  speed of configuration change, and the diversity of threats  require organizations to maintain situational awareness  over their IT assets and to utilize this information to make  informed risk-based decisions.  Security automation utilizes standardized data formats  and transport protocols to enable data to be exchanged  between business, operational, and security systems that  support security processes by:  •  Identifying IT assets, including hardware, software, and  data;  •  Providing awareness over the operational state of com- puting devices;  •  Enabling security reference data to be collected from  internal and external sources; and  •  Supporting analysis processes that measure the effec- tiveness of security controls and provide visibility into  security risks, enabling risk-based decision-making.  Commercial solutions built using security automation  specifications enable the collection and harmonization of  vast amounts of operational and security data into coherent,  comparable information streams to achieve situational  awareness that allows the timely and active management of  diverse IT systems. Through the creation of reference data  and guidance, and the international recognition of flexible,  open standards, the NIST security automation program  works to improve the interoperability, broad acceptance, and  adoption of security automation solutions to address current  and future security challenges, creating opportunities for  innovation.  Specif ication,  Standards,  and Guidance  Development  To support the overarching security automation vision, it  is necessary to have specifications that describe the required  interactions between systems, standards that document  international consensus approaches, and guidance that  informs product developers and implementers. Through  close work with partners in government, industry, and  academia, CSD continues to facilitate the definition and  development of security automation approaches that enable  organizations to understand and manage IT security risks.  During FY 2015, CSD has continued to work to build on  previous security automation work by:  •  Identifying and addressing gaps in the current specifi- cations;  •  Evolving existing approaches to achieve greater scal- ability and impact;  •  Participating in working groups in standards develop- ment organizations to promote international consensus  around standardized approaches;  •  Providing additional guidance on architectural, design,  and analysis concerns; and  •  Developing and maintaining tools and reference imple- mentations.

This area of work is focused on evolving security automation  specifications to integrate with existing transport protocols  to provide for the secure, interoperable exchange of security  automation data. Additional work is focused on evolving  security metrics and providing consensus guidance on  security automation approaches. Through the definition and  adoption of security automation standards and guidelines,  IT vendors will be able to provide standardized security  solutions to their customers. These solutions support  continuous monitoring and automated, dynamic network  defense capabilities, based on the analysis of data from  operational and security data sources and the collective  action of security components.  Security automation standardization work has been  focused in three areas: the evolution and international  adoption of the Security Content Automation Protocol  (SCAP), the development of software asset management  standards to support operational and cybersecurity  use cases, and the development of security automation  consensus standards. The following sections detail this work.  Security Content  Automation Protocol  (SCAP)  SCAP is a multipurpose protocol that provides an  automated means to collect and assess the state of devices.  SCAP supports automated vulnerability checking, verifying  the installation of patches, checking security configuration  settings, verifying technical-control compliance, measuring  security, and examining systems for indicators of a  compromise. SCAP uses the Extensible Markup Language  (XML) to standardize the format and nomenclature by which  security software products communicate information about  software flaws, security configurations, and other aspects of  the device state. SCAP enables security automation content,  also known as “SCAP content,” to be expressed using  standardized formats, identifiers, and scoring models. This  content can be used by any tool that is conformant to the  specifications to collect and evaluate the state of software  installed on a device.  SCAP has been widely adopted by major software  and hardware manufacturers and has become a significant  component of information-security-management and  governance programs. SCAP-enabled tools are currently  being used by the U.S. Government, critical-infrastructure  companies, academia, and other businesses, both  domestically and internationally. Currently, CSD is leveraging  SCAP in multiple areas, both to support its own mission  and to enable other agencies and private-sector entities  to meet their goals. For CSD, SCAP is a critical component  of the SCAP Validation Program, the National Vulnerability  Database (NVD), and the National Checklist Program (NCP).  In September 2012, CSD published SP 800-126 Rev. 2,  The Technical Specification for the Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2. That  document describes the 11 component specifications  composing SCAP. See Table 2 (next page): SCAP 1.2  Specifications for details.  Since the release of SCAP 1.2, CSD has worked to  improve guidance around the use of SCAP specifications. In  FY 2015, CSD released draft NISTIR 8058, Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP) Version 1.2 Content Style  Guide: Best Practices for Creating and Maintaining SCAP  1.2 Content, which provides guidance for SCAP 1.2 content  creators to ensure that stylistic variations in SCAP 1.2  content are addressed in a way that improves the accuracy  and consistency of results, avoids performance problems,  reduces user effort, lowers content maintenance burdens,  and enables content reuse. To achieve this, the report  documents best practices for content creation and  encourages their use by SCAP content authors and  maintainers. Feedback on this report is welcomed and will  help CSD to work towards producing a final version of this  document.  CSD is starting to work on an SCAP 1.3 revision. In  August 2015, CSD requested comments on the design  and development of SCAP 1.3. Specific areas of requested  feedback included:  •  Adopting the Open Vulnerability and Assessment Lan- guage (OVAL) 5.11.1, which was released in April 2015;  •  Adopting the Common Vulnerability Scoring System  (CVSS) v3, which was released in June 2015;  •  Removing support for CVSS v2; and  •  Deprecating support for older specification revisions  and SCAP 1.0.  The received feedback generally favored the adoption  of OVAL 5.11.1 and CVSS v3. Continued support for CVSS v2,  in addition to v3, and some reduction in the minimal support  for older specification revisions were also common themes  in the feedback. CSD is currently considering this feedback  while working on a draft revision of SP 800-126 for public  comment in FY 2016.

An updated revision of this standard, ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015,  was published on October 1, 2015. The software identification  (SWID) data model defined by this standard describes an  XML format for software publishers to provide authoritative  identification, categorization, software relationships  (e.g., dependency, bundling, and patch), executable and  library footprint details, and other metadata for software.  This information can be used to support operational  and cybersecurity use cases around managing software  deployments, managing software licenses, managing  software vulnerabilities and related software patches, and  assessing secure software configurations.  To supplement the requirements in ISO/IEC 19770- 2:2015, CSD has been working with DHS and NSA on the  development of NISTIR 8060, Guidelines for the Creation  of Interoperable Software Identification (SWID) Tags.  NISTIR 8060 provides an overview of the capabilities and  usage of software identification (SWID) tags as part of a  comprehensive software lifecycle. This report introduces  SWID tags in an operational context, provides guidelines for  the creation of interoperable SWID tags, and highlights key  usage scenarios for which SWID tags are applicable. Figure  24 illustrates how SWID tags support multiple elements  of the software product life cycle, including deployment,  installation, patching, upgrading and removal. CSD has  released three public discussion drafts of these guidelines.  A final public draft will be released in FY 2016, along with a  subsequent final release of the report.  Additionally, NIST has worked with the TCG to integrate  SWID tags into the Trusted Network Communications (TNC)  protocol, through the SCAP Messages for IF-M specification  that will be discussed below.  The information provided within SWID tags enhances  the SCAP use cases by providing authoritative information  that can be used to create Common Platform Enumeration  (CPE) names, to support the targeting of checklists, and to  associate software flaws to products, based on a defect in  a software library or executable. CSD will be working on a  number of reports in FY 2016 that provide further guidance  for using SWID tags to address these use cases.  Development of  Security Automation  Consensus Standards  CSD has been promoting the broad international  adoption of SCAP by encouraging the integration of SCAP  into other standards, and by adapting SCAP to address  specific gaps and challenges. CSD has continued its  collaboration with industry partners in the IETF Security  Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM) working  group. This working group provides a venue for advancing  appropriate SCAP specifications into international standards  and addressing identified gap areas. The current scope of  work for SACM includes identifying and/or defining the  transport protocols and data formats needed to support  Figure 24: SWID Tags Support the Software Product Lifecycle  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

The first such publication is the TNC SCAP  Messages for IF-M specification that supports carrying SCAP  content and results over the TNC protocols. The second is  the TNC Enterprise Compliance Profile (ECP) and related  specifications that support the exchange of SWID data  over the TNC protocols. The ECP enables the collection of  SWID data from a device for use by external tools to provide  software inventory information. SCAP and SWID data  collected using these mechanisms may be optionally used  for network access-control decision making, allowing the  device state to be evaluated when devices connect and on  an ongoing basis thereafter.  For more information on these specifications,  please visit: http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/ resources/tnc_scap_messages_for_ifm, and http://www. trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_endpoint_ compliance_profile_specification.  Finally, CSD has worked with the FIRST by participating  in two Special Interest Groups (SIGs). The CVSS SIG (CVSS- SIG) is focused on maintaining and improving the CVSS  scoring model, based on community feedback. The CVSS- SIG published CVSS Revision 3 (CVSS v3) in June 2015. The  second SIG, the Vulnerability Reporting and Data eXchange  SIG (VRDX-SIG), researches and recommends methods for  identifying and exchanging vulnerability information across  disparate vulnerability databases.  For more information, please visit: http://www.first.org/ global/sigs.  Through work with international standards-developing  organizations (SDOs), SCAP and related security automation  capabilities are expected to evolve and expand in support of  the growing need to define and measure effective security  controls, assess and monitor ongoing aspects of information  security, remediate noncompliance, and successfully  manage systems in accordance with the Risk Management  Framework described in SP 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for  Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal  Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach.  Standards that are developed and published by these SDOs  will be considered for inclusion in future revisions of SCAP.

Over the past twelve months, the SACM  working group has been working on identifying use cases,  requirements, and architectural models to inform decisions  about existing specifications and standards that can be  referenced, required modifications or extensions to existing  specifications and standards, and any gaps that need to  be addressed. CSD is working with DHS, the Center for  Internet Security (CIS), and the TCG to bring existing work  into the IETF SACM working group to include OVAL and  specifications related to the TNC protocol.  In FY 2015, the SACM use cases were published by the  IETF as Request for Comments (RFC) 7632.

SCAP and the programs  that leverage it are moving the information assurance  industry towards being able to standardize communications,  and towards the collection and storage of relevant data in  standardized formats, as well as providing automated  means for the assessment and remediation of systems for  both vulnerabilities and configuration compliance.  National  Vulnerabi l i ty  Database (NVD) Security automation reference data is currently  housed within the NVD. The NVD is the U.S. Government  repository of security automation data based on security  automation specifications. This data provides a standards- based foundation for the automation of software asset,  vulnerability, and security configuration management;  security measurement; and compliance activities. This data  supports security automation efforts based on the SCAP. The  NVD includes databases of security configuration checklists  for the NCP, listings of publicly known software flaws,  product names, and impact metrics. A formal validation  program tests the ability of vendor products to use some  forms of security automation data, based on a product’s  conformance in support of specific enterprise capabilities.  SCAP defines the structure of standardized software  flaws and security configuration reference data, also known  as SCAP content. This reference data is provided by the NVD  (http://nvd.nist.gov/).  As of October 2015, the NVD contained the following  resources:  •  Over 72,000 vulnerability advisories, with an average  of 40 new vulnerabilities added daily;  •  82 SCAP-expressed checklists containing thousands  of low-level security configuration checks that can be  used by SCAP-validated security products to perform  automated evaluations of the system state;  •  248 non-SCAP security checklists (e.g., English prose  guidance and configuration scripts);  •  249 U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US- CERT) alerts; 4,402 US-CERT vulnerability summaries;  and 10,286 SCAP machine-readable software flaw  checks, and;  •  A product dictionary with over 106,000 operating sys- tem, application, and hardware name entries; and over  58,000 vulnerability advisories translated into Spanish.  NVD is hosted and maintained by NIST and is sponsored  by the Department of Homeland Security’s US-CERT.  The use of SCAP data by commercial security products,  deployed in thousands of organizations worldwide, has  extended NVD’s effective reach. Increasing demand for NVD  XML data feeds (i.e., mechanisms that provide updated data  from data sources) and SCAP-expressed content from the  NVD website demonstrates an increased adoption of SCAP.  The NVD continues to play a pivotal role in the Payment  Card Industry (PCI) efforts to mitigate vulnerabilities in credit  card systems. PCI mandates the use of NVD vulnerability  severity scores in measuring the risk to payment card  servers worldwide and for prioritizing vulnerability patching.  PCI’s use of NVD severity scores helps enhance credit card  transaction security and protects consumers’ personal  information.

Vulnerabilities in IT products are  discovered daily, and many ready-to-use exploitation  techniques are widely available on the Internet. Because IT  products are often intended for a wide variety of audiences,  restrictive security configuration controls are usually not  enabled by default. As a result, many out-of-the box IT  products are immediately vulnerable. In addition, identifying  a reasonable set of security settings that achieve balanced  risk management is a complicated, arduous, and time- consuming task, even for experienced system administrators.  To facilitate the development of security configuration  checklists for IT products and to make checklists more  organized and usable, CSD established the National  Check-list Program (NCP) in furtherance of its statutory  responsibilities under the Federal Information Security  Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347, and  also under the Cybersecurity Research and Development Act,  which mandates that NIST “develop, and revise as necessary,  a checklist setting forth settings and option selections that  minimize the security risks associated with each computer  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Paragraph (d) of section 39.101 states,  “In acquiring information technology, agencies shall include  the appropriate IT security policies and requirements,  including use of common security configurations available  from the NIST website at http://checklists.nist.gov. Agency  contracting officers should consult with the requiring official  to ensure the appropriate standards are incorporated.”  In Memorandum M-08-22, OMB mandated the use of  SCAP-validated products for the continuous monitoring of  Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) compliance.  The NCP strives to encourage and assist federal agencies  with these mandates.  The goals of the NCP are to:  •  Facilitate the development and sharing of checklists by  providing a formal framework for checklist developers  to submit checklists to NIST;  •  Provide guidance to developers to help them create  standardized, high-quality checklists that conform to  common operation environments;  •  Help developers and users by providing guidelines for  making checklists better documented and more usable;  •  Encourage software vendors and other parties to de- velop checklists;  •  Provide a managed process for the review, update, and  maintenance of checklists;  •  Provide an easy-to-use repository of checklists; and  •  Encourage the use of automation technologies (e.g.,  SCAP) for checklist application.  NCP added 100 new checklists in FY 2015, bringing the  number of checklists posted on the website to 353 (see  http://checklists.nist.gov). Of that total, 153 of the checklists,  addressing 86 platforms, are SCAP-expressed and can be  used with SCAP-validated products. This represents a 45  % increase in the number of SCAP-expressed checklists  when compared to FY 2014, demonstrating continual use  and adoption of this automated means of expressing and  consuming checklist content.  Organizations can use checklists obtained from the  NCP website for automated security configuration patch  assessment. The NCP currently hosts SCAP checklists for  Internet Explorer 9.0, Internet Explorer 10.0, Office 2010,  Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows  Server 2012, and other products.  To assist users in identifying automated checklist content,  NCP groups these checklists into tiers, from Tier I to Tier IV.  The NCP uses the tiers to rank checklists according to their  automation capability. Tier III and IV checklists include fully  vetted SCAP content that has successfully demonstrated  conformance to the requirements outlined in SP 800-126.  Tier III & IV checklists are considered production-ready and  are intended for use with SCAP-validated products.  Tier II checklists document recommended security  settings in a machine-readable, nonstandard format, such  as a proprietary format or a product-specific configuration  script. Tier I checklists are prose-based and contain no  machine-readable content. Users can browse the checklists,  based on the checklist tier, IT product, IT product category,  or authority, and through a keyword search that searches the  checklist name and summary for user specified terms. The  search results show the detailed checklist metadata and a  link to any SCAP content for the checklist, as well as links to  any supporting resources associated with the checklist.  To assist checklist developers, the NCP provides both  manual and automated interfaces to facilitate the submission  and maintenance processes. The manual interface consists  of a web application that guides the submitter through  the data entry process to ensure that all of the required  information is submitted. The submission is validated  upon review, and a report is returned to the submitting  organization, verifying either acceptance or rejection, based  on the criteria requirements. For instance, Tier III and Tier  IV checklists require validation using the SCAP Content  Validation Tool (this tool is available for download via  http://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.2/#tools).  The NCP is defined in SP 800-70 Revision 3, National  Checklist Program for IT Products—Guidelines for Checklist  Users and Developers, which can be found at http://csrc.nist. gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.

The project originally  evolved from the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC)  mandate originally described in a March 2007 memorandum  from OMB, Memorandum M-07-11. The purpose of the USGCB  program is to help improve information security and reduce  overall IT operating costs by providing commonly accepted  and agreed upon security configurations for major operating  systems and applications.  Through the NCP described in SP 800-70 Revision 3,  a baseline submitter may express interest in submitting a  candidate for use in the USGCB program.  CSD provides ongoing support for the USGCB  automation content, including periodic updates to the  existing content, encouraging vendors to submit candidates,  assisting USGCB users in continuously monitoring and  assessing security compliance of information systems  within their environment. This ongoing monitoring element  supports the Risk Management Framework described in  SP 800-37 Revision 1. It also supports the Core functions  of the Cybersecurity Framework, providing USGCB users  with settings that protect digital assets and supports the  detection of suspicious activity.  During FY 2016, the USGCB program will continue to  provide ongoing maintenance of the baseline artifacts and  to consider additional applicable platforms as authored  and submitted by the platform vendors, as well as other  organizations that wish to contribute candidate content.

The configurations are based on a collection of resources,  including the existing NIST OS X configuration guidance,  the OS X security configuration guide, the Department of  Defense (DOD) OS X Recommended Settings, and the  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) OS X Security  Technical Implementation Guide (STIG). The project team  aggregated 400 initial settings, determined which settings  to include in the configuration baseline, and determined  appropriate values for each included setting. The desired  configuration items have been established, and the team is  continuing to develop shell scripts that apply the settings  to an OS X 10.10 system. The settings are organized into  three key baselines, which are appropriate for different  environments:  •  The Enterprise baseline is appropriate for centrally  managed, networked systems;  •  The Small Office Home Office baseline, sometimes  called Standalone, describes small, informal computer  installations that are used for home or business pur- poses; and  •  The Specialized Security-Limited Functionality baseline  is appropriate for systems where security requirements  are more stringent and where the implementation of  security safeguards is likely to reduce functionality.  SCAP, defined and discussed in an earlier section of this  report, will be used to express configuration settings and  check system configuration compliance.  During FY 2013, CSD provided a block of initial settings  to Apple and these settings were posted for the Apple  community on a periodic basis for public review, discussion,  correction and agreement. Each setting has a designated  Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) number, which  aids in the long-term tracking of the setting. Ultimately, the  settings will be tested and included in the configuration  baselines. In addition, CSD started the production of a draft  guideline, Guide to Securing Apple OS X 10.8 Systems for  IT Professionals. This guidance, which is similar in structure  to the SP 800-68, Windows XP Security Guide, focuses on  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

During FY 2014, a majority of all proposed settings were  scripted. The corresponding spreadsheet batches have been  sent to Apple for feedback; approximately 230 settings are  now completed. Settings have also been implemented on OS  X 10.9, when possible. Work on the draft guideline, Guide to  Securing Apple OS X 10.8 Systems for IT Professionals, was  temporarily suspended while configuration setting research  was performed, but was resumed in FY 2015.  In FY 2015, CSD focused on the OS X 10.10 operating  system for security testing. CSD finalized and tested the  entire security configuration of 230 settings for OS X 10.10  and has continued updating the draft publication that was  started for OS X 10.8 and has now been focused on OS X  10.10.  For several months, one of the script’s three profiles  was deployed on select CSD systems for extensive testing.  So far, results have been positive.  In FY 2016, CSD plans to release the draft publication,  Guide to Securing Apple OS X 10.10 Systems for IT  Professionals, for at least one public comment period, and  plans to release a final version after incorporating changes  from the comment period(s). CSD will continue to refine the  script and add more settings to the configuration.

Vulnerabilities are regularly discovered in software  applications that are exploited to stage cyber attacks.  System administrators need objective metrics to guide and  justify decision making as they manage the security risk  of enterprise networks. The objective of this research is to  develop a standard model for the security risk analysis of  computer networks. A standard model will enable NIST to  answer questions such as “Are we more secure now than  yesterday?” or “How does the security of one network  configuration compare with another one?” Also, having a  standard model to measure network security will allow users,  vendors, and researchers to evaluate methodologies and  products for network security in a coherent and consistent  manner.  CSD has approached the challenge of network security  analysis by capturing vulnerability interdependencies  and measuring security, based on how real attackers have  penetrated networks. CSD’s methodology for security risk  analysis is based on attack graphs. CSD analyzes attack  paths through a network, providing a probabilistic metric of  the overall system risk. Through this metric, CSD analyzes  trade-offs between security costs and security benefits.  Computer systems are vulnerable to both known and  zero-day attacks. Enterprises have begun to move parts  of their networks from a traditional infrastructure into  cloud computing environments. Cloud providers can offer  virtual servers that can be rented on demand by users. This  paradigm enables cloud customers to acquire computing  resources with high efficiency, low cost and great flexibility.  However, it also introduces many security problems that  need to be solved.  In FY 2015, CSD attempted to model the problem of  cloud security using a cloud-level attack graph. An attacker  can create stealthy bridges (i.e., a covert connection  between disparate networks that should be isolated) in a  cloud environment. These stealthy bridges can be created  using zero day vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by  vulnerability scanners. The stealthy bridges can be used to  construct a multi-step attack path and facilitate a subsequent  intrusion process across enterprise islands in a cloud. CSD  has developed a new technique to detect potential attacks  in a Cloud using a probabilistic attack graph model.

CSD  also plans to publish the results as a NIST report and as white  papers in conferences and journals.

Most of the  work leverages graph theory (the math of dots and lines)  and algorithmic complexity analysis (the math around fast  computation). In performing this work, the AIM project  seeks to enhance the nation’s ability to defend itself from  network-borne attacks.  This scientific research is conducted in partnership  with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), the University  of Maryland, and the Center for Applied Internet Data  Analysis. ARL’s participation helps focus the work on  solving immediate critical problems facing U.S. Government  networks. However, research solutions are made publicly  available and are designed to be generally applicable to as  many environments as possible.  In FY 2015, the AIM project completed research in  several areas: measurements of Internet resilience of  colluding country attacks, the optimal placement of  defensive resources in Internet Protocol (IP) v6 networks,  and circumvention-resistant network scan detection. More  specifically, the project team accomplished the following:  •  The team analyzed the resilience of the Internet with  respect to countries colluding in using their influence  over the Internet infrastructure to disconnect two  countries, isolate a set of countries from the Internet, or  break the Internet up into non-communicating clusters  (the research was published in the International Journal  of Computer Science: Theory and Applications, as well  as in the proceedings of the Workshop for the Security  of Emerging Network Technologies).  •  The research team showed how to leverage Internet  Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) network migrations to en- hance security capabilities. This was done through an  evaluation of how to optimize the placement of defen- sive resources in specially secured IPv6 networks. The  optimal placements best limit the movement of internal  attackers to a small set of hosts or else force them to  penetrate through the special security boundaries (the  research was published in the journal Data and Appli- cations Security and Privacy).  •  In previous work, the team discovered a critical weak- ness in the most widely cited Threshold Random Walk  (TRW) network scan detection algorithm that enabled  a full circumvention by attackers. To mitigate the prob- lem, we invented a scan detection methodology that  will detect TRW circumvention activity and that also  acts as an effective general-purpose scan detection  algorithm. However, we find that the most effective  approach is a composite solution that combines our  approach with TRW (the research was published in the  journal of Security Informatics).  In FY 2016, the AIM project will work on new methods  for network anomaly detection, efficient representations  for attack graphs, efficient computation of access control  policy to restrict insider attacks, vertex partitioning on  massive graphs to enable security resiliency analyses, and  methods for using attack graphs to perform defense-in- depth measurements.

NIST  research has shown that most failures are triggered by one  or two parameters, and progressively fewer by three, four, or  more parameters (see Figure 25 below), a relationship that  is called the Interaction Rule. These results have important  implications for testing. If all faults in a system can be  triggered by a combination of n or fewer parameters, then  testing all n-way combinations of parameters can provide  very strong fault detection efficiency. These methods are  being applied to software and hardware testing for reliability,  safety, and security. CSD’s focus is on empirical results and  real-world problems.  Project highlights for FY 2015 include the publication of  a paper on a new method of “oracle-free testing”, a form  of consistency checking using two-layer covering arrays  with equivalence classes to automatically detect a large  class of software faults; invited lectures at conferences and  universities; leading the fourth International Workshop on  Combinatorial Testing, held in conjunction with the eighth  IEEE  International Conference on Software Testing; initiating  research on using combinatorial methods to reduce the cost  of high assurance for life-critical software, tools and methods  for locating faults from test results; and analyzing the factors  involved  in different types of software faults. Collaborators  include researchers from the University of Texas at Arlington,  the University of Texas at Dallas, East Carolina University,  and Duke University.  Figure 25: Interaction Rule Graph  Technology transfer activities included the publication  of a number of technical papers and software distribution;  publication of the results of a Cooperative R&D (CRADA)  project with Lockheed Martin; release of enhanced  combinatorial measurement tools; input modeling and  fault location tools; a provisional patent application on the  oracle-free testing method; plus seminars at a number of  conferences, universities, and federal agencies.  Plans for FY 2016 include combinatorial testing for  big data software; initiation of a new CRADA project;  measurement of input model combination coverage of  security-critical software; a beta release of tools for testing  to the modified condition decision coverage test criterion  for life-critical software; developing tools to implement  oracle-free testing methods; analysis of empirical data  on failures; further development of methods and tools for  fault localization; and seminars, workshops, and tutorials at  professional meetings and research labs.

Many security and protection mechanisms are  currently rooted in software that, along with all underlying  components, must be trusted and not tampered with. A  vulnerability in any of those components could compromise  the trustworthiness of the security mechanisms that rely  upon those components. Stronger security assurances may  be possible by grounding security mechanisms in roots of  trust.  Roots of trust are highly reliable and secure hardware,  firmware, and software components that perform specific,  critical security functions. Because roots of trust are  inherently trusted, they must be secure by their design. As  such, many roots of trust are implemented in hardware or  protected firmware so that malware cannot tamper with  the functions they provide. Roots of trust provide a firm  foundation from which to build security and trust.  CSD’s work aims to encourage the use of roots of  trust in computers to provide stronger security assurances.  A focus area for this work has been securing firmware.  Previous guidelines by CSD described methods to protect  boot firmware, commonly known as the Basic Input/Output  System (BIOS) in PC clients and servers.

In FY 2016, CSD will continue to work with the computer  industry on the use of roots of trust to improve the security  of BIOS and other firmware. As part of this effort, CSD is  researching techniques and requirements for securing  firmware throughout the platform.  This effort will consider  methods to protect this firmware from unauthorized  changes, detect accidental or malicious corruption, and  recover from destructive attacks.

NIST’s Dr. Ron Ross Wins Three Top Awards  for Advancing Cybersecurity Dr. Ron Ross, leader of the Federal Information Security Management  Act (FISMA) Implementation Project and an international cybersecurity  ambassador, was recognized by three organizations for contributions to  the field of cybersecurity:  •  Dr. Ross was presented the Samuel J. Heyman Service to America  Medal in the area of Homeland Security and Law Enforcement. The  medal, often referred to as the “Sammie” award, is considered the  “Oscar” award of government service. It highlights excellence in the  federal workforce and inspires other talented and dedicated individuals  to enter public service. He received the honor for “instituting a state- of-the-art risk assessment system that has protected federal computer  networks from cyberattacks and helped secure information critical to  our national and economic security.”  •  Government Computer News (GCN) magazine named Dr. Ross as Gov- ernment Executive of the Year for his contributions to securing federal  information systems.  •  Dr. Ross was also inducted into the National Cyber Security Hall of Fame. The organization honors innovative indi- viduals and organizations for their vision and leadership in creating foundational building blocks of the cybersecurity  industry.  As a result of his widely used work, Dr. Ross has been called on by U.S. industry, academia and governments around the  world to help their efforts to protect information.

In an effort to provide greater access to NIST’s broad  portfolio of security and privacy publications, CSD began  posting additional Special Publications and NISTIRs on the  CSRC that were developed by other components at NIST,  such as the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence  (NCCoE) and National Strategy for Trusted Identities in  Cyberspace (NSTIC).  For example, CSRC now displays  publications from the new NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide  series, SP 1800, authored by the NCCoE staff.  The first three  SP 1800 drafts were posted for public comment, describing  work that closely relates to CSD standards, guidelines and  research.  By posting cybersecurity and privacy draft publications  from other NIST components on CSRC, CSD aims to provide  greater visibility during public comment periods and to  provide a primary resource for stakeholders to access a  broad range of NIST cybersecurity and privacy publications.  In FY 2015, CSD posted a substantial number of final  publications to CSRC, including two FIPS, fifteen Special  Publications, and seven NISTIRs. The release of FIPS 202,  SHA-3 Standard, in August 2015 was the culmination of  many years of effort by the Cryptographic Technology Group  to develop a next-generation standard for secure hashing.  FIPS 202 specifies a family of fixed-length hash functions  and extendable-output functions that complement the  existing SHA-2 algorithms specified in FIPS 180-4, Secure  Hash Standard (SHS).  CSD continued to engage the public by posting fifteen  SPs and thirteen NISTIRs as drafts for public comment. That  included Draft NISTIR 8060, Guidelines for the Creation  of Interoperable Software Identification (SWID) Tags, for  which three iterations were released during short, two- week public comment periods.  Comments were requested  on three existing publications to determine what changes  or approaches should be taken, prior to releasing an official  draft for public comment.  Those publications include  i) SP 800-63-2, Electronic Authentication Guideline, ii)  Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) version 1.3  and iii) the potential use of ISO/IEC 19790:2012 as the U.S.  federal standard for cryptographic modules (as a potential  successor to FIPS 140-2).  Publications are available for download from CSRC  (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/), including several NIST  technical series:  •  FIPS (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html);  •  Special Publications (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/ PubsSPs.html);  •  NISTIRs (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsNISTIRs. html); and  •  ITL Bulletins (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/Pub- sITLSB.html).  The following lists summarize some of the top CSD  publications downloaded in FY 2015:  Top 10 Most-Downloaded CSD  Publications in  NIST Technical  Series  ( i .e. ,  FIPS,  SP 800s,  NISTIRs,  and ITL  Bul let ins):  1.

Additionally, CSD shares its ongoing research efforts  through other publications, such as journal articles,  conference papers, books and other whitepapers. Although  available through NIST’s Publications Portal (http://www. nist.gov/publication-portal.cfm), they can also be accessed  on CSRC’s Articles page (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/ articles/). During FY 2015, more than 20 such documents  were published, and are listed in the next section (FY 2015  Computer Security Division Publications) of this annual  report.  In FY 2016, CSD plans to release a new version of CSRC  that uses a content management system.  The publications  interface on the redesigned website will give users  significantly greater capabilities for browsing, searching,  downloading and sharing information on NIST’s broad  collection of computer security and privacy publications.  FY 2015 Computer  Security Division  Publications  The Computer Security Division uses multiple NIST  Technical Series to promulgate security standards,  guidelines, recommendations, research, and additional  background material. Those series include FIPS, SPs, NISTIRs  and ITL Bulletins. Links to these publications are available at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications. As described earlier, in  FY 2015, CSD began expanding its publication portfolio on  CSRC by posting cybersecurity and privacy SPs and NISTIRs  from other NIST components. In some cases, CSD staff  contributed to the development of a publication (e.g., Draft SP  1800-3).  Others were developed by other ITL cybersecurity  components (e.g., NCCoE and NSTIC), documents that are  closely related to CSD activities (e.g., Draft NISTIR 8062), or  describe CSD programs and standardization activities within  a greater context (e.g., Draft NISTIR 8074).  Additionally, each year CSD staff author numerous  additional publications, including journal articles, conference  papers, and other papers that are widely disseminated. They  range from basic research to high-level summaries of CSD  activities.

These publications are available at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications.  FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING  STANDARDS (FIPS)  FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based Hash and  Extendable-Output Functions  This standard specifies the Secure Hash Algorithm-3 (SHA- 3) family of functions on binary data. Each of the SHA-3  functions is based on an instance of the Keccak algorithm  that NIST selected as the winner of the SHA-3 Cryptographic  Hash Algorithm Competition. This standard also specifies  the Keccak-p family of mathematical permutations,  including the permutation that underlies Keccak, in order to  facilitate the development of additional permutation-based  cryptographic functions.  The SHA-3 family consists of four cryptographic hash  functions, called SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and  SHA3-512, and two extendable-output functions (XOFs),  called SHAKE128 and SHAKE256.  Hash functions are components for many important  information security applications, including 1) the generation  and verification of digital signatures, 2) key derivation, and 3)  pseudorandom bit generation. The hash functions specified  in this standard supplement the SHA-1 hash function and  the SHA-2 family of hash functions that are specified in FIPS  180-4, Secure Hash Standard.  Extendable-output functions are different from hash  functions, but it is possible to use them in similar ways, with  the flexibility to be adapted directly to the requirements  of individual applications, subject to additional security  considerations.  FIPS 180-4 (Updated), Secure Hash Standard (SHS)  This standard specifies SHA-1 and the SHA-2 family of hash  algorithms that can be used to generate digests of messages.  The digests are used to detect whether messages have been  changed since the digests were generated. The Applicability  Clause of this standard was revised to correspond with the  release of FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based  Hash and Extendable-Output Functions (see above). The  revision to the Applicability Clause approves the use of  hash functions specified in either FIPS 180-4 or FIPS 202  when a secure hash function is required for the protection  of sensitive, unclassified information in federal applications,  including as a component within other cryptographic  algorithms and protocols.

This guideline  applies to federal IT systems and will also be useful for  any small or medium sized organizations.  Technologies  recommended in support of the core Simple Mail Transfer  Protocol (SMTP) and the Domain Name System (DNS)  include mechanisms for authenticating a sending domain  (Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain Keys Identified  Mail (DKIM) and Domain-based Message Authentication),  Reporting and Conformance (DMARC).  Recommendations  for email transmission security include Transport Layer  Security (TLS) and associated certificate authentication  protocols. Email content security is facilitated through the  encryption and authentication of message content using  Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) and  OpenPGP, and associated certificate and key distribution  protocols.  SP 800-176, Computer Security Division 2014 Annual  Report  Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002, titled the Federal  Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,  requires NIST to prepare an annual public report on activities  undertaken in the previous year and planned for the coming  year to carry out responsibilities under this law. The primary  goal of the Computer Security Division, a component of  NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory, is to provide  standards and technology that protects information  systems against threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of information and services. During Fiscal Year  2014, CSD successfully responded to numerous challenges  and opportunities in fulfilling that mission. This annual report  highlights the research agenda and activities in which CSD  was engaged during FY 2014.  SP 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified  Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and  Organizations  The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information  (CUI) while residing in nonfederal information systems  and organizations is of paramount importance to federal  agencies and can directly impact the ability of the Federal  Government to successfully carry out its designated missions  and business operations. This publication provides federal  agencies with recommended requirements for protecting  the confidentiality of CUI: (i) when the CUI is resident in  nonfederal information systems and organizations; (ii)  when the information systems where the CUI resides are  not used or operated by contractors of federal agencies  or other organizations on behalf of those agencies; and  (iii) where there are no specific safeguarding requirements  for protecting the confidentiality of CUI prescribed by the  authorizing law, regulation, or government-wide policy for  the CUI category or subcategory listed in the CUI Registry.  The requirements apply to all components of nonfederal  information systems and organizations that process, store,  or transmit CUI, or provide security protection for such  components. The CUI requirements are intended for use by  federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements  established between those agencies and nonfederal  organizations.  SP 800-163, Vetting the Security of Mobile Applications  Today’s commercially available mobile devices (e.g.,  smartphones and tablets) are handheld computing  platforms with wireless capabilities, geographic localization  capabilities, cameras, and microphones. Similar to computing  platforms such as desktops and laptops, the user experience  with a mobile device is tied to the software apps and the  tools and utilities available. The purpose of this document  is to provide guidance for vetting third party software  applications (apps) for mobile devices. Mobile app vetting is  intended to assess a mobile app’s operational characteristics  of secure behavior and reliability (including performance) so  that organizations can determine if the app is acceptable for  use in their expected environment.  SP 800-161, Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for  Federal Information Systems and Organizations  Federal agencies are concerned about the risks associated  with information and communications technology (ICT)  products and services that may contain potentially malicious  functionality, are counterfeit, or are vulnerable due to  poor manufacturing and development practices within  the ICT supply chain. These risks are associated with the  federal agencies decreased visibility into, understanding  of, and control over how the technology that they acquire  is developed, integrated and deployed, as well as the  processes, procedures, and practices used to assure the  integrity, security, resilience, and quality of the products and  services.  This publication provides guidance to federal agencies on  identifying, assessing, and mitigating ICT supply chain risks  at all levels of their organizations.

DRAFT SP 800-152 (Third Draft), A Profile for U.S.  Federal Cryptographic Key Management Systems (CKMS)  This Profile for U.S. Federal Cryptographic Key Management  Systems (FCKMSs) contains requirements for their design,  implementation, procurement, installation, configuration,  management, operation, and use by U.S. federal  organizations. The Profile is based on SP 800-130, A  Framework for Designing Cryptographic Key Management  Systems (CKMS).  DRAFT SP 800-150, Guide to Cyber Threat Information  Sharing  In today’s active threat environment, incident detection and  response is an ongoing challenge for many organizations.  This publication assists organizations in establishing  computer security incident response capabilities that  leverage the collective knowledge, experience, and abilities  of their partners by actively sharing threat intelligence and  ongoing coordination. This publication provides guidelines  for coordinated incident handling, including producing  and consuming data, participating in information sharing  communities, and protecting incident-related data.  DRAFT SP 800-131A Revision 1, Transitions:  Recommendation for Transitioning the Use of  Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Lengths  At the start of the 21st Century, NIST began the task of  providing cryptographic key management guidance,  which includes defining and implementing appropriate key  management procedures, using algorithms that adequately  protect sensitive information, and planning ahead for  possible changes in the use of cryptography because  of algorithm breaks or the availability of more powerful  computing techniques. NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 was the first  document produced in this effort, and includes a general  approach for transitioning from one algorithm or key length  to another. This Recommendation (SP 800-131A) provides  more specific guidance for transitions to the use of stronger  cryptographic keys and more robust algorithms.  DRAFT SP 800-125A, Secure Recommendations for  Hypervisor Deployment  The Hypervisor is a piece of software that provides the  abstraction of all physical resources (such as CPU, Memory,  Network and Storage) and thus, enables multiple computing  stacks (consisting of an operating system, Middleware and  Application programs) called Virtual Machines (VMs) to  be run on a single physical host. In addition, a hypervisor  may have the functionality to define a network within a  single physical host (called a virtual network) to enable  communication among the VMs resident on that host, as  well as with physical and virtual machines outside the host.  With all this functionality, the hypervisor is responsible  for mediating access to physical resources, providing run- time isolation among resident VMs and enabling a virtual  network that provides security-preserving communication  flow among the VMs, and between the VMs and the external  network. To design a hypervisor with the core functionality  described above, there are architectural options, with each  option presenting a different size of Trusted Computing  Base (TCB) and hence, a different degree of ease in  providing the required security assurance. Hence, in  providing security recommendations for the hypervisor, two  different approaches have been adopted in this document–  one approach based on architectural options that provide  more security assurance, and the second approach based on  configuration choices that form part of its core administrative  functions, such as the management of VMs, hypervisor host,  hypervisor software and virtual networks.  DRAFT SP 800-125B, Secure Virtual Network  Configuration for Virtual Machine (VM) Protection  Virtual Machines (VMs) are key resources to be protected,  since they are the compute engines hosting mission-critical  applications. Since VMs are end-nodes of a virtual network,  the configuration of the virtual network forms an important  element in the security of VMs and their hosted applications.  The virtual network configuration areas discussed in this  document are: Network Segmentation, Network path  redundancy, firewall deployment architectures and VM Traffic  Monitoring. The various configuration options under these  areas are analyzed for their advantages and disadvantages,  and a set of security recommendations are provided.  SP 800-90A Revision 1, Recommendation for Random  Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit  Generators  This Recommendation specifies mechanisms for the  generation of random bits using deterministic methods. The  methods provided are based on either hash functions or  block cipher algorithms.

This guide will assist organizations and system  owners in making practical sanitization decisions, based on  a categorization of the confidentiality of their information.  DRAFT SP 800-85A-4, PIV Card Application and  Middleware Interface Test Guidelines (SP 800-73-4  Compliance)  SP 800-73 contains the technical specifications to interface  with the smart card to retrieve and use the PIV identity  credentials. This document, SP 800-85A, contains the  test assertions and test procedures for testing smart card  middleware as well as the card application. The tests reflect  the design goals of interoperability and PIV Card functions.  SP 800-82 Revision 2, Guide to Industrial Control  Systems (ICS) Security  This document provides guidance on how to secure Industrial  Control Systems (ICS), including Supervisory Control and  Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Distributed Control  Systems (DCS), and other control system configurations,  such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), while  addressing their unique performance, reliability, and safety  requirements. The document provides an overview of ICS  and typical system topologies, identifies typical threats and  vulnerabilities to these systems, and provides recommended  security countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks.  SP 800-79-2, Guidelines for the Authorization of Personal  Identity Verification Card Issuers (PCI) and Derived PIV  Credential Issuers (DPCI)  The purpose of this SP is to provide appropriate and useful  guidelines for assessing the reliability of issuers of PIV Cards  and Derived PIV Credentials. These issuers store personal  information and issue credentials based on OMB policies  and on the standards published in response to HSPD-12  and, therefore, are the primary target of the assessment  and authorization under this guideline. The reliability of an  issuer is of utmost importance when one organization (e.g.,  a federal agency) is required to trust the identity credentials  of individuals that were created and issued by another  federal agency. This trust will only exist if organizations  relying on the credentials issued by a given organization  have the necessary level of assurance that the reliability of  the issuing organization has been established through a  formal authorization process.  SP 800-78-4, Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for  Personal Identity Verification  FIPS 201-2 defines requirements for the PIV lifecycle activities,  including identity proofing, registration, PIV Card issuance,  and PIV Card usage. FIPS 201-2 also defines the structure of  an identity credential that includes cryptographic keys. This  document contains the technical specifications needed for  the mandatory and optional cryptographic keys specified in  FIPS 201-2, as well as the supporting infrastructure specified  in FIPS 201-2 and the related SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for  Personal Identity Verification, and SP 800-76-2, Biometric  Specifications for Personal Identity Verification, that rely on  cryptographic functions.  SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification  FIPS 201 defines the requirements and characteristics of a  government-wide interoperable identity credential. FIPS 201  also specifies that this identity credential must be stored on a  smart card. This document, SP 800-73, contains the technical  specifications to interface with the smart card to retrieve  and use the PIV identity credentials. The specifications  reflect the design goals of interoperability and PIV Card  functions. The goals are addressed by specifying a PIV data  model, card edge interface, and application programming  interface. The specifications go further by constraining  implementers’ interpretations of the normative standards.  Such restrictions are designed to ease implementation,  facilitate interoperability, and ensure performance, in a  manner tailored for PIV applications.  DRAFT SP 800-70 Revision 3, National Checklist Program  for IT Products: Guidelines for Checklist Users and  Developers  A security configuration checklist is a document that  contains instructions or procedures for configuring an  IT product for an operational environment, for verifying  that the product has been configured properly, and/or for  identifying unauthorized changes to the product. Using  these checklists can minimize the attack surface, reduce  vulnerabilities, lessen the impact of successful attacks,  and identify changes that might otherwise go undetected.  To facilitate the development of checklists and to make  checklists more organized and usable, NIST established the  National Checklist Program (NCP). This publication explains  how to use the NCP to find and retrieve checklists, and it also  describes the policies, procedures, and general requirements  for participation in the NCP.

The document:  1.  Defines the security services that may be provided and  key types that may be employed in using cryptographic  mechanisms;  2.  Provides background information regarding the  cryptographic algorithms that use cryptographic keying  material;  3.  Classifies the different types of keys and other  cryptographic information according to their functions,  specifies the protection that each type of information  requires and identifies methods for providing this  protection;  4.  Identifies the states in which a cryptographic key may  exist during its lifetime;  5.  Identifies the multitude of functions involved in key  management; and  6.  Discusses a variety of key management issues related  to the keying material. Topics discussed include  key usage, cryptoperiod length, domain-parameter  validation, public-key validation, accountability, audit,  key management system survivability, and guidance for  cryptographic algorithm and key size selection.  SP 800-57 Part 3 Revision 1, Recommendation for  Key Management, Part 3: Application-Specific Key  Management Guidance  SP 800-57 Part 3 is intended primarily to help system  administrators and system installers adequately secure  applications, based on product availability and organizational  needs and to support organizational decisions about future  procurements. This document also provides information  for end users regarding application options left under their  control in normal use of the application. Recommendations  are given for a select set of applications: Public Key  Infrastructures (PKI), Internet Protocol Security (IPsec),  Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure/Multipurpose  Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME), Kerberos, Over-the-Air  Rekeying of Digital Radios (OTAR), Domain Name System  Security Extensions (DNSSEC), Encrypted File Systems  (EFS), and Secure Shell (SSH).  SP 800-53A Revision 4, Assessing Security and  Privacy Controls in Federal Information Systems and  Organizations: Building Effective Assessment Plans  This publication provides a set of procedures for conducting  assessments of the security controls and privacy controls  employed within federal information systems and  organizations. The assessment procedures, executed at  various phases of the system development life cycle, are  consistent with the security and privacy controls in SP 800- 53 Revision 4. The procedures are customizable and can  be easily tailored to provide organizations with the needed  flexibility to conduct security control assessments and  privacy control assessments that support organizational risk  management processes and that are aligned with the stated  risk tolerance of the organization. Information on building  effective security assessment plans and privacy assessment  plans is also provided, along with guidance on analyzing  assessment results.  SP 800-53 Rev. 4 (Update), Security and Privacy Controls  for Federal Information Systems and Organizations  This publication provides a catalog of security and  privacy controls for federal information systems and  organizations and a process for selecting controls to protect  organizational operations (including mission, functions,  image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals,  other organizations, and the Nation from a diverse set of  threats, including hostile cyber attacks, natural disasters,  structural failures, and human errors (both intentional  and unintentional). The security and privacy controls are  customizable and implemented as part of an organization- wide process that manages information security and privacy  risk. The controls address a diverse set of security and privacy  requirements across the Federal Government and critical  infrastructure that are derived from legislation, Executive  Orders, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and/or  mission/business needs. The publication also describes how  to develop specialized sets of controls, or overlays, that are  tailored for specific types of missions/business functions,  technologies, or environments of operation. Finally, the  catalog of security controls addresses security from both a  functionality perspective (the strength of security functions  and mechanisms provided) and an assurance perspective  (the measures of confidence in the implemented security  capability). Addressing both security functionality and  assurance helps to ensure that information technology  component products and the information systems built from  those products using sound system and security engineering  principles are sufficiently trustworthy.

The CSD developed a conformance testing  methodology framework for ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2011 Update:  2013, Data Format for the Interchange of Fingerprint,  Facial & Other Biometric Information (AN-2013). This  testing methodology framework defines the test assertions  implemented within CSD’s conformance test tool, which is  designed to test implementations of AN-2013 transactions  and promotes biometrics conformity assessment efforts.  This initial document includes comprehensive tables of AN- 2013 requirements and test assertions for transaction-wide  requirements and Record Type 1 (which is required for all  transactions). The tables of requirements and assertions  indicate which assertions apply to the traditional encoding  format, the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM)- compliant encoding format, or both encoding formats. The  testing methodology framework defines and makes use of  a specific test assertion syntax, which clearly defines the  assertions associated with each requirement.  DRAFT SP 1800-3, Attribute Based Access Control  Enterprises rely upon strong access control mechanisms to  ensure that corporate resources (e.g., applications, networks,  systems and data) are not exposed to anyone other than  an authorized user. As business requirements change,  enterprises need highly flexible access control mechanisms  that can adapt. The application of attribute-based policy  definitions enables enterprises to accommodate a diverse  set of business cases. This NCCoE practice guide details a  collaborative effort between the NCCoE and technology  providers to demonstrate a standards-based approach to  attribute-based access control (ABAC).  This guide discusses potential security risks facing  organizations, benefits that may result from the  implementation of an ABAC system and the approach that  the NCCoE took in developing a reference architecture and  build. Included is a discussion of major architecture design  considerations, an explanation of security characteristics  achieved by the reference design and a mapping of security  characteristics to applicable standards and security control  families.  For parties interested in adopting all or part of the NCCoE  reference architecture, this guide includes a detailed  description of the installation, configuration and integration  of all components.  DRAFT SP 1800-2, Identity and Access Management for  Electric Utilities  To protect power generation, transmission, and distribution,  energy companies need to control physical and logical  access to their resources, including buildings, equipment,  information technology, and industrial control systems.  They must authenticate authorized individuals to the  devices and facilities to which they are giving access rights  with a high degree of certainty. In addition, they need to  enforce access control policies (e.g., allow, deny or inquire  further) consistently, uniformly, and quickly across all of  their resources. This project resulted from a direct dialogue  among NCCoE staff and members of the electricity  subsector, mainly from electric power companies and those  who provide equipment and/or services to them.  The goal of this project is to demonstrate a centralized,  standards-based technical approach that unifies identity and  access management (IdAM) functions across operational  technology (OT) networks, physical access control systems  (PACS), and information technology systems. These  networks often operate independently, which can result in  identity and access information disparity, increased costs,  inefficiencies, and loss of capacity and service delivery  capability. This guide describes the collaborative efforts with  technology providers and electric company stakeholders to  address the security challenges that energy providers face  in the core function of IdAM. It offers a technical approach  to meeting the challenge, and also incorporates a business  value mind-set by identifying the strategic considerations  involved in implementing new technologies.  This Cybersecurity Practice Guide provides a modular,  open, end-to-end example solution that can be tailored  and implemented by energy providers of varying sizes and  sophistication. It shows energy providers how NIST met the  challenge using open source and commercially available  tools and technologies that are consistent with cybersecurity  standards. The use case scenario is based on a normal day- to-day business operational scenario that provides the  underlying impetus for the functionality presented in the  guide. While the reference solution was demonstrated with  a certain suite of products, the guide does not endorse these  products in particular. Instead, it presents the characteristics  and capabilities that an organization’s security experts can  use to identify similar standards-based products that can  be integrated quickly and cost-effectively with an energy  provider’s existing tools and infrastructure.  DRAFT SP 1800-1, Securing Electronic Health Records on  Mobile Devices  Health care providers increasingly use mobile devices  to receive, store, process, and transmit patient clinical  information. According to NIST’s risk analysis, discussed  here, and in the experience of many health care providers,  mobile devices can present vulnerabilities in a health care  organization’s networks. At the 2012 Health and Human  Services Mobile Devices Roundtable, participants stressed  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

This Cybersecurity Practice Guide provides a modular,  open, end-to-end reference design that can be tailored and  implemented by health care organizations of varying sizes  and information technology sophistication. Specifically, the  guide shows how health care providers, using open source  and commercially available tools and technologies that are  consistent with cybersecurity standards, can more securely  share patient information among caregivers using mobile  devices. The scenario considered is that of a hypothetical  primary care physician using her mobile device to perform  reoccurring activities, such as sending a referral (e.g.,  clinical information) to another physician, or sending an  electronic prescription to a pharmacy. While the design was  demonstrated with a certain suite of products, the guide does  not endorse these products in particular. Instead, it presents  the characteristics and capabilities that an organization’s  security experts can use to identify similar standards-based  products that can be integrated quickly and cost-effectively  with a health care provider’s existing tools and infrastructure.

DRAFT NISTIR 8062, Privacy Risk Management for  Federal Information Systems  This document describes a privacy risk management  framework for federal information systems. The framework  provides the basis for the establishment of a common  vocabulary to facilitate a better understanding of and  communication about privacy risks and the effective  implementation of privacy principles in federal information  systems. This publication focuses on the development of  two key pillars to support the application of the framework:  privacy engineering objectives and a privacy risk model.  DRAFT NISTIR 8060 (Three drafts), Guidelines for the  Creation of Interoperable Software Identification (SWID)  Tags  This guidance provides an overview of the capabilities  and usage of Software Identification (SWID) tags as part  of a comprehensive software life cycle. As instantiated in  the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/ International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 19770- 2 standard, SWID tags support numerous applications  for software asset management and information security  management. This report introduces SWID tags in an  operational context, provides guidelines for the creation of  interoperable SWID tags, and highlights key usage scenarios  for which SWID tags are applicable.  DRAFT NISTIR 8058, Security Content Automation  Protocol (SCAP) Version 1.2 Content Style Guide: Best  Practices for Creating and Maintaining SCAP 1.2 Content  The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is  a suite of specifications that standardize the format  and nomenclature by which software flaw and security  configuration information is communicated, both to  machines and humans. SCAP version 1.2 requirements are  defined in SP 800-126 Revision 2. Over time, certain stylistic  conventions regarding the authoring of SCAP 1.2 content  have become best practices. While these best practices are  not required, they improve the quality of the SCAP content in  several ways, such as improving the accuracy and consistency  of results, avoiding performance problems, reducing user  effort, lowering content maintenance burdens, and enabling  content reuse. This document has been created to capture  the best practices and encourage their use by SCAP content  authors and maintainers.  DRAFT NISTIR 8055, Derived Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) Credentials (DPC) Proof of Concept  Research  This report documents a proof-of-concept implementation  for Derived PIV Credentials (DPCs).

NISTIR 8054, NSTIC Pilots: Catalyzing the Identity  Ecosystem  Pilots are an integral part of the National Strategy for Trusted  Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), passed by the White  House in 2011 to encourage enhanced security, privacy,  interoperability, and ease-of-use for online transactions. This  document details summaries and outcomes of NSTIC pilots;  in addition, it explores common themes in the pilots’ work,  developing and operating innovative identity solutions.  DRAFT NISTIR 8053, De-Identification of Personally  Identifiable Information  De-identification removes identifying information from a  dataset so that individual data cannot be linked with specific  individuals. De-identification can reduce the privacy risk  associated with collecting, processing, archiving, distributing  or publishing information. De-identification thus attempts  to balance the contradictory goals of using and sharing  personal information, while protecting privacy. Several U.S.  laws, regulations and policies specify that data should be  de-identified prior to sharing. In recent years, researchers  have shown that some de-identified data can sometimes be  re-identified. Many different kinds of information can be de- identified, including structured information, free format text,  multimedia, and medical imagery. This document summarizes  roughly two decades of de-identification research, discusses  current practices, and presents opportunities for future  research.  DRAFT NISTIR 8050, Executive Technical Workshop  on Improving Cybersecurity and Consumer Privacy:  Summary and Next Steps  Cybersecurity incidents have grown swiftly from conceivable  to realized risks that regularly threaten the national and  economic security of the United States. These risks threaten  the financial security of companies and the public, weaken  consumer confidence, erode individual privacy protections,  and damage the brand value and reputation of businesses.  On February 12, 2015, NIST and Stanford University hosted  an executive technical workshop, which was held in  coordination with the White House Summit on Cybersecurity  and Consumer Protection, to discuss how to increase the  use of advanced cybersecurity and privacy technologies in  consumer-facing organizations. This document details the  discussion and ideas presented at the workshop and serves  as a platform to receive broader feedback on the relevance  of projects and suggestions discussed at that event.  NISTIR 8041, Proceedings of the Cybersecurity for Direct  Digital Manufacturing (DDM) Symposium  Direct Digital Manufacturing (DDM) involves fabricating  physical objects from a data file using computer-controlled  processes with little to no human intervention. It includes  Additive Manufacturing (AM), 3D printing, rapid prototyping,  etc. The technology is advancing rapidly and has the  potential to significantly change traditional manufacturing  and supply chain industries, including information and  communication technologies (ICT). On February 3, 2015, CSD  hosted a one-day symposium to explore the cybersecurity  needed for DDM, to include ensuring the protection of  intellectual property and the integrity of printers, elements  being printed, and design data. Speakers and attendees  from industry, academia, and government discussed the  state of the industry, cybersecurity risks and solutions, and  implications for ICT supply chain risk management (SCRM).  NISTIR 8023, Risk Management for Replication Devices  This publication provides guidance on protecting the  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information  processed, stored, or transmitted on replication devices  (RDs).

A short background  on identity management is provided alongside a review of  applicable federal and industry guidance. Considerations  are provided for identity proofing, selecting tokens, and the  authentication process. While specific identity management  technologies are analyzed, the document does not preclude  other identity management technologies from being used in  public safety communications networks.  DRAFT NISTIR 7966 (Second Draft), Security of  Interactive and Automated Access Management Using  Secure Shell (SSH)  Users and hosts must be able to access other hosts in an  interactive or automated fashion, often with very high  privileges, for a variety of reasons, including file transfers,  disaster recovery, privileged access management, software  and patch management, and dynamic cloud provisioning.  This is often accomplished using the Secure Shell (SSH)  protocol. The SSH protocol supports several mechanisms  for interactive and automated authentication. Management  of this access requires proper provisioning, termination,  and monitoring processes. However, the security of SSH  key-based access has been largely ignored to date. This  publication assists organizations in understanding the basics  of SSH interactive and automated access management in an  enterprise, focusing on the management of SSH user keys.  DRAFT NISTIR 7904 (Second Draft), Trusted Geolocation  in the Cloud: Proof of Concept Implementation  This publication explains selected security challenges  involving Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing  technologies and geolocation. It then describes a proof-of- concept implementation that was designed to address those  challenges. The publication provides sufficient details about  the proof-of-concept implementation so that organizations  can reproduce it if desired.

NISTIR 7823, Advanced Metering Infrastructure Smart  Meter Upgradeability Test Framework  As electric utilities turn to Advanced Metering Infrastructures  (AMIs) to promote the development and deployment of the  Smart Grid, one aspect that can benefit from standardization  is the upgradeability of Smart Meters. The National Electrical  Manufacturers Association (NEMA) standard SG-AMI 1-2009,  “Requirements for Smart Meter Upgradeability,” describes  functional and security requirements for the secure upgrade  − both local and remote − of Smart Meters. This report  describes conformance test requirements that may be used  voluntarily by testers and/or test laboratories to determine  whether Smart Meters and Upgrade Management Systems  conform to the requirements of NEMA SG-AMI 1-2009.  For each relevant requirement in NEMA SG-AMI 1-2009,  the document identifies the information to be provided  by the vendor to facilitate testing, and the high-level test  procedures to be conducted by the tester/laboratory to  determine conformance.

Dunkelman, P.-A. Fouque, J.  Hoch, J. Kelsey, A. Shamir, and S. Zimmer, “New Second- Preimage Attacks on Hash Functions,” Journal of Cryptology,  40 pp. (June 23, 2015). doi: 10.1007/s00145-015-9206-4.  In this work, we present several new generic second- preimage attacks on hash functions. Our first attack  is based on the herding attack and applies to various  Merkle–Damgård-based iterative hash functions.  Compared to the previously known long-message  second-preimage attacks, our attack offers more  flexibility in choosing the second-preimage message  at the cost of a small computational overhead. More  concretely, our attack allows the adversary to replace  only a few blocks in the original target message to  obtain the second preimage. As a result, our new attack  is applicable to constructions previously believed to  be immune to such second-preimage attacks. Among  others, these include the dithered hash proposal of  Rivest, Shoup’s UOWHF, and the ROX constructions. In  addition, we also suggest several time-memory-data  tradeoff attack variants, allowing for a faster online  phase, and even finding second preimages for shorter  messages. We further extend our attack to sequences  stronger than the ones suggested in Rivest’s proposal.  To this end, we introduce the kite generator as a  new tool to attack any dithering sequence over a  small alphabet. Additionally, we analyze the second- preimage security of the basic tree hash construction.  We also propose several second-preimage attacks  and their time-memory-data tradeoff variants. Finally,  we show how both our new and the previous second- preimage attacks can be applied even more efficiently  when multiple short messages, rather than a single  long target message, are available.

Popular network scan detection algorithms operate  through evaluating external sources for unusual  connection patterns and traffic rates. Research has  revealed evasive tactics that enable full circumvention  of existing approaches (specifically the widely cited  Threshold Random Walk algorithm). To prevent the  use of these circumvention techniques, we propose  a novel approach to network scan detection that  evaluates the behavior of internal network nodes,  and combine it with other established techniques of  scan detection. By itself, our algorithm is an efficient,  protocol-agnostic, completely unsupervised method  that requires no a priori knowledge of the network  being defended beyond which hosts are internal  and which hosts are external to the network, and is  capable of detecting network scanning attempts,  regardless of the rate of the scan (working even  with connectionless protocols). We demonstrate the  effectiveness of our method on both live data from  an enterprise-scale network and on simulated scan  data, finding a false positive rate of just 0.000034 %  with respect to the number of inbound flows. When  combined with both Threshold Random Walk and  simple rate-limiting detection, we achieve an overall  detection rate of 94.44 %.  D. R. Kuhn, R. Kacker and Y.

Despite the undisputed advantages of cloud  computing, customers − in particular, small and  medium enterprises − still need a meaningful  understanding of the security and risk-management  changes that the cloud entails so that they can assess  whether this new computing paradigm meets their  security requirements. This article presents a fresh  view on this problem by surveying and analyzing, from  the standardization and risk assessment perspective,  the specification of security in cloud service-level  agreements as a promising approach to empower  customers in assessing and understanding cloud  security. Apart from analyzing the proposed risk- based approach and surveying the relevant landscape,  this article presents a real-world scenario to support  the creation and adoption of service-level agreements  as enablers for negotiating, assessing, and monitoring  the achieved security levels in cloud services.  P. M. Mell, R. Harang and A. Gueye, “Measuring Limits on  the Ability of Colluding Countries to Partition the Internet,”  International Journal of Computer Science: Theory and  Application 3(3), 60-73 (2015).  We show that the strength of the Internet-based  network interconnectivity of countries is increasing  over time. We then evaluate bounds on the extent  to which a group of colluding countries can disrupt  this connectivity. We evaluate the degree to which  a group of countries can disconnect two other  countries, isolate a set of countries from the Internet,  or even break the Internet up into non-communicative  clusters. To do this, we create an interconnectivity map  of the worldwide Internet routing infrastructure at a  country-level of abstraction. We then examine how  groups of countries may use their pieces of routing  infrastructure to filter out the traffic of other countries  (or to block entire routes). Overall, bounds analysis  indicates that the ability of countries to perform  such disruptions to connectivity has diminished  significantly between 2008 and 2013. However, we  show that the majority of the gains in robustness go  to countries that had already displayed significant  robustness to the types of attacks that we consider.  The countries that displayed higher initial vulnerability  to such attacks did not become significantly more  robust over the time period of analysis.  D. Moody, R. Peralta, R. Perlner, A.

This report summarizes study results on pairing-based  cryptography. The main purpose of the study is to form  NIST’s position on standardizing and recommending  the pairing-based cryptographic schemes currently  published in research literature and standardized  in other standards development organizations. The  report reviews the mathematical background of  pairings.  This includes topics such as pairing-friendly  elliptic curves and how to compute various pairings.  The report includes a brief introduction on existing  identity-based encryption (IBE) schemes and other  cryptographic schemes using pairing technology. The  report provides a complete study of the current status  of standards activities on pairing-based cryptographic  schemes and explores different application scenarios  for pairing-based cryptographic schemes. As an  important aspect of adopting pairing-based schemes,  the report also considers the challenges inherent in  CAVP and CMVP testing for FIPS 140 validation. Based  on the study, the report suggests an approach for  including pairing-based cryptographic schemes in the  NIST cryptographic toolkit.  The report also outlines  several questions that will require further study if this  approach is followed.  D. Moody and D.

Isogenies are the morphisms between elliptic curves  and are, accordingly, a topic of interest in the subject.  As such, they have been well studied, and have been  used in several cryptographic applications. Vélu’s  formulas show how to explicitly evaluate an isogeny,  given a specification of the kernel as a list of points.  However, Vélu’s formulas only work for elliptic curves  specified by a Weierstrass equation. This paper  presents formulas similar to Vélu’s that can be used  to evaluate isogenies on Edwards curves and Huff  curves, which are normal forms of elliptic curves that  provide an alternative to the traditional Weierstrass  form.

Indifferentiability security of a hash mode of operation  guarantees the mode’s resistance against all generic  attacks. It is also useful to establish the security  of protocols that use hash functions as random  functions. The JH hash function was one of the five  finalists in NIST’s SHA-3 hash function competition.  Despite several years of analysis, the indifferentiability  security of the JH mode has remained remarkably  low, only at n/3 bits, while the two finalist modes  Keccak and Grøstl offer a security guarantee of n/2  bits. Note that all these three modes operate with an  n-bit digest and 2n-bit permutations. In this paper, we  improve the indifferentiability security bound for the  JH mode to n/2 bits (e.g., from approximately 171 to  256 bits when n = 512). To put this into perspective,  our result guarantees the absence of (non-trivial)  attacks on both the JH-256 and JH-512 hash functions  with time less than approximately 2256 computations  of the underlying 1024-bit permutation, under the  assumption that the underlying permutations can  be modeled as an ideal permutation. Our bounds are  optimal for JH-256, and the best-known bound for JH- 512. We obtain this improved bound by establishing  an isomorphism of certain query-response graphs  through a careful design of the simulators and bad  events. Our experimental data strongly supports the  theoretically obtained results.  A.T. Vassilev and C.

We study the relationship between two measures  of Boolean functions; “algebraic thickness” and  “normality”. For a function f, the algebraic thickness  is a variant of the “sparsity”, the number of nonzero  coefficients in the unique F2 polynomial representing  f, and the normality is the largest dimension of an  affine subspace on which f  is constant. We show that  for 0 <ε< 2, any function with algebraic thickness  n 3-ε is constant on some affine subspace of dimension  Ω(n  ε/2). Furthermore, we give an algorithm for finding  such a subspace. This is at most a factor of Θ(√n) from the best guaranteed, and when restricted to the  technique used, is at most a factor of Θ(√logn)  from  the best guaranteed. We also show that a concrete  function, majority, has algebraic thickness  Ω(2n1/6  ).  R.

Cloud Data centers are predominantly made up of  Virtualized hosts. The networking infrastructure in a  cloud (virtualized) data center, therefore, consists of  the combination of a physical IP network (data center  fabric) and the virtual network residing in virtualized  hosts. Network Segmentation (Isolation), Traffic flow  control using firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems  / Intrusion Protection Systems (IDS/IPS) IDS/IPS form  the primary network-based security techniques, with  the first one as the foundation for the other two. In this  paper, we describe and analyze three generations of  network segmentation techniques—Virtual Switches  and Physical NIC-based, VLAN-based and Overlay- based. We take a detailed look at the overlay-based  virtual network segmentation and its characteristics,  such as scalability and ease of configuration.  R.

Because of its key role in providing  connectivity among VMs and the applications hosted  on them, Virtual Networks have to be securely  configured to provide the foundation for the overall  security of the virtualized infrastructure in any  deployment scenario. The objective of this paper is  to illustrate a deployment-driven methodology for  deriving a security configuration for Virtual Networks.  The methodology outlines two typical deployment  scenarios, identifies use cases and their associated  security requirements, discusses the security solutions  to meet those requirements and the virtual network  security configuration to implement each security  solution, and then analyzes the pros and cons of each  security solution.

This short paper introduces a method for verifying  equivalence classes for module/unit testing. This is  achieved using a two-layer covering array in which  some or all values of a primary covering array represent  equivalence classes. A second-layer covering array  of the equivalence class values is computed, and its  values substituted for the equivalence class names  in the primary array. It is shown that this method can  detect certain classes of errors without a conventional  test oracle, and an illustrative example is given.  P. M. Mell and R.

Devices in mobile tactical edge networks are often  resource constrained, due to their lightweight and  mobile nature, and often have limited access to  bandwidth. In order to maintain situational awareness  in the cyber domain, security logs from these devices  must be transmitted to command and control sites.  We present a lightweight packing step that takes  advantage of the restricted semantics and regular  format of certain kinds of log files to render them  substantially more amenable to compression with  standard algorithms (especially Lempel-Ziv variants).  We demonstrate that we can reduce compressed  file sizes to as little as 21 % of that of the maximally  compressed file without packing. We can also reduce  overall compression times up to 64 % in our data sets.  Our packing step permits a lossless transmission of  larger log files across the same network transmission  medium, as well as permitting existing sets of logs  to be transmitted within smaller network availability  windows.

At  PQCRYPTO ‘13 in Limoges, Tao, Diene, Tang, and Ding  introduced a promising new multivariate encryption  algorithm based on a fundamentally new idea: hiding  the structure of a large matrix algebra over a finite  field. We present an attack based on the subspace  differential invariants inherent to this methodology.  The attack is a structural key recovery attack that  is asymptotically optimal among all known attacks  (including algebraic attacks) on the original scheme  and its generalizations.  A.

Garfinkel, “Measuring Systematic and  Random Error in Digital Forensics” [abstract], International  Symposium on Forensic Science Error Management:  Detection, Measurement and Mitigation, Arlington, Virginia,  United States, July 21-24, 2015, 1 p.  Recognized sources of error in digital forensics include  systematic errors arising from implementation errors,  and random errors resulting from faulty equipment.  But as digital forensic techniques expand to include  statistical machine learning, another source of error  will be statistical errors that arise because of chance  disagreements between a statistical model and subject  systems examined with that model. We consider two  digital forensics systems with these different types of  measurable error.  First, we show a mechanism for comparing the  numerous and nuanced results of parsing a file system.  Multiple storage system parsers were designed for or  adapted to analyze a game console with a custom file  system. However, it was initially unknown whether  any of the parsers would produce a perspective of  the storage system that was correct in reporting the  files present and their characteristics. We adapted  the parsers to produce an in-common, machine- differentiable format, and used a storage differencing  algorithm to measure the relative incorrectness of  each of the parsers. Discrepancies summarize errors  in implementation or specification, an important  report when any reverse-engineering is necessary.  We discuss advantages and challenges in adopting  this practice.  Second, we show how to construct a classifier using  the hard drive from a multi-user computer that can  determine the user responsible for creating a file.  The classifier is constructed using allocated files and  its accuracy determined with take-one-out cross- validation. Once created, the classifier can be used to  predict the creator of files that can only be recovered  with carving.  R. Perlner, “Optimizing Information Set Decoding Algorithms  to Attack Cyclosymmetric MDPC Codes,” 6th International  Workshop on Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQCrypto  2014), Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, October 1-3, 2014. In  Lecture Notes in Computer Science 8772, Post-Quantum  Cryptography, M. Mosca, ed., Berlin: Springer International,  2014, pp. 220-228. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-11659-4_13.  Recently, several promising approaches have been  proposed to reduce key sizes for code-based  cryptography using structured, but non-algebraic  codes, such as quasi-cyclic (QC) Moderate Density  Parity Check (MDPC) codes. Biasi et al. propose further  reducing the key sizes of code-based schemes using  cyclosymmetric (CS) codes. While Biasi et al. analyze  the complexity of attacking their scheme using  standard information-set-decoding algorithms, the  research presented here shows that information set  decoding algorithms can be improved, by choosing  the columns of the information set in a way that takes  advantage of the added symmetry. The result is an  attack that significantly reduces the security of the  proposed CS-MDPC schemes to the point that they  no longer offer an advantage in key size over QC- MDPC schemes of the same security level. QC-MDPC  schemes are not affected by this paper’s result.  M. Sönmez Turan and J. Kelsey, “How Random is Your RNG?”  Shmoocon 2015, Washington, DC, United States, January 16- 18, 2015, 4 pp.  Cryptographic primitives need random numbers to  protect your data. Random numbers are used for  generating secret keys, nonces, random paddings,  initialization vectors, salts, etc. Deterministic  pseudorandom number generators are useful, but  they still need truly random seeds generated by  entropy sources in order to produce random numbers.  Researchers have shown examples of deployed  systems that did not have enough randomness in their  entropy sources, and as a result, cryptographic keys  were compromised. So how do you know how much  entropy is in your entropy source? Estimating entropy  is a difficult (if not impossible) problem, and we’ve  been working to create usable guidance that will give  conservative estimates on the amount of entropy in an  entropy source. From our research, we shared some  of the challenges and proposed methods. In addition,  we discussed some of the new directions that we are  investigating, and present results of our estimation  methods on simulated entropy sources.

Podio, “Common Biometric Exchange  Formats Framework Standardization,” in Encyclopedia of  Biometrics, 2nd ed. Edited by S. Z. Li and A. Jain. New York:  Springer Reference, 2015.  The Common Biometric Exchange Formats  Framework (CBEFF) provides a standardized set  of definitions and procedures that support the  interchange of biometric data in standard data  structures called CBEFF biometric information  records (BIRs). CBEFF permits considerable flexibility  regarding BIR structures and biometric data content,  but does so in a way that makes it easy for biometric  applications to evaluate their interest in processing a  particular BIR. At their conceptually simplest, standard  CBEFF data structures promote the interoperability  of biometric-based application programs and  systems by specifying a standardized wrapper for  describing, at a high level, the format and certain  attributes of the content of a BIR. The initial versions  of CBEFF were developed by NIST and the Biometric  Consortium. The CBEFF specification published by  NIST in April 2004 (NISTIR 6529-A) was proposed as  the basis for the development of formal national and  international CBEFF standards. Since then, American  National Standards and International Standards (ISO/ IEC) have been published. Development continues  at the international level on a new generation of  CBEFF standards. The paper describes the main  characteristics of CBEFF, emphasizing the value  of CBEFF data structures in open and complex  biometric systems, especially in cases where the  system must cope with a wide variety of biometric  data records, some of which may even be encrypted.  It provides adoption examples of CBEFF data  structures by national and international organizations  and programs, and discusses early work on CBEFF  standardization. Recent and current standardization  efforts are addressed.  D. J. Yaga, J. Campbell and G. Zekster, “Conformance Testing  Methodologies for Biometric Data Interchange Formats,  Standardization of,” in Encyclopedia of Biometrics, 2nd ed.  Edited by S. Z. Li and A. Jain. New York: SpringerReference,  2015.  Conformance testing is the method that is used to  determine if a product, process or system (known  as an implementation under test) satisfies the  requirements specified in the base standard. The goal  of conformance testing is to capture enough of the  requirements of the base standard and test them  under enough conditions that any implementation  under test that passes the conformance test is likely  to be conformant. Conformance testing provides  developers, users, and purchasers with increased levels  of confidence in product quality and increases the  probability of successful interoperability. Conformance  testing methodology standards for data interchange  formats identify a language to define the context of  conformance testing and conformance claims. These  standards include the set of requirements specified in  the base standards and one or more conformance test  assertions per requirement. There are several efforts in  biometric conformance test standardization, including  U.S. national organizations, such as International  Committee for Information Technology Standards  Technical Committee M1-Biometrics and NIST, who is  responsible for the development of the ANSI/NIST- ITL standards; and international organizations, such  as the International Organization for Standardization  (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission  (IEC) Joint Technical Commission 1, Subcommittee  37 - Biometrics. The paper includes a description  of the different national and international efforts  that have taken place in the last few years in the  development of conformance testing methodologies  for biometric data interchange formats developed by  the organizations mentioned above. The content of  these standards (for both published standards and  ongoing projects) are addressed.  White Papers M. Dworkin and R.

CSD’s standards, guidelines, tools and references are developed  in an open, transparent, traceable and collaborative manner that enlists broad expertise from around the world. While developed  for federal agency use, these resources are voluntarily adopted by other organizations because they are effective and accepted  globally.  The need for cybersecurity standards, best practices, tools and references that also address interoperability, usability  and privacy continue to be critical for the Nation. CSD aligns its resources to enable greater development and application of  practical, innovative security technologies and methodologies that enhance our ability to address current and future computer  and information security challenges. Our foundational research and applied cybersecurity programs continue to advance in  many areas, including cryptography, automation, roots of trust, identity and access management, advanced security testing and  measurement, Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems, and public safety networks.  Trust is crucial to the broad adoption of our standards and guidelines, including our cryptographic standards and guidelines.  To ensure that our cryptography resources have been developed according the highest standard of inclusiveness, transparency  and security, NIST conducted an internal and external formal review of our cryptographic standards development efforts in  2014. We documented and solicited public comment on the principles and rigorous processes we use to engage stakeholders  and experts in industry, academia, and government to develop and revise these standards. The final report is now published and  serves as a basis for all CSD’s cryptographic development efforts.  Increasing the trustworthiness and resilience of the IT infrastructure is a significant undertaking that requires a substantial  investment in the architectural design and development of our systems and networks. A disciplined and structured set of  systems security engineering processes that starts with and builds on well-established international standards provides an  important starting point. Draft Special Publication 800-160, Systems Security Engineering: An Integrated Approach to Building  Trustworthy Resilient Systems, which was issued in May 2014, helps organizations to develop a more defensible and survivable  information technology infrastructure. This resource, coupled with other NIST standards and guidelines, contributes to systems  that are more resilient in the face of cyber attacks and other threats.  Strong partnerships with diverse stakeholders are vital to the success of our technical programs. In February 2014, NIST  issued the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity as directed in Executive Order 13636. The Framework,  created through collaboration between industry and government, consists of standards, guidelines, and practices to promote  the protection of the critical infrastructure. Its approach helps owners and operators of the critical infrastructure to manage  cybersecurity-related risk.  Active engagement with diverse stakeholders continues to be critical to our success. In the federal space, this interaction  is most prominent in our strengthened collaborations with the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and  the Committee on National Security Systems to establish a common foundation for information security across the Federal  Government. Our cybersecurity awareness, training, and education programs also exemplify the importance of engagements  with academic institutions, federal agencies, small and medium businesses and others to increase awareness and enhance the  overall cybersecurity posture of the Nation.  CSD’s work with Health and Human Services, Department of Transportation, Federal  Communications Commission and others are all examples of an active and strong engagement, applying security to multiple  government mission areas.  For many years, CSD, in collaboration with our global partners across industry, academia, standards bodies, and  government, has made great contributions to help secure the nation’s critical information and infrastructure. We look forward to  strengthening these relationships as we lead the development and practical application of scalable and sustainable information  security standards and practices.

OVERVIEW: The Cryptographic Technology Group’s (CTG) work in  the field of cryptography includes researching, analyzing  and standardizing cryptographic technology, such as hash  algorithms, symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic  techniques, key management, authentication, and random  number generation. The CTG’s goal is to identify and  promote methods to protect communications and storage  through cryptographic technologies, encouraging inno-  vative development and helping technology users to  manage risk.  In FY 2015, the CTG continued to collaborate with  national and international government agencies, academic  and research organizations, industry partners, and stan-  dards bodies to develop interoperable security standards  and guidelines, and to make an impact in the field of  cryptography. One example is the culmination of an eight- year standardization effort that led to the publication of  Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 202, SHA- 3 Standard: Permutation-Based Hash and Extendable-  Output Functions, announced in the Federal Register on  August 5, 2015.  The CTG’s cryptographic standards program focuses  on cryptographic primitives, algorithms, and schemes; the  developed standards and guidelines are specified in FIPSs,  NIST Special Publications (SPs), and NIST Interagency or  Internal Reports (NISTIRs). Such standards and guidelines  have been considered or adopted by the information  technology (IT) industry and standards development  organizations, such as the International Organization for  Standardization (ISO), the Internet Engineering Task Force  (IETF), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  (IEEE), and the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), and have  been implemented on a variety of platforms.  The CTG is committed to the development of its  standards using an open and transparent process -  conducting workshops and requesting input and comments  from government agencies, private industry, academia and  the global cryptographic community. The CTG also examines  each of its standards to determine if they need to be revised,  withdrawn or re-opened for public comment.  The CTG continues to develop expertise in several  critical research areas, such as post-quantum cryptography  (PQC), elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), privacy-enhancing  cryptography, and lightweight cryptographic schemes for  constrained environments. It has collaborated with many  universities internationally and presented research results  in major cryptography conferences and journals. In addition,  it organized workshops on PQC, ECC standards, and  lightweight cryptography to discuss research results and  develop standardization roadmaps.  The CTG also published several guidelines on crypto- graphic applications, including key management, public  key certificate policies, and trusted platforms. The CTG also  participated in the cybersecurity projects of other CSD  groups, such as the Personal Identity Verification (PIV)  standards, the Federal Cloud Credential Exchange (FCCX),  the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP),  and the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).

OVERVIEW: The SCMG’s security research focuses on the develop-  ment and management of foundational building-block  security mechanisms and techniques that can be integrated  into a wide variety of mission-critical U.S. information  systems. The group’s work spans the spectrum from near- term hardening and improvement of systems, to the design  and analysis of next-generation, leap-ahead security  capabilities. Computer security depends fundamentally on  the level of trust of computer software and systems. This  work, therefore, focuses strongly on assurance-building  activities ranging from the analysis of software configuration  settings, to advanced trust architectures, and to testing tools  that identify flaws in software modules. This work also focuses  significantly on increasing the applicability and effectiveness  of automated techniques, wherever feasible. The SCMG  conducts collaborative research with government, industry,  and academia. Outputs of this research consist of prototype  systems, software tools, demonstrations, guidelines, and  other documentary resources.

OVERVIEW: SSAG’s security research focuses on identifying emerg-  ing and high-priority technologies, and on developing  security solutions that will have a high impact on U.S.  critical infrastructure. The group conducted research and  development related to both public and private sector use  cases. The research considered many aspects of the system’s  lifecycle from the earliest stages of technology develop- ment through proof-of-concept, reference and prototype  imple-mentations, and demonstrations. In addition, the  group worked to transfer new technologies to industry; to  produce new standards and guidance for federal agencies  and industry; and to develop tests, test methodologies,  and assurance methods.  SSAG investigated security concerns associated  with such areas as mobile devices, cloud computing and  virtualization, identity management, access control and  authorization management, and software assurance.  SSAG’s research helps to meet federal information security  requirements that may not be fully addressed by existing  technology. The group collaborated extensively with  government, academia, and private sector entities.  Example successes from this work include:  • Tools for access control policy testing;  •  New concepts in access control and policy enforce- ment;  •  Several Personal Identity Verification (PIV) documents  to support interagency use of the PIV Card;  •  Methods for architecting a secure cloud ecosystem in a  capability-oriented approach;  •  Guidance and tools for orchestrating a secure cloud  ecosystem;  •  Guidance for secure deployment of virtualized infra- structure components – Hypervisor, Virtual Machines  (VMs) and Virtual Network;  •  Methods for achieving comprehensive policy enforce- ment and data interoperability across enterprise data  services; and  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

In particular, the SSAG led the NIST Security and  Forensics Working Group that published draft NISTIR 8006,  NIST Cloud Computing - Security Reference Architecture,  that aggregates forensics challenges in a cloud ecosystem.  The working group has been working on developing a draft  of SP 800-173, Guidance for Applying the Risk Management  Framework to Federal-based Information Systems (target  release date: spring/summer 2016).  In response to the rapid-  ly emerging use of virtualization in enterprise data  centers for supporting both in-house mission-critical  applications and for providing cloud services, two guidance  documents were published: Draft SP 800-125A, Security  Recommendations for Hypervisor Deployment, and Draft  SP 800-125B, Secure Virtual Network Configuration for  Virtual Machine (VM) Protection. In support of the revised  FIPS 201, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal  Employees and Contractors, two new PIV-related SP  800-series were released and five SP 800 documents  were revised. One of the new publications, SP 800-157,  Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity Verification (PIV)  Credentials, guides the implementation and deployment  of PIV credentials for mobile devices. In addition, the PIV  team participated in the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) cybersecurity Sprint effort with a goal to strengthen  the cybersecurity of federal networks, systems, and data  through multi-factor authentication using the PIV Card. To  improve access to new technologies, the group also chaired,  edited, and participated in the development of a wide variety  of national and international security standards.

OVERVIEW: The U.S. economy, citizens, and government rely on  information technology (IT), so the protection of IT and the  information infrastructure is critical. SOIG leverages broad  cybersecurity and risk management expertise to develop,  integrate, and promote security standards, guidelines, tools,  technologies, methodologies, tests, and measurements to  address cybersecurity needs in many areas of national and  international importance.  The SOIG collaborates with stakeholders to address  cybersecurity considerations in many diverse program areas,  including the Information and Communications Technologies  (ICT) supply chain, Smart Grid, Electronic Voting, Cyber  Physical and Industrial Control Systems, Health Information  Technology, and the National Public Safety Broadband  Network. The group produces standards and guidelines  through the Federal Information Security Management Act  (FISMA) implementation program to help federal agencies  build strong cybersecurity risk management programs. In  each of these program areas, the group extends outreach  to stakeholders across federal, state, and local governments;  industry; academia; small businesses; and the public. The  SOIG also leads several broad cybersecurity awareness,  training, education, and outreach efforts, including the  National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE),  the Federal Computer Security Managers’ Forum, and the  Federal Information Systems Security Educators’ Association  (FISSEA).  Key to the group’s success is the ability to interact  with a broad constituency to ensure that SOIG’s program is  consistent with national objectives related to or impacted  by information security. Through open and transparent  public engagement, collaboration, and cooperation, the  group works to address critical cybersecurity challenges,  enable greater U.S. industrial competitiveness, and facilitate  the practical implementation of scalable and sustainable  information security standards and practices.

OVERVIEW: Federal agencies, industry, and the public rely on  cryptography for the protection of the information and  communications used in electronic commerce, the critical  infrastructure, and other application areas. The STVMG  supports the testing and validation of the underlying  cryptographic modules and cryptographic algorithms  based upon established standards. These cryptographic  modules and algorithms enable products and systems to  provide security services, such as confidentiality, integrity  protection, and authentication. Although cryptography  provides security, poor designs or weak algorithms can  render a product insecure and place highly sensitive  information at risk. When protecting sensitive data, federal  agencies require assurance that cryptographic products  meet established security requirements and use only tested  and validated cryptographic modules.  STVMG’s testing-focused activities include validating  cryptographic algorithm implementations, cryptographic  modules, and Security Content Automation Protocol  (SCAP)-enabled products; developing test suites and test  methods; providing implementation guidance and technical  support to industry forums; and conducting education,  training, and outreach programs.  STVMG’s validation programs work together with  independent cryptographic and security testing laboratories  accredited by the NIST National Voluntary Laboratory  Accreditation Program (NVLAP). Based on the independent  laboratory test report and test evidence, the Validation  Program validates an implementation under test. NIST  publishes lists of awarded validations through public  websites.

Title III of the E-Government Act, entitled  the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)  of 2002, included the duties and responsibilities for the  National Institute of Standards and Technology, Information  Technology Laboratory, Computer Security Division (CSD).  In December 2014, the 113th Congress updated FISMA as the  Federal Information Security Modernization Act (Public Law  113-283). NIST CSD responsibilities were unchanged in the  update. In 2015, CSD addressed its assignments through the  following activities:  •  One final Federal Information Processing Standard  (FIPS) was issued: FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permu- tation-Based Hash and Extendable-Output Functions,  which specifies the Secure Hash Algorithm-3 (SHA-3)  family of functions on binary data. Each of the SHA- 3 functions is based on an instance of the Keccak  algorithm that NIST selected as the winner of the  SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm Competition.  (Note: FIPS 186 4, Digital Signature Standard (DSS),  which was published in 2013, was updated in 2015 to  require the implementation of either FIPS 186 or FIPS  202 wherever a secure hash algorithm is required for  Federal applications.)  •  Thirty draft and final NIST Special Publications (SP)  were issued that provide management, operational,  and technical security guidelines in areas such as trust- worthy email, media sanitization, protecting controlled  unclassified information, supply chain risk manage- ment, assessing security and privacy controls, cryp- tographic algorithms and key lengths, key manage- ment systems, cyber threat information sharing, virtual  machine protection, secure hypervisor deployment,  random number generation, personal identity verifica- tion (PIV) (interfaces, credentials,  card application and  middleware), industrial control systems, the national  checklist program, vetting the security of mobile appli- cations, a biometric conformance testing methodology  framework, attribute-based access control, access  management for electric utilities, and securing elec- tronic health records on mobile devices.  •  Eighteen draft and final NIST Interagency/Internal  Reports (NISTIR) were issued on a variety of topics,  including the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in  Cyberspace (NSTIC) pilots for catalyzing the identity  ecosystem, the proceedings of a symposium for cyber- security for direct digital manufacturing, a summary  of the executive technical workshop on improving  cybersecurity and consumer privacy and the next steps  in the process, risk management for replication devices,  considerations for identity management in public-safe- ty mobile networks, a summary of a public-safety  mobile-application security requirements workshop,  privacy risk management, cardholder authentication  for the PIV digital signature key, derived PIV creden- tials proof-of-concept research, an advanced metering  infrastructure smart meter upgradeability test frame- work, a report on strategic U.S. Government engage- ment in international standardization to achieve U.S.  objectives for cybersecurity, guidelines for the creation  of interoperable software identification (SWID) tags, a  security content automation protocol (SCAP) Version  1.2 content style guide about best practices for creating  and maintaining SCAP 1.2 content, de-identification  of personally identifiable information, the security of  interactive and automated access management using  secure shell (SSH), a proof-of-concept implementation  of trusted geolocation in the cloud, and fundamentals  of small business information security.  •  Continued the successful collaboration with the  Department of Defense (DOD), the Intelligence Com- munity (IC), and the Committee on National Security  Systems (CNSS), in partnership with the Joint Task  Force (JTF) Transformation Initiative. Five Special Pub- lications are currently recognized as JTF publications,  and the JTF partners continue to develop and update  key cybersecurity guidelines for protecting federal  information and information systems as part of the  Unified Information Security Framework through CSD’s  FISMA Implementation Project.  •  Continued to develop expertise in several critical  research areas, such as post-quantum cryptography  (PQC), elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), privacy-en- hancing cryptography, and lightweight cryptographic  schemes for constrained environments.  •  Performed research and conducted outreach on stan- dards, practices, and technologies to enable prompt  and effective threat information sharing, hardware  roots of trust for mobile devices, Internet of things,  combinatorial testing techniques, cloud computing and  virtualization, risk management, identity management,  access control and authorization management, and  software assurance.

CSD  staff and guest researchers have collaborated with global  partners from government, industry, and academia, making  significant contributions to help secure critical information  and the infrastructure. The following sections describe CSD’s  programs and project achievements, including extensive  research and development for high quality, cost-effective  security and privacy mechanisms, standards, guidelines,  tests, and metrics that address current and future computer  and information security challenges.  N I S T  R E S P O N S I B I L I T I E S  U N D E R  E X E C U T I V E  O R D E R  1 3 6 3 6 ,  “ I M P R O V I N G  C R I T I C A L  I N F R A S T R U C T U R E  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y ”  Recognizing that the national and economic security of  the United States depends on the reliable functioning of its  critical infrastructure, the President issued Executive Order  (EO) 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity,  in February 2013. This EO directed NIST to work with  stakeholders to develop a voluntary framework – based on  existing standards, guidelines, and practices − for reducing  cybersecurity risks to the critical infrastructure.  The Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) that was develop-  ed provides a prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance- based, and cost-effective approach to help critical  infrastructure owners, operators and other interested  entities identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity-related  risk, while protecting business confidentiality, individual  privacy, and civil liberties.  In FY 2015, NIST continued to work with a diverse stake- holder community to support CSF use and understanding.  This process included:  •  Hosting a workshop at the University of South Florida  in Tampa to share initial CSF experiences;  •  Updating the CSF Web site with a catalog of industry  resources, upcoming NIST speaking events, and an  extensive frequently-asked-question knowledge base;  •  Coordinating with critical infrastructure owners and  operators, regulators, and other industry organizations  through a variety of meetings and industry events to  ensure understanding and use;  •  Analyzing various industry work products, such as  mapping documents, for CSF correctness;  •  Consulting with state and local governments, and the  governments of other nations regarding their align- ment with both the principles and the cybersecurity  outcomes of the CSF;  •  Consulting with international organizations and stan- dards bodies to demonstrate and ensure continued  alignment with voluntary international standards; and  •  Working with both industry and regulatory organiza- tions to apply the CSF in ways that bring efficiencies to  the regulatory process.  Since the release of the Framework, NIST’s primary  goal has been to raise awareness of the Framework and  encourage its use as a tool to help industry sectors and  organizations manage cybersecurity risks. NIST has  strengthened its collaboration with critical infrastructure  owners and operators, industry leaders, government  partners, and other stakeholders, building on previous  years’ interactions that were crucial to the Framework’s  development.  In FY 2016, NIST will continue to conduct stakeholder  outreach and will work collaboratively to further understand  stakeholder needs regarding tools and resources to enable  more effective use of the Framework.  NIST will also publish  guidance on how NIST’s Risk Management Framework  (SP 800-37 revision 1) and the Cybersecurity Framework  complement each other. Additionally, NIST will formally  gather stakeholder input about Framework use, evolution,  and future management through a request for information  (RFI).  Following the RFI, NIST will conduct a public  workshop at NIST in Gaithersburg, Maryland on April 6  and 7, 2016. Periodic program updates will be provided  through the Framework website.

CSD participates in many  cybersecurity standards’ activities in many of these  organizations, either in leadership positions or as editors  and contributors, including the Biometric Application  Programming Interface (BioAPI) Consortium; the Bluetooth  Special Interest Group (SIG): Bluetooth Security Expert  Group (BT-SEG); the International Telecommunications  Union - Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T);  various groups within the Institute of Electrical and  Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Internet Engineering  Task Force (IETF); the North American Security Products  Organization (NASPO); the Trusted Computing Group (TCG);  and Accredited Standards Committee X9, Inc. (ASC X9, Inc.)  (e.g., X9F – Data & Information Security Subcommittee).  Many of CSD’s publications have been the basis for both  national and international standards projects.  The following paragraphs discuss, in particular, CSD  staff activities in conjunction with the InterNational  Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS)  Technical Committee Cyber Security (CS1), where CSD’s Sal  Francomacaro served as the CS1 Vice Chair.  The International  Organization for  Standardization (ISO)  The International Organization for Standardization  (ISO) is a network of the national standards institutes of  148 countries, with representation by one member per  country. The scope of ISO covers the standardization in all  fields except electrical and electronic engineering standards,  which are the responsibility of the International  Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).

(see http://www.iec.ch/about/).  Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) was formed by ISO  and IEC to be responsible for international standardization in  the field of Information Technology (see http://www.iso.org/ iso/jtc1_home.html). JTC 1 develops, maintains, promotes,  and facilitates the IT standards required by global markets,  meeting business and user requirements concerning:  •  Design and development of IT systems and tools;  •  Performance and quality of IT products and systems;  •  Security of IT systems and information;  •  Portability of application programs;  •  Interoperability of IT products and systems;  •  Unified tools and environments;  •  Harmonized IT vocabulary; and  •  User-friendly and ergonomically designed user inter- faces.  JTC 1 consists of a number of subcommittees (SCs) and  working groups that address specific technologies. SCs that  produce standards relating to IT security include:  •  SC 06 - Telecommunications and Information Exchange  Between Systems;  •  SC 17 - Cards and Personal Identification;  •  SC 27 - IT Security Techniques; and  •  SC 37 – Biometrics (Note: Fernando Podio, NIST CSD,  served as Chair).  JTC 1 also has:  •  Technical Committee 68 – Financial Services;  •  SC 2 - Operations and Procedures, including Security;  •  SC 4 – Securities;  •  SC 6 - Financial Transaction Cards, Related Media and  Operations;  •  SC 7 – Software and Systems Engineering; and  •  SC 38 – Distributed application platforms and services  (DAPS).  The American National  Standards  Institute (ANSI)  The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is a  private, nonprofit (501(c)(3)) organization that administers  and coordinates the U.S. voluntary standardization  and conformity assessment system, and facilitates the  development of American National Standards (ANSs) by  accrediting the procedures of SDOs.  ANSI promotes the use of U.S. standards internationally,  advocates U.S. policy and technical positions in international  and regional standards organizations, and encourages the  adoption of international standards as national standards  where they meet the needs of the U.S. user community.  ANSI is the sole U.S. representative and dues-paying  member of the two major non-treaty international standards  organizations: ISO and, via the United States National  Committee (USNC), the IEC.  INCITS is an ANSI-accredited SDO that serves as  the ANSI Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for ISO/IEC  Joint Technical Committee 1. INCITS is sponsored by the  Information Technology Industry (ITI) Council, a trade  association representing the leading U.S. providers of  information technology products and services.  INCITS is organized into Technical Committees that  focus on the creation of standards for different technology  areas. Technical committees that focus on IT security and IT  security-related technologies, or that may require separate  security standards include:  •  B10 – Identification Cards and Related Devices;  •  CS1 – Cyber Security (Dan Benigni, NIST CSD, Chair; Sal  Francomacaro, NIST CSD, Vice Chair and NIST Principal  Voting Member);  •  E22 – Item Authentication;  •  M1 – Biometrics (Fernando Podio, NIST CSD, Chair);  •  T3 – Open Distributed Processing (ODP);  •  T6 – Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Technology;  •  GIT1 – Governance of IT; and  •  DAPS38 – Distributed Application Platforms and Ser- vices.  As a technical committee of INCITS, CS1 develops  national, ANSI-accredited standards in the area of  cybersecurity. Its scope encompasses:  •  Management of information security and systems;  •  Management of third-party information security service  providers;  •  Intrusion detection;  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Several members of NIST’s CSD staff contribute to  CS1’s national and international IT security standards efforts  through its membership in CS1.  CSD’s Role in  Cybersecurity  Standardization  CSD’s cybersecurity research also plays a direct role  in the Cybersecurity Standardization efforts of CS1 at the  national level. The following is a description of the national- level progress achieved during FY 2015 by CSD and CS1.  The NIST Policy Machine research and development  effort has resulted in three ongoing national standards  projects in CS1 in the early stages of development. They  include:  •  Next Generation Access Control –Functional Architec- ture (NGAC-FA), project number INCITS 499-2013, was  published in FY 2013 and is recently beginning an early  revision.  •  Next Generation Access Control – Generic Operations  & Abstract Data Structures (NGAC-GOADS). Serban  Gavrila, NIST CSD, is the editor. The project is assigned  project number 2195-D, and the document (planned for  publication in FY 2016) has successfully completed two  public review periods.  •  Next Generation Access Control -Implementation  Requirements, Protocols and API Definitions (NGAC-IR- PADS). Project number is 2193-D has been assigned.  Sal Francomacaro also served as cybersecurity stand- ards coordinator in CSD.

CSD actively partici- pates in the INCITS B10 committee, which is focused on the  interoperability of Identification Cards and Related Devices.  CSD has contributed and provided valuable feedback to  many INCITS B10 standards during the development process.  In addition, CSD also actively participates in the B10.8 and  B10.12 committees.  The INCITS/B10.8 committee works on International  Driver’s License standards and serves as the U.S. Technical  Advisory Group (TAG) to the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 Working  Group (WG) 10 efforts on the International Standardization  of Driver’s License documents. The B10.12 committee  develops interoperable standards for Integrated Circuit  Cards with Contacts, and serves as the U.S. TAG for the  international ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 17 Working Groups 4 and 11.  During FY 2015, Mr. Francomacaro served as the U.S. Head  of delegation to ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 17 WG4 and WG11.  CSD provides technical and editorial support in the  development of national and international standards.  Specifically, Mr. Ketan Mehta, a CSD staff member, serves  as the technical editor of ANSI 504-1, Generic Identity  Command Set (GICS). GICS enables PIV, PIV-Interoperable  (PIV-I) and Common Access Card (CAC) applications, and  others, to be built from a single platform. GICS defines  an open platform where identity applications can be  instantiated, deployed, and used in an interoperable way  between the credential issuers and credential users. During  FY 2015, an amendment process was started on INCITS 504  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

CSD staff also provided significant input to the standards  of major interest to U.S. government agencies and U.S.  markets. CSD played a role in the development and revision  of:  •  ISO/IEC 7816 (Identification Cards, Integrated Circuit  Cards);  •  ISO/IEC 18013 (Personal Identification, ISO Compliant  Driving License);  •  ISO/IEC 19286 (Identification cards, Privacy-enhancing  protocols and services);  •  Doc 9303-10 LDS 2 (Machine Readable Travel Docu- ments Logical Data Structure for Storage of Data in  Contactless Interface);  •  ISO/IEC 24727 (Identification Cards, Integrated Circuit  Card Programming Interfaces); and  •  ISO/IEC 24787 (Biometrics “Match On Card” Compari- son).  During FY 2016, the INCITS B10 committee, along with  the active collaboration of CSD staff, plans to:  •  Publish Part 3 of INCITS 504;  •  Complete the amendment process for INCITS 504 Part  1 and 2;  •  Contribute to the publication of several revisions of the  ISO/IEC 7816 family of standards (all relevant to FIPS  201 specifications);  •  Pursue the standardization and harmonization of iden- tity standards developed in the U.S.;  •  Develop requirements and identify standards gaps for  Mobile Driving Licenses;  •  Enhance the Machine Readable Travel Documents  (ePassport) data model to address privacy and security  concerns; and  •  Contribute to the development of privacy-enhanced  security protocols.  CSD staff will continue to actively support relevant ID  management standard initiatives, such as ISO/IEC 19286  (Integrated Circuit Card (ICC) Privacy-enhancing protocols  and services) and ISO/IEC 18328 (ICC managed Devices).  CSD’s investment in these activities is motivated by new  technical ideas that emerge from these ISO standards. For  example, INCITS 504 is an ID platform that leverages the FIPS  201 infrastructure to support a large number of government  and enterprise initiatives. In particular, INCITS 504 aims to  support initiatives such as the National Strategy for Trusted  Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC). ISO/IEC 24727 aims to  create an interoperability framework that increases the  resilience and scalability of identity management solutions  and to foster domestic and international interoperability.

Where  international standards are needed, NIST works closely  with U.S. industry, standards developers, other government  agencies, and leaders in the global standards community  to develop standards that will support secure cloud  computing.  As part of this program, Ms. Annie Sokol, CSD, provides  technical and editorial representation in the development  of national and international standards in both SC 27 and  SC38. She was the convener for ISO/IEC 17788 Information  technology – Cloud Computing Overview and vocabulary,  which is the normative reference to other published and  under-development.

These  efforts bring consistent testing of cryptographic modules  to the global community by providing ISO-equivalent  standards representing FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements  for Cryptographic Modules and Derived Test Requirements  [DTR] for FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements for Crypto- graphic Modules.  ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 Working Group (WG) 3 completed  and published revisions of ISO/IEC 19790:2006 and ISO/ IEC 24759:2008, for which Mr. Randall J. Easter of CSD  was the principal editor. The revision of ISO/IEC 19790  was published on August 15, 2012. The revision of ISO/IEC  24759 was published on January 31, 2014. Both ISO/IEC  standards were also adopted by the American National  Standards Institute (ANSI). The two ISO/IEC revisions were  developed with international support and the collaboration  of governments, industry and academia. Revised corrections  of both standards were published on December 15, 2015.  The revision of ISO/IEC 19790:2012 addresses new  security areas such as: defined software module boundaries;  degraded modes of operation; trusted channels; two- factor authentication; software security; mitigation of fault  induction and side-channel attacks; operational self-tests  for algorithms; and life-cycle assurance from design to  end-of-life.  Figure 2 is a chart of the ISO/IEC standards,  as explained above, in which CSD has played a part during  the development process.  In addition to the aforementioned standards, the  Technical Standard (TS) ISO/IEC TS 30104:2015, Physical  Security Attacks, Mitigation Techniques and Security  Requirements, for which Mr. Easter was the editor, was  published on May 15, 2015.  Physical security mechanisms are employed by  cryptographic modules where the protection of the module’s  sensitive security parameters are desired. ISO/IEC 30104  addresses how to express security assurance for products  where the risk of the security environment requires the  support of such mechanisms. This Technical Specification  addresses the following topics:  •  A survey of physical security attacks directed against  different types of hardware embodiments, including  a description of known physical attacks, ranging from  simple attacks that require minimal skill or resources, to  complex attacks that require trained, technical people  and considerable resources;  •  Guidance on the principles, best practices and tech- niques for the design of tamper protection mechanisms  and methods for the mitigation of those attacks; and  •  Guidance on the evaluation or testing of hardware tam- per protection mechanisms and references to current  standards and test programs that address hardware  tamper evaluation and testing.

CSD’s contributions to the development of these  international standards create a strong foundation for the  adoption of and migration from currently used national  standards. In particular, this adoption will promote  international harmonization for the implementation and  testing of cryptographic algorithms and modules, while  accommodating individual country preferences in the choice  of approved security functions. CSD published a Federal  Register notice in August 2015 seeking public comment  for migrating from FIPS 140-2 to ISO/IEC 19790:2012.  The  comment period ended September 2015 (see https:// federalregister.gov/a/2015-19743).  For More Information, See:  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/  CONTACT: Mr. Randall J.

During FY 2015, the CSD FISMA Implementation project  continued to strengthen collaboration through the Joint Task  Force (JTF) Transformation Initiative, which includes the  Department of Defense (DOD), the Intelligence Community  (IC), and the Committee on National Security Systems  (CNSS), and other federal agencies. The JTF partners  continue to develop and update key cybersecurity guidelines  for protecting federal information and information systems  as part of the Unified Information Security Framework.  Previously, the JTF developed common security guidance  in the critical areas of security controls for information  systems and organizations, security assessment procedures  to demonstrate security control effectiveness, security  authorizations for risk acceptance decisions, and continuous  monitoring activities to ensure that decision makers receive  the most up-to-date information on the security state of  their information systems. In addition, CSD worked with  the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Risk  and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), a  government-wide program that provides a standardized  approach to security assessment, authorization, and  continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. The  team developed a high-impact security control baseline  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

In FY 2015, the CSD FISMA Implementation project staff  worked on the following initiatives:  •  Risk Management Guidelines: SP 800-53 Revision 4,  Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information  Systems and Organizations, provides organizations  with the security controls necessary to appropriately  strengthen their information systems and the environ- ments in which those systems operate, and provides a  process for selecting the appropriate controls, which  contributes to systems that are resilient in the face of  attacks and other threats. This “Build It Right” strategy  is reinforced with the ongoing work on the Second  Public Draft of SP 800-160, Systems Security Engineer- ing: An Integrated Approach to Building Trustworthy  Resilient Systems. The implementation of SPs 800-53  and 800-160, combined with the implementation of  SP 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Management  Framework to Federal Information Systems, and SP  800 137, Information Security Continuous Monitoring  for Federal Information Systems and Organizations,  provide organizations with near real-time information  that is essential for senior leaders making ongoing  risk-based decisions affecting their critical missions and  business functions.  •  Guidelines for a Role-Based Information Security  Training Model: SP 800 16, A Role-Based Model for  Federal Information Technology/Cybersecurity Train- ing, describes a process for developing information  technology/cybersecurity role-based training. Its pri- mary focus is to provide a comprehensive, yet flexible,  methodology for the development of training courses  or modules for personnel who have been identified as  having significant information technology/cybersecu- rity responsibilities within agencies.  Agencies can use  SP 800-16 to tailor the Role-Based Security Training to  meet the needs of their own organization.  •  FISMA Outreach Activity to Public and Private Sector  Organizations: Cybersecurity outreach briefings were  conducted and support provided to all levels of govern- ment (federal, state and local), as well as private sector  organizations, on multiple information security topics  of interest. These include, for example, effective imple- mentation of the NIST RMF, contingency planning, in- terconnection security agreements, and information se- curity for small businesses. In addition, the CSD FISMA  implementation project staff conducted outreach activ- ities with academic institutions, providing information  on NIST’s security standards and guidelines, exploring  new areas of cybersecurity research and development,  and serving on cybersecurity advisory panels.  •  Collaboration with JTF partners and other federal  organizations: CSD staff worked closely with JTF part- ners on continued cooperation and planning to ensure  that the five JTF publications remain current, and on  the designation of additional special publications as  JTF guidance. The CSD FISMA implementation project  staff also collaborated with DOD, IC, the Department  of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Emergen- cy Management Agency (FEMA), the Government  Accountability Office (GAO), OMB, GSA, the Small Busi- ness Administration (SBA), and the Inspector Generals  (IGs) on multiple projects to ensure consistency with  FISMA-related guidance and to protect information in a  way that is commensurate with risk.  In FY 2015, the CSD FISMA Implementation project staff  completed the following activities:  •  Published the final version of SP 800-53A, Revision  4, Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal  Information Systems and Organizations;  •  Published both Initial Public Draft (IPD) and final ver- sions of SP 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified  Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and  Organizations, to provide guidance to federal agencies  for the protection of Controlled Unclassified Informa- tion when such information is resident in nonfederal  information systems and organizations;  •  Published an errata version of SP 800-53, Revision 4 to  make necessary clarifications and ensure consistency  with subsequently published/revised NIST SPs and  new/updated federal policy requirements;  •  Continued collaboration with DHS to develop a multi- ple-volume Interagency Report on Automation Support  for Ongoing Assessments, which is based on NIST stan- dards and guidelines; and  •  Continued the development of preliminary drafts of SP  800-18 Revision 2, Guide for Developing Security Plans  for Federal Information Systems and Organizations  and SP 800-60 Revision 2, Guide for Mapping Types  of Information and Information Systems to Security  Categories.  In FY 2016, CSD FISMA Implementation project staff  intend to:  •  Finalize SP 800-160, Systems Security Engineering: An  Integrated Approach to Building Trustworthy Resilient  Systems;  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

These test tools are  developed to promote the adoption of these standards  and to support users that require conformance to selected  biometric standards, product developers and testing labs.  CSD’s project team contributes to the development of  biometric standards and participates in the INCITS Technical  Committee M1 – Biometrics and ISO/IEC Joint Technical  Committee (JTC) 1 Subcommittee (SC) 37 – Biometrics  standards bodies. CSD plans to continue this work in FY 2016.  In FY 2015, Biometric Conformance Test Software  (BioCTS) for ANSI/NIST-ITL (which targets biometric  transactions based on NIST SP 500-290, and SP 500-290  Revision 1 - Data Format for the Interchange of Fingerprint,  Facial & Other Biometric Information) received a substantial  update. Version 2.0 of the testing software was released and  added support for testing for the remaining traditionally  encoded record types not previously supported (+12 for  ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2011, and +18 for ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2011  Update: 2013). Version 2.0 now supports all traditionally  encoded biometric record types between the two versions  of the published ANSI/NIST-ITL standards. Additionally,  Version 2.0 added many enhanced editing features for  traditionally encoded biometric transactions – some new  features include: adding and removing records and fields,  arranging records and fields, automatically sorting records,  displaying the biometric sample image, and enhanced  binary data editing features. In addition to the enhanced  editing features, BioCTS for ANSI/NIST-ITL received many  usability enhancements, as well as updates to some core  software functionality, providing a more usable and robust  testing tool.  As illustrated in Figure 3, a new feature of BioCTS is the  display of the biometric sample, when possible, so that the  user can get visual feedback on the biometric data that is  under test. The update provides a rich editing environment  for binary/traditionally encoded transactions and files,  which are difficult for humans to read. Version 2.0 provides  a user-friendly way to see each field within a transaction/ file, associated test results, and allows for the modification  of data (as shown in Figure 4.)  All of the new features are  detailed in the BioCTS for ANSI/NIST-ITL v2 User Guide (see:  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/BiomResCenter/CTA_BETA/ BioCTS_AN_ITL_v2_Guide.pdf).

(see: http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/biometrics/ biocta_download.cfm).  Figure 4: BioCTS provides a rich editing environment for  reviewing and updating records.  A number of technical contributions towards the  development of ANSI/NIST and international standards  were submitted. They included technical contributions on  international biometric data interchange formats and their  associated conformance testing methodologies, as well  as on SP 500-290 Revision 1 and the associated National  Information Exchange Model (NIEM) Extensible Markup  Language (XML) Schema (see https://tools.niem.gov).  Outreach efforts in FY 2015 in support of biometric  standards development and conformity assessment  included test tool contributions for the standards developers  (in support of ongoing development projects), and  presentations on ANSI/NIST and international biometric  standards and related conformity assessment activities.  The  work included the development of technical publications,  the review of research papers for external publications,  and participation in conference program committees.

Specifically, CSD supports the  effort by providing cybersecurity and privacy experts who  help leverage existing resources and address CPS-specific  cybersecurity and privacy challenges. Such challenges are  related to personalized health care, emergency response,  traffic flow management, and electric power generation  and delivery, and many other emerging technical areas.  Other phrases that are often referenced along with CPS  technologies include:  • Internet of Things (IoT);  • Industrial Internet;  • Smart Cities;  • Smart Grid; and  •  “Smart” Anything (e.g., Cars, Buildings, Homes, Manu- facturing, Hospitals, Appliances) (see http://www.nist. gov/cps/).  Composed of heterogeneous, potentially distributed  components and systems, CPS provides a promise of  increased efficiency and interaction between the digital and  physical worlds. However, assuring that these emerging and  evolving systems are reliable, robust, resilient, trustworthy,  secure, and that they protect the privacy of information  (to only list a few concerns) poses a unique cybersecurity  challenge.  CPS present unique challenges, including the need  for integration with legacy components and allowance for  emerging technologies, and real-time response in support of  extremely high availability, predictability, and reliability.  Cybersecurity is an important crosscutting discipline  that is critical to the safe and resilient design, development  and operation of CPS. Addressing the opportunities  and challenges of CPS requires a broad collaboration to  develop a common foundation, including a consensus  definition, vocabulary, reference architecture, and a  shared understanding of the essential roles of timing,  cybersecurity and data interoperability. CSD is researching  the cybersecurity needs of the broader landscape of CPS  by leveraging CSD’s expertise in cybersecurity in different  domains and applications of CPS (such as industrial control  systems, the smart grid, hardware-enabled security, and  embedded systems).  In June 2014, NIST established the CPS Public Working  Group (PWG), which is open to all, to foster and capture  inputs from those involved in CPS, both nationally and  globally. CSD is working in collaboration with NIST’s  Engineering Laboratory (EL) Smart Grid and Cyber-Physical  Systems Program Office, NIST’s Physical Measurement  Laboratory Time and Frequency Division, ITL’s Software  and Systems Division and ITL’s Advanced Networking  Technologies Division to lead a working group of govern- ment, academic, and industry stakeholders. The CPS PWG  consists of five technical subgroups:  • Definition, Vocabulary, and Reference Architecture;  • Use Cases;  • Cybersecurity and Privacy;  • Data Interoperability; and  • Timing and Synchronization.  Each subgroup consists of co-leaders from academia,  industry and NIST. CSD co-leads the Cybersecurity and  Privacy subgroup that is focused on identifying strategies  for cybersecurity and privacy in CPS, and is working  collaboratively with the other subgroups to ensure that  cybersecurity is included as a design principle during  development.  In September 2015, the CPS PWG published the Draft  Framework for CPS that includes the work of the five  technical subgroups. The document reflects more than a  year’s effort by the CPS PWG, which includes a few hundred  members drawn primarily from industry, academia and  government. In 2016, the CPS PWG will collect and analyze  the comments to the draft and publish the next version of the  CPS Framework. The CPS PWG deliverables are technology  and business-model neutral, and freely available online and  intended for open use by all stakeholders.  Additionally, in 2015, CSD, in conjunction with NIST’s  Engineering Laboratory, Intelligent Systems Division,  finalized SP 800-82 Revision 2, Guide to Industrial Control  Systems Security. CSD will also continue to participate in the  International Society of Automation (ISA) 99 Committee,  which develops and establishes standards, recommended  practices, technical reports, and related information that  define procedures for implementing electronically secure  industrial automation and control systems and security  practices, and for assessing electronic security performance.

CSD remained committed to the value of  communicating its R&D efforts to other federal colleagues  and identifying the opportunities to support R&D efforts  throughout the Federal Government.  In FY 2015, the NITRD Cyber Security and Information  Assurance (CSIA) Interagency Working Group (IWG)  monthly meetings provided an opportunity to learn and  share information about NIST’s ongoing research with  federal program managers of cybersecurity research (see  https://www.nitrd.gov/nitrdgroups/index.php?title=Cyber_ Security_and_Information_Assurance_Interagency_ Working_Group_(CSIA_IWG)#title). The Cybersecurity  Enhancement Act of 2014 requested the development of  a new federal cybersecurity research and development  strategic plan, and NIST was a consistent presence at the  regular development meetings for the new plan that is  intended for release during the month of February 2016.  (see Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 https:// www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1353/ text, and see strategic plan https://www.whitehouse.gov/ sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/2016_Federal_ Cybersecurity_Research_and_Development_Stratgeic_ Plan.pdf).  FY 2015 also included the development of a National  Privacy Research Strategy by the members of the National  Privacy Research Forum (see https://www.nitrd.gov/ cybersecurity/nationalprivacyresearchstrategy.aspx).  Naomi Lefkowitz, Senior Privacy Policy Advisor at NIST, and  Simson Garfinkel, Senior Advisor in the Information Access  Division, shared NIST’s focus on privacy and brought their  expertise to the development process for the privacy R&D  plan that will be published in FY 2016.  NIST regularly attended the NITRD CSIA Senior  Steering Group meetings to share and stay connected with  opportunities that supported the development of the new  strategic plan for cybersecurity R&D and participated in  panel presentations to which the SSG was invited to describe  federal directions in cybersecurity R&D at relevant forums  and conferences (see https://www.nitrd.gov/nitrdgroups/ index.php?title=Cyber_Security_Information_Assurance_ Research_and_Development_Senior_Steering_Group_ (CSIA_R%26D_SSG)#title).  CSD is also a regular participant in the coordination  activities of the federal Special Cyber Operations  Research and Engineering (SCORE) Committee. SCORE  enables technology transfer through the sharing of NIST  cybersecurity expertise and publications with researchers  throughout the Federal Government. The SCORE committee  interacts with federal leaders and reports to the National  Science & Technology Council’s Committee on Homeland &  National Security. In FY 2015, NIST expertise in supply chain  risk management and cryptography was included in SCORE  reports.

HAVA established the Election  Assistance Commission (EAC) and the Technical Guidelines  Development Committee (TGDC), chaired by the Director of  NIST. HAVA directs NIST to provide technical support to the  EAC and TGDC in efforts related to human factors, security,  and laboratory accreditation. As part of NIST’s efforts,  CSD supports the activities of the EAC related to voting  equipment security.  In the past year, NIST continued to support the EAC  in finalizing changes to the Voluntary Voting System  Guidelines (VVSG) 1.1. These changes sought to improve  the auditability of voting systems, provide greater software  integrity protections, expand and improve access-control  requirements, and help ensure that cryptographic security  mechanisms are implemented properly. The EAC approved  these updates to the VVSG in March 2015.  In addition, NIST  completed a set of draft test assertions for the security  requirements in the VVSG.

Initial efforts on the next-generation of the VVSG have  already begun.  In February, NIST and the EAC sponsored  the second Future of Voting Systems Symposium.  This  symposium brought together election officials, voting  system manufacturers, voting system test laboratories,  standards developers, academics, and federal, state, and  local government officials to discuss emerging trends in  voting.  The discussions at this workshop are being used  to define the scope and priorities for the next-generation  guidelines.  In FY 2016, NIST and the EAC will establish a set of  public working groups to inform the development of a new  version of the VVSG.  NIST and EAC goals are to accelerate  the development and adoption of the VVSG by leading these  working groups in close consultation with election officials,  the federal and private sectors, standards bodies and EAC  committees, academic researchers, and other members  of the public. These working groups will focus on voting  system technology areas, including accessibility, usability,  interoperability, security, and testing and certification.

HIT leads to improvements in healthcare quality,  reduced medical errors, increased efficiencies in health care  delivery and administration, and improved health for the  general population. Central to reaching these goals is the  assurance of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of  health information. CSD works with government, industry,  academia, and others to provide security tools, technologies,  and methodologies that provide for the security and privacy  of health information.  NIST CSD continued its HIT security outreach efforts  in FY 2015. NIST and the Department of Health and Human  Services’ (DHHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) co-hosted the  eighth annual Health Insurance Portability and Accountability  Act (HIPAA) Security Rule conference, Safeguarding Health  Information: Building Assurance through HIPAA Security, in  September 2015 in Washington, D.C. The conference offered  important sessions that focused on broad topics of interest  to the healthcare and health IT security community. Over  600 in-person and virtual attendees from federal, state,  and local governments, academia, HIPAA-covered entities  and business associates, industry groups, and vendors  heard from, and interacted with, healthcare, security, and  privacy experts on technologies and methodologies for  safeguarding health information and for implementing the  requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule. Presentations and  panel discussions covered a variety of security management  and technical assurance topics, including:  •  Collaborative approaches for securing medical devices;  •  Vulnerabilities in medical devices and control systems;  •  Business associate liability;  •  Information sharing and threat intelligence;  •  Data recovery and security plans; and  •  Securing electronic health records on mobile devices.  The keynote addresses were delivered by Jocelyn  Samuels, Director, DHHS/OCR, and Dr. Cris Ewell, Chief  Information Security Officer at Seattle Children’s Hospital.  In FY 2016, NIST will work with diverse healthcare  stakeholders, including partners in government and  industry, to support security capabilities in new areas,  such as the Precision Medicine Initiative, and identify  opportunities to strengthen the sector’s cybersecurity risk  management efforts through the application of the NIST  Cybersecurity Framework.

These  technologies increasingly rely on a supply-chain ecosystem  that is long, complex, variable, interconnected, globally  distributed, and geographically diverse. Outsourcing the  development, maintenance, management, and disposal of  data and ICT is increasingly common.  These trends have caused organizations acquiring  technology to experience a lack of visibility throughout the  supply chain (see Figure 5). Such organizations need a better  understanding of how the technology being acquired was  developed, integrated and deployed. These organizations  also need to better understand the processes, procedures,  and practices used to assure the integrity, security, resilience,  and quality of the products and services being obtained. This  lack of visibility and understanding, in turn, has decreased  the acquiring organization’s ability to effectively manage  risk inherited from the supply chain.  The Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) program  seeks to provide organizations with a standardized and  repeatable toolkit of technical and intelligence resources to  strategically manage supply-chain risk throughout the entire  lifecycle of systems, products and services.  In FY 2015, CSD finalized and published NIST SP 800- 161, Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal  Information Systems and Organizations. This document  builds on existing NIST guidance to help federal departments  and agencies identify, assess and mitigate ICT supply-chain  risk at all organizational levels.  When NIST researched and developed the Framework  for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, which  was published in February 2014, cyber supply-chain risk  management (CSCRM) was identified as an area needing  further research and guidance (see the NIST Roadmap  for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, also  published in February 2014). In FY 2015, CSD initiated a  project on industry best practices for CSCRM. Initial research  was developed into company case studies spanning multiple  business sectors. The studies will be analyzed to support a  workshop, and a final publication is planned for FY 2016.

The working group  evolved from the White House’s Comprehensive National  Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) 11, Develop a Multi-Pronged  Approach for Global Supply Chain Risk Management, which  ended in 2014. In FY 2015, the co-chairs began the process  of formalizing the working group under the auspices of the  CNSS.  CSD continued working with partners through the  Software and Supply Chain Assurance (SSCA) Forum, co- sponsoring four multi-day workshops. The SSCA Working  Group (WG) is a key public-private partnership that meets  quarterly to discuss current projects, tools, resources, and  lessons learned regarding CSCRM. The SSCA WG is co- sponsored by NIST, GSA, DoD and DHS.  In FY 2016, CSD will:  •  Continue working on Industry Best Practices for Cyber  Supply Chain Management, including hosting a two- day workshop, developing cyber supply-chain stan- dards mappings to the Cybersecurity Framework, as  well as a strategy to better integrate the supply-chain  management and information security functions in or- ganizations; the various pieces of the research project  will culminate in a draft guidance document;  •  Continue to co-chair the interagency working group on  cyber supply-chain risk management;  •  Begin research to demonstrate cause and effect rela- tionships between cyber supply-chain capability/ma- turity levels and organizational performance outcomes  over time; and  •  Research metrics for use in supply chain risk manage- ment.

One portion  of this legislation calls for the  establishment of a nationwide,  interoperable public-safety broad- band network based on the  3rd Generation Partnership Project’s  (3GPP) Long-Term Evolution (LTE)  technology. The network will be  deployed and operated by the First  Responder Network Authority  (FirstNet). The planned NPSBN will  “create a much needed nationwide interoperable broadband  network that will help police, firefighters, emergency medical  service professionals and other public safety officials stay  safe and do their jobs.” (see http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ category/public-safety). NIST is directed to establish a list  of certified devices and required components to be used  by public-safety officials, vendors, and other interested  parties for interacting with the nationwide network. NIST  is also directed to conduct research and development  that supports the acceleration and advancement of the  nationwide network.  In FY 2015, CSD supported the joint National  Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)  and NIST Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR)  program with efforts in public-safety mobile-application  security, identity management, and enabling cybersecurity  capabilities on the PSCR 700 MHz LTE network located in  Boulder, Colorado (see http://www.pscr.gov). In June 2015,  CSD, in cooperation with the Association of Public-Safety  Communications Officials (APCO) International and FirstNet,  held a half-day workshop titled “Identifying and Categorizing  Data Types for Public Safety Mobile Applications.” The  outcome of that workshop will be captured in a forthcoming  NIST publication in FY 2016. At PSCR’s Annual Public Safety  Broadband Stakeholder Conference, CSD organized a  panel titled “Applied Public Safety Cybersecurity Research”  highlighting PSCR’s cybersecurity activities over the previous  twelve months in the areas of identity management, mobile  application security, and LTE infrastructure cybersecurity.

In  addition, CSD developed an informational survey on mobile  application vetting services titled “Mobile Application  Vetting Services for Public Safety” and Draft NISTIR 8080,  Usability and Security Considerations for Public Safety  Mobile Authentication.  CSD participated in the standards development process  for LTE technology within the 3GPP, supporting security  requirements for public safety that are related to Proximity  Services (ProSe), Group Communication System Enablers  (GCSE), and Mission Critical Push-To-Talk (MCPTT). In  addition, CSD broadened its scope within the IETF to include  efforts related to public safety.  In FY 2016, CSD will continue representing public  safety in international standardization efforts, such as the  IETF and 3GPP. CSD will work to implement and exercise  LTE cybersecurity infrastructure capabilities in the PSCR  700 MHz LTE network, conduct research into mobile  authentication solutions to support public-safety, and  investigate mobile application-security services and  solutions to support the security requirements of public- safety mobile applications and devices. CSD will continue  to engage the public-safety communications community by  organizing workshops and conferences; and participating  in events such as APCO’s Annual Meeting, PSRC’s Annual  Public Safety Broadband Stakeholder Conference, and the  International Wireless Communications Expo (IWCE).

The  infrastructure is used to send command information across  the electric grid from generation systems to distribution  systems, and to exchange usage and billing information  between utilities and their customers. Key to the successful  deployment of the smart grid infrastructure is the  development of the cybersecurity strategy that includes  cybersecurity as a design consideration for new and  emerging systems, and an approach to adding cybersecurity  into existing systems. The electric grid is critical to the  economic and physical well-being of the nation, and  emerging cyber threats targeting power systems highlight  the need to integrate advanced  security to protect critical assets.  The Smart Grid Inter- operability Panel (SGIP) became  a membership-supported organi- zation in January 2013. The SGIP  Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG) was renamed the  Smart Grid Cybersecurity Committee (SGCC), and continues  to be led by Ms. Suzanne Lightman of the CSD in support of  responsibilities identified in the Energy Independence and  Security Act of 2007. The SGCC chair is a voting member of  the SGIP Technical Committee, and serves as an ex-officio  Director of the Board.  During the last year, staff from CSD and ITL’s Software  and Systems Division (SSD) worked on developing network  security tools that are specifically designed to support next- generation electrical power systems. They concentrated on  authenticating the provenance of multicast data streams  from emerging power system sensors, called Phasor  Measurement Units.  By authenticating the sensors to the  utility, the utility may trust that sensor measurements are  coming from the correct sensors and have not been hijacked.  Multicast authentication of sensor data is challenging,  due to the need for low security overhead, tolerance  of lossy networks, time-criticality, and high data rates.  Researchers augmented an existing authentication scheme  to accommodate high-data-rate sensor transmissions that  are unbounded in length (no session expiration). Using  dual offset key chains to reduce the authentication delay  and computational overhead associated with key chain  commitment, they developed a new protocol called inf- TESLA that meets the performance requirements imposed  by the physical dynamics of the power system.  Their key disclosure mechanism, as well as com- parative studies showing a cumulative reduction in the  communication overhead and computational cost over  existing methods, are outlined in a paper to appear at the  Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Symposium  on Applied Computing.  Significant effort was made to integrate their  authentication protocol into existing network simulation  software, specifically OPNET, thus providing potential users  the ability to evaluate the protocol on their own networks  and for their own applications.  Furthermore, in an effort to address the growing interest  in co-optimizing cyber and physical components to work  together as a system, CSD staff developed mathematical  formalism to tradeoff the sensitivity of a dynamic system  to attack or perturbation against the authentication  overhead incurred by their protocol. This formalism was  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

In FY 2016, CSD will coordinate with NIST’s Engineering  Laboratory (EL) and Smart Grid Program Office on the  further development of a Cybersecurity Smart Grid Test  Lab, part of the NIST Smart Grid Testbed Facility now  under construction. CSD will also collaborate with SSD on  cybersecurity research in relation to the IEEE 1588, Precision  Time Protocol, a time synchronization standard that is used  for the electric grid and other special-purpose industrial  automation and measurement networks.

NICE is responsive to President Obama’s declaration that  the “cyber threat is one of the most serious economic  and national security challenges we face as a nation” and  “America’s economic prosperity in the 21st century will  depend on cybersecurity.”  The NICE program seeks to foster, energize, and  promote a robust network and an integrated ecosystem  of cybersecurity education, training, and workforce  development.  CSD is leading the NICE program, working from  the strengths and energy of more than twenty federal  departments and agencies, leveraging each of their  relationships with academia and industry sectors to ensure  coordination, cooperation, focus, public engagement, tech- nology transfer and sustainability. NIST will highlight these  activities, engage various stakeholder groups and create  forums for sharing information and leveraging best practices.  The NICE Program Office focuses on the following  activities:  •  Accelerate learning and skills development by invoking  a sense of urgency in both the public and private sec- tors to address the shortage of a skilled cybersecurity  workforce;  •  Nurture a diverse learning community through  strengthening education and training across a multi- farious ecosystem that prioritizes learning, emphasizes  outcomes, and celebrates diversity; and  •  Guide Career Development and Workforce Planning  that supports job seekers and employers in addressing  market demands and maximizing talent management.  The NICE Program Office staff promoted NICE act- ivities through contributions to many events, symposia,  forums, competitions, educational outreach meetings, and  workshops. The staff continued its leadership to achieve  the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Cross-Agency  Priority Goal: “Closing Skills Gaps” for the IT/Cybersecurity  workforce. The staff focused on reducing cybersecurity  workforce gaps and supported the goals of the White  House’s “Ready to Work” initiative. In addition, the staff took  leadership of the NICE Working Group, a group established  to provide a mechanism in which public and private sector  participants can develop concepts, design strategies, and  pursue actions that advance cybersecurity education,  training, and workforce development.  In FY 2015, the NICE Program Office announced that  a grant will be awarded to support the development  of a visualization tool to show the demand for and  availability of critical cybersecurity jobs across the nation.  This cybersecurity jobs “heat map” will be developed  in partnership with Computing Technology Industry  Association (CompTIA) and Burning Glass Technologies.  The map will provide data to help employers, job seekers,  policy makers, training providers, and guidance counselors  in order to meet today’s increasing demand for cyber- security workers.  NICE also provided grant support for the  NICE 2015 Conference and Expo, the inaugural National  Cybersecurity K-12 Cybersecurity Education Conference, the  Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) Community Meeting,  and the NICE Challenge Project.  In FY 2016, the NICE Program Office will continue to  promote the coordination of existing and future cyber- security education, training, and workforce activities.

CSRC encourages  the broad sharing of information security tools and practices,  provides a resource for information security standards  and guidelines, and identifies and links key security web  resources to support industry and government users. CSRC  is an integral component of all of the work that CSD conducts  and produces. It is CSD’s repository for anyone wanting to  access these documents and other valuable security-related  information. During FY 2015, CSRC had more than 5.9 million  page views and downloads.  CSRC is the primary gateway for gaining access to NIST  computer security publications, standards, and guidelines,  and serves as a vital link to CSD’s customers. Publications  are organized to help users locate relevant information  quickly and are arranged by topic, relevant security control  family, and legal requirements.  In addition to CSRC, CSD maintains a publication  announcement mailing list. This free e mail list notifies  subscribers about publications that have been posted to the  CSRC website, along with announcing new CSD-sponsored  events and important news and/or announcements. The  e-mail list is a valuable tool for more than 59,000 subscribers  from the Federal Government, industry, academia, and  individuals with a personal interest in IT security worldwide.  Individuals who are interested in subscribing to this list  should visit http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/subscribe.html  for more information.  During FY 2015, the CSRC has been updated on a daily  basis with new information, such as the publication of draft  and final documents (FIPS, SPs, NISTIRs and ITL Bulletins)  and various project and program webpage updates.  An improvement made to the CSRC homepage was to  add a new section titled “Draft Publications Request for  Comments Deadlines”. This section will help our customers  that are interested in submitting comments to our technical  publications find the deadline dates for submitting  comments to certain publications.

Federal  Computer  Security Managers’  (FCSM) Forum  The Federal Computer Security Managers’ (FCSM)  Forum is sponsored by NIST to promote the sharing of  security-related information among federal agencies. The  Forum, which serves more than 1,100 members, strives to  provide an ongoing opportunity for managers of federal  information security programs to exchange information  security materials in a timely manner, build upon the  experiences of other programs, and reduce possible  duplication of effort. It provides a mechanism for NIST to  share information directly with federal agency information  security managers in fulfillment of NIST’s leadership  mandate under FISMA. It assists NIST in establishing  and maintaining relationships with other individuals or  organizations that are actively addressing information  security issues within the Federal Government. CSD’s Patricia  Toth serves as the Chairperson and Peggy Himes serves as  the Secretariat.  The Forum maintains an extensive email subscription  service. Participation in the service is only open to Federal  Government employees who participate in the management  of their organization’s information system security  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

FISSEA strives to elevate the general level  of information system security knowledge for the Federal  Government and the federal workforce. It also seeks to assist  the professional development of its members.

Willingness to share  products, information, and experiences is all that is required  to become a FISSEA member. A working group meets  monthly to administer business activities.  FISSEA maintains a website, a mailing list, and  participates in a social networking site as a means of  communication for its members. CSD assists FISSEA with  its operations by providing staff support for several of its  activities and by being FISSEA’s host agency.  The 28th Annual FISSEA Conference occurred March 24- 25, 2015 at NIST. The FISSEA audience included managers  responsible for information systems security awareness,  training, certifications, workforce identification, compliance,  etc. in federal agencies; contractors providing awareness  and training support; and faculty members of accredited  educational institutions who are involved in information  security training and education.  Pat Toth, Peggy Himes,  and Judy Barnard (NIST), as well as Gretchen Morris (DB  Consulting/NASA), and other members of the FISSEA  Working Group, were integral to the effort to support the  conference.  This year’s theme was “Changes, Challenges, and  Collaborations: Effective Cybersecurity Training”. Attendees  gained new techniques for developing/conducting training,  cost-effective practices, workforce development, and free  resources and contacts.  Over 200 cybersecurity training  professionals attended the two-day conference.  NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL)  Director, Charles Romine, welcomed attendees to the event.  We were honored to have Dr. Neil Grunberg, Professor  of Military and Emergency Medicine, Uniformed Services  University, who provided an inspiring keynote presentation,  “Information Security System Educators Must be Leaders.”  His talk addressed the leadership and communication skills  needed by Cybersecurity Educators  Presenters represented NIST, DHS, the Department of  State (DoS), the National Security Agency (NSA), private  industry, and academia. Attendees had an opportunity to  visit 16 vendors and federal agencies on the second day to  share and tell about their specific awareness and training  programs.  FISSEA conferences include Pecha Kucha (Lightning  Rounds) sessions. Speakers have 6 minutes 40 seconds for  their presentations, and the challenge is in limiting one’s  talk to only 20 slides. It’s challenging to do as a speaker and  quite fun for the audience to watch, so the Pecha Kucha fast- paced talks proved to be entertaining and educational.  The FISSEA Educator of the Year Award was established  to recognize and honor a contemporary who is making  special efforts to create, build, manage, or inspire an  information systems security awareness, training, or  education program.  Sam Maroon presented the FISSEA  2014 Educator of the Year posthumously to Shon Harris of  Logical Security. Mr. Maroon shared Ms. Harris’ contributions  to the cybersecurity education industry by characterizing  her contributions in three ways: as a writer, a trainer, and a  thought leader. Ms. Harris’ friends and colleagues, Michael  Lester and Hamid Dehghan accepted the plaque on her  behalf.

The conference continues to be a valuable  forum for individuals from government, industry, and  academia who are involved with information systems/ cybersecurity workforce development. Attendees gain  insights regarding information security awareness, training,  education, certification, and professionalization. Attendees  also learn of ongoing and planned training and education  programs and cybersecurity initiatives.  It provides NIST  the opportunity to provide assistance to departments and  agencies as they work to meet their FISMA responsibilities.  The FISSEA website provides links to the Conference  Program, and also links to presentations (http://csrc.nist. gov/fissea).  The next conference will be held at NIST on March 15-16,  2016.

The Board plays a central and unique role  in providing the government with expert advice concerning  information security and privacy issues that may affect  federal information systems. Title III of the E-Government  Act of 2002 reaffirmed the need for this Board by giving it  an additional responsibility: to thoroughly review all of the  proposed information technology standards and guidelines  developed under Section 20 of the National Institute of  Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S. Code (U.S.C.) 278g- 3), as amended.  The ISPAB is a federal advisory committee with specific  statutory objectives to identify emerging managerial,  Figure 7: Friends and colleagues accepting the  FISSEA Educator of the Year on behalf of Ms. Harris  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

The Board  was originally created by the Computer Security Act of  1987 (P.L. 100-235) as the Computer System Security and  Privacy Advisory Board (CSSPAB) within the Department  of Commerce. The CSSPAB was chartered in May 1988 in  accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act,  as amended. The 2002 FISMA legislation amended the  statutory authority of the Board and provided its current  name.  The duties of the Board, as stipulated in FISMA, include:  •  Identification of emerging managerial, technical, ad- ministrative, and physical safeguard issues relative to  information security and privacy;  •  Advising NIST and the Director of the Office of Man- agement and Budget on information security and  privacy issues pertaining to Federal Government  information systems (including the thorough review of  proposed standards and guidelines developed under 15  U.S.C. 278g-3 - Computer Standards Program); and  •  Annually reporting its findings to the Secretary of  Commerce, the Director of the Office of Management  and Budget, the Director of NSA, and the appropriate  committees of Congress.  Congress indicated the long-term need for the Board by  setting the term of Board members to four years. The charter  requires that the NIST Director appoint the Chairperson and  all twelve members of the Board. They are selected for their  preeminence in the information technology industry or  related disciplines.  The 15 U.S.C. 278g-4 charter stipulates that Board  members be selected from three main categories, with  each category providing four members. Category 1 includes  members from outside the Federal Government who are  eminent in the information technology industry, at least  one of whom is a representative of small or medium-sized  companies in such industries. Category 2 also includes  members from outside the Federal Government who are  eminent in the field of information technology or related  disciplines, but who are not employed by or representative  of a producer of information. Category 3 includes those from  the Federal Government who are experienced in information  system management, including those with experience in  information security and privacy, at least one of whom should  be from the National Security Agency. The categorization  of Board members is intended to meet ISPAB’s statutory  objectives. Federal members bring a detailed understanding  of the federal processing environment; industry brings  concerns and experiences regarding product development  and market formation, while private computer security  experts are able to bring their experiences of commercial  cost-effective security measures into Board discussion.  Dr. Peter Weinberger is currently the Chair of ISPAB.  Dr. Weinberger, a Computer Scientist from Google, joined  the Board in 2008 and assumed the responsibilities of the  Chair in January 2015.  He is also a Co-Chair of a National  Academies study on fundamental work in cybersecurity, and  a member of the National Academies study on Presidential  Policy Directive (PPD) 28, Signals Intelligence Activities.  He is well supported by the following Board members (see  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/membership.html):  Figure 8:  From Left to Right – Annie Sokol (Designated Federal Officer, CSD, NIST), Greg Garcia, Ed Roback, Toby Levin,  Jeffrey Greene, John Centafont, Dr. Kevin Fu, Dr. Peter Weinberger (Chair, ISPAB), Matt Scholl (Chief, CSD, NIST)  Members not included in this picture: Chris Boyer, Dr. Ana Anton, David Cullinane, Gale Stone, and J.

A computer failure or system breach  could jeopardize the company’s reputation and may result  in significant damage and recovery cost, or going out  of business. The small business owner who recognizes  the threat of computer crime and takes steps to deter  inappropriate activities is less likely to become a victim.  The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) reports  that over 27 million U.S. companies - more than 99 percent of  all U.S. businesses - are SMBs of 500 employees or fewer (see  http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/allprofiles12.pdf).  While the threats to individual SMBs may not be significantly  different from those facing larger organizations, an SMB  frequently has fewer resources available to protect systems,  detect attacks, or respond to security issues. A vulnerability  common to a large percentage of SMBs could pose a threat  to the nation’s information infrastructure and economic  base.  To help address information security risk, these busi-  nesses require assistance with the identification of security  mechanisms and with practical, cost-effective training.  Training helps SMB’s use their limited resources most  effectively to address relevant and serious threats. In  response to this need, NIST, the SBA, and the Federal Bureau  of Investigation (FBI) InfraGard program co-sponsor a series  of cybersecurity training workshops for small businesses.  These workshops provide an overview of cybersecurity  threats, vulnerabilities, and corresponding protective tools  and techniques, with a special emphasis on information that  small business personnel can apply directly.  In FY 2015, six SMB outreach workshops were provided  in Reno, Nevada; Fresno, California; Modesto, California;  Fairmont, West Virginia; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and  McHenry, Maryland. Additionally, the SMB Cybersecurity  Outreach Program was briefed to the InfraGard National  Congress.  In collaboration with the SBA and the FBI, planning  is underway to identify locations and plan cybersecurity  workshops in FY 2016.

The competition ended on October 2,  2012 when NIST announced the selection of Keccak as the  winning algorithm for standardization as the new SHA- 3 Standard. NIST consulted with the Keccak designers  and the cryptographic community, and developed a SHA- 3 standardization plan that was presented at numerous  cryptography conferences and posted at the NIST hash  website, indicated below, for public feedback.  NIST announced Draft FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard:  Permutation-Based Hash and Extendable-Output Functions,  in the Federal Register (79 FR 30549) on May 28, 2014  and requested comments (see https://federalregister. gov/a/2014-12336). The announcement also proposed a  revision of the Applicability Clause of the Announcement  Section of FIPS 180-4, Secure Hash Standard, to allow the  use of hash functions specified in either FIPS 180-4 or FIPS  202, modifying the original mandate to use only the hash  functions specified in FIPS 180-4. The other sections of FIPS  180-4 remain unchanged. A ninety-day public comment  period was provided, which ended on August 26, 2014.  NIST received seven comments on Draft FIPS 202 and  one comment on the Draft Revision of the Applicability  Clause of FIPS 180-4. All comments received are posted  at the NIST hash website. None of the comments opposed  the adoption of the SHA-3 Standard or the revision of the  Applicability Clause of FIPS 180-4. NIST also received public  feedback at the 2014 SHA-3 Workshop and afterwards. All  of the comments were carefully reviewed, and changes were  made to FIPS 202, where appropriate. NIST made additional  editorial changes to improve FIPS 202.  FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based Hash and  Extendable-Output Functions, and the revised Applicability  Clause of FIPS 180-4 were approved by the Secretary of  Commerce and announced in the Federal Register (80  FR 46543) on August 5, 2015 (see https://federalregister. gov/a/2015-19181). FIPS 202 and FIPS 180-4 are available at:  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html.

For example, random numbers  are used to generate the keys needed for encryption and  digital signature applications.  In March 2007, CSD published SP 800-90,  Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using  Deterministic Random Bit Generators, which contained four  deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) mechanisms,  two based on hash functions, one based on the use of block  cipher algorithms and one based on the use of elliptic curves.  This recommendation was revised as SP 800-90A in January  2012 to include additional capabilities and in June 2015 to  remove the DRBG based on the use of elliptic curves, i.e.,  the DUAL_EC_DRBG, since its security has been in question.  Two additional documents (SP 800-90B,  Recommendation for the Entropy Sources Used for Random  Bit Generation, and SP 800-90C, Recommendation for  Random Bit Generator (RBG) Constructions) are under  development, and the initial drafts were made available for  public comment in 2012.  SP 800-90B addresses the development and testing of  entropy sources, including descriptions of the tests for NIST’s  Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program to validate  candidate entropy sources. An entropy source depends on  a noise source, which is the root of security for the entropy  source. During FY 2015, the CTG developed and tested  additional methods for estimating the amount of entropy  per noise-source output. An overview of the methodology  and preliminary results of new estimators, called predictors,  were presented at ShmooCon in the talk “How Random is  Your RNG?” Further details and results were published in the  paper “Predictive Models for Min-Entropy Estimation” at the  Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (CHES  2015) workshop. A new draft of SP 800-90B will be provided  for another public comment period in early FY 2016.  SP 800-90C provides basic guidance on the construc- tion of RBGs from the entropy sources validated against the  requirements of SP 800-90B and the DRBG mechanisms  of SP 800-90A. The CTG plans to provide a new version of  this document for public comment prior to the end of the SP  800-90B public-comment period.

A block cipher  transforms some fixed-length binary data (i.e., a “block”)  into seemingly random data of the same length. The  transformation is determined by the choice of some secret  data called the “key.” The same key is used to reverse the  transformation and recover the original block of data. A  cryptographic technique that is constructed from a block  cipher is called a mode of operation. Several modes of  operation have been specified in the SP 800-38 series of  publications.  The CTG has nearly completed the development of two  AES modes of operation for format-preserving encryption  (FPE), based on proposals that were submitted from the  private sector. A format can be a sequence of decimal digits,  such as a credit card number or a social security number;  formats can also be defined for other sets of characters  besides decimal digits. FPE is expected to facilitate the  retrofitting of encryption to existing applications. For  example, FPE could be applied to database systems, so  that sensitive data could be targeted for encryption without  disrupting the underlying data fields/pathways.  The two modes of operation for FPE, called FF1 and  FF3, will be specified in Special Publication 800-38G,  Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation:  Methods for Format-Preserving Encryption, which will be  completed in FY 2016.  In the coming year, the CTG plans to consider technical  changes to two other Special Publications in the 800-38  series. In particular, the CTG plans: 1) to solicit public comment  on requirements for the generation of non-repeating IVs  for the Galois/Counter Mode, specified in SP 800-38D,  Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation:  Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) and GMAC; and 2) to revisit  the combinations of encryption and authentication that are  approved in SP 800-38F, Recommendation for Block Cipher  Modes of Operation: Methods for Key Wrapping.

CSD  began to provide guidance in managing the keys used for  cryptographic applications in the late 1990s to early 2000s.  Several guidance and recommendation documents have  been and continue to be developed in the form of NIST  Special Publications (SP), which have been periodically  updated to address new algorithms and handling procedures.  These documents are coordinated with federal agencies and  with the cryptographic community, including national and  international organizations, industry, and academia. During  FY 2015, the following publications were either created or  revised.  SP 800-57, Recommendation for Key Management,  Part 3: Application-Specific Key Management Guidance,  was first published in 2009. This document addresses the  key-management issues of currently available cryptographic  mechanisms, including the use of Public Key Infrastructures  (PKI) and several commonly used security protocols and  applications. A revision of this document was provided for  public comment in May 2014 that updated the guidance  provided in the 2009 version, included an additional  section on the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, and substituted  a reference to SP 800-52, Revision 1, Guidelines for the  Selection, Configuration, and Use of Transport Layer  Security (TLS) Implementations, for the TLS section. After  the comment period, the draft revision was revised, and  published in January 2015.  SP 800-57, Recommendation for Key Management, Part  1: General, was first published in 2005, and later revised in  2007 and 2012. Another revision was provided for public  comment in FY 2015 that includes information on and  references to recent work performed by CSD; removed  references to the Dual_EC_DRBG, which was removed  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

The revision  was provided for public comment in September 2015 and  should be completed in early FY 2016.  SP 800-131A, Transitions: Recommendation for  Transitioning the Use of Cryptographic Algorithms and  Key Lengths, was originally published in January 2011. This  document provides specific guidance for transitions to  the use of stronger cryptographic keys and more robust  algorithms. An update of SP 800-131A was provided  for public comment and completed in November 2015.  This update removes approval for the Dual_EC_DRBG,  deprecates the use of non-approved key-establishment  schemes, disallows the use of non-approved key-wrapping  methods after 2017, and indicates that the use of the SHA-3  family of hash functions as acceptable.  SP 800-152, A Profile for U.S. Federal Cryptographic  Key Management Systems (CKMS), provides guidance  on the CKMSs to be used by the Federal Government.  This document provides refinements of the requirements  for CKMS designers that are specified in SP 800-130, A  Framework for Designing Cryptographic Key Management  Systems. SP 800-152 also provides requirements and  recommendations for the service providers of CKMSs used  by federal agencies and their contractors, as well as guidance  for the federal agencies in selecting a CKMS that supports  the security and management policies of those agencies. A  draft of this document was provided for public comment in  FY 2013, and a workshop was held in March 2013 to discuss  the draft. A second draft was provided for comment in FY  2015, and a final version addressing the received comments  was published in October 2015.  A new NIST publication is under development  that provides guidance on the security strength of a  cryptographic key that is used to protect data (i.e., a data- protection key), given the manner in which the key was  generated and handled. This document, SP 800-158, Key  Management: Obtaining a Targeted Security Strength,  involves a considerable amount of new research, since it  is an area that has not been fully addressed to date. This  publication will be available for public comment in FY 2016.  Additional key-management work to be conducted in FY  2016 includes revision(s) to SP 800-56A, Recommendation  for Pair-Wise Key-Establishment Schemes Using Discrete  Logarithm Cryptography, and SP 800-56B, Recommenda- tion for Pair-Wise Key-Establishment Schemes Using Integer  Factorization Cryptography, to allow the use of larger key  sizes.

TLS is a widely used cryptographic  protocol that provides communication security for a variety  of network applications, such as email, e-commerce, and  healthcare.  SP 800-52 was first published in 2005, and SP 800-52  Revision 1 was published in April 2014. Since the revision, CTG  has been following developments in TLS implementations,  including updates and attacks. In FY 2016, a second revision  will be published that considers these developments.  This second revision will be a minor update to SP 800-52  Revision 1.  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is actively  developing extensions that can be used to add functionality  to TLS. CSD will continue to review updates and additions to  the TLS protocol in FY 2016.

NIST has standardized elliptic curve cryptography  for digital signature algorithms in FIPS 186 and for key  establishment schemes in SP 800-56A.

However, the provenance of the  curves is not fully specified in the standard, leading to recent  public concerns that there could be a hidden weakness in  these curves. NIST is not aware of any vulnerability in these  curves when they are implemented correctly and used as  described in NIST standards and guidelines.  However, more than fifteen years have passed since  these curves were developed, and the community now  knows more about the security of elliptic curve cryptography  and practical implementation issues. Advances within the  cryptographic community have led to the development of  new elliptic curves and algorithms whose designers claim  to offer better performance and are easier to implement  in a secure manner. Some of these curves are under  consideration in voluntary, consensus-based Standards  Developing Organizations.  In June 2015, NIST hosted a workshop on Elliptic Curve  Cryptography Standards to discuss possible approaches to  promote the adoption of secure, interoperable and efficient  elliptic curve mechanisms. Workshop participants expressed  significant interest in the development, standardization and  adoption of new elliptic curves. As a result of this input,  NIST is considering the addition of new elliptic curves to  the current set of recommended curves in FIPS 186-4. In FY  2016, NIST will solicit comments on possible improvements  to FIPS 186-4, which may lead to a workshop held later in  the year.

If large- scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to  break the existing infrastructure of public-key cryptography.  The focus of the Post-Quantum Cryptography project is  to identify candidate quantum-resistant systems that are  secure against both quantum and classical computers, as  well as the impact that such post-quantum algorithms will  have on current protocols and security infrastructures.  In FY 2015, NIST researchers held regular seminars. The  presentation topics included the latest published results; a  synopsis of the security analysis; and status reports in the  areas of quantum computation, hash-based signatures,  coding-based cryptography, lattice-based cryptography,  and multivariate cryptography. Through these presentations  and discussions, the team made significant progress in  understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the existing  cryptographic schemes in each category. The project team  is planning to create evaluation criteria for post-quantum  cryptography schemes for standardization.  The NIST team continues to be productive in post- quantum cryptography research. The results have been  published at the major conferences, such as PQCrypto  2014, and Eurocrypt 2015. NIST researchers have given  presentations at conferences and workshops to increase  awareness of the upcoming migration. NIST researchers have  contributed to the European Telecommunications Standards  Institute (ETSI) whitepaper on quantum-safe cryptography.  NIST has also sponsored other research, education, and  research events.  NIST held the Workshop on Cybersecurity in a Post- Quantum World in March of 2015. The workshop was  attended by approximately 140 participants from around  the world. Presentations given at the workshop included  new proposals for quantum-safe cryptosystems, ideas for  how to modify protocols (such as TLS) to include these new  cryptosystems, discussions on how to standardize hash- based signatures and key-management issues, as well as  new ideas on the cryptanalysis of the many post-quantum  systems.  In FY 2016, NIST will continue to explore the security  and feasibility of purported quantum-resistant technologies,  with the ultimate goal of uncovering the fundamental  mechanisms necessary for efficient, trustworthy, and cost- effective information assurance in the post-quantum era.  Upon the successful completion of this phase of the project,  NIST will be prepared for possible standardization efforts in  this area.

In practice, it  is important to be able to minimize the size of these  circuits. This problem is closely related to designing small  combinational circuits. These circuits use only binary AND,  XOR and NEGATION gates, i.e., multiplication, addition, and  “+1” in arithmetic modulo 2. A combinational circuit on four  variables (X1, X2, X3, and X4) using AND and XOR gates is  depicted in Figure 9.  The project team has shown that finding optimal  combinational circuits is MAX-SNP Complete. In practice, this  means that it is necessary to settle for methods that design  “good” circuits, as opposed to provably optimal circuits.  The CTG has developed and implemented new solutions for  the circuit-minimization problem. Two patents have been  granted related to this work, the last one in FY 2014. These  are held jointly between NIST and the University of Southern  Denmark.  The CTG is also researching circuit-based security  metrics for cryptographic functions. For a function to be  secure (in particular, one-way), it must be the case that any  circuit that implements it is sufficiently complex. In particular,  a function is insecure if it can be implemented by a circuit  containing too few Boolean AND gates. This security metric,  namely the number of AND gates necessary and sufficient  to implement a function, is referred to as its multiplicative  complexity. Unfortunately, determining multiplicative  complexity is extremely hard (very recently, Magnus Find  proved computational intractability conditioned on the  existence of one-way functions). Mathematicians attempted  to determine multiplicative complexity in the 1970s, but the  effort had been largely abandoned by the 1980s. However, the  CTG has published circuits that are provably optimal or close  to optimal (with respect to multiplicative complexity) for  important classes of functions. In the process, we developed  tools that have wide applicability for both theoretical and  applied research in security and cryptography.  Multiparty computation is a technique that allows  a group of people to compute a function of their inputs  without revealing the inputs themselves. Examples of this  are: i) holding an election; ii) conducting closed-bid auctions  in which only the winning bid is determined; iii) proving to a  third party that a person’s encrypted attributes satisfy some  requirement, such as “over 21 and (U.S. citizen or Canadian  citizen)”. The protocols that solve multiparty computation  problems often encrypt bits using arithmetic modulo 2. The  complexity of such protocols largely depends on the number  of multiplications required. Hence, expressing functions as  circuit computations with only a few multiplication (AND)  gates is important. Some of the published circuits are now  the standard reference for benchmarking tools in multiparty  computation.  The following is a partial list of new results by our team:  •  The smallest known circuits were constructed for multi- plication in several small finite fields.  •  The smallest known circuits were constructed for  binary multiplication (i.e., multiplication of polynomials  of degree n over the Galois Field with two elements).  This yields important speed increases in elliptic curve  cryptography.  •  Optimal circuits were constructed - with respect to  multiplicative complexity - for all predicates on four  bits (see the example below). There are 65,536 such  predicates. Surprisingly, the multiplicative complexity  of all these functions turned out to be at most three.  Additionally, our circuits use no more than seven  non-linear gates (XOR, XNOR). This is quite hard. Con- sider the following predicate (arithmetic is modulo 2):  f = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x1x2 + x1x3 + x1x4 + x2x3 +x2x4 + x1x2x3  + x1x2x4 + x1x2x3x4.  Computing the last term requires three multiplications.  So, it is quite surprising that the full expression can be  Figure 9: Combinational Boolean Circuit  The red nodes are AND gates; the yellow nodes are XOR gates.

But, we  have shown this to be true for f  and all other pred- icates on four bits. The circuit on the previous page  computes f using three multiplications and six addi- tions.  •  A proof was developed that the maximum multipli- cative complexity of predicates on five bits (there are  more than 4 billion such predicates) is four. The proof is  constructive, meaning that the circuits can actually be  built.  •  A proof was developed that an explicit function  requires at least 3.01n gates. This constitutes the only  improvement on this problem for more than 30 years.  The result is due to Magnus Find, in collaboration with  mathematicians from New York University (NYU) and  from the Steklov Institute, St. Petersburg, Russia.

Examples of these areas  include: sensor networks, distributed control systems, the  Internet of Things, cyber physical systems, and the smart  grid. Security and privacy can be very important in all of  these areas. Because the majority of current cryptographic  algorithms were designed for desktop/server environments,  implementing many of these algorithms with constrained  resources can be extremely challenging. If current algorithms  can be made to fit into the limited resources of constrained  environments, their performance is typically not acceptable.  CTG staff are examining applications in constrained  environments to determine whether NIST should develop  lightweight cryptographic standards. CTG is communicating  with industry experts to understand challenges, limitations  and work from other standardization bodies in this area. In  FY 2015, CTG organized a NIST workshop on Lightweight  Cryptography in Gaithersburg, MD, July 20-21, 2015 to  discuss issues related to the security and resource  requirements of applications in constrained environments  and potential future standardization of lightweight primitive  algorithms. The workshop included two invited talks, twenty- four presentations and a panel discussion.  In FY 2015, CTG staff further engaged the international  cryptographic community by providing presentations at  the Fourth International Workshop on Lightweight Crypto- graphy for Security and Privacy in Bochum, Germany, at  the Fast Software Encryption Workshop in Istanbul, Turkey  and at the Lightweight Crypto Day, in Haifa Israel. Project  summaries and challenges ahead were presented at the  Cybersecurity Innovation Forum and to ITL’s Cyber-Physical  Systems (CPS) group.  In FY 2016, CTG will continue to analyze the resource  requirements and performance characteristics of lightweight  primitives, and study their use as building blocks to perform  various cryptographic objectives. Additionally, CTG is  planning to publish a report that describes the current state  and challenges in target application areas.

The service is available at https://beacon.nist.gov/home. It  uses two independent, commercially available sources of  randomness, each with an independent hardware entropy  source and SP 800-90A-approved components.  The NIST Beacon is designed to provide unpredictability,  autonomy, and consistency. Unpredictability means that  users cannot algorithmically predict bits before they are  made available by the source. Autonomy means that the  source is resistant to attempts by outside parties to alter the  distribution of the random bits. Consistency means that a set  of users can access the source in such a way that they are  confident of receiving the same random string.  The NIST Beacon posts bit-strings in blocks of 512 bits  every 60 seconds. Each such value is time-stamped and  signed, and includes the hash of the previous value to chain  the sequence of values together. This prevents all parties,  even the source, from retroactively changing an output  packet without being detected. The NIST Beacon keeps  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

At any point in time, the full history of  outputs is available to users.  Tables of random numbers have probably been used for  multiple purposes at least since the Industrial Revolution.  In the digital age, algorithmic pseudorandom number  generators (PRNGs) have largely replaced these tables. The  NIST Beacon expands the use of randomness to multiple  scenarios in which neither tables nor PRNGs can be used.  The extra functionalities stem mainly from three features.  First, the Beacon-generated numbers cannot be predicted  before they are published. Second, the public, time-bound,  and authenticated nature of the Beacon allows a user  application to prove to anybody that it used truly random  numbers not known before a certain point in time. Third, this  proof can be presented offline and at any point in the future.  Although commercially available physical sources of  randomness are adequate as entropy sources for currently  envisioned implementations of the NIST Beacon, we are  working on developing a source of verifiably random  sequences. In collaboration with NIST physicists from the  Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML), we aim to use  quantum non-locality to build an entropy source whose  unpredictability is guaranteed by the laws of physics. This  project is funded by NIST’s Innovations in Measurement  Science (IMS) Program. IMS funds highly competitive  projects designed to explore high-risk, leading-edge  research concepts that anticipate the future measurement  and standards needs of industry and science. For more  information on this collaboration see http://www.nist.gov/ pml/div684/random_numbers_bell_test.cfm.  As of the end of FY 2015, the NIST Beacon has been  functioning without interruption for more than two years.  NIST encourages the community at large to research and  publish novel ways in which this tool can be used. A few  examples of applications are unpredictable sampling,  new authentication mechanisms, and secure multi-party  computation.

The ability to generate  strong cryptographic keys is directly related to having  access to unpredictable random data, but generating truly  unpredictable random data on computing devices is hard  and unreliable. As a result, weak keys are widely used in  cryptographic applications compromising the security of  sensitive data protected by them with potentially disastrous  consequences.  A primary goal of this project is to provide high-quality,  truly unpredictable random data to devices on the Internet  to enable them to generate strong cryptographic keys and  attest the strength of the keys used to protect data in transit  or at rest, thereby enabling cryptographic system strength  attestation. Achieving this goal would provide a solid basis  for addressing the problems targeted by Cryptographic  System Validation (see the next section: Validated Programs,  the first project in this section).  Random data obtained from sources of true randomness  that are based on unpredictable physical phenomena, such  as quantum effects, is much better suited for cryptographic  applications. CSD is collaborating with the NIST Physical  Measurement Laboratory (PML) to build a quantum source.  The aim is to use quantum effects to generate sequences  that are guaranteed to be unpredictable, even if an attacker  has access to the random source. For more information on  this collaboration, see http://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/ random_numbers_bell_test.cfm.  This project aims to develop a system and protocols  for obtaining random data with high entropy from one or  more remote sources. The high-level architecture is shown in  Figure 10 (see next page). The architecture of the Entropy-as- a-Service system consists of two main parts: the client-side  and the server-side.  The critical components of the system  are the quantum device, the EaaS server and a secure device  in the client systems capable of providing strong isolation  and protection for the cryptographic keys stored inside the  device and offering a set of basic cryptographic services.  Client devices mix this data with locally available random  data to seed random number generators to generate strong  cryptographic keys and other random values independently  from the remote sources.

In such  a heterogeneous network, a mobile device may switch its  connection between different wireless technologies, such  as between cellular and WiFi networks. The procedure for  conducting such a switch is called a “handover.” Media- independent handover (MIH) is a set of services specified  in IEEE 802.21 to assist the handover. When the services  provided by the pervasive heterogeneous networks  are extended to other applications, such as Smart Grid  applications, the MIH needs to be processed by a group  of wireless nodes, such as smart meters, for balancing the  network load and for reliability. In this case, the information  may need to be delivered to a group of smart meters using a  multicast message, which is used to deliver the information.  That is, the multicast message is sent from one point-of- service (PoS) to multiple wireless nodes. In some of the  application environments, such as sensor networks, the  groups are formed dynamically; new nodes can be added  to the group, and some nodes in the group may need to  be removed. Such groups are managed through multicast  signals.  Amendment 2 of IEEE 802.21 provides protection  mechanisms for unicast messages − mechanisms that  protect messages between a PoS and a single mobile  node. In FY 2015, CSD continued work with IEEE 802.21 to  develop security solutions for group management in Task  Group D of IEEE 802.21. The solutions, specified in IEEE  802.21 Amendment 4, include the mechanisms to distribute  group keys and for the protection of multicast messages.  Amendment 4 of IEEE 802.21 was published in FY 2015.  In FY 2016, CSD will continue to contribute to a broader  scope of IEEE 802 wireless standards.

The OMB memorandum defines four levels of assurance that  a federal agency must select, based on a risk assessment  to determine the impact of an authentication failure. This  guideline covers the remote authentication of users (such as  private individuals) interacting with government IT systems  over the Internet. It defines technical requirements for  each of the four levels of assurance in the areas of identity  proofing, tokens, credential binding, management processes,  authentication protocols and assertion characteristics. Since  the initial release of SP 800-63, the CSD has released two  revisions to address changes in modern technology and  lessons learned from practical implementations by federal  departments and agencies.  Several recent developments have an impact on the way  that agencies fulfill their e Authentication requirements:  •  Executive Order 13681, Improving the Security of Con- sumer Financial Transactions, issued by the adminis- tration in October 2014, requires “…that all agencies  making personal data accessible to citizens through  digital applications require the use of multiple factors  of authentication and an effective identity proofing  process, as appropriate.” (see http://www.whitehouse. gov/the-press-office/2014/10/17/executive-order-im- proving-security-consumer-financial-transactions)  •  CSD published The Framework for Improving Critical  Infrastructure Cybersecurity in February 2014 in re- sponse to Executive Order (EO) 13636, Improving Crit- ical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (for the Framework,  see http://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/; for the  EO 13636, see http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press- office/2013/02/12/executive-order-improving-criti- cal-infrastructure-cybersecurity). The accompanying  roadmap cites the need for NIST to “…conduct identity  and authentication research complemented by the pro- duction of Special Publications that support improved  authentication practices.” (see http://www.nist.gov/ cyberframework/upload/roadmap-021214.pdf)  •  The National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyber- space (NSTIC), which was released in 2011, charts a  course for both public and private sectors to collab- orate to raise the level of trust associated with the iden- tities of individuals, organizations, networks, services,  and devices involved in online transactions through an  Identity Ecosystem (see http://www.nist.gov/nstic/).  NSTIC calls for the Federal Government to “lead by  example and implement the Identity Ecosystem for the  services it provides internally and externally.” As the  Identity Ecosystem starts to take shape, NIST guide- lines should reflect and support it.  In addition, market forces have resulted in an inflexion  point in how departments and agencies authenticate users.  NIST and our private sector partners have observed that  some public and private sector identity assurance standards  have become outdated or have simply not been adopted.

Innovation  has offered new perspectives in how trusted identities  can be established. Practical implementations of SP 800- 63 have informed us of areas of strengths, weaknesses,  and techniques not utilized by federal agencies or the  private sector. In addition, federal agencies are the only  organizations required to follow NIST SPs. However, as the  Federal Government evolves to accept credentials offered  by private sector organizations, the applicability of SP 800- 63 has expanded beyond agency use. NIST has an obligation  to service the expansion of the original SP 800-63 target.  Therefore, in April of 2015, NIST issued a call for  comments on the current published version, SP 800-63-2,  in order to identify specific topics that could be addressed  in a future revision of SP 800-63 (see http://csrc.nist.gov/ groups/ST/eauthentication/sp800-63-2_call-comments. html). NIST received over 40 submissions from individuals,  academia, and the public and private sectors. Over 300  distinct comments were identified from these submissions. In  addition to the comments that NIST received, vulnerabilities  have been discovered in existing online authentication  services, specifically in the area of remote identity proofing,  which has warranted an accelerated consideration of  updated guidance for the Federal Government.  In FY 2016, CSD expects its authentication work to be  driven by the needs of the ongoing rapid expansion of online  service delivery, commercially available authentication  services, results and metrics from NSTIC pilots, and the  availability of multi-factor tokens to consumers. Breaches  of personal information and the relative availability of  personal information has necessitated that NIST reconsider  approaches to identity proofing, both in-person and  remotely. The paradigm where the starting assumption was  that personal data was hard to find has now changed to one  where it is acknowledged that this data is readily available  online; existing guidance needs to be adjusted to offer  organizations cost-effective, yet secure, identity proofing  capabilities. The NSTIC pilots have tested innovative  alternatives to high-assurance remote proofing, necessita- ting that SP 800-63 be considerate of these advances in the  marketplace. In addition, commercial advances in physical  document validation and verification, the proliferation of  high-resolution video cameras on commodity computing  devices, including mobile phones, as well as new offerings  in the delivery of in-person proofing, will influence potential  updates to requirements at all levels of assurance.  As many types of biometric sensors become ubiquitous  in personal mobile devices, and more and more individuals  leverage biometrics in commercial use cases such as  mobile payment and online authentication to private  sector services, CSD will re-examine the current position of  remote, unattended biometric authentication.  The existing  publication does allow local biometric authentication to  unlock a token – a secure technique currently used by  popular mobile handset manufacturers. Yet the comments  CSD received reveal that some believe this is insufficient,  and that centralized biometric authentication used in  single- or multi-factor schemes should be allowed in a future  revision. CSD will pursue detailed research in the security  of remote biometric authentication, examine the efficacy  of standardization efforts related to presentation attack  detection, and contemplate the long-term impacts of the  en-masse theft of biometrics before expanding the current  requirements of SP 800-63-2.  The user experience of online authentication will also be  a significant consideration in a potential update of SP 800- 63. The CSD has observed that the user experience has a  direct relationship with individual uptake of authentication  services as well as the overall security of any authentication  scheme. While CSD does not intend to weaken requirements  to accommodate a favorable user experience, understanding  the impact of e-Authentication requirements on the user,  and to design requirements that do not degrade security but  upgrade the user experience, is imperative.  The CSD, therefore, plans to actively consider revisions  to SP 800-63-2 in response to the issues noted above and  other issues that can be dealt with in time to assist in the  intense ongoing efforts to expand online services.

Poor  implementations of these standards or specifications may  render a particular product insecure, potentially placing  sensitive information at risk. CSD operates several validation  programs that help provide a level of assurance that products  meet established security requirements and conform to  published specifications. To that end, the Security Testing,  Validation, and Measurement Group (STVMG) develops test  suites and test methods; provides implementation guidance  and technical support to industry forums; and conducts  education, training, and outreach programs.  STVMG’s validation programs work together with  independent laboratories that are accredited by the National  Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP).  Based on the independent laboratory test report and test  evidence provided by the labs, the validation programs  described below validate the implementation under test.  CSD subsequently publishes lists of the validations awarded  on public websites.  Cryptographic System Val idation Current validation programs focus on providing a known  level of assurance for cryptographic algorithms and modules.  These modules are used within the context of a larger system  to provide cryptographic services as a method of protecting  the data within the system. As information systems continue  to become more complex, the methods used to implement  cryptographic services have also increased in complexity.  Problems with the use of cryptography are often introduced  through the interaction of cryptographic components with  the operating environment. This program seeks to specify  how cryptographic components are used as part of a defined  cryptographic system to solve problems with a measureable  level of assurance, and to introduce automated methods of  quantifying the level of assurance that has been provided.  In FY 2016, this program will begin the research required  to define a reference cryptographic systems architecture  and example use cases where cryptographic systems are  built from known cryptographic components that cooperate  through trust relationships to provide a measureable level of  assurance. The architecture should begin at the lowest level  with a hardware-based root of trust, and each cryptographic  component should be added in successive layers to  provide assurance in a systematic way. This should allow  the development of tests that would measure the correct  implementation of cryptographic components as part of a  larger system.  This program will perform research and experimentation  in applicable technologies and techniques that will enable  the efficient testing of the cryptographic capabilities of each  layer, and enable the continuous monitoring capabilities of  each cryptographic component, providing the necessary  interfaces to establish trust relationships with other  cryptographic components. Techniques could include such  items as:  •  Embedding XML data elements and standard inter- faces to query those data elements during the design  and implementation of cryptographic components that  would enable automated testing capabilities;  •  Using cryptographic techniques to embed values into  the module that would increase the verifiability and  assurance that the module provides; and  •  Using industry-based secure development techniques  to increase the level of trust inherent in software mod- ules, starting with design and implementation.  Research into this area of cryptographic system  validation holds the promise of automating the validation of  all cryptographic components, providing a higher assurance  with less manual effort. The program will use an approach  that was developed for the SCAP product validation effort  to embed data elements that instrument the test harnesses  used to validate cryptographic systems. This would also  provide the instrumentation that could be leveraged to  enable a greater level of situational awareness and security  measurement, and potentially, to enable continuous  monitoring of cryptographic systems.

Through  these programs, NIST and CSE work with international  government, public and private sectors as a part of the  cryptographic community to achieve standards-based  security and assurance of correct implementation. The  goal of these programs is to provide federal agencies  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

The  testing carried out by independent third-party laboratories  accredited by NVLAP, and the validations performed by  the CAVP and CMVP programs provide this metric. Federal  agencies, industry, and the public can choose cryptographic  modules and/or products containing cryptographic modules  from the CMVP Validated Modules List and have confidence  in the claimed level of security and assurance of correct  implementation.  Cryptographic algorithm and cryptographic module  testing and validation are based on published NIST  standards. Since federal agencies are required to use  validated cryptographic modules for the protection of  sensitive unclassified information, the validated modules and  the validated algorithms that the modules contain represent  the culmination and delivery of CSD’s cryptography-based  work to the end user.  The CAVP and the CMVP are separate collaborative  programs. The CAVP and the CMVP validate algorithms and  modules, respectively, which are used in a wide variety of  products, including Internet browsers, radios, smart cards,  space-based communications, munitions, security tokens,  mobile phones, network and storage devices, and products  supporting the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and electronic  commerce. A module may be a standalone product, such  as a virtual private network (VPN) or smart card, or it  could be a module embedded in many products, such as a  cryptographic-based toolkit. As a result, a small number of  modules may be incorporated within hundreds of products.  The CAVP validates cryptographic algorithms that may be  integrated in one or more cryptographic modules.

For the  CAVP, the validation system documents are designed for  each FIPS-approved or NIST-recommended cryptographic  algorithm. See the website for a listing (see http://csrc.nist. gov/groups/STM/cavp/). Security requirements for the  CMVP are found in FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements for  Cryptographic Modules, and the associated test metrics  and methods in Derived Test Requirements for FIPS 140- 2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules.  The four Annexes to FIPS 140-2 reference the underlying  cryptographic algorithm standards or methods. The CMVP- developed Implementation Guidance for FIPS 140-2 and the  Cryptographic Validation Program provides programmatic  and implementation guidance across all of the referenced  documents. The information provided in the Derived  Test Requirements (DTR) and Implementation Guidance  (IG) documents ensures the repeatability of tests and the  equivalency of results across the testing laboratories. The IG  provides clarity, consistency of interpretation, and insight for  successful conformance testing, validation, and revalidation.  The unique position of the validation programs gives the  CAVP and CMVP the opportunity to acquire insight during  the validation review activities and results in practical, timely,  and up-to-date guidance that is needed by the testing  laboratories and vendors to move their modules out to the  user community in a timely and cost-effective manner and  with the assurance of third-party conformance testing. This  knowledge and insight provide a foundation for current and  future standards and tools development.  The CMVP reviews the cryptographic module validation  requests from the testing laboratories and, as a byproduct  of the review, is attentive to emerging and/or changing  technologies.  Starting with FY 2015, the Security Testing, Validation,  and Measurement (STVM) group created a research team  whose mission is to conduct research to assist developers  of cryptographic modules, testing laboratories, and the  user community when developing new standards. The  insights from this research into the evolution of operating  environments and complex systems allow the CMVP to  perform research and development on evolving test metrics  and methods and future requirements for cryptographic  modules.  The CAVP and the CMVP have stimulated the improved  quality and security assurance of cryptographic algorithm  implementations and modules. By the end of FY 2015, the  CMVP had validated and issued a total of 2,380 crypto- graphic module validation certificates to more than 475  domestic and international vendors.  As shown in Figure 12,  the CMVP awarded 197 certificates in FY 2015. The left portion  of the graphic illustrates the distribution by submission type,  based upon the modification scenarios described in the  CMVP Implementation Guidance, including:  •  1SUB - Modifications made to hardware, software or  firmware components that did not affect any FIPS 140-1  or FIPS 140-2 security relevant items (e.g., a mainte- nance activity);  •  3SUB - Modifications that include changes that affect  some of the FIPS 140-2 security-relevant items and  require revalidation, but drew upon previous submis- sions; and,  •  5SUB - Significant changes to hardware, software, or  firmware components and, therefore, were considered  a new module requiring full validation testing.  The right portion of the diagram shows the number of  certificates awarded, based upon each of the four increasing  levels of security specified in the FIPS that may be satisfied  by a cryptographic module.  Likewise, to date, the CAVP has issued approximately  19,578 validations, representing the algorithm validations of  approximately 17 approved algorithms.

The number of algorithms and modules submitted  for validation continues to grow, representing significant  growth in the number of validations expected to be available  in the future.

The CAVP is responsible for providing  assurance that the cryptographic algorithm implementations  contained in cryptographic modules are implemented  according to the specifications in the standards. The CAVP  accomplishes this by designing and developing conformance  testing specific to each cryptographic algorithm.  The conformance testing consists of a suite of validation  tests for each approved cryptographic algorithm. These  validation tests exercise the algorithmic requirements and  mathematical formulas detailed in the algorithm to assure  that the detailed specifications are implemented correctly  and completely. If the implementer deviates from the  specifications in the standard or excludes any part of these  specifications or requirements, the validation test will detect  the deviations and fail. The validation testing will indicate that  the algorithm implementation does not function properly or  is incomplete.  The cryptographic algorithm validation tests designed  and developed by the CAVP are used by independent third- party laboratories accredited by the NVLAP. The laboratory  works with vendors to validate their cryptographic  algorithm implementations. The suite of validation tests for  each algorithm ensures the repeatability of tests and the  equivalency of results across the testing laboratories.  There are several types of validation tests, all designed  to satisfy the testing requirements of the cryptographic  algorithms and their specifications. These include, but are  not limited to, Known-Answer Tests, Monte Carlo Tests,  and Multi-Block Message Tests. The Known-Answer Tests  are designed to examine the individual components of  the algorithm by supplying known values to the variables  and verifying the expected result. Negative testing is also  performed by supplying known incorrect values to assure  that the implementation recognizes values that are not  allowed. The Monte Carlo Test is designed to exercise the  entire implementation under test (IUT). This test is designed  to detect the presence of implementation flaws that are not  detected with the controlled input of the Known-Answer  Tests. The types of implementation flaws detected by  this validation test include pointer problems, insufficient  allocation of space, improper error handling, and incorrect  behavior of the IUT. The Multi-Block Message Test (MMT)  is designed to test the ability of the implementation to  process multi-block messages, which requires the chaining  of information from one block to the next.  During the last few years, the CTG has expanded its  publications to contain not only the algorithm’s specifica- tions, but also requirements for an algorithm’s use. Many  of these usage requirements do not fall within the scope  of the CAVP, because the CAVP focuses on the correctness  of the instructions within the algorithm’s boundary. If these  additional algorithm usage requirements are not considered  applicable to the algorithm’s implementation, they cannot  be tested at the algorithm level by the CAVP, but may be  tested by the Cryptographic Module Validation Program  (CMVP) if the requirements are considered applicable to  the cryptographic module. However, some of these usage  requirements may be considered to be outside the scope  of both the algorithm implementation and cryptographic  module. In this latter case, the fulfillment of the requirements  is the responsibility of entities using, installing, or configuring  applications or protocols that use the cryptographic  algorithms. For example, depending on the design of a  cryptographic module, it may not be possible for the module  to determine whether a specific key is used for multiple  purposes, a situation that is strongly discouraged.  The CAVP currently has algorithm validation testing for  the following cryptographic algorithms:  TABLE 1:  CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS & NIST TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS (FIPS & SPS)  CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHM/COMPONENT FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING  STANDARD (FIPS) OR SPECIAL PUBLICATION  (SP)  Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES)  SP 800-67, Recommendation for the Triple Data  Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) Block Cipher, and  SP 800-38A, Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of  Operation–Methods and Techniques  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) FIPS 197, Advanced Encryption Standard, and  SP 800-38A, Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of  Operation–Methods and Techniques  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Conformance testing is necessary  because SCAP is a complex collection of eleven individual  specifications that work together to support various use  cases. A single error in product implementation could result  in undetected vulnerabilities or policy noncompliance within  an organization’s networks.

In  general, vendors may opt for product validation for one or  more SCAP capabilities or operating systems. Currently, the  program offers testing on Microsoft Windows and Red Hat  Enterprise Linux platforms. Figure 16 illustrates the SCAP  1.2 Validation Process. The validation process starts when  a vendor voluntarily submits an SCAP-enabled product to  an NVLAP-accredited laboratory. Once the lab completes  product testing, the lab submits a test report to the SCAP  Validation Program at NIST for review. NIST reviews the  test report and awards a validation if all requirements have  been met. Once a validation is awarded, the SCAP Validation  Record is sent to the lab, and the information about the  newly validated product is posted on the SCAP Validated  Products web page.  The SCAP Validation Program resources web page  provides the public with a centralized location for all  resources and information necessary for preparing products  for SCAP 1.2 validation. Resources include: documentation,  a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), the SCAP  validation-test content, and tools for validating and  processing SCAP data streams. The SCAP validation-test  content should be used by vendors for quality assurance  testing prior to entering formal SCAP testing with an  NVLAP-accredited laboratory. The open-source tools that  are available for download may be used by SCAP content  authors for testing SCAP source content. The SCAP Content  Validation Tool (SCAPVal) may be used to determine if the  content conforms to the SCAP specification. Open-source  SCAP reference implementation tools, such as the SCAP  Reference Implementation Tool, may be used to process  SCAP data streams.  End users may use information on the SCAP Validation  web page to learn about SCAP validation and find products  that have been awarded validations. The validation  records that are posted on the SCAP Validated Products  page identify the product versions that were tested in the  laboratory, along with details about each validation, such as  the tested platforms, SCAP capabilities, the validation test  suite version, and the lab that performed the product test.  In FY 2015, five products successfully completed testing  and were awarded validations, bringing the total number  of SCAP 1.2-validated products to twelve. This provides  coverage for 80 percent of the market space. Several  products are in various stages of validation testing and are  expected to be awarded validations in FY 2016. The current  list of SCAP 1.2-validated products may be found on the  SCAP Validated Products list at https://nvd.nist.gov/SCAP- Validated-Tools.  In FY 2016, the SCAP Validation Program plans to  expand the validation test suite, adding new operating  system support and introducing module testing. SCAP  module testing enables the “SCAP Inside” labeling program.  Products using the “SCAP Inside” label have incorporated an  SCAP-validated module; however, the consumer product as  a whole has not completed validation testing by an NVLAP  accredited laboratory. Additions to the SCAP Validation  Program will be defined in NISTIR 7511 Revision 4.

The two PIV  components that come under the scope of NPIVP are the  PIV Smart Card Application and the PIV Middleware. NPIVP  test facilities that perform the two types of tests are the  Cryptographic and Security Testing (CST) Laboratories  that have been accredited by the NVLAP. As of September  2015, there were nine such facilities (see http://csrc.nist.gov/ groups/SNS/piv/npivp/testing_facilities.html).  The interface specifications for the PIV Smart Card  Application and PIV Middleware are found in a FIPS  201-associated document, namely, SP 800-73-4, Interfaces  for Personal Identity Verification. The conformance tests  for these specifications are detailed in SP 800-85A-2, PIV  Card Application and Middleware Interface Test Guidelines.  To implement these tests and to generate conformance test  reports, CSD also developed an integrated toolkit called  “PIV Interface Test Runner,” which conducts tests on both  PIV Card Application and PIV Middleware products, and  provides the toolkit to accredited NPIVP test facilities.

Currently, the NPIVP  team is guiding the development of the “PIV Interface Test  Runner” toolkit for validating PIV Card application and PIV  Middleware products for conformance to the specifications  in SP 800-73-4, SP 800-76-2 and SP 800-78-4.

HSPD-12 called  for the creation of a new identity credential for federal  employees and contractors. FIPS 201 is the technical  specification for both the PIV identity credential and the PIV  system that produces, manages, and uses the credential.  Within NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL),  this work is a collaborative effort of the Information Access  Division (IAD) and CSD. CSD activities in FY 2015 directly  supported the recently revised FIPS 201-2 by updating  the relevant publications associated with FIPS 201-2 and  by developing two new publications. CSD performed the  following activities during FY 2015 in support of HSPD-12:  •  Published SP 800-157, Guidelines for Derived Personal  Identity Verification (PIV) Credentials, in December  2014. SP 800-157 defines the technical details for  implementing and deploying derived PIV credentials  on mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets.  As intended by FIPS 201-2, a derived PIV credential is  a PIV credential that can be provisioned directly to a  mobile device to enable remote enterprise access from  the device. The use of Derived PIV Credentials greatly  improves the usability of electronic authentication from  mobile devices to remote IT resources, while at the  same time maintaining the goals of HSPD-12 for com- mon identification that is secure, reliable, and interop- erable government wide.  •  Organized and hosted a workshop in March 2015 on  upcoming Special Publications supporting FIPS 201-2  (PIV).  The event drew over 160 in-person attendees  and about 75 webcast remote attendees from gov- ernment, industry, and academia representing a wide  range of implementers and professionals in cyberse- curity and physical security. Topics covered included  physical access control with the PIV Card, PIV card- holder interagency record exchange, and derived PIV  credentials.  •  Published SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity  Verification, in June 2015, after two public comment  periods. The three-part SP details the new, optional PIV  Card capabilities introduced in FIPS 201-2, including a  virtual contact interface (VCI), a secure channel proto- col, and an on-card biometric comparison mechanism.  SP 800-73-4 also requires new PIV Cards to enforce a  minimum PIN length of six digits.  •  Published SP 800-78-4, Cryptographic Algorithms and  Key Sizes for Personal Identity Verification, in June  2015, after two public comment periods. The document  has been modified to align with SP 800-73-4, and  Figure 17: Government Employees Use PIV Cards for  Facility Access  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Cryptographic algo- rithm validation testing requirements were also added.  •  Published Draft SP 800-85A-4, PIV Card Application  and Middleware Interface Test Guidelines (SP 800-73-4  Compliance), in June 2015, to align the testing require- ments with FIPS 201-2, SP 800-73-4, and SP 800-78-4.  •  Published NISTIR 7863, Cardholder Authentication for  the PIV Digital Signature Key, in June 2015. The docu- ment provides clarification for the requirement in FIPS  201-2 that a PIV cardholder perform an explicit user  action prior to each use of the digital signature key  stored on the card. NISTIR 7863 clarifies the require- ment for “explicit user action” and specifies a range of  PIN caching options that maintains the goal of “explicit  user action” while adhering to a consistent and reliable  level of security.  •  Published SP 800-79-2, Guidelines for the Authoriza- tion of Personal Identity Verification Card Issuers (PCI)  and Derived PIV Credential Issuers (DPCI), in July 2015.  The document incorporates changes required by FIPS  201-2 to accredit PIV Card Issuers and includes a set of  issuer controls for Derived PIV Credentials Issuers.  In FY 2016, CSD will continue to focus on updating the  relevant publications associated with FIPS 201-2, including SP  800-116, A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials  in Physical Access Control Systems (PACS), and developing  two new publications: SP 800-156, Representation of PIV  Chain-of-Trust for Import and Export, and SP 800-166,  Guidelines for Testing Derived Personal Identity Verification  (PIV) Credentials. CSD will also continue to provide technical  and strategic inputs to the PIV-related initiatives.

CSD tracks software security vulnerabilities (in  the National Vulnerability Database), seeks techniques for  the measurement of security vulnerabilities, and also seeks  techniques to reduce the impact and prevalence of security  vulnerabilities in newly developed products or in new  versions of existing products.  One approach to reducing the number of security  vulnerabilities in software is to improve the development  tools that are available. By identifying languages and  software development tools that support a reduction of  vulnerabilities and, by stimulating the creation of better  tools and tool usage techniques, the approach should help  developers produce applications with fewer vulnerabilities.  While it is impossible to assure the total absence of security  vulnerabilities in this way, it might well be possible to rule  out specific, significant classes of vulnerabilities that today  provide the basis for many serious exploits.  CSD is developing an empirical, competitive approach  to finding the most effective and usable combinations of  tools to produce software systems that are relatively free of  exploitable vulnerabilities. Multiple competitions are planned  that will be based on an idea developed during the Designing  a Secure Systems Engineering Competition Workshop that  was conducted by National Science Foundation in 2010. The  workshop proposed a competition for the development of a  set of tools to help non-security-expert developers to rapidly  build a significant application with zero vulnerabilities, as  detected by an extensive public test suite.  The participants in the planned competitions would  implement software systems to solve challenge problems  using software development tool chains (“toolchains”)  of their own choosing, within specified time periods. The  toolchains may include existing technologies (e.g., existing  software libraries and frameworks, code generators, reusable  source code, or bug-finding tools), novel technologies, or  any combination thereof.  Each competition would apply  a time pressure by simulating a deadline in the software  development process, increasing the likelihood of an  introduction of security flaws. The objective of the toolchains  will be to detect or prevent security flaws while still supporting  a quick-paced software development of applications with  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Through the demonstration of security  flaw avoidance in a time-constrained setting, CSD seeks to  show that wide-scale improvements in the overall security  of software products can be realized without sacrificing  time-to-market.  The competitions, which will be open to  all interested parties, will aim to provide a level playing field  for the application and measurement of the full spectrum  of commercial and research software development,  composition, and reuse techniques.  In FY 2015, CSD and its contractors developed 8  challenge problems for the competition.  A challenge problem  is comprised of three parts: 1) a functional specification of a  program to develop (during the competition), 2) a security  policy that the program must enforce, typically including  confidentiality and integrity requirements, and 3) a challenge- problem-specific test suite including 20 fully-automated  pass/fail functionality tests, 20 fully-automated pass/fail  security tests, and extensive application of random inputs  (i.e., fuzz testing).  The challenge problems span three initial  program types: command-line interface programs, mobile  applications (i.e., cell phone apps), and web applications  (browser-based apps). In FY 2015, CSD and its contractors  also developed a testing infrastructure for the competition  and performed testing to exercise the tools and to assess the  suitability of the challenge problems.  In FY 2016, CSD plans to re-engineer portions of the  testing infrastructure in response to issues uncovered by  testing, to perform a second round of testing, and to publicly  announce the first toolchain competition.

Virtualization  is a foundational technology that facilitates the use of a  computing infrastructure for cloud-computing services. At  the core of a virtualized infrastructure is the virtualized  host that provides an abstraction of the hardware (e.g.,  CPU, memory) and that enables multiple computing stacks  (comprised of the operating system, middleware, and  applications) to be run on a single physical machine, creating  dynamically provisioned, elastic compute resources. The  efficiency of such a dynamic and distributed processing  environment is counter-balanced by the interoperability,  portability, and security challenges inherent in this  computing environment. CSD is working in parallel on several  projects (introduced below) that aim to accelerate the  Federal Government’s adoption of secure cloud computing.  CSD subject matter experts collaborate with national and  international standards setting organizations, and both  the public and private sectors in developing security,  interoperability and portability standards and guidance.  CSD Role in  the NIST Cloud Computing  Program  During FY 2015, the NIST Cloud Computing Team  continued to promote the development of publications,  national and international standards, and specifications in  support of the U.S. Government’s (USG) effective and secure  use of cloud computing, as well as providing technical  guidance to federal agencies for secure and effective cloud- computing adoption. CSD supports many of the technical  standards activities hosted by the NIST Cloud Computing  Program, with a particular focus on cloud-computing  security and forensic science. Activities include the leading  role for the development of the following documents:  •  SP 800-173, Guide for Applying the Risk Manage- ment Framework to Cloud-based Federal Information  Systems (draft). This publication provides guidance  in using the Risk Management Framework described  in SP 800-37 Revision 1 to issue an authorization to  operate for cloud-based information systems. The draft  document will be posted for public comment in the  first quarter of FY 2016.  •  SP 800-174, Security and Privacy Controls for Cloud- based Federal Information Systems (internal draft).  The document will provide a cloud overlay of the SP  800-53 Revision 4 security controls for cloud-based  ecosystems.  •  Define the cloud forensics use cases that address the  top four challenges identified in NISTIR 8006, NIST  Cloud Computing Forensic Science Challenges.  CSD staff members organized the security and forensics  tracks of the eighth NIST Cloud Computing Forum and  Workshop, which was held in July 2015.  In support of U.S. cloud-computing mandates, CSD  staff members provided leadership for several public cloud  working groups operating under the NIST Cloud Computing  Program. These working groups focus on meeting the  high-priority requirements described in SP 500-293, U.S.  Government Cloud Computing Technology Roadmap.  CSD staff chaired or co-chaired several significant cloud  computing efforts in 2015:  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

The working group’s activities were  ceased in mid FY 2015.  CSD staff members participated in various standards  development organizations, all listed in the section of this  report dedicated to international standards.  In FY 2015, CSD members of the NIST cloud-computing  team continued research in key areas of cloud security,  cloud interoperability and portability, cloud metrics, cloud  services, and cloud Service Level Agreements (SLAs). They  also presented the results of cloud-computing research and  development, introduced the standards and specifications  under development, and provided the status of the NIST  Cloud-Computing Program in a variety of domestic and  international conferences and workshops. CSD staff  continues to engage industry and federal agencies for  inputs and collaborative work through working groups,  publications, and networking.

This included the publication of a revised Policy Machine  specification as NISTIR 7987 Revision 1, Policy Machine:  Features, Architecture, and Specification, in September 2015.  NIST and other members of an Ad Hoc INCITS working  group are developing a three-part Policy Machine standard  under the title of Next Generation Access Control (NGAC),  under three sub-projects:  •  Project 2193–D: Next Generation Access Control – Im- plementation Requirements, Protocols and API Defini- tions;  •  Project 2194–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Functional Architecture; and  •  Project 2195–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Generic Operations & Abstract Data Structures.  The Policy Machine’s architecture was the basis for the  NGAC work within INCITS. An initial standard from Project  2194–D was published in 2013 and is now available from the  ANSI e-standards store as INCITS 499, NGAC Functional  Architecture (NGAC–FA). The standard resulting from  Project 2195–D: INCITS 526, NGAC Generic Operations and  Abstract Data Structures (NGAC-GOADS), is in the approval  process and is expected to be published in the fall of 2015.  In FY 2016, CSD plans to issue a new version of its open- source distribution to reflect new features and enhanced  performance, revise INCITS 499, and publish SP 800-178, A  Comparison of Extensible Access Control Markup Language  (XACML) and NGAC Attribute Based Access Control  Standards for Data Services.

The objective of this project is to analyze  various configuration options in the deployment of these  components and to provide guidance in the form of security  recommendations. The project builds upon previous research  that included: (a) the identification of security requirements  for various use cases when a virtualized infrastructure is  offered for cloud services and (b) the analysis of configura- tion options for Secure Hypervisor Deployment and  providing security recommendations.  In FY 2015, the focus of research was the secure  configuration of virtual networks for the protection of VMs.  VM Security forms the primary goal in virtual network  configuration due to the following: (a) VMs are the compute- engines of the virtualized infrastructure on which mission  critical applications of the enterprise run, and (b) VMs are  the end-nodes of the virtual network. Research included the  following configuration areas:  • Network segmentation;  • Network path redundancy;  • Firewall deployment architecture; and  • VM traffic monitoring.  Research included the analysis of the security  advantages and disadvantages of various configuration  options in each of these areas, forming the basis for security  recommendations. The research resulted in the following  publications during FY 2015:  •  The conference paper entitled, Analysis of Network  Segmentation Techniques in Cloud Data Centers; and  •  Draft SP 800-125B, Secure Virtual Network Configura- tion for Virtual Machine (VM) Protection.  Cybersecurity for  Emerging  Technologies  Technology is advancing at an amazing rate, with  rapid technological advances in manufacturing, healthcare,  nanotechnology, cyber physical systems, and the “Internet  of things.” This project scans the environment for  developing technologies that may be currently at risk from a  cybersecurity perspective, or potentially at risk in the future  as the technology improves.  In FY 2015, CSD conducted research on cybersecurity  in the field of additive manufacturing or three-dimensional  (3D) printing. On February 3, 2015, CSD hosted a symposium  on Cybersecurity for Direct Digital Manufacturing, which  involves fabricating physical objects from a data file using  computer-controlled processes with little to no human  intervention, such as in additive manufacturing and 3D  printing. During the symposium, attendees representing  government, industry, and academic organizations discussed  relevant cybersecurity risks, challenges, and solutions, as  well as the implications for information and communications  technology supply-chain risk management. Attendees  identified several opportunities in the area and generally  agreed that the time is right for building cybersecurity into  these technologies. The proceedings of the symposium  were published in April 2015 in NISTIR 8041, Proceedings of  the Cybersecurity for Direct Digital Manufacturing (DDM)  Symposium.  Along the same lines, CSD researched risk management  practices for securing a set of technologies called Replication  Devices (RDs). As a result of this research, CSD published  NISTIR 8023, Risk Management for Replication Devices, in  April 2015 to help organizations protect the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of information processed, stored,  or transmitted on RDs. An RD is any device that reproduces  (e.g., copies, prints, or scans) documents, images, or objects  from an electronic or physical source.  For the purposes  of NISTIR 8023, RDs include copiers, printers, 3D printers,  scanners, and 3D scanners, as well as multifunction  machines when used as a copier, printer, or scanner. RDs in  use within organizations run the gamut in terms of age and  functionality, with some devices being relatively simple and  others quite complex and sophisticated.

Cyber threat  information includes indicators (i.e., artifacts or observable  events that suggest that an attack is imminent, that an  attack is underway, or that a compromise may have already  occurred); information about the tactics, techniques, and  procedures (TTPs) of actors; recommended courses of  action, and other information that is used to characterize  threats. Because threat actors often use the same TTPs  against multiple targets, exchanging cyber threat informa- tion allows organizations to leverage the collective  knowledge, experience, and analysis capabilities of their  peers, thereby increasing the overall awareness and security  of an entire sharing community. Through the exchange of  cyber threat information, organizations can gain a more  complete understanding of their threat environment by  correlating their observations with those of others.  When one organization observes an attack that may  affect or be used against other organizations, information  sharing and coordination can make it possible to reduce the  impact of the attack, speed recovery operations, and maintain  a higher level of operational security. By integrating cyber  threat information sharing into its existing cybersecurity and  risk management practices, an organization can reduce the  likelihood or mitigate the impact of successful cyber attacks,  more effectively protect its systems, detect and anticipate  the actions of threat actors, respond to cyber attacks, and  recover to rapidly deploy effective countermeasures.  In FY 2014, CSD worked with DHS to develop SP 800- 150, Guide to Cyber Threat Information Sharing (Draft),  which provides guidance to organizations seeking to  establish and participate in cyber threat information sharing  communities. The draft publication was released for public  comment on October 28, 2014. The goal of this publication  is to help organizations prepare for an exchange of cyber  threat information, both consuming cyber threat information  from external sources and producing information for other  organizations to use. Because each organization may have  substantially different capabilities for detecting threats,  responding to attacks, diagnosing causes, and handling  sensitive incident-related information, this guidance is  intended to help organizations collaborate and exchange  cyber threat information despite these organizational  differences.  CSD’s cyber threat information sharing initiative is  focused on providing guidance on how an organization can  establish information sharing and coordination capabilities  that enhance or augment their existing cybersecurity  practices. The guidance covers threat-informed detection,  protection and response capabilities; data privacy and  sensitivity; data collection and retention practices; the use of  open standards for information exchange; de-identification  and anonymization; and guidance on how an organization  can establish, participate in, and maintain coordination and  information sharing relationships. The guidance will help  incident responders, network defenders, and operations  personnel consider what information is sharable, the  circumstances under which sharing is permitted, with whom  the information may be shared, and how the information  should be protected.  In early FY 2016, CSD plans to release the second draft  to Draft SP 800-150, based on the input received during the  public comment period of the first draft, which was released  October 2014.

Recommendations have included the usage of passwords in  enterprises, biometrics, and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)  solutions. In FY 2015, CSD researched the classification of  general authentication features. This investigation was  prompted by the general call to move away from passwords  towards the growing number of alternative authentication  methods (e.g. biometrics, smart cards, etc.). In the early part  of this investigation, it became clear that an ontology of  authentication was needed.  A draft taxonomy (see Figure 19) was developed  to better describe current and emerging authentication  mechanisms. This taxonomy covers a wide assortment  of commonly used methods to cover human-machine,  machine-machine, and attribute attestation. It does not  address identity management - which typically happens  before authentication occurs, or access control - which  typically happens after.  As a result of this research, several patterns and gaps  were identified. For example, there are similar technologies  used to support the various mechanisms. One of the greatest  challenges is in defining a set of common metrics to assess  authentication technologies. Two areas identified as needing  metrics include authentication strength and the suitability of  the method to the environment. The strength measurements  should include security and usability. This provides a way  to monitor a common complaint of designers – usability  being a tradeoff to security. However, security and usability  is not sufficient to address the suitability of implementing  a particular authentication mechanism in a particular  environment. By adding in measures for deployability and  manageability it should be possible to address the suitability  of an authentication mechanism.

As shown in Figure 20 (previous page),  this framework will support integration of security with  deployability, usability and manageability of authentication.  This work will also be used to better identify the needs  and dependencies for proper interaction with identity  management and access control processes.

Although these mobile devices are relatively  small and inexpensive, they can be used for voice calls,  simple text messages, sending and receiving emails,  browsing the web, online banking and e-commerce, social  networking, and many functions once limited to laptop  and desktop computers. Smart phones and tablet devices  have specialized built-in hardware, such as cameras,  accelerometers, Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers,  and removable media readers. They also employ a wide range  of wireless interfaces, including infrared, Wireless Fidelity  (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, Near Field Communications (NFC), and  one or more types of cellular interfaces that provide network  connectivity across the globe.  Smart phones present new capabilities, but also a  number of new security and privacy challenges. One such  challenge concerns securing smartphone applications. To  address this issue, NIST is conducting research in software- assurance methodologies for smart phone applications (or  “apps”) and is working with other government agencies and  industry to bridge the security gaps present with today’s  smart phones. For example, NIST developed the AppVet  mobile app-vetting system and framework for managing  an organization’s app-vetting process with respect to the  organization’s security and privacy policies. This system was  used by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  (DARPA) to vet apps prior to being deployed on thousands of  mobile devices for use in Afghanistan, the 2013 Presidential  Inauguration, and the 2014 Boston Marathon.  NIST’s work in mobile security has earned the 2014  Government Computer News (GCN) award for Information  Technology Excellence and the 2013 U.S. Department of  Commerce Gold Medal Award. In FY 2016, NIST will be  transitioning AppVet to the Department of Homeland  Security as part of their Carwash program, which provides  government development teams with a continuous  integration build, testing, source code management, and  issue tracking system.

The primary  motivations for the development of IPv6 were to increase  the number of unique IP addresses available for use and to  handle the needs of new Internet applications and devices.  In addition, IPv6 was designed with the following goals:  increased ease of network management and configuration,  expandable IP headers, improved mobility and security, and  the quality of service controls. IPv6 has been, and continues  to be, developed and defined by the IETF.  FY 2012 was a significant year for the deployment  of IPv6 in the United States Government (USG). OMB’s  Memo of September 10, 2010, Transition to IPv6, required  all government agencies to “upgrade public/external facing  servers and services (e.g., web, email, Domain Name System  (DNS), and Internet Service Provider (ISP) services) to  operationally use IPv6 by the end of FY 2012.” NIST worked  with the U.S. Government IPv6 (USGv6) Task Force and with  individual government agencies to achieve this goal. NIST  developed an online monitor to demonstrate which high- level government domains have met this goal with respect  to Domain Name System (DNS) services, email, web servers,  and Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC).  In FY 2013, NIST and OMB continued to use this monitor to  measure USGv6 compliance with OMB’s requirement.

Agencies were required to “upgrade internal  client applications that communicate with public Internet  servers and supporting enterprise networks to operationally  use IPv6 by the end of FY 2014.” NIST developed online  diagnostic tools to help agencies verify compliance to this  requirement.  The NIST IPv6 Test Program, whose goal is to provide  assurance on IPv6 product conformance and interoperability,  continues to operate. In FY 2015, NIST continued to manage  and evolve the USGv6 Test Program and to help federal  agencies fulfill OMB mandates and monitor compliance to  those mandates. In FY 2016, NIST is planning to update SP  500-267, A Profile for IPv6 in the U.S. Government, Version  1.0. This document is the basis for the USGv6 Test Program  and for USG IPv6-compliant device evaluation and purchase.  The NIST program is a collaboration between CSD and the  ITL Advanced Networking Technology Division.

Practical and conceptual guidance for  these topics is needed.  In FY 2015, the following research was accomplished for  this project:  •  Enhanced the unified enforcement mechanism of data  services for use by a Policy Machine (PM) for an enter- prise computing environment;  •  Enhanced the capabilities of the Access Control Policy  Tool (ACPT);  •  Enhanced the capabilities of the Access Control Rule  Logic Circuit Simulation (ACRLC) tool;  •  Studied an Attribute Assurance mechanism for access  authentication and authorization;  •  •  Published a conference paper for Big Data Processing  access control and distributed systems; and  •  Studied efficient test case generation methods for  Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) policy testing.  In FY 2016, CSD will continue the above research. CSD  expects that this project will:  •  Promote (or accelerate) the adoption of community  computing that utilizes the power of shared resources  and common trust-management schemes;  •  Provide guidance for implementing access control  models and mechanisms for standalone or network  systems;  •  Increase the security and safety of static (connected)  distributed systems by applying the testing and verifi- cation tool for the AC policies;  •  Assist system architects, security administrators, and  security managers whose expertise is related to access  control or privilege policy in managing their systems  and in learning the limitations and practical approaches  for their applications; and  •  Provide accurate and efficient fault detection and  correction technology for implementing AC rules and  policies.

Faulty policies,  misconfigurations, or flaws in software implementation can  result in serious vulnerabilities. The specification of access  control policies is often a challenging problem. Often, a  system’s privacy and security are compromised due to the  misconfiguration of access control policies, instead of the  failure of cryptographic primitives or protocols. This problem  becomes increasingly severe as software systems become  more and more complex, and are deployed to manage a large  amount of sensitive information and resources organized  into sophisticated structures. Identifying discrepancies  between policy specifications and their properties (their  intended function) is crucial because correct implementation  and enforcement of policies by applications is based on the  premise that the policy specifications are correct. As a result,  policy specifications must undergo rigorous verification and  validation through systematic testing to ensure that the  policy specifications truly encapsulate the desires of the  policy authors.  To formally and precisely capture the security properties  that AC should adhere to, access control models are usually  written to bridge the rather wide gap in abstraction between  policy and mechanism. Thus, an access-control model  provides unambiguous and precise expression, as well as  a reference for the design and implementation of security  requirements. Techniques are required for verifying whether  an access-control model is correctly expressed in the access- control policies, and whether the properties are satisfied in  the model.  Most research on AC model or policy verification  techniques is focused on one particular model, and almost  all of the research is in applied methods, which require the  completed AC policies as the input for verification or test  processes to generate fault reports. Even though correct  verification is achieved, and counter-examples may be  generated when faults were found, those methods provide  no information about the source of faults that might allow  conflicts in privilege assignment, the leakage of privileges, or  conflict of interest permissions. The difficulty in finding the  source of faults is increased, especially when the AC rules  are intricately covering duplicated variables to a degree of  complexity. The complexity is due to the fact that a fault  might not be caused by one particular rule. Thus, it requires  manually analyzing each rule in the policy in order to find the  correct solution for the fault.  To address the issue, CSD developed the Access Control  Property Tool (ACPT), shown in Figure 22 (next page),  which allows a user to compose, verify, test, and generate  access control policies. CSD also researched the AC Rule  Logic Circuit Simulation (ACRLCS) technique, which enables  the AC authors to detect a fault when the fault-causing AC  rule is added to the policy, so the fix can be implemented in  real time before adding other rules that further complicate  the detecting effort, rather than checking by retracing the  interrelations between rules after the policy is completed.  In FY 2015, CSD accomplished the following:  •  Published a conference paper for policy tool evaluation  and analysis: Evaluating and Capability and Perfor- mance of Access Control Policy Verification Tools;  •  Developed verification oracles for policy test bench- marking, which embed policy faults for committee,  university, hospital, and bank policy test scenarios;  •  Developed a Small Business Innovation Research  (SBIR) solicitation for access control tool development;  •  Enhanced the ACRLCS − the Access Control Rule Logic  Circuit Simulation System;  •  Published a conference paper for policy test case gen- eration: Pseudo-exhaustive Testing of Attribute-Based  Access Control Rules;  •  Worked with industrial and academic organizations in  exploring new capabilities that helped to improve the  usability of the AC tools (ACPT and ACRLCS), resulting  in additional usage; ACPT was downloaded by 343  users and organizations; and,  •  Enhanced the capability of ACPT by improving policy  combination algorithms and adding test oracles for  basic access control models.  In FY 2016, CSD is planning to conduct further research  on the new capabilities and enhance the performance of the  ACPT and ACRLCS.  Figure 22 (next page) shows the system architecture  of the NIST access control policy tool: ACPT, which allows  access control policy authors to compose, verify, and test  access control policy implementation.  This project is expected to:  •  Provide a generic paradigm and framework of access  control model/property conformance testing;  •  Provide templates for specifying access control rules  in popular access control models, such as the Attribute  Based, Multilevel, and Workflow models;  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

ABAC  represents a point on the spectrum of logical access control,  from simple access control lists to more capable role-based  access (RBAC), and finally, to a highly flexible method for  providing access based on the evaluation of attributes.

The research also includes  technologies such as attribute assurance, attribute  engineering/management, identity system integration,  attribute federation, situational awareness (real-time or  contextual) mechanisms, policy management, and natural- language policy translation to digital policy. Figure 23  illustrates the interaction of many of these components. The  goal of this research is to improve information sharing, while  maintaining control of that information for federal agencies.  In FY 2015, CSD published two ABAC papers: Attribute- Based Access Control for IEEE Computing magazine, and  Implementing and Managing Policy Rules in Attribute- Based Access Control for IEEE International Conference on  Information Reuse and Integration. CSD also wrote a draft  Special Publication document for ABAC formal models  research: A Comparison of XACML and NGAC Attribute  Based Access Control Standards, which compares the  characteristics of two ABAC implementation mechanisms:  XACML and NGAC. CSD continued research on the Attribute  Assurance of ABAC in partnership with the National  Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), and  the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE).  CSD developed a draft Special Publication based on the  mechanism for defining the veracity, security, and readiness  levels of assurance of ABAC attributes.  In FY 2016, CSD will continue the research of ABAC  formal models, as well as details and extended topics of  ABAC capabilities, such as attribute assurance, ABAC  implementation examples, ABAC mechanisms, and ABAC  standards. The ABAC project will pursue the following  objectives:  •  Provide readers with the terminology and a basic un- derstanding of ABAC;  •  Provide readers with an overview of the current state  of logical access control, a working definition of ABAC,  and an explanation of the core and enterprise ABAC  concepts;  Figure 23: ABAC Access Control Mechanism Chart  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

These IT environments are under  constant threat of attack and are frequently undergoing  change, with new and updated software being deployed  along with updated configurations. The wide variety of  computing products, the dynamic nature of software, the  speed of configuration change, and the diversity of threats  require organizations to maintain situational awareness  over their IT assets and to utilize this information to make  informed risk-based decisions.  Security automation utilizes standardized data formats  and transport protocols to enable data to be exchanged  between business, operational, and security systems that  support security processes by:  •  Identifying IT assets, including hardware, software, and  data;  •  Providing awareness over the operational state of com- puting devices;  •  Enabling security reference data to be collected from  internal and external sources; and  •  Supporting analysis processes that measure the effec- tiveness of security controls and provide visibility into  security risks, enabling risk-based decision-making.  Commercial solutions built using security automation  specifications enable the collection and harmonization of  vast amounts of operational and security data into coherent,  comparable information streams to achieve situational  awareness that allows the timely and active management of  diverse IT systems. Through the creation of reference data  and guidance, and the international recognition of flexible,  open standards, the NIST security automation program  works to improve the interoperability, broad acceptance, and  adoption of security automation solutions to address current  and future security challenges, creating opportunities for  innovation.  Specif ication,  Standards,  and Guidance  Development  To support the overarching security automation vision, it  is necessary to have specifications that describe the required  interactions between systems, standards that document  international consensus approaches, and guidance that  informs product developers and implementers. Through  close work with partners in government, industry, and  academia, CSD continues to facilitate the definition and  development of security automation approaches that enable  organizations to understand and manage IT security risks.  During FY 2015, CSD has continued to work to build on  previous security automation work by:  •  Identifying and addressing gaps in the current specifi- cations;  •  Evolving existing approaches to achieve greater scal- ability and impact;  •  Participating in working groups in standards develop- ment organizations to promote international consensus  around standardized approaches;  •  Providing additional guidance on architectural, design,  and analysis concerns; and  •  Developing and maintaining tools and reference imple- mentations.

This area of work is focused on evolving security automation  specifications to integrate with existing transport protocols  to provide for the secure, interoperable exchange of security  automation data. Additional work is focused on evolving  security metrics and providing consensus guidance on  security automation approaches. Through the definition and  adoption of security automation standards and guidelines,  IT vendors will be able to provide standardized security  solutions to their customers. These solutions support  continuous monitoring and automated, dynamic network  defense capabilities, based on the analysis of data from  operational and security data sources and the collective  action of security components.  Security automation standardization work has been  focused in three areas: the evolution and international  adoption of the Security Content Automation Protocol  (SCAP), the development of software asset management  standards to support operational and cybersecurity  use cases, and the development of security automation  consensus standards. The following sections detail this work.  Security Content  Automation Protocol  (SCAP)  SCAP is a multipurpose protocol that provides an  automated means to collect and assess the state of devices.  SCAP supports automated vulnerability checking, verifying  the installation of patches, checking security configuration  settings, verifying technical-control compliance, measuring  security, and examining systems for indicators of a  compromise. SCAP uses the Extensible Markup Language  (XML) to standardize the format and nomenclature by which  security software products communicate information about  software flaws, security configurations, and other aspects of  the device state. SCAP enables security automation content,  also known as “SCAP content,” to be expressed using  standardized formats, identifiers, and scoring models. This  content can be used by any tool that is conformant to the  specifications to collect and evaluate the state of software  installed on a device.  SCAP has been widely adopted by major software  and hardware manufacturers and has become a significant  component of information-security-management and  governance programs. SCAP-enabled tools are currently  being used by the U.S. Government, critical-infrastructure  companies, academia, and other businesses, both  domestically and internationally. Currently, CSD is leveraging  SCAP in multiple areas, both to support its own mission  and to enable other agencies and private-sector entities  to meet their goals. For CSD, SCAP is a critical component  of the SCAP Validation Program, the National Vulnerability  Database (NVD), and the National Checklist Program (NCP).  In September 2012, CSD published SP 800-126 Rev. 2,  The Technical Specification for the Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2. That  document describes the 11 component specifications  composing SCAP. See Table 2 (next page): SCAP 1.2  Specifications for details.  Since the release of SCAP 1.2, CSD has worked to  improve guidance around the use of SCAP specifications. In  FY 2015, CSD released draft NISTIR 8058, Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP) Version 1.2 Content Style  Guide: Best Practices for Creating and Maintaining SCAP  1.2 Content, which provides guidance for SCAP 1.2 content  creators to ensure that stylistic variations in SCAP 1.2  content are addressed in a way that improves the accuracy  and consistency of results, avoids performance problems,  reduces user effort, lowers content maintenance burdens,  and enables content reuse. To achieve this, the report  documents best practices for content creation and  encourages their use by SCAP content authors and  maintainers. Feedback on this report is welcomed and will  help CSD to work towards producing a final version of this  document.  CSD is starting to work on an SCAP 1.3 revision. In  August 2015, CSD requested comments on the design  and development of SCAP 1.3. Specific areas of requested  feedback included:  •  Adopting the Open Vulnerability and Assessment Lan- guage (OVAL) 5.11.1, which was released in April 2015;  •  Adopting the Common Vulnerability Scoring System  (CVSS) v3, which was released in June 2015;  •  Removing support for CVSS v2; and  •  Deprecating support for older specification revisions  and SCAP 1.0.  The received feedback generally favored the adoption  of OVAL 5.11.1 and CVSS v3. Continued support for CVSS v2,  in addition to v3, and some reduction in the minimal support  for older specification revisions were also common themes  in the feedback. CSD is currently considering this feedback  while working on a draft revision of SP 800-126 for public  comment in FY 2016.

An updated revision of this standard, ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015,  was published on October 1, 2015. The software identification  (SWID) data model defined by this standard describes an  XML format for software publishers to provide authoritative  identification, categorization, software relationships  (e.g., dependency, bundling, and patch), executable and  library footprint details, and other metadata for software.  This information can be used to support operational  and cybersecurity use cases around managing software  deployments, managing software licenses, managing  software vulnerabilities and related software patches, and  assessing secure software configurations.  To supplement the requirements in ISO/IEC 19770- 2:2015, CSD has been working with DHS and NSA on the  development of NISTIR 8060, Guidelines for the Creation  of Interoperable Software Identification (SWID) Tags.  NISTIR 8060 provides an overview of the capabilities and  usage of software identification (SWID) tags as part of a  comprehensive software lifecycle. This report introduces  SWID tags in an operational context, provides guidelines for  the creation of interoperable SWID tags, and highlights key  usage scenarios for which SWID tags are applicable. Figure  24 illustrates how SWID tags support multiple elements  of the software product life cycle, including deployment,  installation, patching, upgrading and removal. CSD has  released three public discussion drafts of these guidelines.  A final public draft will be released in FY 2016, along with a  subsequent final release of the report.  Additionally, NIST has worked with the TCG to integrate  SWID tags into the Trusted Network Communications (TNC)  protocol, through the SCAP Messages for IF-M specification  that will be discussed below.  The information provided within SWID tags enhances  the SCAP use cases by providing authoritative information  that can be used to create Common Platform Enumeration  (CPE) names, to support the targeting of checklists, and to  associate software flaws to products, based on a defect in  a software library or executable. CSD will be working on a  number of reports in FY 2016 that provide further guidance  for using SWID tags to address these use cases.  Development of  Security Automation  Consensus Standards  CSD has been promoting the broad international  adoption of SCAP by encouraging the integration of SCAP  into other standards, and by adapting SCAP to address  specific gaps and challenges. CSD has continued its  collaboration with industry partners in the IETF Security  Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM) working  group. This working group provides a venue for advancing  appropriate SCAP specifications into international standards  and addressing identified gap areas. The current scope of  work for SACM includes identifying and/or defining the  transport protocols and data formats needed to support  Figure 24: SWID Tags Support the Software Product Lifecycle  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

The first such publication is the TNC SCAP  Messages for IF-M specification that supports carrying SCAP  content and results over the TNC protocols. The second is  the TNC Enterprise Compliance Profile (ECP) and related  specifications that support the exchange of SWID data  over the TNC protocols. The ECP enables the collection of  SWID data from a device for use by external tools to provide  software inventory information. SCAP and SWID data  collected using these mechanisms may be optionally used  for network access-control decision making, allowing the  device state to be evaluated when devices connect and on  an ongoing basis thereafter.  For more information on these specifications,  please visit: http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/ resources/tnc_scap_messages_for_ifm, and http://www. trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_endpoint_ compliance_profile_specification.  Finally, CSD has worked with the FIRST by participating  in two Special Interest Groups (SIGs). The CVSS SIG (CVSS- SIG) is focused on maintaining and improving the CVSS  scoring model, based on community feedback. The CVSS- SIG published CVSS Revision 3 (CVSS v3) in June 2015. The  second SIG, the Vulnerability Reporting and Data eXchange  SIG (VRDX-SIG), researches and recommends methods for  identifying and exchanging vulnerability information across  disparate vulnerability databases.  For more information, please visit: http://www.first.org/ global/sigs.  Through work with international standards-developing  organizations (SDOs), SCAP and related security automation  capabilities are expected to evolve and expand in support of  the growing need to define and measure effective security  controls, assess and monitor ongoing aspects of information  security, remediate noncompliance, and successfully  manage systems in accordance with the Risk Management  Framework described in SP 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for  Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal  Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach.  Standards that are developed and published by these SDOs  will be considered for inclusion in future revisions of SCAP.

Over the past twelve months, the SACM  working group has been working on identifying use cases,  requirements, and architectural models to inform decisions  about existing specifications and standards that can be  referenced, required modifications or extensions to existing  specifications and standards, and any gaps that need to  be addressed. CSD is working with DHS, the Center for  Internet Security (CIS), and the TCG to bring existing work  into the IETF SACM working group to include OVAL and  specifications related to the TNC protocol.  In FY 2015, the SACM use cases were published by the  IETF as Request for Comments (RFC) 7632.

SCAP and the programs  that leverage it are moving the information assurance  industry towards being able to standardize communications,  and towards the collection and storage of relevant data in  standardized formats, as well as providing automated  means for the assessment and remediation of systems for  both vulnerabilities and configuration compliance.  National  Vulnerabi l i ty  Database (NVD) Security automation reference data is currently  housed within the NVD. The NVD is the U.S. Government  repository of security automation data based on security  automation specifications. This data provides a standards- based foundation for the automation of software asset,  vulnerability, and security configuration management;  security measurement; and compliance activities. This data  supports security automation efforts based on the SCAP. The  NVD includes databases of security configuration checklists  for the NCP, listings of publicly known software flaws,  product names, and impact metrics. A formal validation  program tests the ability of vendor products to use some  forms of security automation data, based on a product’s  conformance in support of specific enterprise capabilities.  SCAP defines the structure of standardized software  flaws and security configuration reference data, also known  as SCAP content. This reference data is provided by the NVD  (http://nvd.nist.gov/).  As of October 2015, the NVD contained the following  resources:  •  Over 72,000 vulnerability advisories, with an average  of 40 new vulnerabilities added daily;  •  82 SCAP-expressed checklists containing thousands  of low-level security configuration checks that can be  used by SCAP-validated security products to perform  automated evaluations of the system state;  •  248 non-SCAP security checklists (e.g., English prose  guidance and configuration scripts);  •  249 U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US- CERT) alerts; 4,402 US-CERT vulnerability summaries;  and 10,286 SCAP machine-readable software flaw  checks, and;  •  A product dictionary with over 106,000 operating sys- tem, application, and hardware name entries; and over  58,000 vulnerability advisories translated into Spanish.  NVD is hosted and maintained by NIST and is sponsored  by the Department of Homeland Security’s US-CERT.  The use of SCAP data by commercial security products,  deployed in thousands of organizations worldwide, has  extended NVD’s effective reach. Increasing demand for NVD  XML data feeds (i.e., mechanisms that provide updated data  from data sources) and SCAP-expressed content from the  NVD website demonstrates an increased adoption of SCAP.  The NVD continues to play a pivotal role in the Payment  Card Industry (PCI) efforts to mitigate vulnerabilities in credit  card systems. PCI mandates the use of NVD vulnerability  severity scores in measuring the risk to payment card  servers worldwide and for prioritizing vulnerability patching.  PCI’s use of NVD severity scores helps enhance credit card  transaction security and protects consumers’ personal  information.  For More Information, See:  https://nvd.nist.gov  CONTACTS: Mr. Harold Booth  Mr. Robert Byers  (301) 975-8441  (301) 975-3279  harold.booth@nist.gov  robert.byers@nist.gov  National  Checkl ist  Program (NCP) There are many threats to information technology (IT),  ranging from remotely launched network service exploits to  malicious code spread through infected emails, websites,  and downloaded files. Vulnerabilities in IT products are  discovered daily, and many ready-to-use exploitation  techniques are widely available on the Internet. Because IT  products are often intended for a wide variety of audiences,  restrictive security configuration controls are usually not  enabled by default. As a result, many out-of-the box IT  products are immediately vulnerable. In addition, identifying  a reasonable set of security settings that achieve balanced  risk management is a complicated, arduous, and time- consuming task, even for experienced system administrators.  To facilitate the development of security configuration  checklists for IT products and to make checklists more  organized and usable, CSD established the National  Check-list Program (NCP) in furtherance of its statutory  responsibilities under the Federal Information Security  Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347, and  also under the Cybersecurity Research and Development Act,  which mandates that NIST “develop, and revise as necessary,  a checklist setting forth settings and option selections that  minimize the security risks associated with each computer  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Paragraph (d) of section 39.101 states,  “In acquiring information technology, agencies shall include  the appropriate IT security policies and requirements,  including use of common security configurations available  from the NIST website at http://checklists.nist.gov. Agency  contracting officers should consult with the requiring official  to ensure the appropriate standards are incorporated.”  In Memorandum M-08-22, OMB mandated the use of  SCAP-validated products for the continuous monitoring of  Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) compliance.  The NCP strives to encourage and assist federal agencies  with these mandates.  The goals of the NCP are to:  •  Facilitate the development and sharing of checklists by  providing a formal framework for checklist developers  to submit checklists to NIST;  •  Provide guidance to developers to help them create  standardized, high-quality checklists that conform to  common operation environments;  •  Help developers and users by providing guidelines for  making checklists better documented and more usable;  •  Encourage software vendors and other parties to de- velop checklists;  •  Provide a managed process for the review, update, and  maintenance of checklists;  •  Provide an easy-to-use repository of checklists; and  •  Encourage the use of automation technologies (e.g.,  SCAP) for checklist application.  NCP added 100 new checklists in FY 2015, bringing the  number of checklists posted on the website to 353 (see  http://checklists.nist.gov). Of that total, 153 of the checklists,  addressing 86 platforms, are SCAP-expressed and can be  used with SCAP-validated products. This represents a 45  % increase in the number of SCAP-expressed checklists  when compared to FY 2014, demonstrating continual use  and adoption of this automated means of expressing and  consuming checklist content.  Organizations can use checklists obtained from the  NCP website for automated security configuration patch  assessment. The NCP currently hosts SCAP checklists for  Internet Explorer 9.0, Internet Explorer 10.0, Office 2010,  Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows  Server 2012, and other products.  To assist users in identifying automated checklist content,  NCP groups these checklists into tiers, from Tier I to Tier IV.  The NCP uses the tiers to rank checklists according to their  automation capability. Tier III and IV checklists include fully  vetted SCAP content that has successfully demonstrated  conformance to the requirements outlined in SP 800-126.  Tier III & IV checklists are considered production-ready and  are intended for use with SCAP-validated products.  Tier II checklists document recommended security  settings in a machine-readable, nonstandard format, such  as a proprietary format or a product-specific configuration  script. Tier I checklists are prose-based and contain no  machine-readable content. Users can browse the checklists,  based on the checklist tier, IT product, IT product category,  or authority, and through a keyword search that searches the  checklist name and summary for user specified terms. The  search results show the detailed checklist metadata and a  link to any SCAP content for the checklist, as well as links to  any supporting resources associated with the checklist.  To assist checklist developers, the NCP provides both  manual and automated interfaces to facilitate the submission  and maintenance processes. The manual interface consists  of a web application that guides the submitter through  the data entry process to ensure that all of the required  information is submitted. The submission is validated  upon review, and a report is returned to the submitting  organization, verifying either acceptance or rejection, based  on the criteria requirements. For instance, Tier III and Tier  IV checklists require validation using the SCAP Content  Validation Tool (this tool is available for download via  http://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.2/#tools).  The NCP is defined in SP 800-70 Revision 3, National  Checklist Program for IT Products—Guidelines for Checklist  Users and Developers, which can be found at http://csrc.nist. gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.

The purpose of the USGCB  program is to help improve information security and reduce  overall IT operating costs by providing commonly accepted  and agreed upon security configurations for major operating  systems and applications.  Through the NCP described in SP 800-70 Revision 3,  a baseline submitter may express interest in submitting a  candidate for use in the USGCB program.  CSD provides ongoing support for the USGCB  automation content, including periodic updates to the  existing content, encouraging vendors to submit candidates,  assisting USGCB users in continuously monitoring and  assessing security compliance of information systems  within their environment. This ongoing monitoring element  supports the Risk Management Framework described in  SP 800-37 Revision 1. It also supports the Core functions  of the Cybersecurity Framework, providing USGCB users  with settings that protect digital assets and supports the  detection of suspicious activity.  During FY 2016, the USGCB program will continue to  provide ongoing maintenance of the baseline artifacts and  to consider additional applicable platforms as authored  and submitted by the platform vendors, as well as other  organizations that wish to contribute candidate content.

The configurations are based on a collection of resources,  including the existing NIST OS X configuration guidance,  the OS X security configuration guide, the Department of  Defense (DOD) OS X Recommended Settings, and the  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) OS X Security  Technical Implementation Guide (STIG). The project team  aggregated 400 initial settings, determined which settings  to include in the configuration baseline, and determined  appropriate values for each included setting. The desired  configuration items have been established, and the team is  continuing to develop shell scripts that apply the settings  to an OS X 10.10 system. The settings are organized into  three key baselines, which are appropriate for different  environments:  •  The Enterprise baseline is appropriate for centrally  managed, networked systems;  •  The Small Office Home Office baseline, sometimes  called Standalone, describes small, informal computer  installations that are used for home or business pur- poses; and  •  The Specialized Security-Limited Functionality baseline  is appropriate for systems where security requirements  are more stringent and where the implementation of  security safeguards is likely to reduce functionality.  SCAP, defined and discussed in an earlier section of this  report, will be used to express configuration settings and  check system configuration compliance.  During FY 2013, CSD provided a block of initial settings  to Apple and these settings were posted for the Apple  community on a periodic basis for public review, discussion,  correction and agreement. Each setting has a designated  Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) number, which  aids in the long-term tracking of the setting. Ultimately, the  settings will be tested and included in the configuration  baselines. In addition, CSD started the production of a draft  guideline, Guide to Securing Apple OS X 10.8 Systems for  IT Professionals. This guidance, which is similar in structure  to the SP 800-68, Windows XP Security Guide, focuses on  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

During FY 2014, a majority of all proposed settings were  scripted. The corresponding spreadsheet batches have been  sent to Apple for feedback; approximately 230 settings are  now completed. Settings have also been implemented on OS  X 10.9, when possible. Work on the draft guideline, Guide to  Securing Apple OS X 10.8 Systems for IT Professionals, was  temporarily suspended while configuration setting research  was performed, but was resumed in FY 2015.  In FY 2015, CSD focused on the OS X 10.10 operating  system for security testing. CSD finalized and tested the  entire security configuration of 230 settings for OS X 10.10  and has continued updating the draft publication that was  started for OS X 10.8 and has now been focused on OS X  10.10.  For several months, one of the script’s three profiles  was deployed on select CSD systems for extensive testing.  So far, results have been positive.  In FY 2016, CSD plans to release the draft publication,  Guide to Securing Apple OS X 10.10 Systems for IT  Professionals, for at least one public comment period, and  plans to release a final version after incorporating changes  from the comment period(s). CSD will continue to refine the  script and add more settings to the configuration.

Vulnerabilities are regularly discovered in software  applications that are exploited to stage cyber attacks.  System administrators need objective metrics to guide and  justify decision making as they manage the security risk  of enterprise networks. The objective of this research is to  develop a standard model for the security risk analysis of  computer networks. A standard model will enable NIST to  answer questions such as “Are we more secure now than  yesterday?” or “How does the security of one network  configuration compare with another one?” Also, having a  standard model to measure network security will allow users,  vendors, and researchers to evaluate methodologies and  products for network security in a coherent and consistent  manner.  CSD has approached the challenge of network security  analysis by capturing vulnerability interdependencies  and measuring security, based on how real attackers have  penetrated networks. CSD’s methodology for security risk  analysis is based on attack graphs. CSD analyzes attack  paths through a network, providing a probabilistic metric of  the overall system risk. Through this metric, CSD analyzes  trade-offs between security costs and security benefits.  Computer systems are vulnerable to both known and  zero-day attacks. Enterprises have begun to move parts  of their networks from a traditional infrastructure into  cloud computing environments. Cloud providers can offer  virtual servers that can be rented on demand by users. This  paradigm enables cloud customers to acquire computing  resources with high efficiency, low cost and great flexibility.  However, it also introduces many security problems that  need to be solved.  In FY 2015, CSD attempted to model the problem of  cloud security using a cloud-level attack graph. An attacker  can create stealthy bridges (i.e., a covert connection  between disparate networks that should be isolated) in a  cloud environment. These stealthy bridges can be created  using zero day vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by  vulnerability scanners. The stealthy bridges can be used to  construct a multi-step attack path and facilitate a subsequent  intrusion process across enterprise islands in a cloud. CSD  has developed a new technique to detect potential attacks  in a Cloud using a probabilistic attack graph model.

In FY 2016, CSD plans to develop new techniques and  metrics to detect attacks on Cloud Computing and for  network forensics analysis using Bayesian Networks. CSD  also plans to publish the results as a NIST report and as white  papers in conferences and journals.

Most of the  work leverages graph theory (the math of dots and lines)  and algorithmic complexity analysis (the math around fast  computation). In performing this work, the AIM project  seeks to enhance the nation’s ability to defend itself from  network-borne attacks.  This scientific research is conducted in partnership  with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), the University  of Maryland, and the Center for Applied Internet Data  Analysis. ARL’s participation helps focus the work on  solving immediate critical problems facing U.S. Government  networks. However, research solutions are made publicly  available and are designed to be generally applicable to as  many environments as possible.  In FY 2015, the AIM project completed research in  several areas: measurements of Internet resilience of  colluding country attacks, the optimal placement of  defensive resources in Internet Protocol (IP) v6 networks,  and circumvention-resistant network scan detection. More  specifically, the project team accomplished the following:  •  The team analyzed the resilience of the Internet with  respect to countries colluding in using their influence  over the Internet infrastructure to disconnect two  countries, isolate a set of countries from the Internet, or  break the Internet up into non-communicating clusters  (the research was published in the International Journal  of Computer Science: Theory and Applications, as well  as in the proceedings of the Workshop for the Security  of Emerging Network Technologies).  •  The research team showed how to leverage Internet  Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) network migrations to en- hance security capabilities. This was done through an  evaluation of how to optimize the placement of defen- sive resources in specially secured IPv6 networks. The  optimal placements best limit the movement of internal  attackers to a small set of hosts or else force them to  penetrate through the special security boundaries (the  research was published in the journal Data and Appli- cations Security and Privacy).  •  In previous work, the team discovered a critical weak- ness in the most widely cited Threshold Random Walk  (TRW) network scan detection algorithm that enabled  a full circumvention by attackers. To mitigate the prob- lem, we invented a scan detection methodology that  will detect TRW circumvention activity and that also  acts as an effective general-purpose scan detection  algorithm. However, we find that the most effective  approach is a composite solution that combines our  approach with TRW (the research was published in the  journal of Security Informatics).  In FY 2016, the AIM project will work on new methods  for network anomaly detection, efficient representations  for attack graphs, efficient computation of access control  policy to restrict insider attacks, vertex partitioning on  massive graphs to enable security resiliency analyses, and  methods for using attack graphs to perform defense-in- depth measurements.

NIST  research has shown that most failures are triggered by one  or two parameters, and progressively fewer by three, four, or  more parameters (see Figure 25 below), a relationship that  is called the Interaction Rule. These results have important  implications for testing. If all faults in a system can be  triggered by a combination of n or fewer parameters, then  testing all n-way combinations of parameters can provide  very strong fault detection efficiency. These methods are  being applied to software and hardware testing for reliability,  safety, and security. CSD’s focus is on empirical results and  real-world problems.  Project highlights for FY 2015 include the publication of  a paper on a new method of “oracle-free testing”, a form  of consistency checking using two-layer covering arrays  with equivalence classes to automatically detect a large  class of software faults; invited lectures at conferences and  universities; leading the fourth International Workshop on  Combinatorial Testing, held in conjunction with the eighth  IEEE  International Conference on Software Testing; initiating  research on using combinatorial methods to reduce the cost  of high assurance for life-critical software, tools and methods  for locating faults from test results; and analyzing the factors  involved  in different types of software faults. Collaborators  include researchers from the University of Texas at Arlington,  the University of Texas at Dallas, East Carolina University,  and Duke University.  Figure 25: Interaction Rule Graph  Technology transfer activities included the publication  of a number of technical papers and software distribution;  publication of the results of a Cooperative R&D (CRADA)  project with Lockheed Martin; release of enhanced  combinatorial measurement tools; input modeling and  fault location tools; a provisional patent application on the  oracle-free testing method; plus seminars at a number of  conferences, universities, and federal agencies.  Plans for FY 2016 include combinatorial testing for  big data software; initiation of a new CRADA project;  measurement of input model combination coverage of  security-critical software; a beta release of tools for testing  to the modified condition decision coverage test criterion  for life-critical software; developing tools to implement  oracle-free testing methods; analysis of empirical data  on failures; further development of methods and tools for  fault localization; and seminars, workshops, and tutorials at  professional meetings and research labs.

Many security and protection mechanisms are  currently rooted in software that, along with all underlying  components, must be trusted and not tampered with. A  vulnerability in any of those components could compromise  the trustworthiness of the security mechanisms that rely  upon those components. Stronger security assurances may  be possible by grounding security mechanisms in roots of  trust.  Roots of trust are highly reliable and secure hardware,  firmware, and software components that perform specific,  critical security functions. Because roots of trust are  inherently trusted, they must be secure by their design. As  such, many roots of trust are implemented in hardware or  protected firmware so that malware cannot tamper with  the functions they provide. Roots of trust provide a firm  foundation from which to build security and trust.  CSD’s work aims to encourage the use of roots of  trust in computers to provide stronger security assurances.  A focus area for this work has been securing firmware.  Previous guidelines by CSD described methods to protect  boot firmware, commonly known as the Basic Input/Output  System (BIOS) in PC clients and servers.

In FY 2016, CSD will continue to work with the computer  industry on the use of roots of trust to improve the security  of BIOS and other firmware. As part of this effort, CSD is  researching techniques and requirements for securing  firmware throughout the platform.  This effort will consider  methods to protect this firmware from unauthorized  changes, detect accidental or malicious corruption, and  recover from destructive attacks.

NIST’s Dr. Ron Ross Wins Three Top Awards  for Advancing Cybersecurity Dr. Ron Ross, leader of the Federal Information Security Management  Act (FISMA) Implementation Project and an international cybersecurity  ambassador, was recognized by three organizations for contributions to  the field of cybersecurity:  •  Dr. Ross was presented the Samuel J. Heyman Service to America  Medal in the area of Homeland Security and Law Enforcement. The  medal, often referred to as the “Sammie” award, is considered the  “Oscar” award of government service. It highlights excellence in the  federal workforce and inspires other talented and dedicated individuals  to enter public service. He received the honor for “instituting a state- of-the-art risk assessment system that has protected federal computer  networks from cyberattacks and helped secure information critical to  our national and economic security.”  •  Government Computer News (GCN) magazine named Dr. Ross as Gov- ernment Executive of the Year for his contributions to securing federal  information systems.  •  Dr. Ross was also inducted into the National Cyber Security Hall of Fame. The organization honors innovative indi- viduals and organizations for their vision and leadership in creating foundational building blocks of the cybersecurity  industry.  As a result of his widely used work, Dr. Ross has been called on by U.S. industry, academia and governments around the  world to help their efforts to protect information. He has led U.S. cybersecurity teams to Australia, India, Japan, Canada,  and the European Union, promoting effective information security concepts and best practices.

In an effort to provide greater access to NIST’s broad  portfolio of security and privacy publications, CSD began  posting additional Special Publications and NISTIRs on the  CSRC that were developed by other components at NIST,  such as the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence  (NCCoE) and National Strategy for Trusted Identities in  Cyberspace (NSTIC).  For example, CSRC now displays  publications from the new NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide  series, SP 1800, authored by the NCCoE staff.  The first three  SP 1800 drafts were posted for public comment, describing  work that closely relates to CSD standards, guidelines and  research.  By posting cybersecurity and privacy draft publications  from other NIST components on CSRC, CSD aims to provide  greater visibility during public comment periods and to  provide a primary resource for stakeholders to access a  broad range of NIST cybersecurity and privacy publications.  In FY 2015, CSD posted a substantial number of final  publications to CSRC, including two FIPS, fifteen Special  Publications, and seven NISTIRs. The release of FIPS 202,  SHA-3 Standard, in August 2015 was the culmination of  many years of effort by the Cryptographic Technology Group  to develop a next-generation standard for secure hashing.  FIPS 202 specifies a family of fixed-length hash functions  and extendable-output functions that complement the  existing SHA-2 algorithms specified in FIPS 180-4, Secure  Hash Standard (SHS).  CSD continued to engage the public by posting fifteen  SPs and thirteen NISTIRs as drafts for public comment. That  included Draft NISTIR 8060, Guidelines for the Creation  of Interoperable Software Identification (SWID) Tags, for  which three iterations were released during short, two- week public comment periods.  Comments were requested  on three existing publications to determine what changes  or approaches should be taken, prior to releasing an official  draft for public comment.  Those publications include  i) SP 800-63-2, Electronic Authentication Guideline, ii)  Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) version 1.3  and iii) the potential use of ISO/IEC 19790:2012 as the U.S.  federal standard for cryptographic modules (as a potential  successor to FIPS 140-2).  Publications are available for download from CSRC  (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/), including several NIST  technical series:  •  FIPS (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html);  •  Special Publications (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/ PubsSPs.html);  •  NISTIRs (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsNISTIRs. html); and  •  ITL Bulletins (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/Pub- sITLSB.html).

Additionally, CSD shares its ongoing research efforts  through other publications, such as journal articles,  conference papers, books and other whitepapers. Although  available through NIST’s Publications Portal (http://www. nist.gov/publication-portal.cfm), they can also be accessed  on CSRC’s Articles page (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/ articles/). During FY 2015, more than 20 such documents  were published, and are listed in the next section (FY 2015  Computer Security Division Publications) of this annual  report.  In FY 2016, CSD plans to release a new version of CSRC  that uses a content management system.  The publications  interface on the redesigned website will give users  significantly greater capabilities for browsing, searching,  downloading and sharing information on NIST’s broad  collection of computer security and privacy publications.  FY 2015 Computer  Security Division  Publications  The Computer Security Division uses multiple NIST  Technical Series to promulgate security standards,  guidelines, recommendations, research, and additional  background material. Those series include FIPS, SPs, NISTIRs  and ITL Bulletins. Links to these publications are available at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications. As described earlier, in  FY 2015, CSD began expanding its publication portfolio on  CSRC by posting cybersecurity and privacy SPs and NISTIRs  from other NIST components. In some cases, CSD staff  contributed to the development of a publication (e.g., Draft SP  1800-3).  Others were developed by other ITL cybersecurity  components (e.g., NCCoE and NSTIC), documents that are  closely related to CSD activities (e.g., Draft NISTIR 8062), or  describe CSD programs and standardization activities within  a greater context (e.g., Draft NISTIR 8074).  Additionally, each year CSD staff author numerous  additional publications, including journal articles, conference  papers, and other papers that are widely disseminated. They  range from basic research to high-level summaries of CSD  activities.  NIST Technical  Series  Publications −  FIPS,  SPs,  NISTIRs,  and ITL Bul let ins  Below are lists of NIST Technical Series publications  that CSD released on CSRC as draft documents or as  final publications during FY 2015 (from October 1, 2014 to  September 30, 2015).

These publications are available at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications.  FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING  STANDARDS (FIPS)  FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based Hash and  Extendable-Output Functions  This standard specifies the Secure Hash Algorithm-3 (SHA- 3) family of functions on binary data. Each of the SHA-3  functions is based on an instance of the Keccak algorithm  that NIST selected as the winner of the SHA-3 Cryptographic  Hash Algorithm Competition. This standard also specifies  the Keccak-p family of mathematical permutations,  including the permutation that underlies Keccak, in order to  facilitate the development of additional permutation-based  cryptographic functions.  The SHA-3 family consists of four cryptographic hash  functions, called SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and  SHA3-512, and two extendable-output functions (XOFs),  called SHAKE128 and SHAKE256.  Hash functions are components for many important  information security applications, including 1) the generation  and verification of digital signatures, 2) key derivation, and 3)  pseudorandom bit generation. The hash functions specified  in this standard supplement the SHA-1 hash function and  the SHA-2 family of hash functions that are specified in FIPS  180-4, Secure Hash Standard.  Extendable-output functions are different from hash  functions, but it is possible to use them in similar ways, with  the flexibility to be adapted directly to the requirements  of individual applications, subject to additional security  considerations.  FIPS 180-4 (Updated), Secure Hash Standard (SHS)  This standard specifies SHA-1 and the SHA-2 family of hash  algorithms that can be used to generate digests of messages.  The digests are used to detect whether messages have been  changed since the digests were generated. The Applicability  Clause of this standard was revised to correspond with the  release of FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based  Hash and Extendable-Output Functions (see above). The  revision to the Applicability Clause approves the use of  hash functions specified in either FIPS 180-4 or FIPS 202  when a secure hash function is required for the protection  of sensitive, unclassified information in federal applications,  including as a component within other cryptographic  algorithms and protocols.

This guideline  applies to federal IT systems and will also be useful for  any small or medium sized organizations.  Technologies  recommended in support of the core Simple Mail Transfer  Protocol (SMTP) and the Domain Name System (DNS)  include mechanisms for authenticating a sending domain  (Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain Keys Identified  Mail (DKIM) and Domain-based Message Authentication),  Reporting and Conformance (DMARC).  Recommendations  for email transmission security include Transport Layer  Security (TLS) and associated certificate authentication  protocols. Email content security is facilitated through the  encryption and authentication of message content using  Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) and  OpenPGP, and associated certificate and key distribution  protocols.  SP 800-176, Computer Security Division 2014 Annual  Report  Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002, titled the Federal  Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,  requires NIST to prepare an annual public report on activities  undertaken in the previous year and planned for the coming  year to carry out responsibilities under this law. The primary  goal of the Computer Security Division, a component of  NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory, is to provide  standards and technology that protects information  systems against threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of information and services. During Fiscal Year  2014, CSD successfully responded to numerous challenges  and opportunities in fulfilling that mission. This annual report  highlights the research agenda and activities in which CSD  was engaged during FY 2014.  SP 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified  Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and  Organizations  The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information  (CUI) while residing in nonfederal information systems  and organizations is of paramount importance to federal  agencies and can directly impact the ability of the Federal  Government to successfully carry out its designated missions  and business operations. This publication provides federal  agencies with recommended requirements for protecting  the confidentiality of CUI: (i) when the CUI is resident in  nonfederal information systems and organizations; (ii)  when the information systems where the CUI resides are  not used or operated by contractors of federal agencies  or other organizations on behalf of those agencies; and  (iii) where there are no specific safeguarding requirements  for protecting the confidentiality of CUI prescribed by the  authorizing law, regulation, or government-wide policy for  the CUI category or subcategory listed in the CUI Registry.  The requirements apply to all components of nonfederal  information systems and organizations that process, store,  or transmit CUI, or provide security protection for such  components. The CUI requirements are intended for use by  federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements  established between those agencies and nonfederal  organizations.  SP 800-163, Vetting the Security of Mobile Applications  Today’s commercially available mobile devices (e.g.,  smartphones and tablets) are handheld computing  platforms with wireless capabilities, geographic localization  capabilities, cameras, and microphones. Similar to computing  platforms such as desktops and laptops, the user experience  with a mobile device is tied to the software apps and the  tools and utilities available. The purpose of this document  is to provide guidance for vetting third party software  applications (apps) for mobile devices. Mobile app vetting is  intended to assess a mobile app’s operational characteristics  of secure behavior and reliability (including performance) so  that organizations can determine if the app is acceptable for  use in their expected environment.  SP 800-161, Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for  Federal Information Systems and Organizations  Federal agencies are concerned about the risks associated  with information and communications technology (ICT)  products and services that may contain potentially malicious  functionality, are counterfeit, or are vulnerable due to  poor manufacturing and development practices within  the ICT supply chain. These risks are associated with the  federal agencies decreased visibility into, understanding  of, and control over how the technology that they acquire  is developed, integrated and deployed, as well as the  processes, procedures, and practices used to assure the  integrity, security, resilience, and quality of the products and  services.  This publication provides guidance to federal agencies on  identifying, assessing, and mitigating ICT supply chain risks  at all levels of their organizations. This publication integrates  ICT supply chain risk management (SCRM) into federal  agency risk management activities by applying a multi- tiered, SCRM-specific approach, including guidance on  supply chain risk assessment and mitigation activities.  SP 800-157, Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) Credentials  This recommendation provides technical guidelines for  the implementation of standards-based, secure, reliable,  interoperable public key infrastructure (PKI)-based identity  credentials that are issued by federal departments and  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

The scope of this document includes  requirements for initial issuance and maintenance of  these credentials, certificate policies and cryptographic  specifications, technical specifications for permitted  cryptographic token types and the command interfaces  for the removable implementations of such cryptographic  tokens.  DRAFT SP 800-152 (Third Draft), A Profile for U.S.  Federal Cryptographic Key Management Systems (CKMS)  This Profile for U.S. Federal Cryptographic Key Management  Systems (FCKMSs) contains requirements for their design,  implementation, procurement, installation, configuration,  management, operation, and use by U.S. federal  organizations. The Profile is based on SP 800-130, A  Framework for Designing Cryptographic Key Management  Systems (CKMS).  DRAFT SP 800-150, Guide to Cyber Threat Information  Sharing  In today’s active threat environment, incident detection and  response is an ongoing challenge for many organizations.  This publication assists organizations in establishing  computer security incident response capabilities that  leverage the collective knowledge, experience, and abilities  of their partners by actively sharing threat intelligence and  ongoing coordination. This publication provides guidelines  for coordinated incident handling, including producing  and consuming data, participating in information sharing  communities, and protecting incident-related data.  DRAFT SP 800-131A Revision 1, Transitions:  Recommendation for Transitioning the Use of  Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Lengths  At the start of the 21st Century, NIST began the task of  providing cryptographic key management guidance,  which includes defining and implementing appropriate key  management procedures, using algorithms that adequately  protect sensitive information, and planning ahead for  possible changes in the use of cryptography because  of algorithm breaks or the availability of more powerful  computing techniques. NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 was the first  document produced in this effort, and includes a general  approach for transitioning from one algorithm or key length  to another. This Recommendation (SP 800-131A) provides  more specific guidance for transitions to the use of stronger  cryptographic keys and more robust algorithms.  DRAFT SP 800-125A, Secure Recommendations for  Hypervisor Deployment  The Hypervisor is a piece of software that provides the  abstraction of all physical resources (such as CPU, Memory,  Network and Storage) and thus, enables multiple computing  stacks (consisting of an operating system, Middleware and  Application programs) called Virtual Machines (VMs) to  be run on a single physical host. In addition, a hypervisor  may have the functionality to define a network within a  single physical host (called a virtual network) to enable  communication among the VMs resident on that host, as  well as with physical and virtual machines outside the host.  With all this functionality, the hypervisor is responsible  for mediating access to physical resources, providing run- time isolation among resident VMs and enabling a virtual  network that provides security-preserving communication  flow among the VMs, and between the VMs and the external  network. To design a hypervisor with the core functionality  described above, there are architectural options, with each  option presenting a different size of Trusted Computing  Base (TCB) and hence, a different degree of ease in  providing the required security assurance. Hence, in  providing security recommendations for the hypervisor, two  different approaches have been adopted in this document–  one approach based on architectural options that provide  more security assurance, and the second approach based on  configuration choices that form part of its core administrative  functions, such as the management of VMs, hypervisor host,  hypervisor software and virtual networks.  DRAFT SP 800-125B, Secure Virtual Network  Configuration for Virtual Machine (VM) Protection  Virtual Machines (VMs) are key resources to be protected,  since they are the compute engines hosting mission-critical  applications. Since VMs are end-nodes of a virtual network,  the configuration of the virtual network forms an important  element in the security of VMs and their hosted applications.  The virtual network configuration areas discussed in this  document are: Network Segmentation, Network path  redundancy, firewall deployment architectures and VM Traffic  Monitoring. The various configuration options under these  areas are analyzed for their advantages and disadvantages,  and a set of security recommendations are provided.  SP 800-90A Revision 1, Recommendation for Random  Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit  Generators  This Recommendation specifies mechanisms for the  generation of random bits using deterministic methods. The  methods provided are based on either hash functions or  block cipher algorithms.

This guide will assist organizations and system  owners in making practical sanitization decisions, based on  a categorization of the confidentiality of their information.  DRAFT SP 800-85A-4, PIV Card Application and  Middleware Interface Test Guidelines (SP 800-73-4  Compliance)  SP 800-73 contains the technical specifications to interface  with the smart card to retrieve and use the PIV identity  credentials. This document, SP 800-85A, contains the  test assertions and test procedures for testing smart card  middleware as well as the card application. The tests reflect  the design goals of interoperability and PIV Card functions.  SP 800-82 Revision 2, Guide to Industrial Control  Systems (ICS) Security  This document provides guidance on how to secure Industrial  Control Systems (ICS), including Supervisory Control and  Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Distributed Control  Systems (DCS), and other control system configurations,  such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), while  addressing their unique performance, reliability, and safety  requirements. The document provides an overview of ICS  and typical system topologies, identifies typical threats and  vulnerabilities to these systems, and provides recommended  security countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks.  SP 800-79-2, Guidelines for the Authorization of Personal  Identity Verification Card Issuers (PCI) and Derived PIV  Credential Issuers (DPCI)  The purpose of this SP is to provide appropriate and useful  guidelines for assessing the reliability of issuers of PIV Cards  and Derived PIV Credentials. These issuers store personal  information and issue credentials based on OMB policies  and on the standards published in response to HSPD-12  and, therefore, are the primary target of the assessment  and authorization under this guideline. The reliability of an  issuer is of utmost importance when one organization (e.g.,  a federal agency) is required to trust the identity credentials  of individuals that were created and issued by another  federal agency. This trust will only exist if organizations  relying on the credentials issued by a given organization  have the necessary level of assurance that the reliability of  the issuing organization has been established through a  formal authorization process.  SP 800-78-4, Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for  Personal Identity Verification  FIPS 201-2 defines requirements for the PIV lifecycle activities,  including identity proofing, registration, PIV Card issuance,  and PIV Card usage. FIPS 201-2 also defines the structure of  an identity credential that includes cryptographic keys. This  document contains the technical specifications needed for  the mandatory and optional cryptographic keys specified in  FIPS 201-2, as well as the supporting infrastructure specified  in FIPS 201-2 and the related SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for  Personal Identity Verification, and SP 800-76-2, Biometric  Specifications for Personal Identity Verification, that rely on  cryptographic functions.  SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification  FIPS 201 defines the requirements and characteristics of a  government-wide interoperable identity credential. FIPS 201  also specifies that this identity credential must be stored on a  smart card. This document, SP 800-73, contains the technical  specifications to interface with the smart card to retrieve  and use the PIV identity credentials. The specifications  reflect the design goals of interoperability and PIV Card  functions. The goals are addressed by specifying a PIV data  model, card edge interface, and application programming  interface. The specifications go further by constraining  implementers’ interpretations of the normative standards.  Such restrictions are designed to ease implementation,  facilitate interoperability, and ensure performance, in a  manner tailored for PIV applications.  DRAFT SP 800-70 Revision 3, National Checklist Program  for IT Products: Guidelines for Checklist Users and  Developers  A security configuration checklist is a document that  contains instructions or procedures for configuring an  IT product for an operational environment, for verifying  that the product has been configured properly, and/or for  identifying unauthorized changes to the product. Using  these checklists can minimize the attack surface, reduce  vulnerabilities, lessen the impact of successful attacks,  and identify changes that might otherwise go undetected.  To facilitate the development of checklists and to make  checklists more organized and usable, NIST established the  National Checklist Program (NCP). This publication explains  how to use the NCP to find and retrieve checklists, and it also  describes the policies, procedures, and general requirements  for participation in the NCP.

The document:  1.  Defines the security services that may be provided and  key types that may be employed in using cryptographic  mechanisms;  2.  Provides background information regarding the  cryptographic algorithms that use cryptographic keying  material;  3.  Classifies the different types of keys and other  cryptographic information according to their functions,  specifies the protection that each type of information  requires and identifies methods for providing this  protection;  4.  Identifies the states in which a cryptographic key may  exist during its lifetime;  5.  Identifies the multitude of functions involved in key  management; and  6.  Discusses a variety of key management issues related  to the keying material. Topics discussed include  key usage, cryptoperiod length, domain-parameter  validation, public-key validation, accountability, audit,  key management system survivability, and guidance for  cryptographic algorithm and key size selection.  SP 800-57 Part 3 Revision 1, Recommendation for  Key Management, Part 3: Application-Specific Key  Management Guidance  SP 800-57 Part 3 is intended primarily to help system  administrators and system installers adequately secure  applications, based on product availability and organizational  needs and to support organizational decisions about future  procurements. This document also provides information  for end users regarding application options left under their  control in normal use of the application. Recommendations  are given for a select set of applications: Public Key  Infrastructures (PKI), Internet Protocol Security (IPsec),  Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure/Multipurpose  Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME), Kerberos, Over-the-Air  Rekeying of Digital Radios (OTAR), Domain Name System  Security Extensions (DNSSEC), Encrypted File Systems  (EFS), and Secure Shell (SSH).  SP 800-53A Revision 4, Assessing Security and  Privacy Controls in Federal Information Systems and  Organizations: Building Effective Assessment Plans  This publication provides a set of procedures for conducting  assessments of the security controls and privacy controls  employed within federal information systems and  organizations. The assessment procedures, executed at  various phases of the system development life cycle, are  consistent with the security and privacy controls in SP 800- 53 Revision 4. The procedures are customizable and can  be easily tailored to provide organizations with the needed  flexibility to conduct security control assessments and  privacy control assessments that support organizational risk  management processes and that are aligned with the stated  risk tolerance of the organization. Information on building  effective security assessment plans and privacy assessment  plans is also provided, along with guidance on analyzing  assessment results.  SP 800-53 Rev. 4 (Update), Security and Privacy Controls  for Federal Information Systems and Organizations  This publication provides a catalog of security and  privacy controls for federal information systems and  organizations and a process for selecting controls to protect  organizational operations (including mission, functions,  image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals,  other organizations, and the Nation from a diverse set of  threats, including hostile cyber attacks, natural disasters,  structural failures, and human errors (both intentional  and unintentional). The security and privacy controls are  customizable and implemented as part of an organization- wide process that manages information security and privacy  risk. The controls address a diverse set of security and privacy  requirements across the Federal Government and critical  infrastructure that are derived from legislation, Executive  Orders, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and/or  mission/business needs. The publication also describes how  to develop specialized sets of controls, or overlays, that are  tailored for specific types of missions/business functions,  technologies, or environments of operation. Finally, the  catalog of security controls addresses security from both a  functionality perspective (the strength of security functions  and mechanisms provided) and an assurance perspective  (the measures of confidence in the implemented security  capability). Addressing both security functionality and  assurance helps to ensure that information technology  component products and the information systems built from  those products using sound system and security engineering  principles are sufficiently trustworthy.

The CSD developed a conformance testing  methodology framework for ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2011 Update:  2013, Data Format for the Interchange of Fingerprint,  Facial & Other Biometric Information (AN-2013). This  testing methodology framework defines the test assertions  implemented within CSD’s conformance test tool, which is  designed to test implementations of AN-2013 transactions  and promotes biometrics conformity assessment efforts.  This initial document includes comprehensive tables of AN- 2013 requirements and test assertions for transaction-wide  requirements and Record Type 1 (which is required for all  transactions). The tables of requirements and assertions  indicate which assertions apply to the traditional encoding  format, the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM)- compliant encoding format, or both encoding formats. The  testing methodology framework defines and makes use of  a specific test assertion syntax, which clearly defines the  assertions associated with each requirement.  DRAFT SP 1800-3, Attribute Based Access Control  Enterprises rely upon strong access control mechanisms to  ensure that corporate resources (e.g., applications, networks,  systems and data) are not exposed to anyone other than  an authorized user. As business requirements change,  enterprises need highly flexible access control mechanisms  that can adapt. The application of attribute-based policy  definitions enables enterprises to accommodate a diverse  set of business cases. This NCCoE practice guide details a  collaborative effort between the NCCoE and technology  providers to demonstrate a standards-based approach to  attribute-based access control (ABAC).  This guide discusses potential security risks facing  organizations, benefits that may result from the  implementation of an ABAC system and the approach that  the NCCoE took in developing a reference architecture and  build. Included is a discussion of major architecture design  considerations, an explanation of security characteristics  achieved by the reference design and a mapping of security  characteristics to applicable standards and security control  families.  For parties interested in adopting all or part of the NCCoE  reference architecture, this guide includes a detailed  description of the installation, configuration and integration  of all components.  DRAFT SP 1800-2, Identity and Access Management for  Electric Utilities  To protect power generation, transmission, and distribution,  energy companies need to control physical and logical  access to their resources, including buildings, equipment,  information technology, and industrial control systems.  They must authenticate authorized individuals to the  devices and facilities to which they are giving access rights  with a high degree of certainty. In addition, they need to  enforce access control policies (e.g., allow, deny or inquire  further) consistently, uniformly, and quickly across all of  their resources. This project resulted from a direct dialogue  among NCCoE staff and members of the electricity  subsector, mainly from electric power companies and those  who provide equipment and/or services to them.  The goal of this project is to demonstrate a centralized,  standards-based technical approach that unifies identity and  access management (IdAM) functions across operational  technology (OT) networks, physical access control systems  (PACS), and information technology systems. These  networks often operate independently, which can result in  identity and access information disparity, increased costs,  inefficiencies, and loss of capacity and service delivery  capability. This guide describes the collaborative efforts with  technology providers and electric company stakeholders to  address the security challenges that energy providers face  in the core function of IdAM. It offers a technical approach  to meeting the challenge, and also incorporates a business  value mind-set by identifying the strategic considerations  involved in implementing new technologies.  This Cybersecurity Practice Guide provides a modular,  open, end-to-end example solution that can be tailored  and implemented by energy providers of varying sizes and  sophistication. It shows energy providers how NIST met the  challenge using open source and commercially available  tools and technologies that are consistent with cybersecurity  standards. The use case scenario is based on a normal day- to-day business operational scenario that provides the  underlying impetus for the functionality presented in the  guide. While the reference solution was demonstrated with  a certain suite of products, the guide does not endorse these  products in particular. Instead, it presents the characteristics  and capabilities that an organization’s security experts can  use to identify similar standards-based products that can  be integrated quickly and cost-effectively with an energy  provider’s existing tools and infrastructure.  DRAFT SP 1800-1, Securing Electronic Health Records on  Mobile Devices  Health care providers increasingly use mobile devices  to receive, store, process, and transmit patient clinical  information. According to NIST’s risk analysis, discussed  here, and in the experience of many health care providers,  mobile devices can present vulnerabilities in a health care  organization’s networks. At the 2012 Health and Human  Services Mobile Devices Roundtable, participants stressed  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

This Cybersecurity Practice Guide provides a modular,  open, end-to-end reference design that can be tailored and  implemented by health care organizations of varying sizes  and information technology sophistication. Specifically, the  guide shows how health care providers, using open source  and commercially available tools and technologies that are  consistent with cybersecurity standards, can more securely  share patient information among caregivers using mobile  devices. The scenario considered is that of a hypothetical  primary care physician using her mobile device to perform  reoccurring activities, such as sending a referral (e.g.,  clinical information) to another physician, or sending an  electronic prescription to a pharmacy. While the design was  demonstrated with a certain suite of products, the guide does  not endorse these products in particular. Instead, it presents  the characteristics and capabilities that an organization’s  security experts can use to identify similar standards-based  products that can be integrated quickly and cost-effectively  with a health care provider’s existing tools and infrastructure.

DRAFT NISTIR 8062, Privacy Risk Management for  Federal Information Systems  This document describes a privacy risk management  framework for federal information systems. The framework  provides the basis for the establishment of a common  vocabulary to facilitate a better understanding of and  communication about privacy risks and the effective  implementation of privacy principles in federal information  systems. This publication focuses on the development of  two key pillars to support the application of the framework:  privacy engineering objectives and a privacy risk model.  DRAFT NISTIR 8060 (Three drafts), Guidelines for the  Creation of Interoperable Software Identification (SWID)  Tags  This guidance provides an overview of the capabilities  and usage of Software Identification (SWID) tags as part  of a comprehensive software life cycle. As instantiated in  the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/ International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 19770- 2 standard, SWID tags support numerous applications  for software asset management and information security  management. This report introduces SWID tags in an  operational context, provides guidelines for the creation of  interoperable SWID tags, and highlights key usage scenarios  for which SWID tags are applicable.  DRAFT NISTIR 8058, Security Content Automation  Protocol (SCAP) Version 1.2 Content Style Guide: Best  Practices for Creating and Maintaining SCAP 1.2 Content  The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is  a suite of specifications that standardize the format  and nomenclature by which software flaw and security  configuration information is communicated, both to  machines and humans. SCAP version 1.2 requirements are  defined in SP 800-126 Revision 2. Over time, certain stylistic  conventions regarding the authoring of SCAP 1.2 content  have become best practices. While these best practices are  not required, they improve the quality of the SCAP content in  several ways, such as improving the accuracy and consistency  of results, avoiding performance problems, reducing user  effort, lowering content maintenance burdens, and enabling  content reuse. This document has been created to capture  the best practices and encourage their use by SCAP content  authors and maintainers.  DRAFT NISTIR 8055, Derived Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) Credentials (DPC) Proof of Concept  Research  This report documents a proof-of-concept implementation  for Derived PIV Credentials (DPCs).

NISTIR 8054, NSTIC Pilots: Catalyzing the Identity  Ecosystem  Pilots are an integral part of the National Strategy for Trusted  Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), passed by the White  House in 2011 to encourage enhanced security, privacy,  interoperability, and ease-of-use for online transactions. This  document details summaries and outcomes of NSTIC pilots;  in addition, it explores common themes in the pilots’ work,  developing and operating innovative identity solutions.  DRAFT NISTIR 8053, De-Identification of Personally  Identifiable Information  De-identification removes identifying information from a  dataset so that individual data cannot be linked with specific  individuals. De-identification can reduce the privacy risk  associated with collecting, processing, archiving, distributing  or publishing information. De-identification thus attempts  to balance the contradictory goals of using and sharing  personal information, while protecting privacy. Several U.S.  laws, regulations and policies specify that data should be  de-identified prior to sharing. In recent years, researchers  have shown that some de-identified data can sometimes be  re-identified. Many different kinds of information can be de- identified, including structured information, free format text,  multimedia, and medical imagery. This document summarizes  roughly two decades of de-identification research, discusses  current practices, and presents opportunities for future  research.  DRAFT NISTIR 8050, Executive Technical Workshop  on Improving Cybersecurity and Consumer Privacy:  Summary and Next Steps  Cybersecurity incidents have grown swiftly from conceivable  to realized risks that regularly threaten the national and  economic security of the United States. These risks threaten  the financial security of companies and the public, weaken  consumer confidence, erode individual privacy protections,  and damage the brand value and reputation of businesses.  On February 12, 2015, NIST and Stanford University hosted  an executive technical workshop, which was held in  coordination with the White House Summit on Cybersecurity  and Consumer Protection, to discuss how to increase the  use of advanced cybersecurity and privacy technologies in  consumer-facing organizations. This document details the  discussion and ideas presented at the workshop and serves  as a platform to receive broader feedback on the relevance  of projects and suggestions discussed at that event.  NISTIR 8041, Proceedings of the Cybersecurity for Direct  Digital Manufacturing (DDM) Symposium  Direct Digital Manufacturing (DDM) involves fabricating  physical objects from a data file using computer-controlled  processes with little to no human intervention. It includes  Additive Manufacturing (AM), 3D printing, rapid prototyping,  etc. The technology is advancing rapidly and has the  potential to significantly change traditional manufacturing  and supply chain industries, including information and  communication technologies (ICT). On February 3, 2015, CSD  hosted a one-day symposium to explore the cybersecurity  needed for DDM, to include ensuring the protection of  intellectual property and the integrity of printers, elements  being printed, and design data. Speakers and attendees  from industry, academia, and government discussed the  state of the industry, cybersecurity risks and solutions, and  implications for ICT supply chain risk management (SCRM).  NISTIR 8023, Risk Management for Replication Devices  This publication provides guidance on protecting the  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information  processed, stored, or transmitted on replication devices  (RDs). It suggests appropriate countermeasures in the  context of the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). A  security risk assessment template in table and flowchart  format is also provided to help organizations determine the  risk associated with replication devices.  NISTIR 8018, Public Safety Mobile Application Security  Requirements Workshop Summary  This document captures the input received from the half- day workshop, “Public Safety Mobile Application Security  Requirements,” organized by the Association of Public- Safety Communications Officials (APCO) International, in  cooperation with FirstNet and the Department of Commerce  and held on February 25, 2014. This first-of-its-kind workshop  was attended by public safety practitioners, mobile  application developers, industry experts, and government  officials who contributed their experience and knowledge to  provide input in identifying security requirements for public  safety mobile applications.  NISTIR 8014, Considerations for Identity Management in  Public Safety Mobile Networks  This document analyzes approaches to identity management  for public safety networks in an effort to assist individuals  developing technical and policy requirements for public  safety use.

A short background  on identity management is provided alongside a review of  applicable federal and industry guidance. Considerations  are provided for identity proofing, selecting tokens, and the  authentication process. While specific identity management  technologies are analyzed, the document does not preclude  other identity management technologies from being used in  public safety communications networks.  DRAFT NISTIR 7966 (Second Draft), Security of  Interactive and Automated Access Management Using  Secure Shell (SSH)  Users and hosts must be able to access other hosts in an  interactive or automated fashion, often with very high  privileges, for a variety of reasons, including file transfers,  disaster recovery, privileged access management, software  and patch management, and dynamic cloud provisioning.  This is often accomplished using the Secure Shell (SSH)  protocol. The SSH protocol supports several mechanisms  for interactive and automated authentication. Management  of this access requires proper provisioning, termination,  and monitoring processes. However, the security of SSH  key-based access has been largely ignored to date. This  publication assists organizations in understanding the basics  of SSH interactive and automated access management in an  enterprise, focusing on the management of SSH user keys.  DRAFT NISTIR 7904 (Second Draft), Trusted Geolocation  in the Cloud: Proof of Concept Implementation  This publication explains selected security challenges  involving Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing  technologies and geolocation. It then describes a proof-of- concept implementation that was designed to address those  challenges. The publication provides sufficient details about  the proof-of-concept implementation so that organizations  can reproduce it if desired. The publication is intended to  be a blueprint or template that can be used by the general  security community to validate and implement the described  proof-of-concept implementation.  NISTIR 7863, Cardholder Authentication for the PIV  Digital Signature Key  FIPS 201-2 requires explicit user action by the PIV cardholder  as a condition for the use of the digital signature key stored  on the card. This document clarifies the requirement for  explicit user action to encourage the development of  compliant applications and middleware that use the digital  signature key.  NISTIR 7823, Advanced Metering Infrastructure Smart  Meter Upgradeability Test Framework  As electric utilities turn to Advanced Metering Infrastructures  (AMIs) to promote the development and deployment of the  Smart Grid, one aspect that can benefit from standardization  is the upgradeability of Smart Meters. The National Electrical  Manufacturers Association (NEMA) standard SG-AMI 1-2009,  “Requirements for Smart Meter Upgradeability,” describes  functional and security requirements for the secure upgrade  − both local and remote − of Smart Meters. This report  describes conformance test requirements that may be used  voluntarily by testers and/or test laboratories to determine  whether Smart Meters and Upgrade Management Systems  conform to the requirements of NEMA SG-AMI 1-2009.  For each relevant requirement in NEMA SG-AMI 1-2009,  the document identifies the information to be provided  by the vendor to facilitate testing, and the high-level test  procedures to be conducted by the tester/laboratory to  determine conformance.  DRAFT NISTIR 7621 Revision 1, Small Business  Information Security: the Fundamentals  NIST, as a partner with the Small Business Administration  and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in an information  security awareness outreach to the small business  community, developed this NISTIR as a reference guideline  for small businesses. This document is intended to present  the fundamentals of a small business information security  program in non-technical language.

Dunkelman, P.-A. Fouque, J.  Hoch, J. Kelsey, A. Shamir, and S. Zimmer, “New Second- Preimage Attacks on Hash Functions,” Journal of Cryptology,  40 pp. (June 23, 2015). doi: 10.1007/s00145-015-9206-4.  In this work, we present several new generic second- preimage attacks on hash functions. Our first attack  is based on the herding attack and applies to various  Merkle–Damgård-based iterative hash functions.  Compared to the previously known long-message  second-preimage attacks, our attack offers more  flexibility in choosing the second-preimage message  at the cost of a small computational overhead. More  concretely, our attack allows the adversary to replace  only a few blocks in the original target message to  obtain the second preimage. As a result, our new attack  is applicable to constructions previously believed to  be immune to such second-preimage attacks. Among  others, these include the dithered hash proposal of  Rivest, Shoup’s UOWHF, and the ROX constructions. In  addition, we also suggest several time-memory-data  tradeoff attack variants, allowing for a faster online  phase, and even finding second preimages for shorter  messages. We further extend our attack to sequences  stronger than the ones suggested in Rivest’s proposal.  To this end, we introduce the kite generator as a  new tool to attack any dithering sequence over a  small alphabet. Additionally, we analyze the second- preimage security of the basic tree hash construction.  We also propose several second-preimage attacks  and their time-memory-data tradeoff variants. Finally,  we show how both our new and the previous second- preimage attacks can be applied even more efficiently  when multiple short messages, rather than a single  long target message, are available.

Popular network scan detection algorithms operate  through evaluating external sources for unusual  connection patterns and traffic rates. Research has  revealed evasive tactics that enable full circumvention  of existing approaches (specifically the widely cited  Threshold Random Walk algorithm). To prevent the  use of these circumvention techniques, we propose  a novel approach to network scan detection that  evaluates the behavior of internal network nodes,  and combine it with other established techniques of  scan detection. By itself, our algorithm is an efficient,  protocol-agnostic, completely unsupervised method  that requires no a priori knowledge of the network  being defended beyond which hosts are internal  and which hosts are external to the network, and is  capable of detecting network scanning attempts,  regardless of the rate of the scan (working even  with connectionless protocols). We demonstrate the  effectiveness of our method on both live data from  an enterprise-scale network and on simulated scan  data, finding a false positive rate of just 0.000034 %  with respect to the number of inbound flows. When  combined with both Threshold Random Walk and  simple rate-limiting detection, we achieve an overall  detection rate of 94.44 %.  D. R. Kuhn, R. Kacker and Y.

There are relatively few good methods for evaluating  test set quality after ensuring basic requirements  traceability.

Despite the undisputed advantages of cloud  computing, customers − in particular, small and  medium enterprises − still need a meaningful  understanding of the security and risk-management  changes that the cloud entails so that they can assess  whether this new computing paradigm meets their  security requirements. This article presents a fresh  view on this problem by surveying and analyzing, from  the standardization and risk assessment perspective,  the specification of security in cloud service-level  agreements as a promising approach to empower  customers in assessing and understanding cloud  security. Apart from analyzing the proposed risk- based approach and surveying the relevant landscape,  this article presents a real-world scenario to support  the creation and adoption of service-level agreements  as enablers for negotiating, assessing, and monitoring  the achieved security levels in cloud services.  P. M. Mell, R. Harang and A. Gueye, “Measuring Limits on  the Ability of Colluding Countries to Partition the Internet,”  International Journal of Computer Science: Theory and  Application 3(3), 60-73 (2015).  We show that the strength of the Internet-based  network interconnectivity of countries is increasing  over time. We then evaluate bounds on the extent  to which a group of colluding countries can disrupt  this connectivity. We evaluate the degree to which  a group of countries can disconnect two other  countries, isolate a set of countries from the Internet,  or even break the Internet up into non-communicative  clusters. To do this, we create an interconnectivity map  of the worldwide Internet routing infrastructure at a  country-level of abstraction. We then examine how  groups of countries may use their pieces of routing  infrastructure to filter out the traffic of other countries  (or to block entire routes). Overall, bounds analysis  indicates that the ability of countries to perform  such disruptions to connectivity has diminished  significantly between 2008 and 2013. However, we  show that the majority of the gains in robustness go  to countries that had already displayed significant  robustness to the types of attacks that we consider.  The countries that displayed higher initial vulnerability  to such attacks did not become significantly more  robust over the time period of analysis.  D. Moody, R. Peralta, R. Perlner, A.

This report summarizes study results on pairing-based  cryptography. The main purpose of the study is to form  NIST’s position on standardizing and recommending  the pairing-based cryptographic schemes currently  published in research literature and standardized  in other standards development organizations. The  report reviews the mathematical background of  pairings.  This includes topics such as pairing-friendly  elliptic curves and how to compute various pairings.  The report includes a brief introduction on existing  identity-based encryption (IBE) schemes and other  cryptographic schemes using pairing technology. The  report provides a complete study of the current status  of standards activities on pairing-based cryptographic  schemes and explores different application scenarios  for pairing-based cryptographic schemes. As an  important aspect of adopting pairing-based schemes,  the report also considers the challenges inherent in  CAVP and CMVP testing for FIPS 140 validation. Based  on the study, the report suggests an approach for  including pairing-based cryptographic schemes in the  NIST cryptographic toolkit.  The report also outlines  several questions that will require further study if this  approach is followed.  D. Moody and D.

Isogenies are the morphisms between elliptic curves  and are, accordingly, a topic of interest in the subject.  As such, they have been well studied, and have been  used in several cryptographic applications. Vélu’s  formulas show how to explicitly evaluate an isogeny,  given a specification of the kernel as a list of points.  However, Vélu’s formulas only work for elliptic curves  specified by a Weierstrass equation. This paper  presents formulas similar to Vélu’s that can be used  to evaluate isogenies on Edwards curves and Huff  curves, which are normal forms of elliptic curves that  provide an alternative to the traditional Weierstrass  form. Our formulas are not simply compositions  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Paul, “Improved  Indifferentiability Security Bound for the JH Mode,” Designs,  Codes and Cryptography 74(3), 23 pp. (February 2015). doi:  10.1007/s10623-015-0047-9.  Indifferentiability security of a hash mode of operation  guarantees the mode’s resistance against all generic  attacks. It is also useful to establish the security  of protocols that use hash functions as random  functions. The JH hash function was one of the five  finalists in NIST’s SHA-3 hash function competition.  Despite several years of analysis, the indifferentiability  security of the JH mode has remained remarkably  low, only at n/3 bits, while the two finalist modes  Keccak and Grøstl offer a security guarantee of n/2  bits. Note that all these three modes operate with an  n-bit digest and 2n-bit permutations. In this paper, we  improve the indifferentiability security bound for the  JH mode to n/2 bits (e.g., from approximately 171 to  256 bits when n = 512). To put this into perspective,  our result guarantees the absence of (non-trivial)  attacks on both the JH-256 and JH-512 hash functions  with time less than approximately 2256 computations  of the underlying 1024-bit permutation, under the  assumption that the underlying permutations can  be modeled as an ideal permutation. Our bounds are  optimal for JH-256, and the best-known bound for JH- 512. We obtain this improved bound by establishing  an isomorphism of certain query-response graphs  through a careful design of the simulators and bad  events. Our experimental data strongly supports the  theoretically obtained results.  A.T. Vassilev and C.

We study the relationship between two measures  of Boolean functions; “algebraic thickness” and  “normality”. For a function f, the algebraic thickness  is a variant of the “sparsity”, the number of nonzero  coefficients in the unique F2 polynomial representing  f, and the normality is the largest dimension of an  affine subspace on which f  is constant. We show that  for 0 <ε< 2, any function with algebraic thickness  n 3-ε is constant on some affine subspace of dimension  Ω(n  ε/2). Furthermore, we give an algorithm for finding  such a subspace. This is at most a factor of Θ(√n) from the best guaranteed, and when restricted to the  technique used, is at most a factor of Θ(√logn)  from  the best guaranteed. We also show that a concrete  function, majority, has algebraic thickness  Ω(2n1/6  ).  R.

Cloud Data centers are predominantly made up of  Virtualized hosts. The networking infrastructure in a  cloud (virtualized) data center, therefore, consists of  the combination of a physical IP network (data center  fabric) and the virtual network residing in virtualized  hosts. Network Segmentation (Isolation), Traffic flow  control using firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems  / Intrusion Protection Systems (IDS/IPS) IDS/IPS form  the primary network-based security techniques, with  the first one as the foundation for the other two. In this  paper, we describe and analyze three generations of  network segmentation techniques—Virtual Switches  and Physical NIC-based, VLAN-based and Overlay- based. We take a detailed look at the overlay-based  virtual network segmentation and its characteristics,  such as scalability and ease of configuration.  R.

Because of its key role in providing  connectivity among VMs and the applications hosted  on them, Virtual Networks have to be securely  configured to provide the foundation for the overall  security of the virtualized infrastructure in any  deployment scenario. The objective of this paper is  to illustrate a deployment-driven methodology for  deriving a security configuration for Virtual Networks.  The methodology outlines two typical deployment  scenarios, identifies use cases and their associated  security requirements, discusses the security solutions  to meet those requirements and the virtual network  security configuration to implement each security  solution, and then analyzes the pros and cons of each  security solution.

This short paper introduces a method for verifying  equivalence classes for module/unit testing. This is  achieved using a two-layer covering array in which  some or all values of a primary covering array represent  equivalence classes. A second-layer covering array  of the equivalence class values is computed, and its  values substituted for the equivalence class names  in the primary array. It is shown that this method can  detect certain classes of errors without a conventional  test oracle, and an illustrative example is given.  P. M. Mell and R.

Devices in mobile tactical edge networks are often  resource constrained, due to their lightweight and  mobile nature, and often have limited access to  bandwidth. In order to maintain situational awareness  in the cyber domain, security logs from these devices  must be transmitted to command and control sites.  We present a lightweight packing step that takes  advantage of the restricted semantics and regular  format of certain kinds of log files to render them  substantially more amenable to compression with  standard algorithms (especially Lempel-Ziv variants).  We demonstrate that we can reduce compressed  file sizes to as little as 21 % of that of the maximally  compressed file without packing. We can also reduce  overall compression times up to 64 % in our data sets.  Our packing step permits a lossless transmission of  larger log files across the same network transmission  medium, as well as permitting existing sets of logs  to be transmitted within smaller network availability  windows.

At  PQCRYPTO ‘13 in Limoges, Tao, Diene, Tang, and Ding  introduced a promising new multivariate encryption  algorithm based on a fundamentally new idea: hiding  the structure of a large matrix algebra over a finite  field. We present an attack based on the subspace  differential invariants inherent to this methodology.  The attack is a structural key recovery attack that  is asymptotically optimal among all known attacks  (including algebraic attacks) on the original scheme  and its generalizations.  A. Nelson and S. Garfinkel, “Measuring Systematic and  Random Error in Digital Forensics” [abstract], International  Symposium on Forensic Science Error Management:  Detection, Measurement and Mitigation, Arlington, Virginia,  United States, July 21-24, 2015, 1 p.  Recognized sources of error in digital forensics include  systematic errors arising from implementation errors,  and random errors resulting from faulty equipment.  But as digital forensic techniques expand to include  statistical machine learning, another source of error  will be statistical errors that arise because of chance  disagreements between a statistical model and subject  systems examined with that model. We consider two  digital forensics systems with these different types of  measurable error.  First, we show a mechanism for comparing the  numerous and nuanced results of parsing a file system.  Multiple storage system parsers were designed for or  adapted to analyze a game console with a custom file  system. However, it was initially unknown whether  any of the parsers would produce a perspective of  the storage system that was correct in reporting the  files present and their characteristics. We adapted  the parsers to produce an in-common, machine- differentiable format, and used a storage differencing  algorithm to measure the relative incorrectness of  each of the parsers. Discrepancies summarize errors  in implementation or specification, an important  report when any reverse-engineering is necessary.  We discuss advantages and challenges in adopting  this practice.  Second, we show how to construct a classifier using  the hard drive from a multi-user computer that can  determine the user responsible for creating a file.  The classifier is constructed using allocated files and  its accuracy determined with take-one-out cross- validation. Once created, the classifier can be used to  predict the creator of files that can only be recovered  with carving.  R. Perlner, “Optimizing Information Set Decoding Algorithms  to Attack Cyclosymmetric MDPC Codes,” 6th International  Workshop on Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQCrypto  2014), Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, October 1-3, 2014. In  Lecture Notes in Computer Science 8772, Post-Quantum  Cryptography, M. Mosca, ed., Berlin: Springer International,  2014, pp. 220-228. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-11659-4_13.  Recently, several promising approaches have been  proposed to reduce key sizes for code-based  cryptography using structured, but non-algebraic  codes, such as quasi-cyclic (QC) Moderate Density  Parity Check (MDPC) codes. Biasi et al. propose further  reducing the key sizes of code-based schemes using  cyclosymmetric (CS) codes. While Biasi et al. analyze  the complexity of attacking their scheme using  standard information-set-decoding algorithms, the  research presented here shows that information set  decoding algorithms can be improved, by choosing  the columns of the information set in a way that takes  advantage of the added symmetry. The result is an  attack that significantly reduces the security of the  proposed CS-MDPC schemes to the point that they  no longer offer an advantage in key size over QC- MDPC schemes of the same security level. QC-MDPC  schemes are not affected by this paper’s result.  M. Sönmez Turan and J. Kelsey, “How Random is Your RNG?”  Shmoocon 2015, Washington, DC, United States, January 16- 18, 2015, 4 pp.  Cryptographic primitives need random numbers to  protect your data. Random numbers are used for  generating secret keys, nonces, random paddings,  initialization vectors, salts, etc. Deterministic  pseudorandom number generators are useful, but  they still need truly random seeds generated by  entropy sources in order to produce random numbers.  Researchers have shown examples of deployed  systems that did not have enough randomness in their  entropy sources, and as a result, cryptographic keys  were compromised. So how do you know how much  entropy is in your entropy source? Estimating entropy  is a difficult (if not impossible) problem, and we’ve  been working to create usable guidance that will give  conservative estimates on the amount of entropy in an  entropy source. From our research, we shared some  of the challenges and proposed methods. In addition,  we discussed some of the new directions that we are  investigating, and present results of our estimation  methods on simulated entropy sources.

Podio, “Common Biometric Exchange  Formats Framework Standardization,” in Encyclopedia of  Biometrics, 2nd ed. Edited by S. Z. Li and A. Jain. New York:  Springer Reference, 2015.  The Common Biometric Exchange Formats  Framework (CBEFF) provides a standardized set  of definitions and procedures that support the  interchange of biometric data in standard data  structures called CBEFF biometric information  records (BIRs). CBEFF permits considerable flexibility  regarding BIR structures and biometric data content,  but does so in a way that makes it easy for biometric  applications to evaluate their interest in processing a  particular BIR. At their conceptually simplest, standard  CBEFF data structures promote the interoperability  of biometric-based application programs and  systems by specifying a standardized wrapper for  describing, at a high level, the format and certain  attributes of the content of a BIR. The initial versions  of CBEFF were developed by NIST and the Biometric  Consortium. The CBEFF specification published by  NIST in April 2004 (NISTIR 6529-A) was proposed as  the basis for the development of formal national and  international CBEFF standards. Since then, American  National Standards and International Standards (ISO/ IEC) have been published. Development continues  at the international level on a new generation of  CBEFF standards. The paper describes the main  characteristics of CBEFF, emphasizing the value  of CBEFF data structures in open and complex  biometric systems, especially in cases where the  system must cope with a wide variety of biometric  data records, some of which may even be encrypted.  It provides adoption examples of CBEFF data  structures by national and international organizations  and programs, and discusses early work on CBEFF  standardization. Recent and current standardization  efforts are addressed.  D. J. Yaga, J. Campbell and G. Zekster, “Conformance Testing  Methodologies for Biometric Data Interchange Formats,  Standardization of,” in Encyclopedia of Biometrics, 2nd ed.  Edited by S. Z. Li and A. Jain. New York: SpringerReference,  2015.  Conformance testing is the method that is used to  determine if a product, process or system (known  as an implementation under test) satisfies the  requirements specified in the base standard. The goal  of conformance testing is to capture enough of the  requirements of the base standard and test them  under enough conditions that any implementation  under test that passes the conformance test is likely  to be conformant. Conformance testing provides  developers, users, and purchasers with increased levels  of confidence in product quality and increases the  probability of successful interoperability. Conformance  testing methodology standards for data interchange  formats identify a language to define the context of  conformance testing and conformance claims. These  standards include the set of requirements specified in  the base standards and one or more conformance test  assertions per requirement. There are several efforts in  biometric conformance test standardization, including  U.S. national organizations, such as International  Committee for Information Technology Standards  Technical Committee M1-Biometrics and NIST, who is  responsible for the development of the ANSI/NIST- ITL standards; and international organizations, such  as the International Organization for Standardization  (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission  (IEC) Joint Technical Commission 1, Subcommittee  37 - Biometrics. The paper includes a description  of the different national and international efforts  that have taken place in the last few years in the  development of conformance testing methodologies  for biometric data interchange formats developed by  the organizations mentioned above. The content of  these standards (for both published standards and  ongoing projects) are addressed.  White Papers M. Dworkin and R.

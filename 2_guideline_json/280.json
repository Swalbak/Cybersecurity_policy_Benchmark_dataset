REFERENCES 57  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  4  PREFACE  The 2009 reform of the EU legislative framework for electronic communications introduced  Article 13a and Article 13b as part of the Framework directive (Directive 2009/140/EC). This  reform was transposed into national legislation by EU Member States in 2011.  Article 13a  requires MS to ensure that providers of electronic communications manage security risks and  take appropriate security measures to guarantee the security (paragraph 1) and integrity  (paragraph 2) of these networks and services. Article 13a (paragraph 3) requires providers to  notify significant security incidents to competent national authorities, who should report about  these incidents to ENISA and the European Commission (EC) annually. Article 13b outlines  how authorities can supervise and enforce compliance with these security requirements.  In 2010, ENISA, the European Commission, and experts from ministries and telecom regulators  in the EU Member States initiated a series of meetings to achieve an efficient and harmonised  implementation of Article 13a across the EU, forming the Article 13a Expert Group1. This  group is now chaired by an expert from a national competent authority in the EU and comprises  experts from competent authorities from all EU countries as well as from some EFTA and EU  candidate countries. The Article 13a Expert Group reached consensus about two non-binding  technical guidelines for implementing Article 13a: the “Technical Guideline on Incident  Reporting” and the “Technical Guideline on Security Measures”.  In December 2018, a new set of telecom rules called the European Electronic  Communications Code (abbreviated as EECC) was adopted. The EECC updates the EU  telecom package of 2009 and paves the way for the roll out of fibre, very high capacity networks  and next generation mobile networks (5G), which will create jobs and growth, enable new  application scenarios like internet of things (IoT) and new business models. An important part of  the EECC is consumer protection2 and security of electronic communications. EU countries  have to transpose this EU directive into national law by 21 December 2020.  Article 40 of the EECC, which replaces the above-mentioned Article 13a, contains detailed  security requirements for electronic communication providers. Article 41 of the EECC, which  replaces Article 13b, outlines how competent authority can enforce these security requirements.  Although the security requirements under the EECC are similar to the security requirements  under the Framework directive, there are important differences. An overview of the main  differences can be found in an ENISA policy paper about the EECC. As with Article 13a, ENISA  will support the EU Member States with the implementation of Article 40 of the EECC, to ensure  there is an effective, efficient, and harmonized approach to security supervision across the EU.  To reflect this legislative change the Article 13a group has changed its name to ECASEC,  European Competent Authorities for Secure Electronic Communications.  This document, the Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC, provides guidance to  competent authorities about the technical details of implementing Articles 40 and 41 of the  EECC: how to ensure that providers assess risks and take appropriate security measures.  1 Now known as the ‘ECASEC Expert Group’  2 In addition to protection of consumers, the EECC actually promotes interest of EU citizens. For example, one of the  objectives listed in the Article 3, paragraphs (d), is to “promote the interests of the citizens of the Union, by ensuring  connectivity and the widespread availability and take-up of very high capacity networks, including fixed, mobile and wireless  networks, and of electronic communications services”.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/security-supervision-changes-in-the-new-eu-telecoms-legislation  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  5  The structure of this guideline is as follows: The guideline lists 29 high-level security objectives,  which are grouped in 8 security domains. For each security objective we list specific detailed  security measures which could be taken by providers to reach the security objective. These  security measures are grouped in 3 levels of increasing sophistication. We also give examples  of evidence, which could be taken into account by an auditor, for example, when assessing if  these security measures are actually in place. The overall structure is depicted in the diagram  below.  Figure 1: Overall structure of the security objectives and security measures  One size does not fit all: Neither the high-level security objectives nor the detailed security  measures should be seen as binding recommendations about which are appropriate security  measures for providers to take. The reason is that the electronic communications sector is very  diverse; large incumbents, small service providers, black fibre operators, virtual mobile network  operators, ISPs offering only DSL, etc. In each setting the risks are different and it is up to the  providers to assess the risks and decide which are appropriate security measures to take. This  document is intended as a tool for competent authorities supervising the sector. It could be used  as a structure for self-assessments, audits and audit reports, guidance for providers, or as a  mapping to international network and information security standards used in the electronic  communications sector.  General security guideline supplemented by specific security profiles: The security  measures in this guideline are technology-neutral. They should be applicable to a wide range of  different types of technologies. As a supplement to this guideline we are developing more  detailed guidance for specific networks and technology, such as 5G. This security guideline,  together with the 5G supplement3, addresses the relevant technical measures in the EU toolbox  of risk mitigating measures for 5G networks.  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement-security-measures-under-eecc  https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=64468 https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=64468 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement-security-measures-under-eecc  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  6  Figure 2: Structure of the ENISA Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  7  1. INTRODUCTION  This document provides technical guidance to the national authorities tasked with supervising  the security of electronic communication networks and services (hereinafter Competent  Authorities), and in particular the security measures mentioned in Article 40 the European  Electronic Communications Code4 (hereinafter EECC).  1.1 TARGET AUDIENCE  This guideline is for experts from competent authorities in the EU Member States tasked with  the implementation of Article 40 of the EECC.  This guideline may be useful also for experts working in the EU’s electronic communications  sector and experts working in cyber security.  1.2 GOAL  This document aims to give guidance to competent authorities about the security measures  described in Article 40 of the EECC and the enforcement described in Article 41 of the EECC.  1.3 VERSIONS AND CHANGES  ENISA updates this guideline periodically, when necessary, in agreement with the competent  authorities.  This fourth version of the Guideline constitutes an update to the Guideline published on 10  December 2020.  List of the main changes in the fourth version:   Corrections to select measures and evidence in Security Objective 2: ‘Governance and  risk management’   Updated the name of Security Objective 4 to ‘Security of third-party dependencies’ and  expanded its measure a)   Amended the description underneath Security Objective 14: Protection of security  critical data’. Furthermore, amended measure a) and evidence i. of this objective   Amended Section 5.8: ‘Mapping Security Domains’, primarily by way of additions   Amended Section 5.9: ‘Mapping Security Objectives’, primarily by way of mapping  additional ISO27002:2013 controls   Introduced corrections throughout the Guideline, including to referencing international  standards  4 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018L1972&from=EN  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018L1972&from=EN  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  8  Structure of this document  In Section 2 we summarize the role and objectives of ENISA related to the implementation of  Article 40 of the EECC. In Section 3 we introduce Article 40, the scope and the terminology  used in this document. In Section 4 we list 29 security objectives, divided in 9 domains, and we  provide details about security measures and evidence. In Section 5 we give guidance on  potential regulatory activities competent authorities could deploy to assess compliance to the  security measures required by Article 40 of the EECC. In Section 6 we provide a mapping from  the security measures in this guideline to some well-known international standards.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  9  2. BACKGROUND  In this section we summarize the EU policy context and we explain ENISA’s role and objectives.  2.1 EU POLICY CONTEXT  The European Electronic Communications Code, the EECC, is an EU directive, meaning that  EU countries have to transpose it into national legislation. The deadline for this transposition  was 21 December 2020. The new EECC has now replaced the four EU directives. In this paper,  we refer to these directives as the “old rules”.  • The Framework Directive, which is based on the Framework Directive 2002/21/EC as  amended by Directive 2009/140/EC.  • The Access Directive, which is based on the Access Directive 2002/19/EC and amended  by Directive 2009/140/EC.  • The Authorisation Directive is based on the Authorisation Directive 2002/20/EC and  amended by Directive 2009/140/EC.  • The Universal Service Directive is based on the Universal Service Directive 2002/22/EC  and the Citizens' Rights Directive 2009/136/EC.  These rules were last modified in 2009 as part of a wider EU telecom reform, which included  also the ePrivacy directive5, addressing confidentiality and privacy in electronic communications  and the BEREC regulation6, establishing the Body of European telecom regulators.  2.2 ENISA’S ROLE  Article 40 of the EECC asks ENISA to facilitate harmonization on the security aspects.  The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (‘ENISA’) shall facilitate, in  accordance with Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council  (7), the coordination of Member States to avoid diverging national requirements that may create  security risks and barriers to the internal market.  5 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58  6 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32009R1211&from=EN  7 Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 concerning the European  Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 (OJ L 165,  18.6.2013, p. 41).  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32009R1211&from=EN  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  10  3. EECC DEFINITIONS AND  TERMINOLOGY  3.1 EECC DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGY  In this section we introduce the relevant parts of the EECC and the related terms used in this  document.  3.1.1 EECC: Articles 40 and 41 and relevant recitals  Most of the security requirements are contained in Article 40 and Article 41 of the EECC.  For the sake of reference we quote Article 40 and Article 41 in full below.  Article 40 Security of networks and services  1.  Member States shall ensure that providers of public electronic communications  networks or of publicly available electronic communications services take appropriate  and proportionate technical and organisational measures to appropriately manage the  risks posed to the security of networks and services. Having regard to the state of the  art, those measures shall ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk presented.  In particular, measures, including encryption where appropriate, shall be taken to  prevent and minimise the impact of security incidents on users and on other networks  and services.  The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (‘ENISA’) shall  facilitate, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament  and of the Council (45), the coordination of Member States to avoid diverging national  requirements that may create security risks and barriers to the internal market.  2.  Member States shall ensure that providers of public electronic communications  networks or of publicly available electronic communications services notify without  undue delay the competent authority of a security incident that has had a significant  impact on the operation of networks or services.  In order to determine the significance of the impact of a security incident, where  available the following parameters shall, in particular, be taken into account:  (a) the number of users affected by the security incident;  (b) the duration of the security incident;  (c) the geographical spread of the area affected by the security incident;  (d) the extent to which the functioning of the network or service is affected;  (e) the extent of impact on economic and societal activities.  Where appropriate, the competent authority concerned shall inform the competent  authorities in other Member States and ENISA. The competent authority concerned  may inform the public or require the providers to do so, where it determines that  disclosure of the security incident is in the public interest.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  11  Once a year, the competent authority concerned shall submit a summary report to the  Commission and to ENISA on the notifications received and the action taken in  accordance with this paragraph.  3. Member States shall ensure that in the case of a particular and significant threat of a  security incident in public electronic communications networks or publicly available  electronic communications services, providers of such networks or services shall  inform their users potentially affected by such a threat of any possible protective  measures or remedies which can be taken by the users. Where appropriate, providers  shall also inform their users of the threat itself.  4. This Article is without prejudice to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive  2002/58/EC.  5. The Commission, taking utmost account of ENISA’s opinion, may adopt  implementing acts detailing the technical and organisational measures referred to in  paragraph 1, as well as the circumstances, format and procedures applicable to  notification requirements pursuant to paragraph 2. They shall be based on European  and international standards to the greatest extent possible, and shall not prevent  Member States from adopting additional requirements in order to pursue the objectives  set out in paragraph 1.  Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination  procedure referred to in Article 118(4).  Article 41 Implementation and enforcement  1. Member States shall ensure that, in order to implement Article 40, the competent  authorities have the power to issue binding instructions, including those regarding the  measures required to remedy a security incident or prevent one from occurring when a  significant threat has been identified and time-limits for implementation, to providers of  public electronic communications networks or publicly available electronic  communications services.  2. Member States shall ensure that competent authorities have the power to require  providers of public electronic communications networks or publicly available electronic  communications services to:  (a) provide information needed to assess the security of their networks and  services, including documented security policies; and  (b) submit to a security audit carried out by a qualified independent body or a  competent authority and make the results thereof available to the competent  authority; the cost of the audit shall be paid by the provider.  3. Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities have all the powers  necessary to investigate cases of non-compliance and the effects thereof on the  security of the networks and services.  4. Member States shall ensure that, in order to implement Article 40, the competent  authorities have the power to obtain the assistance of a Computer Security Incident  Response Team (‘CSIRT’) designated pursuant to Article 9 of Directive (EU)  2016/1148 in relation to issues falling within the tasks of the CSIRTs pursuant to point  2 of Annex I to that Directive.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  12  5. The competent authorities shall, where appropriate and in accordance with national  law, consult and cooperate with the relevant national law enforcement authorities, the  competent authorities within the meaning of Article 8(1) of Directive (EU) 2016/1148  and the national data protection authorities.  In addition, we include full or partial text of several recitals that are of direct or indirect relevance  for ensuring security of networks and services:  (17) Interpersonal communications services are services that enable interpersonal and  interactive exchange of information, covering services like traditional voice calls  between two individuals but also all types of emails, messaging services, or group  chats. Interpersonal communications services only cover communications between a  finite, that is to say not potentially unlimited, number of natural persons, which is  determined by the sender of the communication.  (18) […] The mere use of a number as an identifier should not be considered to be  equivalent to the use of a number to connect with publicly assigned numbers and  should therefore, in itself, not be considered to be sufficient to qualify a service as a  number-based interpersonal communications service.  (94) […] Security measures should take into account, as a minimum, all the relevant  aspects of the following elements: as regards security of networks and facilities:  physical and environmental security, security of supply, access control to networks and  integrity of networks; as regards handling of security incidents: handling procedures,  security incident detection capability, security incident reporting and communication; as  regards business continuity management: service continuity strategy and contingency  plans, disaster recovery capabilities; as regards monitoring, auditing and testing:  monitoring and logging policies, exercise contingency plans, network and service  testing, security assessments and compliance monitoring; and compliance with  international standards.  (95) […] independent inter personal communications services, […] are also subject to  appropriate security requirements in accordance with their specific nature and  economic importance. Providers of such services should thus also ensure a level of  security appropriate to the risk posed. Given that providers of number -independent  interpersonal communications services normally do not exercise actual control over the  transmission of signals over networks, the degree of risk for such services can be  considered in some respects to be lower than for traditional electronic communications  services. Therefore, where justified on the basis of the actual assessment of the  security risks involved, the measures taken by providers of number-independent  interpersonal communications services should be lighter.  […]  (96) Providers […] should inform users of particular and significant security threats and  of measures they can take to protect the security of their communications, for instance  by using specific types of software or encryption technologies. […]  (97) In order to safeguard security of networks and services, and without prejudice to  the Member States’ powers to ensure the protection of their essential security interests  and public security, and to permit the investigation, detection and prosecution of  criminal offences, the use of encryption for example, end-to-end where appropriate,  should be promoted and, where necessary, encryption should be mandatory in  accordance with the principles of security and privacy by default and by design.  (98) Competent authorities should ensure that the integrity and availability of public  electronic communications networks are maintained. The European Union Agency for  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  13  Network and Information Security (‘ENISA’) should contribute to an enhanced level of  security of electronic communications by, inter alia, providing expertise and advice,  and promoting the exchange of best practices. The competent authorities should have  the necessary means to perform their duties, including powers to request the  information necessary to assess the level of security of networks or services. They  should also have the power to request comprehensive and reliable data about actual  security incidents that have had a significant impact on the operation of networks or  services. They should, where necessary, be assisted by Computer Security Incident  Response Teams (‘CSIRTs’) established by Directive (EU) 2016/ 1148 of the  European Parliament and of the Council8. In particular, CSIRTs may be required to  provide competent authorities with information about risks and security incidents  affecting public electronic communications networks and publicly available electronic  communications services, and recommend ways to address them.  3.2 TERMINOLOGY  We reiterate some of the definitions and terms used extensively in this document.  3.2.1 Security of networks and services  Article 2 (21) of the EECC defines ‘security of networks and services’ as the ability of electronic  communications networks and services to resist, at a given level of confidence, any action that  compromises the availability9, authenticity10, integrity11 or confidentiality12 of those networks and  services, of stored or transmitted or processed data, or of the related services offered by, or  accessible via, those electronic communications networks or services.  3.2.2 Security incidents  Article 2 (42) of the EECC defines ‘security incident’ as an event having an actual adverse effect  on the security of electronic communications networks or services.  3.2.3 Competent authorities  The term ‘competent authorities’ is used in this document in line with the terminology used in  Article 41 of the EECC, meaning those national authorities with competences to supervise  Article 40, the implementation of security measures in the national telecom sector13. In practice  these competences may be split or shared between multiple national authorities.  3.2.4 Security measures  Article 40 of the EECC defines ‘security measures’ as technical and organisational measures for  managing the risks posed to the security of networks and services.  3.2.5 NI-ICS  Article 2 (7) of the EECC defines a ‘number-independent interpersonal communications service’  as an interpersonal communications service, which does not connect with “publicly assigned  numbering resources”, meaning (national or international) telephone numbers, or which does  not enable communication with these (national or international) telephone numbers. In this  document we use the acronym NI ICS for the sake of brevity.  8 Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high  common level of security of network and information systems across the Union (OJ L 194, 19.7.2016, p. 1).  9Availability is typically defined as a property of being accessible and usable on demand by an authorized entity (ISO/IEC  27000:2018)  10 Authenticity is typically defined as a property that an entity is what it claims to be (ISO/IEC 27000:2018)  11 Integrity is typically defined as a property of accuracy and completeness (ISO/IEC 27000:2018)  12 Confidentiality is typically defined as a property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized  individuals, entities, or processes (ISO/IEC 27000:2018)  13 Previous versions of this guideline used the abbreviation NRA, National Regulatory Authority.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  14  4. SECURITY MEASURES  In this section we provide a list of 29 security objectives which competent authorities should  take into account when assessing compliance of providers to Article 40 of the EECC.  We stress that this is only a guideline for competent authorities and that it is at the discretion of  competent authorities to mandate or recommend different or additional security objectives, or  different security measures.  Note that some of the security objectives or security measures may not be relevant or  appropriate in all settings for all types of providers, depending on the type of networks or  services offered14.  4.1 ASSETS IN SCOPE AND RISK ASSESSMENT  The scope of the security measures is defined as follows.  Assets in scope: All assets15 of the provider (including relevant third party assets) which, when  compromised and/or failing, can have a negative impact on the security of networks and  services.  Providers should perform analysis, specific for their particular setting, to determine which assets  are in scope and should subsequently conduct risk assessment to determine which security  measures are appropriate. Risk assessments need updating, to address changes and past  incidents, because risks change over time. Note that this guideline does not address risk  assessment in detail. There are several standard methodologies providers could use for this  (see References).  Remark on classical information security risk management: It is good to mention here that  there is a lot of information security literature which focusses on how an organization can  manage the information security risks related to the use of network and information security, for  example through the establishment of an information security management system. A well-  known example of a related standard is ISO 27001. Article 40 of the EECC, however, focuses  primarily on risks for the users who rely on the networks and communications services provided  by the provider, and not the risks for the provider. This means in practice that, while enterprise  risk management methodologies are very helpful, they may not be fully suitable to be used for  the EECC without adaptation.  4.1.1 Primary and secondary assets  In some literature there is a distinction between primary assets and secondary (supporting)  assets. In this context (Article 40 of the EECC) the primary assets are the electronic  communication networks and services provided by the provider.  In this document when we speak about assets we mean the secondary assets i.e. the systems  and processes supporting the provision of electronic communications networks and services  (such as base stations, routers, registers, power supply, etc.).  14 For example, in the case of dark fibre providers certain security measures may not be applicable because these  providers do not directly deal with subscribers and do not have much staff.  15 A widely used generic definition of an asset is “something that has value”. We provide more details about assets in  sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  15  4.2 CRITICAL ASSETS  In the remainder of this document, we use the term critical assets for assets (network and  information systems, processes, data, etc.) which, when compromised and/or fail, there would  be a severe impact on the security of networks and services. When determining severity of the  impact, factors like type (e.g. whether the materialisation of a threat leads to compromised  confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of the network) and scale of impact (e.g. in terms of  affected users, duration, sensitivity of information altered or accessed) could be considered16.  Parameters related to determination of significance of the impact of a security incident as listed  in EECC Article 40 (2) and reproduced in section 3.1 should also be taken into account.  Critical assets should (obviously) be protected with priority.  4.2.1 Personnel and key personnel  In this document the term “personnel” refers to employees, contractors, and third-party users.  We use the term “key personnel” to refer to the key roles in the organization with respect to  security of networks and services. Now providers are not all the same and organizations and job  profiles are different, but typically this would include roles like the CEO, the CIO, the CISO, the  business continuity manager and system administrators of critical systems.  4.2.2 Third parties and outsourcing  In this document we use the term “third parties” to refer to parties (organizations, individuals) the  provider works with to deliver the services, i.e. vendors the provider buys products from,  suppliers, consultants who advise the provider, auditors auditing the provider, companies the  provider outsources work to, and so on17.  Third parties and third party assets are in scope just as if they were assets of the providers. In  other words, even if certain processes are outsourced, the provider remains responsible for  ensuring that appropriate security measures are taken to protect the security of networks and  services it is providing.  4.3 STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITY MEASURES  This document lists 29 security objectives18 which have been derived from a set of international  and national standards that are commonly used by providers in the EU’s electronic  communication sector (see References). For each of the security objectives we list more  detailed security measures which could be implemented by providers to reach the security  objective. For each security objective we also list detailed evidence which could indicate that the  measures are in place. Note that the security measures or the evidence should not be seen as  a baseline or list of minimum requirements for providers (see the remark below).  The security measures are grouped in 3 different sophistication levels, defined as follows.  16 These criteria are in line with the criteria used in the EU Coordinated risk assessment of the cybersecurity of 5G  networks. Further guidance related to critical asset identification pertaining to 5G networks specifically is provided in the  supplement of this document - security profile for 5G MNOs.  17 Therefore, in this document, the term ‘third parties’ does not refer to customers, the public, or government or regulatory  authorities.  18 In information security governance literature these are also sometimes referred to as ‘control objectives’.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  16  Figure 3: Structure of the security measures  The levels are cumulative. In other words, at level 2 we do not repeat the security measures and  the evidence for level 1, for the sake of brevity, but they are understood to be included  (accumulated). And similarly at level 3 the security measures are understood to include the  ones of levels 1 and 2. If the measures at level 1 are not (fully) implemented than this could be  called level 0, but we do not explicitly mention level 0 in this document.  The overall structure of the security objectives and security measures is depicted as following.  Figure 4: Overall structure of the security objectives and security measures  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  17  Remark about baselines and minimum security measures: Neither the high-level security  objectives in this document nor the detailed security measures should be seen as binding  recommendations about which are appropriate security measures for providers to take. So, for  example, the security measures at level 1 are not to be considered “the minimum” for the sector.  Risks are different for different providers and it depends on the specifics (the setting, the type of  provider, the type of services offered, the assets in question, etc.) which security objectives are  important and which measures are appropriate.  Remark about separate measures: We list a number of individual security measures, one by  one. But this should not be seen as a recommendation to split security activities into parts, or to  keep separate standalone documents or files for each measure. For example, one could  imagine using a single inventory of assets could be used for risk assessment, change  management and asset management procedures.  Remark about technological limitations and implementation feasibility: Some of the  recommended measures may be more difficult (or not simply not feasible) to implement in an  old or legacy systems with outdated equipment, using old technology and/or relying on old  standards and network protocols. In such cases, it is advisable to have limitations and  exclusions stated and documented and to consider including formal decommissioning plans for  these old or legacy systems.  4.4 SECURITY OBJECTIVES AND SECURITY MEASURES  Below we list 29 high-level security objectives (SO1, SO2, etc.), grouped in 8 domains (D1, D2,  etc.). For each security objective we list detailed security measures, which could be  implemented by the provider, as well as the type of evidence that could be taken into  consideration by an auditor, for example, when assessing if measures are in place.

TECHNICAL SUPERVISION  OF SECURITY MEASURES  The principles of security supervision under the new rules (Article 40 and 41 of the EECC) are a  continuation of the old rules (Article 13a and Article 13b of the Framework directive). Under the  new rules, as with under the old rules:   Communication providers have to assess risks, take appropriate security measures  and report significant incidents to competent authorities (Article 13a of the Framework  directive, Article 40 of the EECC).   Competent authorities should have powers to supervise this, to enquire about  measures in place, and to investigate cases of non-compliance by providers (Article  13b of the Framework directive, Article 41 of the EECC).  This means that for the new rules competent authorities can build on the experience and  practice developed under the old rules.  The most common regulatory activities of competent authorities regarding supervision of  security measures are 37:   Mandating or recommending a security standard   Assessing compliance across the market   Taking a staged approach to supervision   Auditing providers (periodically, at random, and/or post-incident)  In the remainder of this section we discuss the technical aspects of each of these activities.  5.1 MANDATING OR RECOMMENDING A SECURITY STANDARD  There could be several reasons for mandating or recommending a standard of security  measures:   to provide guidance about what security measures should be implemented, for  example by explaining high-level objectives or detailed security measures.   to provide a terminology for discussing about security objectives or security  measures.   to provide a structure for supervision and auditing, by dividing security in different  domains.   to provide a baseline, i.e. a minimum set of security measures that must be in place,  for example because without basic security measures it may be difficult to conduct an  audit, because key evidence, like logs, records about incidents, etc. may be missing.   to provide a mapping between different existing standards, for example, to be able to  compare compliance and audit reports which are based on different standards.  Following we go into detail about the different options.  37 This list is based on input from a survey, asking competent authorities across the EU, which are the activities they are  deploying or planning to deploy.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  43  5.1.1 Mandating versus recommending a security standard  When discussing the supervision of security legislation by government authorities there is often  a discussion about whether or not the government authority should mandate a specific list of  security measures, strongly recommend them, or just recommend them as guidance. One could  argue that mandating a standard would create clarity about what providers need to do to be  compliant. On the other hand, one could also argue that in most settings the sector, the  organizations involved, the technology used, is just too diverse to allow for a single checklist of  minimum security measures for the entire sector. Often only very high-level security standards  could be reasonably applied to a wider number of organizations. Inevitably such high-level  standards leave a lot of important technical details unaddressed. So it is hard to capture all the  security requirements of Article 40 of the EECC comprehensively in one standard. At the same  time for specific settings or specific issues the competent authority could mandate specific  security measures to be taken. For instance, a competent authority could ask all providers to  provide the competent authority with a contact point in case of contingencies, or ask all  providers to have 4 hours of backup power for their base station controllers.  Note that when mandating security measures for specific aspects, it is important that competent  authorities discuss with providers about effectiveness and feasibility beforehand. Such  discussions could be triggered by large incidents or focus happened in the past period, frequent  root causes, and/or other common issues (for example, about software vulnerabilities in  common IT equipment).  Best practices in network and information security are rapidly changing, because information  technology changes rapidly and because the capability of attackers changes rapidly. The  competent authority is in a unique role to support and foster the exchange of and discussion  about best practices between experts of different providers. In this way the competent authority  supports that best practices are adopted across the sector. Especially providers with less  experience and less expertise could benefit greatly from such discussions and exchanges.  5.1.2 Using the ENISA guideline as a recommendation  Competent authorities could use this ENISA guideline to provide guidance to providers. The  ENISA guideline consists of 29 high level security objectives derived from different standards  (see References). To reach the security objectives, providers should choose appropriate  technical security measures. This document lists detailed security measures which providers  could take to reach the security objectives. The security measures are split in three  (sophistication) levels ranging from 1) basic, to 2) industry standard, to 3) state of the art.  Providers should assess the risks to their communications networks and services to understand  which security measures are appropriate.  5.1.3 Using the ENISA guideline as a mapping  Many (especially larger) providers already have a security standard or a security governance  framework in place, often based on international standards. This ENISA guideline could be used  as a neutral mapping to different standards in use by the industry. Such a mapping would allow  providers to continue use existing international standards, and it would avoid incurring  unnecessary costs for providers when complying with the requirements of Article 40 of the  EECC.  In practice, for example, providers could show compliance to Article 40 of the EECC by  providing audit reports or certification against existing industry standards, combined with a  mapping from these standards to this ENISA guideline. In Section 6 we provide an example of  such a mapping to some well-known international security standards.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  44  5.1.4 Using existing national or international standards or best practices  Competent authorities could refer to existing national or international standards or requirements,  either as a baseline requirement or as a recommendation. An overview of standards widely  used in the industry is included in the section References. Competent authorities should take  into account national circumstances when choosing an appropriate set of standards or best  practices. We would like to make three remarks in this regard:   Competent authorities should take into account that some (especially the large)  providers may operate in several EU countries, and that it would be cumbersome for  these providers to adopt different standards in different countries. In this respect it  could be useful to allow providers to use international standards which are widely used  across the EU and in this way reduce compliance costs for these providers.   In most countries the electronic communications sector is large (hundreds of providers)  and contains both large providers (>10% of market share) and very small ones (<1% of  market share). Competent authorities should also take into account the differences  between the providers in their country. What might work for large providers may well  be overwhelming for smaller providers, and vice versa, what might work for one  provider might be inappropriate for another provider.   Finally, competent authorities should take into account that best practices in network  and information security are rapidly changing, because information technology  changes rapidly and because the capability of attackers changes rapidly. This makes it  hard to capture the high-level security requirement of Article 40 of the EECC  comprehensively in a list of detailed security measures. In this light, competent  authorities should focus first on supervising that providers assess risks and proactively  take appropriate security measures, rather than on trying to cast detailed security  measures in stone.  5.2 ASSESSING COMPLIANCE ACROSS THE MARKET  Self-assessments could be used to get an overview of the kind of security measures taken by  providers, across the sector. The security objectives and measures listed in Section 4 can be  used directly in self-assessment forms. The sophistication levels (see Section 4) would allow  providers to indicate, per security objective, what kind of security measures are in place. Used  in this way the sophistication levels would allow for a quick comparison between providers  across the sector. We give an example in the diagram below. Here the red bars indicate the  level of sophistication of the security measures taken by one provider, while the green bars  show the levels for a provider with less sophisticated security measures. Such a difference in  sophistication may be justified by a difference in the type of services or networks being offered  by the two providers.  Figure 5: Example of two different providers (green and red), with security measures at different  levels of sophistication.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  45  Depending on the motivation behind the assessment the competent authority could focus on a  subset of security objectives. For example, a competent authority could be interested in a  domain like business continuity or specific security objectives around change management.  Competent authorities could also restrict self-assessments to a subset of the sector, for instance  providers with a certain number of users (more than 10% market share e.g.), a certain service  (mobile networks, e.g.), or providers offering certain critical services (communications for ports  and airports e.g.).  We provide two simplified examples of how a competent authority could set up a self-  assessment form. In the first example, the competent authority assesses security measures  across all providers in the sector, but with a focus on a subset of the security objectives.  Example: The competent authority of country D has organized a self-assessment focused  on governance and risk management (domain D1 in the ENISA guideline). Self-assessment  forms are emailed to all providers:  Indicate your estimate market share: (choose from <1%, >10%, >10%)  Indicate which service you are offering:  (fixed/mobile telephony, fixed/mobile  internet)  Per security objective, indicate the level of sophistication and if you can produce  evidence.  SO1: Information security policy  Sophistication level: (choose from 0, 1, 2, 3). Evidence exists: (choose from yes, no).  SO2: Governance and risk management framework  Sophistication level: (choose from 0, 1, 2, 3). Evidence exists: (choose from yes, no).  SO3: Security roles and responsibilities  Sophistication level: (choose from 0, 1, 2, 3). Evidence exists: (choose from yes, no).  SO4: Managing third party networks or services  Sophistication level: (choose from 0, 1, 2, 3). Evidence exists: (choose from yes, no).  In the second example the competent authority focuses on a subset of security measures and a  subset of providers:  Example: The competent authority in country E wants to focus on the issues behind a  number of large mobile network outages in the past year which are caused by power cuts,  cable cuts, and natural disasters. The competent authority focusses on the security  measures which are most relevant in this context. Self-assessment forms are sent only to  mobile network operators with large market share (>10%). Questions are a combination of  multiple choice and open questions for a description of security measures in place, and open  questions for the type of evidence that the provider can produce to substantiate answers.  For each of the security objectives SO9 (Physical and environmental security), SO10  (Security of supplies), SO21 (Service continuity strategy and contingency plans),  SO22 (Disaster recovery capabilities), SO24 (Exercise contingency plans), indicate the  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  46  level of sophistication, on a scale from 0 to 3 (0 none, 1 basic, 2 industry standard, 3  state of the art):  Describe the security measures in place to reach the objective: (max 200 words)  Describe the evidence you could provide to the competent authority which could substantiate  that measures are in place: (0 none, 1 internal documentation, 2 audit report from external  auditor)  Remark about confidentiality: Self-assessment results or profiles could be sensitive and it is  important to ensure confidentiality of results from other providers and/or the public. It is  important to explain clearly the purpose of the assessment (for example, by explaining that  there are no regulatory consequences) and to give explicit guarantees to providers about  confidentiality of the results.  5.3 SUPERVISION REGIME FOR NI-ICS PROVIDERS  In general, the security provisions in the EECC for NI-ICS are the same as for the number-  based services. Both are subject to (normal) ex-ante, supervision, and are required to provide  information, submit to security audits and be subjected to investigation of non-compliance by  the competent authorities. However, because these providers of do not normally exercise actual  control over the transmission networks, there may be different risks for these providers, and  certain security measures may not be needed, if justified on the basis of a risk assessment38.  See the recital 95:  (95) […] independent inter personal communications services, […] are also  subject to appropriate security requirements in accordance with their specific  nature and economic importance. Providers of such services should thus also  ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk posed. Given that providers of  number -independent interpersonal communications services normally do not  exercise actual control over the transmission of signals over networks, the  degree of risk for such services can be considered in some respects to be  lower than for traditional electronic communications services. Therefore,  where justified on the basis of the actual assessment of the security risks  involved, the measures taken by providers of number-independent  interpersonal communications services should be lighter.  […]  In practice this means that, depending on the setting, the type of network or service offered, the  assets involved, etc., some of the security measures in this guideline may not be fully applicable  to NI-ICS providers. When assessing the compliance of providers with Article 40, competent  authorities should take into account the type of network or service offered, the assets involved,  the threats and resulting risks for this network or service.  5.4 TECHNOLOGY PROFILES  This guideline on security measures is technology neutral. To provide more specific guidance  for specific types of network/service providers, we supplement this guideline with “security  profiles”, for technologies like 5G or providers NI ICS. These security profiles supplement this  38 Security Supervision under the EECC, ENISA, January 2020, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/supporting-the- implementation-of-the-european-electronic-commmunications-code-eecc/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/supporting-the-implementation-of-the-european-electronic-commmunications-code-eecc/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/supporting-the-implementation-of-the-european-electronic-commmunications-code-eecc/  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  47  generic and technology-agnostic guideline. The following supplementary security profiles are  under development and will be published separately:   Security profile for 5G MNOs, containing supplementary guidance for technical  supervision of security measures for 5G MNOs;   Security profile for NI-ICS providers, containing supplementary guidance on number-  independent interpersonal communication services (NI-ICS).  Figure 6: ENISA Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC – Technologies Supplements  5.5 TAKING A STAGED APPROACH  Depending on the national circumstances, competent authorities might want to adopt a staged  approach in supervising (and enforcing) compliance to the security requirements of Article 40 of  the EECC. In case some providers do not (yet) have appropriate security measures in place (or  if they cannot provide evidence of this), competent authorities may want to give providers some  time to comply, in stages. Competent authorities could use this guideline to adopt a staged  approach. We discuss some possible options for staging:   Services or assets in scope: One could first focus on a subset of services (for  example mobile networks) or a subset of assets (for example, core network), and deal  with other services later.  Example: The competent authority in country A wants to focus first on the mobile  networks, because they are (nationally) the most critical. The competent authority  starts with a self-assessment across providers of mobile networks. The scope of  the assessment is ‘assets supporting mobile networks’. Other services are out of  scope initially, as well as providers who do not offer mobile telephony networks.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  48   Providers in scope: One could first focus on a subset of providers, for example  providers with a large market share, and look at other providers at a later stage.  Example: The competent authority in country B wants to focus first on the providers  with large market share, because here a lot of users are at stake. The competent  authority starts with collecting self-assessment reports from the main providers  (>10% of market share). The survey is followed up by a series of workshops where  the main causes of incidents are discussed. Next year the competent authority will  start a separate supervision program for smaller providers (focussed more on  guidance).   Security domains: One could first focus on a subset of security objectives, business  continuity for example, and focus on other objectives at a later stage.  Example: The competent authority in country C wants to focus first on the main  incidents, taking into account the incidents reported by providers. Since last year in  country A the incidents were mostly due to natural disasters, in the supervision the  competent authority focusses first on the measures SO9, SO10, SO21, SO22,  SO24. The competent authority will address other security measures at a later  stage.   Sophistication levels and baselines:  Competent authorities could first focus on  ensuring that all providers have taken the basic security measures, for example level 1  as defined in this guideline, and only later focus on ensuring that providers take more  sophisticated security measures. We should stress here that such an approach would  have limitations: particularly when the sector has both large and small providers: For  large providers basic security measures may be insufficient, while for small providers  they could be more than enough. It would be better to take differences across the  sector into account and define different baselines for providers of different size.  Example: The competent authority in country D defines two profiles as baselines.   The first profile contains the basic security measures for only the domains  D1 Governance and risk management, D2 Human resource security, D3  Security of systems and facilities, – it is the baseline for small providers  (<10% market share.   The second profile contains industry standard security measures for all  domains (D1, … D8)– it is the baseline for large providers (>10% of market  share).  At a later stage the competent authority will review the profiles, and where needed  raise the requirements in some areas or define different baselines for other types of  providers (IXPs e.g.).  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  49  5.6 AUDITING PROVIDERS  Depending on the setting, competent authorities might want to require providers to undergo an  audit. Depending on the setting and the goal of auditing different types of audits may be  needed. In this section we discuss different options for auditing providers.  Note that auditing is not always easy because network and information systems are often  complex. To understand if specific subsystems are working correctly, an auditor may need to  have deep knowledge and expertise: in security the devil is in the details. To give one simple  example: An auditor may find there is a firewall in place to protect certain systems, but the  detailed firewall rules determine greatly the effectiveness of the firewall. One rule with one  mistake may make the entire firewall useless.  Remark about audit costs: Competent authorities should take into account the costs of third-  party audits for providers, particularly the smaller providers. Self-assessments (see previous  section) may be a more light-weight approach.  Remark about efficiency of audits: A frequent complaint from organizations subject to  information security audits is that auditing often forces them to generate a lot of paper work, and  that this is not only useless but that it also diverts resources from the actual task at hand:  making the network and information systems secure. Competent authorities should take into  account that some providers are already partaking in compliance or certification programs  (voluntarily or in the context of different legislation) and are already undergoing (internal or  external) audits. If auditing is needed, it is important to leverage where possible existing audit  reports and compliance evidence.  Remark about language and international operators: When requesting documentation or  evidence from providers, competent authorities should take into account that providers may  keep certain relevant documentation (manuals, policies, procedures, etc.) in the English  language for efficiency reasons, because the provider operates in several countries or because  the operator employs personnel from abroad.  5.6.1 Assessment types  An audit involves different types of assessments, for example a review of security policies or an  interview with the CISO about contingency planning. Audits usually consist of a combination of  different types of assessments. We discuss the different types below:   Document review: Document review is essential in any audit. Relevant documents  may include descriptions of policies, roles and responsibilities, descriptions of  processes and procedures, systems architecture and design, test procedures and  actual test results. Chapter 4 of this guideline includes descriptions of evidence which  could be considered when assessing the implementation of security measures.   Interviews: In addition to document review, a lot of information may be collected by  interviewing service provider employees. At small providers it may be enough to speak  to one or two persons with commercial and technical responsibility. At large providers,  typical roles to be interviewed are C-level managers (CIO), chief security officers (CSO  or CISO), tactical/operational security officers, NOC managers, internal CERT team,  product managers, and system administrators responsible for critical processes or  systems.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  50   System evaluation: Besides documentation, certification, and interviews, the ultimate  check to see if the networks and information systems are secure, and if  policy/procedures are being applied in practice, is by inspecting or testing the system  itself. In some settings system review may be needed, for example to understand how  a security incident could have happened. System evaluation should focus on critical  systems because it can be time-consuming.  5.6.2 Auditor types  Auditing can be carried out by different parties.   Self-assessment: In self-assessments there is really no auditor, but the personnel of  the provider assesses and reports about compliance. Although self-assessment  reports may be biased, they can provide useful information for providers and  competent authorities. An advantage of self-assessments is that self-assessments are  relatively cheap for providers. Earlier in this document, in  Section 5.2, we discuss self-  assessments in more detail.   Internal auditor: In large organizations, a provider could ask an internal security role  or internal audit department to do an audit of certain systems or parts of the  organization. Compared to self-assessments, an internal auditor may be less biased.  An advantage is that internal auditors often know the organization inside out. Also  internal auditors could more easily leverage the deep knowledge about the network  and information systems at the provider.   External auditor: An audit report from an external auditor is even less biased. The  only issue here may be that the external auditor may not know all the details about the  organization and/or the network and information systems. This would make the entire  audit more costly, because on the one hand the external auditor would need to  dedicate a lot of time to study the setting and systems at the provider, and the provider  would also need to dedicate a lot of time to providing the necessary information to the  auditor.   Competent authority as auditor: The competent authority could carry out an audit of  an provider, by using internal staff with auditing expertise, or by outsourcing the  auditing to an auditing firm.   Certifying auditor: In certification a licensed auditor checks compliance to a specific  standard. The audit report results in a certificate of compliance issued by a certifying  authority. For example it is quite common for large providers to be ISO 27001 certified.  Certification is often refreshed yearly, following a yearly re-audit. Competent authorities  could require certification, and ask providers to submit their certificates as a way to  show compliance39.   Specialist auditor: In special cases the competent authority may want to designate a  specific auditor, for a specific purpose or following a specific incident. For example, an  competent authority could mandate providers to undergo a security scan of systems by  a security scanning specialist.   Pool of auditors: The competent authority could designate a pool of external auditors.  Criteria for auditors could be based on past experience (a track record of audits, or  security tests) or be based on examination criteria. For example, competent authorities  could start with a list of licensed auditors40 and offer them a yearly training which  focuses on Article 13a requirements for the sector, in this way creating a pool of  auditors.  39 This may also include a more detailed scope statement (or a Statement of Applicability for ISO 27001).  40 In most countries, for example, there are organizations that license auditors to carry out IT audits.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  51  5.6.3 Audit timing and objectives  The frequency and objectives of auditing varies. We distinguish two types of audits.   Preventive audits: Preventive audits are usually done at fixed intervals, periodically.  In the case of certification (see above) audits are carried out yearly or bi-yearly.  Preventive audits often do not have a specific scope, however it is good practice to set-  up preventive periodic audits according to a multi-year plan and focus first on certain  (important) issues and only later on other issues in subsequent audits. The frequency  of auditing should take into account that providers may need some time to address  deficiencies found in previous audits.  Example: The competent authority in country H mandates providers to undergo  yearly (preventive) audits by 3rd party auditors. To simplify matters and to reduce  the burden for providers, the competent authority works according to a 3 year  supervision plan, focussing on urgent issues first: In the first year the scope of  audits is restricted to business continuity, natural disasters and power cuts  (measures SM9, SM10, SM21, SM22, SM24). In the second year the focus is on  the storage and retention of customer data. In the third year all security measures  will be audited.   Post-incident audits: Post-incident auditing by an competent authority is usually done  ad-hoc, depending on the type of incident and the setting. Post-incident audits have a  specific focus – and usually they are aimed at assessing if security measures are in  place to prevent the incident from re-occurring. The audit in this case has a specific  scope (the services affected by the incident, the assets affected) and regards specific  security measures (measures failing during the incident, or measures which could  prevent re-occurrence).  5.7 AUTHORISATIONS CONDITIONS  5.7.1 Authorisations  Member States are allowed to attach general authorisation conditions concerning the security of  public networks. This was already envisaged under the “old rules” (Directive 2009/140/EC) and  is also included in the Annex I of the EECC.  For the sake of clarity, in the next section we highlight those conditions listed in the Annex I of  the EECC that are of particular relevance for the security of networks and services.  5.7.2 Conditions  List of conditions which may be attached to general authorisations, rights of use for radio  spectrum and rights of use for numbering resources are indicated in the Annex I of the EECC  and are grouped in different categories, for general and specific conditions.  Of those conditions, some are specifically and directly related to assuring security of networks  and services, such as:   In Category A (General conditions which may be attached to a general authorisation):  o Condition 8: Measures designed to ensure compliance with the standards or  specifications referred to in Article 39 (when standards or specifications  referred to are related to information security, e.g. ISO 27001)  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  52   In Category B (Specific conditions which may be attached to a general authorisation for  the provision of electronic communication networks):  o Condition 4: Maintenance of the integrity of public electronic communications  networks in accordance with this Directive including by conditions to prevent  electromagnetic interference between electronic communications networks or  services in accordance with Directive 2014/30/EU.  o Condition 5: Security of public networks against unauthorised access in  accordance with Directive 2002/58/EC  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  53  6 MAPPING TO  INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS  The security measures described in this document (see Section 4) have been derived from  existing international network and information security standards. This guideline is not intended  to replace existing standards or frameworks that are used by providers. Providers could map the  standards they use internally to the security measures in Section 4, and in this way show  compliance with Article 40. In this section we give two examples of such a mapping.  5.8 MAPPING SECURITY DOMAINS  Below, as an example, we map the security domains of Section 4 to a number of international  standards frequently used by providers. We map to the following standards:   ISO 27001:2013, a standard for information security management,   ISO 27002:2013, a catalogue of information security controls,   ISO 27036-3:2013, guidelines for information and communication technology supply  chain security,   ISO 27005:2018, a standard for information security risk management, and   ISO 22301:2019, a standard for business continuity management.  Security  domains  Addressed in Details  D1: Governance  and risk  management  ISO 27001,  ISO 27002, ISO  27005 and ISO  27036-3.  ISO 27001 provides a standard for governance of  information security risks.  ISO 27005 provides a standard for risk management.  ISO 27001 Section A.4 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 5) covers  Information security policies.  ISO 27001 Section A.7 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 7) covers  information security roles and responsibilities.  ISO 27001 Section A.15 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 15)  covers relationships with suppliers.  ISO 27036-3, Part 3 provides guidelines for ICT supply  chain security.  D2: Human  resources  security  ISO 27001  ISO 27002  ISO 27001 Section A.7 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 7) covers  background screening, information security roles and  responsibilities, security knowledge and training, and  personnel changes.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  54  Security  domains  Addressed in Details  D3: Security of  systems and  facilities  ISO 27001  ISO 27002  ISO 27001 Section A.11 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 11)  covers physical and environmental security.  ISO 27001 Section A.11 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 9) covers  access control to information systems and facilities.  ISO 27001 Section A.13 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 13)  covers network security.  ISO 27001 Section A.10 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 10)  covers encryption (cryptography)  D4: Operations  management  ISO 27001  ISO 27002  ISO 27001 Section A.13 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 12)  covers operational procedures and change management.  ISO 27001 Section A.8 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 8) covers  asset management.  D5: Incident  management  ISO 27001  ISO 27002  ISO 27001 Section A.16 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 16)  covers management of information security incidents, as  well as communications about security events.  D6: Business  continuity  management  ISO 27001  ISO 27002  ISO 22301  ISO 27001 Section A.11 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 17)  covers security aspects of business continuity  management.  ISO 22301 covers Business Continuity Management.  D7: Monitoring  and security  testing  ISO 27001  ISO 27002  Monitoring is covered in ISO 27001 Sections A.12 and A.15  (and in ISO 27002 Chapters 12 and 15).  Security testing and compliance reviews are covered in  ISO 27001 Sections A.14 and A.18 (and in ISO 27002  Chapters 14 and 18).  D8: Threat  awareness  ISO 27001  ISO 27002  User awareness is partially covered in ISO 27001 Section  A.7 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 7)  Management of technical vulnerabilities is covered in ISO  72001 Section A.12.6.1 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 12).  Contact with special interest groups (e.g. for exchange of  information about threats) is covered in ISO 27001 Section  A.6.1.4 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 6)  We have used ISO standards in this example, but a similar mapping could be made to other  national or international standards. For example, the mapping would look similar if, instead of  ISO 27001 and ISO 27005, we would map to the ITU standards X.1051 (information security  management) and X.1055 (risk management).  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  55  5.9 MAPPING SECURITY OBJECTIVES  One could also make a more detailed mapping.

REFERENCES 57  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  4  PREFACE  The 2009 reform of the EU legislative framework for electronic communications introduced  Article 13a and Article 13b as part of the Framework directive (Directive 2009/140/EC). This  reform was transposed into national legislation by EU Member States in 2011.  Article 13a  requires MS to ensure that providers of electronic communications manage security risks and  take appropriate security measures to guarantee the security (paragraph 1) and integrity  (paragraph 2) of these networks and services. Article 13a (paragraph 3) requires providers to  notify significant security incidents to competent national authorities, who should report about  these incidents to ENISA and the European Commission (EC) annually. Article 13b outlines  how authorities can supervise and enforce compliance with these security requirements.  In 2010, ENISA, the European Commission, and experts from ministries and telecom regulators  in the EU Member States initiated a series of meetings to achieve an efficient and harmonised  implementation of Article 13a across the EU, forming the Article 13a Expert Group1. This  group is now chaired by an expert from a national competent authority in the EU and comprises  experts from competent authorities from all EU countries as well as from some EFTA and EU  candidate countries. The Article 13a Expert Group reached consensus about two non-binding  technical guidelines for implementing Article 13a: the “Technical Guideline on Incident  Reporting” and the “Technical Guideline on Security Measures”.  In December 2018, a new set of telecom rules called the European Electronic  Communications Code (abbreviated as EECC) was adopted. The EECC updates the EU  telecom package of 2009 and paves the way for the roll out of fibre, very high capacity networks  and next generation mobile networks (5G), which will create jobs and growth, enable new  application scenarios like internet of things (IoT) and new business models. An important part of  the EECC is consumer protection2 and security of electronic communications. EU countries  have to transpose this EU directive into national law by 21 December 2020.  Article 40 of the EECC, which replaces the above-mentioned Article 13a, contains detailed  security requirements for electronic communication providers. Article 41 of the EECC, which  replaces Article 13b, outlines how competent authority can enforce these security requirements.  Although the security requirements under the EECC are similar to the security requirements  under the Framework directive, there are important differences. An overview of the main  differences can be found in an ENISA policy paper about the EECC. As with Article 13a, ENISA  will support the EU Member States with the implementation of Article 40 of the EECC, to ensure  there is an effective, efficient, and harmonized approach to security supervision across the EU.  To reflect this legislative change the Article 13a group has changed its name to ECASEC,  European Competent Authorities for Secure Electronic Communications.  This document, the Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC, provides guidance to  competent authorities about the technical details of implementing Articles 40 and 41 of the  EECC: how to ensure that providers assess risks and take appropriate security measures.  1 Now known as the ‘ECASEC Expert Group’  2 In addition to protection of consumers, the EECC actually promotes interest of EU citizens. For example, one of the  objectives listed in the Article 3, paragraphs (d), is to “promote the interests of the citizens of the Union, by ensuring  connectivity and the widespread availability and take-up of very high capacity networks, including fixed, mobile and wireless  networks, and of electronic communications services”.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/security-supervision-changes-in-the-new-eu-telecoms-legislation  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  5  The structure of this guideline is as follows: The guideline lists 29 high-level security objectives,  which are grouped in 8 security domains. For each security objective we list specific detailed  security measures which could be taken by providers to reach the security objective. These  security measures are grouped in 3 levels of increasing sophistication. We also give examples  of evidence, which could be taken into account by an auditor, for example, when assessing if  these security measures are actually in place. The overall structure is depicted in the diagram  below.  Figure 1: Overall structure of the security objectives and security measures  One size does not fit all: Neither the high-level security objectives nor the detailed security  measures should be seen as binding recommendations about which are appropriate security  measures for providers to take. The reason is that the electronic communications sector is very  diverse; large incumbents, small service providers, black fibre operators, virtual mobile network  operators, ISPs offering only DSL, etc. In each setting the risks are different and it is up to the  providers to assess the risks and decide which are appropriate security measures to take. This  document is intended as a tool for competent authorities supervising the sector. It could be used  as a structure for self-assessments, audits and audit reports, guidance for providers, or as a  mapping to international network and information security standards used in the electronic  communications sector.  General security guideline supplemented by specific security profiles: The security  measures in this guideline are technology-neutral. They should be applicable to a wide range of  different types of technologies. As a supplement to this guideline we are developing more  detailed guidance for specific networks and technology, such as 5G. This security guideline,  together with the 5G supplement3, addresses the relevant technical measures in the EU toolbox  of risk mitigating measures for 5G networks.  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement-security-measures-under-eecc  https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=64468 https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=64468 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement-security-measures-under-eecc  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  6  Figure 2: Structure of the ENISA Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  7  1. INTRODUCTION  This document provides technical guidance to the national authorities tasked with supervising  the security of electronic communication networks and services (hereinafter Competent  Authorities), and in particular the security measures mentioned in Article 40 the European  Electronic Communications Code4 (hereinafter EECC).  1.1 TARGET AUDIENCE  This guideline is for experts from competent authorities in the EU Member States tasked with  the implementation of Article 40 of the EECC.  This guideline may be useful also for experts working in the EU’s electronic communications  sector and experts working in cyber security.  1.2 GOAL  This document aims to give guidance to competent authorities about the security measures  described in Article 40 of the EECC and the enforcement described in Article 41 of the EECC.  1.3 VERSIONS AND CHANGES  ENISA updates this guideline periodically, when necessary, in agreement with the competent  authorities.  This fourth version of the Guideline constitutes an update to the Guideline published on 10  December 2020.  List of the main changes in the fourth version:   Corrections to select measures and evidence in Security Objective 2: ‘Governance and  risk management’   Updated the name of Security Objective 4 to ‘Security of third-party dependencies’ and  expanded its measure a)   Amended the description underneath Security Objective 14: Protection of security  critical data’. Furthermore, amended measure a) and evidence i. of this objective   Amended Section 5.8: ‘Mapping Security Domains’, primarily by way of additions   Amended Section 5.9: ‘Mapping Security Objectives’, primarily by way of mapping  additional ISO27002:2013 controls   Introduced corrections throughout the Guideline, including to referencing international  standards  4 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018L1972&from=EN  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018L1972&from=EN  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  8  Structure of this document  In Section 2 we summarize the role and objectives of ENISA related to the implementation of  Article 40 of the EECC. In Section 3 we introduce Article 40, the scope and the terminology  used in this document. In Section 4 we list 29 security objectives, divided in 9 domains, and we  provide details about security measures and evidence. In Section 5 we give guidance on  potential regulatory activities competent authorities could deploy to assess compliance to the  security measures required by Article 40 of the EECC. In Section 6 we provide a mapping from  the security measures in this guideline to some well-known international standards.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  9  2. BACKGROUND  In this section we summarize the EU policy context and we explain ENISA’s role and objectives.  2.1 EU POLICY CONTEXT  The European Electronic Communications Code, the EECC, is an EU directive, meaning that  EU countries have to transpose it into national legislation. The deadline for this transposition  was 21 December 2020. The new EECC has now replaced the four EU directives. In this paper,  we refer to these directives as the “old rules”.  • The Framework Directive, which is based on the Framework Directive 2002/21/EC as  amended by Directive 2009/140/EC.  • The Access Directive, which is based on the Access Directive 2002/19/EC and amended  by Directive 2009/140/EC.  • The Authorisation Directive is based on the Authorisation Directive 2002/20/EC and  amended by Directive 2009/140/EC.  • The Universal Service Directive is based on the Universal Service Directive 2002/22/EC  and the Citizens' Rights Directive 2009/136/EC.  These rules were last modified in 2009 as part of a wider EU telecom reform, which included  also the ePrivacy directive5, addressing confidentiality and privacy in electronic communications  and the BEREC regulation6, establishing the Body of European telecom regulators.  2.2 ENISA’S ROLE  Article 40 of the EECC asks ENISA to facilitate harmonization on the security aspects.  The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (‘ENISA’) shall facilitate, in  accordance with Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council  (7), the coordination of Member States to avoid diverging national requirements that may create  security risks and barriers to the internal market.  5 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58  6 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32009R1211&from=EN  7 Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 concerning the European  Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 (OJ L 165,  18.6.2013, p. 41).  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32009R1211&from=EN  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  10  3. EECC DEFINITIONS AND  TERMINOLOGY  3.1 EECC DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGY  In this section we introduce the relevant parts of the EECC and the related terms used in this  document.  3.1.1 EECC: Articles 40 and 41 and relevant recitals  Most of the security requirements are contained in Article 40 and Article 41 of the EECC.  For the sake of reference we quote Article 40 and Article 41 in full below.  Article 40 Security of networks and services  1.  Member States shall ensure that providers of public electronic communications  networks or of publicly available electronic communications services take appropriate  and proportionate technical and organisational measures to appropriately manage the  risks posed to the security of networks and services. Having regard to the state of the  art, those measures shall ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk presented.  In particular, measures, including encryption where appropriate, shall be taken to  prevent and minimise the impact of security incidents on users and on other networks  and services.  The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (‘ENISA’) shall  facilitate, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament  and of the Council (45), the coordination of Member States to avoid diverging national  requirements that may create security risks and barriers to the internal market.  2.  Member States shall ensure that providers of public electronic communications  networks or of publicly available electronic communications services notify without  undue delay the competent authority of a security incident that has had a significant  impact on the operation of networks or services.  In order to determine the significance of the impact of a security incident, where  available the following parameters shall, in particular, be taken into account:  (a) the number of users affected by the security incident;  (b) the duration of the security incident;  (c) the geographical spread of the area affected by the security incident;  (d) the extent to which the functioning of the network or service is affected;  (e) the extent of impact on economic and societal activities.  Where appropriate, the competent authority concerned shall inform the competent  authorities in other Member States and ENISA. The competent authority concerned  may inform the public or require the providers to do so, where it determines that  disclosure of the security incident is in the public interest.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  11  Once a year, the competent authority concerned shall submit a summary report to the  Commission and to ENISA on the notifications received and the action taken in  accordance with this paragraph.  3. Member States shall ensure that in the case of a particular and significant threat of a  security incident in public electronic communications networks or publicly available  electronic communications services, providers of such networks or services shall  inform their users potentially affected by such a threat of any possible protective  measures or remedies which can be taken by the users. Where appropriate, providers  shall also inform their users of the threat itself.  4. This Article is without prejudice to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive  2002/58/EC.  5. The Commission, taking utmost account of ENISA’s opinion, may adopt  implementing acts detailing the technical and organisational measures referred to in  paragraph 1, as well as the circumstances, format and procedures applicable to  notification requirements pursuant to paragraph 2. They shall be based on European  and international standards to the greatest extent possible, and shall not prevent  Member States from adopting additional requirements in order to pursue the objectives  set out in paragraph 1.  Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination  procedure referred to in Article 118(4).  Article 41 Implementation and enforcement  1. Member States shall ensure that, in order to implement Article 40, the competent  authorities have the power to issue binding instructions, including those regarding the  measures required to remedy a security incident or prevent one from occurring when a  significant threat has been identified and time-limits for implementation, to providers of  public electronic communications networks or publicly available electronic  communications services.  2. Member States shall ensure that competent authorities have the power to require  providers of public electronic communications networks or publicly available electronic  communications services to:  (a) provide information needed to assess the security of their networks and  services, including documented security policies; and  (b) submit to a security audit carried out by a qualified independent body or a  competent authority and make the results thereof available to the competent  authority; the cost of the audit shall be paid by the provider.  3. Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities have all the powers  necessary to investigate cases of non-compliance and the effects thereof on the  security of the networks and services.  4. Member States shall ensure that, in order to implement Article 40, the competent  authorities have the power to obtain the assistance of a Computer Security Incident  Response Team (‘CSIRT’) designated pursuant to Article 9 of Directive (EU)  2016/1148 in relation to issues falling within the tasks of the CSIRTs pursuant to point  2 of Annex I to that Directive.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  12  5. The competent authorities shall, where appropriate and in accordance with national  law, consult and cooperate with the relevant national law enforcement authorities, the  competent authorities within the meaning of Article 8(1) of Directive (EU) 2016/1148  and the national data protection authorities.  In addition, we include full or partial text of several recitals that are of direct or indirect relevance  for ensuring security of networks and services:  (17) Interpersonal communications services are services that enable interpersonal and  interactive exchange of information, covering services like traditional voice calls  between two individuals but also all types of emails, messaging services, or group  chats. Interpersonal communications services only cover communications between a  finite, that is to say not potentially unlimited, number of natural persons, which is  determined by the sender of the communication.  (18) […] The mere use of a number as an identifier should not be considered to be  equivalent to the use of a number to connect with publicly assigned numbers and  should therefore, in itself, not be considered to be sufficient to qualify a service as a  number-based interpersonal communications service.  (94) […] Security measures should take into account, as a minimum, all the relevant  aspects of the following elements: as regards security of networks and facilities:  physical and environmental security, security of supply, access control to networks and  integrity of networks; as regards handling of security incidents: handling procedures,  security incident detection capability, security incident reporting and communication; as  regards business continuity management: service continuity strategy and contingency  plans, disaster recovery capabilities; as regards monitoring, auditing and testing:  monitoring and logging policies, exercise contingency plans, network and service  testing, security assessments and compliance monitoring; and compliance with  international standards.  (95) […] independent inter personal communications services, […] are also subject to  appropriate security requirements in accordance with their specific nature and  economic importance. Providers of such services should thus also ensure a level of  security appropriate to the risk posed. Given that providers of number -independent  interpersonal communications services normally do not exercise actual control over the  transmission of signals over networks, the degree of risk for such services can be  considered in some respects to be lower than for traditional electronic communications  services. Therefore, where justified on the basis of the actual assessment of the  security risks involved, the measures taken by providers of number-independent  interpersonal communications services should be lighter.  […]  (96) Providers […] should inform users of particular and significant security threats and  of measures they can take to protect the security of their communications, for instance  by using specific types of software or encryption technologies. […]  (97) In order to safeguard security of networks and services, and without prejudice to  the Member States’ powers to ensure the protection of their essential security interests  and public security, and to permit the investigation, detection and prosecution of  criminal offences, the use of encryption for example, end-to-end where appropriate,  should be promoted and, where necessary, encryption should be mandatory in  accordance with the principles of security and privacy by default and by design.  (98) Competent authorities should ensure that the integrity and availability of public  electronic communications networks are maintained. The European Union Agency for  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  13  Network and Information Security (‘ENISA’) should contribute to an enhanced level of  security of electronic communications by, inter alia, providing expertise and advice,  and promoting the exchange of best practices. The competent authorities should have  the necessary means to perform their duties, including powers to request the  information necessary to assess the level of security of networks or services. They  should also have the power to request comprehensive and reliable data about actual  security incidents that have had a significant impact on the operation of networks or  services. They should, where necessary, be assisted by Computer Security Incident  Response Teams (‘CSIRTs’) established by Directive (EU) 2016/ 1148 of the  European Parliament and of the Council8. In particular, CSIRTs may be required to  provide competent authorities with information about risks and security incidents  affecting public electronic communications networks and publicly available electronic  communications services, and recommend ways to address them.  3.2 TERMINOLOGY  We reiterate some of the definitions and terms used extensively in this document.  3.2.1 Security of networks and services  Article 2 (21) of the EECC defines ‘security of networks and services’ as the ability of electronic  communications networks and services to resist, at a given level of confidence, any action that  compromises the availability9, authenticity10, integrity11 or confidentiality12 of those networks and  services, of stored or transmitted or processed data, or of the related services offered by, or  accessible via, those electronic communications networks or services.  3.2.2 Security incidents  Article 2 (42) of the EECC defines ‘security incident’ as an event having an actual adverse effect  on the security of electronic communications networks or services.  3.2.3 Competent authorities  The term ‘competent authorities’ is used in this document in line with the terminology used in  Article 41 of the EECC, meaning those national authorities with competences to supervise  Article 40, the implementation of security measures in the national telecom sector13. In practice  these competences may be split or shared between multiple national authorities.  3.2.4 Security measures  Article 40 of the EECC defines ‘security measures’ as technical and organisational measures for  managing the risks posed to the security of networks and services.  3.2.5 NI-ICS  Article 2 (7) of the EECC defines a ‘number-independent interpersonal communications service’  as an interpersonal communications service, which does not connect with “publicly assigned  numbering resources”, meaning (national or international) telephone numbers, or which does  not enable communication with these (national or international) telephone numbers. In this  document we use the acronym NI ICS for the sake of brevity.  8 Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high  common level of security of network and information systems across the Union (OJ L 194, 19.7.2016, p. 1).  9Availability is typically defined as a property of being accessible and usable on demand by an authorized entity (ISO/IEC  27000:2018)  10 Authenticity is typically defined as a property that an entity is what it claims to be (ISO/IEC 27000:2018)  11 Integrity is typically defined as a property of accuracy and completeness (ISO/IEC 27000:2018)  12 Confidentiality is typically defined as a property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized  individuals, entities, or processes (ISO/IEC 27000:2018)  13 Previous versions of this guideline used the abbreviation NRA, National Regulatory Authority.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  14  4. SECURITY MEASURES  In this section we provide a list of 29 security objectives which competent authorities should  take into account when assessing compliance of providers to Article 40 of the EECC.  We stress that this is only a guideline for competent authorities and that it is at the discretion of  competent authorities to mandate or recommend different or additional security objectives, or  different security measures.  Note that some of the security objectives or security measures may not be relevant or  appropriate in all settings for all types of providers, depending on the type of networks or  services offered14.  4.1 ASSETS IN SCOPE AND RISK ASSESSMENT  The scope of the security measures is defined as follows.  Assets in scope: All assets15 of the provider (including relevant third party assets) which, when  compromised and/or failing, can have a negative impact on the security of networks and  services.  Providers should perform analysis, specific for their particular setting, to determine which assets  are in scope and should subsequently conduct risk assessment to determine which security  measures are appropriate. Risk assessments need updating, to address changes and past  incidents, because risks change over time. Note that this guideline does not address risk  assessment in detail. There are several standard methodologies providers could use for this  (see References).  Remark on classical information security risk management: It is good to mention here that  there is a lot of information security literature which focusses on how an organization can  manage the information security risks related to the use of network and information security, for  example through the establishment of an information security management system. A well-  known example of a related standard is ISO 27001. Article 40 of the EECC, however, focuses  primarily on risks for the users who rely on the networks and communications services provided  by the provider, and not the risks for the provider. This means in practice that, while enterprise  risk management methodologies are very helpful, they may not be fully suitable to be used for  the EECC without adaptation.  4.1.1 Primary and secondary assets  In some literature there is a distinction between primary assets and secondary (supporting)  assets. In this context (Article 40 of the EECC) the primary assets are the electronic  communication networks and services provided by the provider.  In this document when we speak about assets we mean the secondary assets i.e. the systems  and processes supporting the provision of electronic communications networks and services  (such as base stations, routers, registers, power supply, etc.).  14 For example, in the case of dark fibre providers certain security measures may not be applicable because these  providers do not directly deal with subscribers and do not have much staff.  15 A widely used generic definition of an asset is “something that has value”. We provide more details about assets in  sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  15  4.2 CRITICAL ASSETS  In the remainder of this document, we use the term critical assets for assets (network and  information systems, processes, data, etc.) which, when compromised and/or fail, there would  be a severe impact on the security of networks and services. When determining severity of the  impact, factors like type (e.g. whether the materialisation of a threat leads to compromised  confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of the network) and scale of impact (e.g. in terms of  affected users, duration, sensitivity of information altered or accessed) could be considered16.  Parameters related to determination of significance of the impact of a security incident as listed  in EECC Article 40 (2) and reproduced in section 3.1 should also be taken into account.  Critical assets should (obviously) be protected with priority.  4.2.1 Personnel and key personnel  In this document the term “personnel” refers to employees, contractors, and third-party users.  We use the term “key personnel” to refer to the key roles in the organization with respect to  security of networks and services. Now providers are not all the same and organizations and job  profiles are different, but typically this would include roles like the CEO, the CIO, the CISO, the  business continuity manager and system administrators of critical systems.  4.2.2 Third parties and outsourcing  In this document we use the term “third parties” to refer to parties (organizations, individuals) the  provider works with to deliver the services, i.e. vendors the provider buys products from,  suppliers, consultants who advise the provider, auditors auditing the provider, companies the  provider outsources work to, and so on17.  Third parties and third party assets are in scope just as if they were assets of the providers. In  other words, even if certain processes are outsourced, the provider remains responsible for  ensuring that appropriate security measures are taken to protect the security of networks and  services it is providing.  4.3 STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITY MEASURES  This document lists 29 security objectives18 which have been derived from a set of international  and national standards that are commonly used by providers in the EU’s electronic  communication sector (see References). For each of the security objectives we list more  detailed security measures which could be implemented by providers to reach the security  objective. For each security objective we also list detailed evidence which could indicate that the  measures are in place. Note that the security measures or the evidence should not be seen as  a baseline or list of minimum requirements for providers (see the remark below).  The security measures are grouped in 3 different sophistication levels, defined as follows.  16 These criteria are in line with the criteria used in the EU Coordinated risk assessment of the cybersecurity of 5G  networks. Further guidance related to critical asset identification pertaining to 5G networks specifically is provided in the  supplement of this document - security profile for 5G MNOs.  17 Therefore, in this document, the term ‘third parties’ does not refer to customers, the public, or government or regulatory  authorities.  18 In information security governance literature these are also sometimes referred to as ‘control objectives’.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  16  Figure 3: Structure of the security measures  The levels are cumulative. In other words, at level 2 we do not repeat the security measures and  the evidence for level 1, for the sake of brevity, but they are understood to be included  (accumulated). And similarly at level 3 the security measures are understood to include the  ones of levels 1 and 2. If the measures at level 1 are not (fully) implemented than this could be  called level 0, but we do not explicitly mention level 0 in this document.  The overall structure of the security objectives and security measures is depicted as following.  Figure 4: Overall structure of the security objectives and security measures  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  17  Remark about baselines and minimum security measures: Neither the high-level security  objectives in this document nor the detailed security measures should be seen as binding  recommendations about which are appropriate security measures for providers to take. So, for  example, the security measures at level 1 are not to be considered “the minimum” for the sector.  Risks are different for different providers and it depends on the specifics (the setting, the type of  provider, the type of services offered, the assets in question, etc.) which security objectives are  important and which measures are appropriate.  Remark about separate measures: We list a number of individual security measures, one by  one. But this should not be seen as a recommendation to split security activities into parts, or to  keep separate standalone documents or files for each measure. For example, one could  imagine using a single inventory of assets could be used for risk assessment, change  management and asset management procedures.  Remark about technological limitations and implementation feasibility: Some of the  recommended measures may be more difficult (or not simply not feasible) to implement in an  old or legacy systems with outdated equipment, using old technology and/or relying on old  standards and network protocols. In such cases, it is advisable to have limitations and  exclusions stated and documented and to consider including formal decommissioning plans for  these old or legacy systems.  4.4 SECURITY OBJECTIVES AND SECURITY MEASURES  Below we list 29 high-level security objectives (SO1, SO2, etc.), grouped in 8 domains (D1, D2,  etc.).

One possible way for identifying such dependent services may be to pass the obligation to service consumers to  inform the providers if their service is considered critical.

TECHNICAL SUPERVISION  OF SECURITY MEASURES  The principles of security supervision under the new rules (Article 40 and 41 of the EECC) are a  continuation of the old rules (Article 13a and Article 13b of the Framework directive). Under the  new rules, as with under the old rules:   Communication providers have to assess risks, take appropriate security measures  and report significant incidents to competent authorities (Article 13a of the Framework  directive, Article 40 of the EECC).   Competent authorities should have powers to supervise this, to enquire about  measures in place, and to investigate cases of non-compliance by providers (Article  13b of the Framework directive, Article 41 of the EECC).  This means that for the new rules competent authorities can build on the experience and  practice developed under the old rules.  The most common regulatory activities of competent authorities regarding supervision of  security measures are 37:   Mandating or recommending a security standard   Assessing compliance across the market   Taking a staged approach to supervision   Auditing providers (periodically, at random, and/or post-incident)  In the remainder of this section we discuss the technical aspects of each of these activities.  5.1 MANDATING OR RECOMMENDING A SECURITY STANDARD  There could be several reasons for mandating or recommending a standard of security  measures:   to provide guidance about what security measures should be implemented, for  example by explaining high-level objectives or detailed security measures.   to provide a terminology for discussing about security objectives or security  measures.   to provide a structure for supervision and auditing, by dividing security in different  domains.   to provide a baseline, i.e. a minimum set of security measures that must be in place,  for example because without basic security measures it may be difficult to conduct an  audit, because key evidence, like logs, records about incidents, etc. may be missing.   to provide a mapping between different existing standards, for example, to be able to  compare compliance and audit reports which are based on different standards.  Following we go into detail about the different options.  37 This list is based on input from a survey, asking competent authorities across the EU, which are the activities they are  deploying or planning to deploy.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  43  5.1.1 Mandating versus recommending a security standard  When discussing the supervision of security legislation by government authorities there is often  a discussion about whether or not the government authority should mandate a specific list of  security measures, strongly recommend them, or just recommend them as guidance. One could  argue that mandating a standard would create clarity about what providers need to do to be  compliant. On the other hand, one could also argue that in most settings the sector, the  organizations involved, the technology used, is just too diverse to allow for a single checklist of  minimum security measures for the entire sector. Often only very high-level security standards  could be reasonably applied to a wider number of organizations. Inevitably such high-level  standards leave a lot of important technical details unaddressed. So it is hard to capture all the  security requirements of Article 40 of the EECC comprehensively in one standard. At the same  time for specific settings or specific issues the competent authority could mandate specific  security measures to be taken. For instance, a competent authority could ask all providers to  provide the competent authority with a contact point in case of contingencies, or ask all  providers to have 4 hours of backup power for their base station controllers.  Note that when mandating security measures for specific aspects, it is important that competent  authorities discuss with providers about effectiveness and feasibility beforehand. Such  discussions could be triggered by large incidents or focus happened in the past period, frequent  root causes, and/or other common issues (for example, about software vulnerabilities in  common IT equipment).  Best practices in network and information security are rapidly changing, because information  technology changes rapidly and because the capability of attackers changes rapidly. The  competent authority is in a unique role to support and foster the exchange of and discussion  about best practices between experts of different providers. In this way the competent authority  supports that best practices are adopted across the sector. Especially providers with less  experience and less expertise could benefit greatly from such discussions and exchanges.  5.1.2 Using the ENISA guideline as a recommendation  Competent authorities could use this ENISA guideline to provide guidance to providers. The  ENISA guideline consists of 29 high level security objectives derived from different standards  (see References). To reach the security objectives, providers should choose appropriate  technical security measures. This document lists detailed security measures which providers  could take to reach the security objectives. The security measures are split in three  (sophistication) levels ranging from 1) basic, to 2) industry standard, to 3) state of the art.  Providers should assess the risks to their communications networks and services to understand  which security measures are appropriate.  5.1.3 Using the ENISA guideline as a mapping  Many (especially larger) providers already have a security standard or a security governance  framework in place, often based on international standards. This ENISA guideline could be used  as a neutral mapping to different standards in use by the industry. Such a mapping would allow  providers to continue use existing international standards, and it would avoid incurring  unnecessary costs for providers when complying with the requirements of Article 40 of the  EECC.  In practice, for example, providers could show compliance to Article 40 of the EECC by  providing audit reports or certification against existing industry standards, combined with a  mapping from these standards to this ENISA guideline. In Section 6 we provide an example of  such a mapping to some well-known international security standards.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  44  5.1.4 Using existing national or international standards or best practices  Competent authorities could refer to existing national or international standards or requirements,  either as a baseline requirement or as a recommendation. An overview of standards widely  used in the industry is included in the section References. Competent authorities should take  into account national circumstances when choosing an appropriate set of standards or best  practices. We would like to make three remarks in this regard:   Competent authorities should take into account that some (especially the large)  providers may operate in several EU countries, and that it would be cumbersome for  these providers to adopt different standards in different countries. In this respect it  could be useful to allow providers to use international standards which are widely used  across the EU and in this way reduce compliance costs for these providers.   In most countries the electronic communications sector is large (hundreds of providers)  and contains both large providers (>10% of market share) and very small ones (<1% of  market share). Competent authorities should also take into account the differences  between the providers in their country. What might work for large providers may well  be overwhelming for smaller providers, and vice versa, what might work for one  provider might be inappropriate for another provider.   Finally, competent authorities should take into account that best practices in network  and information security are rapidly changing, because information technology  changes rapidly and because the capability of attackers changes rapidly. This makes it  hard to capture the high-level security requirement of Article 40 of the EECC  comprehensively in a list of detailed security measures. In this light, competent  authorities should focus first on supervising that providers assess risks and proactively  take appropriate security measures, rather than on trying to cast detailed security  measures in stone.  5.2 ASSESSING COMPLIANCE ACROSS THE MARKET  Self-assessments could be used to get an overview of the kind of security measures taken by  providers, across the sector. The security objectives and measures listed in Section 4 can be  used directly in self-assessment forms. The sophistication levels (see Section 4) would allow  providers to indicate, per security objective, what kind of security measures are in place. Used  in this way the sophistication levels would allow for a quick comparison between providers  across the sector. We give an example in the diagram below. Here the red bars indicate the  level of sophistication of the security measures taken by one provider, while the green bars  show the levels for a provider with less sophisticated security measures. Such a difference in  sophistication may be justified by a difference in the type of services or networks being offered  by the two providers.  Figure 5: Example of two different providers (green and red), with security measures at different  levels of sophistication.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  45  Depending on the motivation behind the assessment the competent authority could focus on a  subset of security objectives. For example, a competent authority could be interested in a  domain like business continuity or specific security objectives around change management.  Competent authorities could also restrict self-assessments to a subset of the sector, for instance  providers with a certain number of users (more than 10% market share e.g.), a certain service  (mobile networks, e.g.), or providers offering certain critical services (communications for ports  and airports e.g.).  We provide two simplified examples of how a competent authority could set up a self-  assessment form. In the first example, the competent authority assesses security measures  across all providers in the sector, but with a focus on a subset of the security objectives.  Example: The competent authority of country D has organized a self-assessment focused  on governance and risk management (domain D1 in the ENISA guideline). Self-assessment  forms are emailed to all providers:  Indicate your estimate market share: (choose from <1%, >10%, >10%)  Indicate which service you are offering:  (fixed/mobile telephony, fixed/mobile  internet)  Per security objective, indicate the level of sophistication and if you can produce  evidence.  SO1: Information security policy  Sophistication level: (choose from 0, 1, 2, 3). Evidence exists: (choose from yes, no).  SO2: Governance and risk management framework  Sophistication level: (choose from 0, 1, 2, 3). Evidence exists: (choose from yes, no).  SO3: Security roles and responsibilities  Sophistication level: (choose from 0, 1, 2, 3). Evidence exists: (choose from yes, no).  SO4: Managing third party networks or services  Sophistication level: (choose from 0, 1, 2, 3). Evidence exists: (choose from yes, no).  In the second example the competent authority focuses on a subset of security measures and a  subset of providers:  Example: The competent authority in country E wants to focus on the issues behind a  number of large mobile network outages in the past year which are caused by power cuts,  cable cuts, and natural disasters. The competent authority focusses on the security  measures which are most relevant in this context. Self-assessment forms are sent only to  mobile network operators with large market share (>10%). Questions are a combination of  multiple choice and open questions for a description of security measures in place, and open  questions for the type of evidence that the provider can produce to substantiate answers.  For each of the security objectives SO9 (Physical and environmental security), SO10  (Security of supplies), SO21 (Service continuity strategy and contingency plans),  SO22 (Disaster recovery capabilities), SO24 (Exercise contingency plans), indicate the  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  46  level of sophistication, on a scale from 0 to 3 (0 none, 1 basic, 2 industry standard, 3  state of the art):  Describe the security measures in place to reach the objective: (max 200 words)  Describe the evidence you could provide to the competent authority which could substantiate  that measures are in place: (0 none, 1 internal documentation, 2 audit report from external  auditor)  Remark about confidentiality: Self-assessment results or profiles could be sensitive and it is  important to ensure confidentiality of results from other providers and/or the public. It is  important to explain clearly the purpose of the assessment (for example, by explaining that  there are no regulatory consequences) and to give explicit guarantees to providers about  confidentiality of the results.  5.3 SUPERVISION REGIME FOR NI-ICS PROVIDERS  In general, the security provisions in the EECC for NI-ICS are the same as for the number-  based services. Both are subject to (normal) ex-ante, supervision, and are required to provide  information, submit to security audits and be subjected to investigation of non-compliance by  the competent authorities. However, because these providers of do not normally exercise actual  control over the transmission networks, there may be different risks for these providers, and  certain security measures may not be needed, if justified on the basis of a risk assessment38.  See the recital 95:  (95) […] independent inter personal communications services, […] are also  subject to appropriate security requirements in accordance with their specific  nature and economic importance. Providers of such services should thus also  ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk posed. Given that providers of  number -independent interpersonal communications services normally do not  exercise actual control over the transmission of signals over networks, the  degree of risk for such services can be considered in some respects to be  lower than for traditional electronic communications services. Therefore,  where justified on the basis of the actual assessment of the security risks  involved, the measures taken by providers of number-independent  interpersonal communications services should be lighter.  […]  In practice this means that, depending on the setting, the type of network or service offered, the  assets involved, etc., some of the security measures in this guideline may not be fully applicable  to NI-ICS providers. When assessing the compliance of providers with Article 40, competent  authorities should take into account the type of network or service offered, the assets involved,  the threats and resulting risks for this network or service.  5.4 TECHNOLOGY PROFILES  This guideline on security measures is technology neutral. To provide more specific guidance  for specific types of network/service providers, we supplement this guideline with “security  profiles”, for technologies like 5G or providers NI ICS. These security profiles supplement this  38 Security Supervision under the EECC, ENISA, January 2020, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/supporting-the- implementation-of-the-european-electronic-commmunications-code-eecc/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/supporting-the-implementation-of-the-european-electronic-commmunications-code-eecc/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/supporting-the-implementation-of-the-european-electronic-commmunications-code-eecc/  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  47  generic and technology-agnostic guideline. The following supplementary security profiles are  under development and will be published separately:   Security profile for 5G MNOs, containing supplementary guidance for technical  supervision of security measures for 5G MNOs;   Security profile for NI-ICS providers, containing supplementary guidance on number-  independent interpersonal communication services (NI-ICS).  Figure 6: ENISA Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC – Technologies Supplements  5.5 TAKING A STAGED APPROACH  Depending on the national circumstances, competent authorities might want to adopt a staged  approach in supervising (and enforcing) compliance to the security requirements of Article 40 of  the EECC. In case some providers do not (yet) have appropriate security measures in place (or  if they cannot provide evidence of this), competent authorities may want to give providers some  time to comply, in stages. Competent authorities could use this guideline to adopt a staged  approach. We discuss some possible options for staging:   Services or assets in scope: One could first focus on a subset of services (for  example mobile networks) or a subset of assets (for example, core network), and deal  with other services later.  Example: The competent authority in country A wants to focus first on the mobile  networks, because they are (nationally) the most critical. The competent authority  starts with a self-assessment across providers of mobile networks. The scope of  the assessment is ‘assets supporting mobile networks’. Other services are out of  scope initially, as well as providers who do not offer mobile telephony networks.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  48   Providers in scope: One could first focus on a subset of providers, for example  providers with a large market share, and look at other providers at a later stage.  Example: The competent authority in country B wants to focus first on the providers  with large market share, because here a lot of users are at stake. The competent  authority starts with collecting self-assessment reports from the main providers  (>10% of market share). The survey is followed up by a series of workshops where  the main causes of incidents are discussed. Next year the competent authority will  start a separate supervision program for smaller providers (focussed more on  guidance).   Security domains: One could first focus on a subset of security objectives, business  continuity for example, and focus on other objectives at a later stage.  Example: The competent authority in country C wants to focus first on the main  incidents, taking into account the incidents reported by providers. Since last year in  country A the incidents were mostly due to natural disasters, in the supervision the  competent authority focusses first on the measures SO9, SO10, SO21, SO22,  SO24. The competent authority will address other security measures at a later  stage.   Sophistication levels and baselines:  Competent authorities could first focus on  ensuring that all providers have taken the basic security measures, for example level 1  as defined in this guideline, and only later focus on ensuring that providers take more  sophisticated security measures. We should stress here that such an approach would  have limitations: particularly when the sector has both large and small providers: For  large providers basic security measures may be insufficient, while for small providers  they could be more than enough. It would be better to take differences across the  sector into account and define different baselines for providers of different size.  Example: The competent authority in country D defines two profiles as baselines.   The first profile contains the basic security measures for only the domains  D1 Governance and risk management, D2 Human resource security, D3  Security of systems and facilities, – it is the baseline for small providers  (<10% market share.   The second profile contains industry standard security measures for all  domains (D1, … D8)– it is the baseline for large providers (>10% of market  share).  At a later stage the competent authority will review the profiles, and where needed  raise the requirements in some areas or define different baselines for other types of  providers (IXPs e.g.).  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  49  5.6 AUDITING PROVIDERS  Depending on the setting, competent authorities might want to require providers to undergo an  audit. Depending on the setting and the goal of auditing different types of audits may be  needed. In this section we discuss different options for auditing providers.  Note that auditing is not always easy because network and information systems are often  complex. To understand if specific subsystems are working correctly, an auditor may need to  have deep knowledge and expertise: in security the devil is in the details. To give one simple  example: An auditor may find there is a firewall in place to protect certain systems, but the  detailed firewall rules determine greatly the effectiveness of the firewall. One rule with one  mistake may make the entire firewall useless.  Remark about audit costs: Competent authorities should take into account the costs of third-  party audits for providers, particularly the smaller providers. Self-assessments (see previous  section) may be a more light-weight approach.  Remark about efficiency of audits: A frequent complaint from organizations subject to  information security audits is that auditing often forces them to generate a lot of paper work, and  that this is not only useless but that it also diverts resources from the actual task at hand:  making the network and information systems secure. Competent authorities should take into  account that some providers are already partaking in compliance or certification programs  (voluntarily or in the context of different legislation) and are already undergoing (internal or  external) audits. If auditing is needed, it is important to leverage where possible existing audit  reports and compliance evidence.  Remark about language and international operators: When requesting documentation or  evidence from providers, competent authorities should take into account that providers may  keep certain relevant documentation (manuals, policies, procedures, etc.) in the English  language for efficiency reasons, because the provider operates in several countries or because  the operator employs personnel from abroad.  5.6.1 Assessment types  An audit involves different types of assessments, for example a review of security policies or an  interview with the CISO about contingency planning. Audits usually consist of a combination of  different types of assessments. We discuss the different types below:   Document review: Document review is essential in any audit. Relevant documents  may include descriptions of policies, roles and responsibilities, descriptions of  processes and procedures, systems architecture and design, test procedures and  actual test results. Chapter 4 of this guideline includes descriptions of evidence which  could be considered when assessing the implementation of security measures.   Interviews: In addition to document review, a lot of information may be collected by  interviewing service provider employees. At small providers it may be enough to speak  to one or two persons with commercial and technical responsibility. At large providers,  typical roles to be interviewed are C-level managers (CIO), chief security officers (CSO  or CISO), tactical/operational security officers, NOC managers, internal CERT team,  product managers, and system administrators responsible for critical processes or  systems.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  50   System evaluation: Besides documentation, certification, and interviews, the ultimate  check to see if the networks and information systems are secure, and if  policy/procedures are being applied in practice, is by inspecting or testing the system  itself. In some settings system review may be needed, for example to understand how  a security incident could have happened. System evaluation should focus on critical  systems because it can be time-consuming.  5.6.2 Auditor types  Auditing can be carried out by different parties.   Self-assessment: In self-assessments there is really no auditor, but the personnel of  the provider assesses and reports about compliance. Although self-assessment  reports may be biased, they can provide useful information for providers and  competent authorities. An advantage of self-assessments is that self-assessments are  relatively cheap for providers. Earlier in this document, in  Section 5.2, we discuss self-  assessments in more detail.   Internal auditor: In large organizations, a provider could ask an internal security role  or internal audit department to do an audit of certain systems or parts of the  organization. Compared to self-assessments, an internal auditor may be less biased.  An advantage is that internal auditors often know the organization inside out. Also  internal auditors could more easily leverage the deep knowledge about the network  and information systems at the provider.   External auditor: An audit report from an external auditor is even less biased. The  only issue here may be that the external auditor may not know all the details about the  organization and/or the network and information systems. This would make the entire  audit more costly, because on the one hand the external auditor would need to  dedicate a lot of time to study the setting and systems at the provider, and the provider  would also need to dedicate a lot of time to providing the necessary information to the  auditor.   Competent authority as auditor: The competent authority could carry out an audit of  an provider, by using internal staff with auditing expertise, or by outsourcing the  auditing to an auditing firm.   Certifying auditor: In certification a licensed auditor checks compliance to a specific  standard. The audit report results in a certificate of compliance issued by a certifying  authority. For example it is quite common for large providers to be ISO 27001 certified.  Certification is often refreshed yearly, following a yearly re-audit. Competent authorities  could require certification, and ask providers to submit their certificates as a way to  show compliance39.   Specialist auditor: In special cases the competent authority may want to designate a  specific auditor, for a specific purpose or following a specific incident. For example, an  competent authority could mandate providers to undergo a security scan of systems by  a security scanning specialist.   Pool of auditors: The competent authority could designate a pool of external auditors.  Criteria for auditors could be based on past experience (a track record of audits, or  security tests) or be based on examination criteria. For example, competent authorities  could start with a list of licensed auditors40 and offer them a yearly training which  focuses on Article 13a requirements for the sector, in this way creating a pool of  auditors.  39 This may also include a more detailed scope statement (or a Statement of Applicability for ISO 27001).  40 In most countries, for example, there are organizations that license auditors to carry out IT audits.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  51  5.6.3 Audit timing and objectives  The frequency and objectives of auditing varies. We distinguish two types of audits.   Preventive audits: Preventive audits are usually done at fixed intervals, periodically.  In the case of certification (see above) audits are carried out yearly or bi-yearly.  Preventive audits often do not have a specific scope, however it is good practice to set-  up preventive periodic audits according to a multi-year plan and focus first on certain  (important) issues and only later on other issues in subsequent audits. The frequency  of auditing should take into account that providers may need some time to address  deficiencies found in previous audits.  Example: The competent authority in country H mandates providers to undergo  yearly (preventive) audits by 3rd party auditors. To simplify matters and to reduce  the burden for providers, the competent authority works according to a 3 year  supervision plan, focussing on urgent issues first: In the first year the scope of  audits is restricted to business continuity, natural disasters and power cuts  (measures SM9, SM10, SM21, SM22, SM24). In the second year the focus is on  the storage and retention of customer data. In the third year all security measures  will be audited.   Post-incident audits: Post-incident auditing by an competent authority is usually done  ad-hoc, depending on the type of incident and the setting. Post-incident audits have a  specific focus – and usually they are aimed at assessing if security measures are in  place to prevent the incident from re-occurring. The audit in this case has a specific  scope (the services affected by the incident, the assets affected) and regards specific  security measures (measures failing during the incident, or measures which could  prevent re-occurrence).  5.7 AUTHORISATIONS CONDITIONS  5.7.1 Authorisations  Member States are allowed to attach general authorisation conditions concerning the security of  public networks. This was already envisaged under the “old rules” (Directive 2009/140/EC) and  is also included in the Annex I of the EECC.  For the sake of clarity, in the next section we highlight those conditions listed in the Annex I of  the EECC that are of particular relevance for the security of networks and services.  5.7.2 Conditions  List of conditions which may be attached to general authorisations, rights of use for radio  spectrum and rights of use for numbering resources are indicated in the Annex I of the EECC  and are grouped in different categories, for general and specific conditions.  Of those conditions, some are specifically and directly related to assuring security of networks  and services, such as:   In Category A (General conditions which may be attached to a general authorisation):  o Condition 8: Measures designed to ensure compliance with the standards or  specifications referred to in Article 39 (when standards or specifications  referred to are related to information security, e.g. ISO 27001)  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  52   In Category B (Specific conditions which may be attached to a general authorisation for  the provision of electronic communication networks):  o Condition 4: Maintenance of the integrity of public electronic communications  networks in accordance with this Directive including by conditions to prevent  electromagnetic interference between electronic communications networks or  services in accordance with Directive 2014/30/EU.  o Condition 5: Security of public networks against unauthorised access in  accordance with Directive 2002/58/EC  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  53  6 MAPPING TO  INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS  The security measures described in this document (see Section 4) have been derived from  existing international network and information security standards. This guideline is not intended  to replace existing standards or frameworks that are used by providers. Providers could map the  standards they use internally to the security measures in Section 4, and in this way show  compliance with Article 40. In this section we give two examples of such a mapping.  5.8 MAPPING SECURITY DOMAINS  Below, as an example, we map the security domains of Section 4 to a number of international  standards frequently used by providers. We map to the following standards:   ISO 27001:2013, a standard for information security management,   ISO 27002:2013, a catalogue of information security controls,   ISO 27036-3:2013, guidelines for information and communication technology supply  chain security,   ISO 27005:2018, a standard for information security risk management, and   ISO 22301:2019, a standard for business continuity management.  Security  domains  Addressed in Details  D1: Governance  and risk  management  ISO 27001,  ISO 27002, ISO  27005 and ISO  27036-3.  ISO 27001 provides a standard for governance of  information security risks.  ISO 27005 provides a standard for risk management.  ISO 27001 Section A.4 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 5) covers  Information security policies.  ISO 27001 Section A.7 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 7) covers  information security roles and responsibilities.  ISO 27001 Section A.15 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 15)  covers relationships with suppliers.  ISO 27036-3, Part 3 provides guidelines for ICT supply  chain security.  D2: Human  resources  security  ISO 27001  ISO 27002  ISO 27001 Section A.7 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 7) covers  background screening, information security roles and  responsibilities, security knowledge and training, and  personnel changes.  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  54  Security  domains  Addressed in Details  D3: Security of  systems and  facilities  ISO 27001  ISO 27002  ISO 27001 Section A.11 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 11)  covers physical and environmental security.  ISO 27001 Section A.11 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 9) covers  access control to information systems and facilities.  ISO 27001 Section A.13 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 13)  covers network security.  ISO 27001 Section A.10 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 10)  covers encryption (cryptography)  D4: Operations  management  ISO 27001  ISO 27002  ISO 27001 Section A.13 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 12)  covers operational procedures and change management.  ISO 27001 Section A.8 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 8) covers  asset management.  D5: Incident  management  ISO 27001  ISO 27002  ISO 27001 Section A.16 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 16)  covers management of information security incidents, as  well as communications about security events.  D6: Business  continuity  management  ISO 27001  ISO 27002  ISO 22301  ISO 27001 Section A.11 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 17)  covers security aspects of business continuity  management.  ISO 22301 covers Business Continuity Management.  D7: Monitoring  and security  testing  ISO 27001  ISO 27002  Monitoring is covered in ISO 27001 Sections A.12 and A.15  (and in ISO 27002 Chapters 12 and 15).  Security testing and compliance reviews are covered in  ISO 27001 Sections A.14 and A.18 (and in ISO 27002  Chapters 14 and 18).  D8: Threat  awareness  ISO 27001  ISO 27002  User awareness is partially covered in ISO 27001 Section  A.7 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 7)  Management of technical vulnerabilities is covered in ISO  72001 Section A.12.6.1 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 12).  Contact with special interest groups (e.g. for exchange of  information about threats) is covered in ISO 27001 Section  A.6.1.4 (and ISO 27002 Chapter 6)  We have used ISO standards in this example, but a similar mapping could be made to other  national or international standards. For example, the mapping would look similar if, instead of  ISO 27001 and ISO 27005, we would map to the ITU standards X.1051 (information security  management) and X.1055 (risk management).  GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  July 2021  55  5.9 MAPPING SECURITY OBJECTIVES  One could also make a more detailed mapping.

    "abstract": "This document, the Technical Guideline for Security Measures, provides guidance to competent authorities about the technical details of implementing Articles 40 and 41 of the EECC: how to ensure that providers assess risks and take appropriate security measures. The guideline lists 29 high-level security objectives, which are grouped in 8 security domains. For each security objective we list specific detailed security measures which could be taken by providers to reach the security objective. These security measures are grouped in 3 levels of increasing sophistication. We also give examples of evidence, which could be taken into account by an auditor, for example, when assessing if these security measures are actually in place."

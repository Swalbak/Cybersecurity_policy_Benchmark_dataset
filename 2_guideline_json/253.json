This report is an extended and updated version of the 2020 Report on CSIRT-LE Cooperation:  A Study of Roles and Synergies among Selected EU Member States/EFTA Countries published  in January 2021 (ENISA, 2021a) and referred to as “2020 Report on CSIRT-LE cooperation”,  and follows a number of previous reports published by the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity including Tools and Methodologies to Support Cooperation between CSIRTs and  Law Enforcement (ENISA, 2017), Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law  Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects, Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law  Enforcement: Interaction with the Judiciary (ENISA, 2017a), An Overview on Enhancing  Technical Cooperation between CSIRTs and LE (ENISA, 2019a) and Roadmap of the  Cooperation between CSIRTs and LE (ENISA, 2019b).  This report addressed the legal and organisational framework, roles and duties of CSIRTs,  LEAs and the Judiciary, their required competences, as well as synergies and potential  interferences in their activities related to their responses to cyber incidents and fight against  cybercrime, respectively. This report presents a detailed and updated analysis focusing on  sixteen EU/EEA Member States namely Belgium, Czechia (2), Estonia, Finland, France,  Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, and  Sweden (3).  The data for this report were collected via desk research and interviews with subject-matter  experts using the methodology developed and presented in the 2020 ENISA Report on CSIRT- LE cooperation. The data collected showed, among other things, that:  • The communities make efforts to avoid interferences and attempt to create effective  partnerships and take advantage of their synergies to support each other in the fight  against cybercrime; however, some interferences might occur during incident handling  and cybercrime investigations.  • The main challenge experienced by the experts interviewed in cooperating with the  other communities seems to remain the difficulty to sometimes “speak the same  languages”, especially between the CSIRTs (technical) and Judiciary (legal)  communities.  • There are examples of joint training activities, mainly involving two communities (CSIRTs  and LEAs or LEAs and the Judiciary, especially prosecutors) and, more rarely, involving  all three communities, in particular in the form of joint exercises. Such activities help  enhance overall the knowledge and competences required to respond to cybercrime.  • While there has been no significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the  cooperation and interaction between the three communities and their ability to function,  in the long run the lack of networking opportunities fostered by face-to-face meetings  might have an impact on the relationship between the three communities, which is  mainly based on trust and personal contacts.  (2) Czechia has been the short-form name for the Czech Republic since 2016.  (3 ) While Czechia, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Romania and Sweden were already analysed in the  2020 ENISA Report on CSIRT-LE Cooperation (ENISA, 2021a), the current report presents an analysis also focused on the  additional Member States: Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Slovenia and Spain.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  8  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1.  BACKGROUND OF THE REPORT  This report follows up previous work in the area of computer security incident response teams  (CSIRTs) and Law enforcement (LE) cooperation. With the view of enhancing the response to  cyberattacks and supporting the fight against cybercrime, this report aims to continue to  facilitate cooperation between the CSIRT and the LE communities and the extensions that this  collaboration may have to other communities, especially the Judiciary.  This report is an extended and updated version of the 2020 Report on CSIRT-LE Cooperation:  A study of roles and synergies among selected EU Member States/EFTA countries (ENISA,  2021a) published in January 2021.The parts on countries already covered in the 2020 report  (Czechia, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Romania and Sweden) are  reproduced in this report, with some minor changes.  An overview and timeline of the previous work carried out by the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) in the area of CSIRT and LE cooperation is presented in the figure  below (4).  Figure 1: Overview and timeline of previous ENISA work on CSIRT–LE cooperation  This current report (as well as the 2020 report) and the ENISA training material on CSIRT-LE  cooperation (5) are a set of deliverables complementing each other as follows:  • The present report analyses roles, duties, competences, synergies and potential  interferences across the three communities (CSIRTs, LE and Judiciary) in sixteen  additional MSs.  (4) All reports and training materials are available on the ENISA website under publications  (www.enisa.europa.eu/publications) and training resources (www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity- specialists/online-training-material).  (5) The ENISA training material on CSIRT-LE cooperation is available on the ENISA website under:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material/legal-cooperation  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications http://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material http://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material/legal-cooperation  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  9  • The training material helps a trainer explain these concepts, e.g. through scenarios  and contains exercises for trainees based on these scenarios.  1.2.  REPORT OBJECTIVES  The main objective of this report is to present a detailed analysis of the roles and duties of  CSIRTs and LEAs and required competences, showing synergies and potential  interferences in their activities related to their responses to incidents of a criminal nature and  their fight against cybercrime. By facilitating the cooperation between the CSIRT and the LE  communities and the interaction with the Judiciary, this work has the final aim to contribute to  better respond to cybercrime, which, as reaffirmed at the Octopus Conference on Cybercrime  organised by the Council of Europe in November 2021, affects significantly the individuals and  ‘often represents a serious interference with the rights and lives of victims’ (Council of Europe,  n.d.g).  1.3.  REPORT SCOPE  The report focuses on the cooperation of national and governmental (n/g) CSIRTs (6) with LEAs,  although most of the analysis is largely applicable to CSIRTs in general (i.e. other than n/g  CSIRTs). Military CSIRTs are mentioned too but only if they play a specific role in CSIRT-LE  cooperation in case of cybercrime (e.g. if they act as national CSIRTs).  No specific sector is targeted in this report and the results are applicable to the different levels  of cooperation between the three communities in response to incidents of a criminal nature and  in the fight against cybercrime in all sectors (from finance to energy and from transport to  health).  Following the methodology presented in the 2020 Report on CSIRT-LE Cooperation: A study of  roles and synergies among selected EU Member States/EFTA countries (ENISA, 2021a)(7), an  analysis has been conducted and presented in Chapter 2 below.  The analysis presented in this current report covers sixteen EU/EEA countries. Eight countries  were already analysed and presented in the 2020 report: Czechia, France, Germany,  Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Romania and Sweden. The additional countries analysed in the  current report are Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Slovenia and Spain.  The general geographical scoping of the report is limited to sixteen EU/EFTA countries. This  selection of countries was based on the following criteria:  • geographical balance;  • balance of different political systems;  • balance of different legal systems;  • balance in terms of size (area and population) of the countries;  • balance in terms of maturity of the n/g CSIRTs;  • balance in terms of maturity of the CSIRT–LE cooperation.  This report does not seek to provide an exhaustive analysis; rather, it focuses on a small  number of topics affecting cooperation – in particular roles and duties, synergies and possible  overlaps and interferences, required competences – as might be of interest in cross-border  investigations.  (6) ‘National/government (n/g) CSIRTs’ refers to teams ‘that serve a country’s government by helping to protect its critical  information infrastructure. N/g CSIRTs play a key role in coordinating incident management with the relevant  stakeholders at national level. They also bear responsibility for cooperation with other countries’ national and  governmental teams (ENISA, n.d.d)]” (ENISA, 2019c, p. 9).  (7) See in particular its Chapter on “Proposed methodology”, p.16ff.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  10  In the future, this report is likely to be followed up with an extended version covering additional  countries.  1.4.  TARGET AUDIENCE  The intended target audience of this report is:  • CSIRTs, in particular n/g CSIRTs;  • LE (8);  • Judiciary (in this report this refers both to prosecutors (9) and to judges (10));  • Individuals and organisations with an interest in cybersecurity.  Policymakers and lawmakers may also benefit from particular aspects of the analysis presented  in this report as they prepare policies and legislation to enhance cooperation between  operational communities in responding to cyberattacks and fighting cybercrime, including  CSIRTs, LEAs and the Judiciary, in the Member States and in jurisdictions interested in  cooperating with the EU in their transition to and affirmation of the rule of law.  1.5. DATA COLLECTION METHODS  The methodology used to collect data for this report is fully outlined in Chapter 3 “Proposed  methodology” (p.16ff) of the 2020 Report on CSIRT-LE cooperation (ENISA, 2021a).  Qualitative research (11) was conducted for this report. A combination of research methods was  used to collect data for analysing CSIRT, LE and Judiciary cooperation, roles and duties,  required competences, synergies and potential interferences in the selected Member  State/EFTA countries, in particular:  • desk research;  • subject matter expert interviews;  • Segregation of Duties (SoD) matrix.  A summary of the desk research per country is included in Annex A of this report. A list of  courses and training programmes for LE, Judiciary and CSIRTs (not exhaustive and not  containing national training initiatives) is provided in Annex B of this report.  In addition to the desk research, the country profile analysis was based on interviews with  CSIRTs, LE and some Judiciary representatives, which included also the filling in of the SoD  matrix. Contributions from the interviewees are acknowledged in the report. However, the  following points should be noted:  • Some interviewees requested not to be named in the report. In order to ensure  consistency, the names of all the other interviewees have been omitted;  • Interviewees provided their contributions based on their knowledge and expertise and  were mainly not acting as representatives of their country;  • Concerning Italy, due to an important ongoing reform and the creation of a new  National Cybersecurity Agency, it was challenging to collect data via interviews with  the CSIRTs and with the LE, at this specific point in time. Therefore, the analysis for  (8) Similarly, to previous ENISA reports, law enforcement (LE), law enforcement agencies (LEAs), police and police  agencies are used synonymously; see, for instance, (ENISA, 2018).  (9) On the status and role of prosecutors, see (UNODC, 2014).  (10) On judges and principles to ensure their competence, independence and impartiality, see the European Charter on  the Statute for Judges (Council of Europe, 1998).  (11) Qualitative research is focused on explaining the reasons for people’s behaviour and understanding their opinions  and options while quantitative research aims to quantify attitudes, opinions or other defined variables to generalise  results from a population (Bryman & Bell, 2011). Interviewing is the most common format used for data collection in  qualitative research while the questionnaire is the research instrument that is used most widely for both quantitative  and qualitative approaches.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  11  Italy has been conducted based on one interview only and on the data collected via  desk research;  • Due to time constraint, few interviewees, provided data by filling the questionnaire in  writing, instead of via a video/phone interview. Few others preferred to fill the SoD  matrix and send it separately via email instead of filling it in during the interview.  The cut-off date for data collection was 3rd August 2021; however, some additional input  received between August and October 2021 was also integrated in this report.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  12  2. COUNTRY FOCUS  This chapter presents the analysis of the data collected by using the methodology outlined in  the 2020 Report on CSIRT-LE cooperation published in January 2021 (ENISA, 2021a).  The analysis addressed the following MSs/EEA countries:  • Belgium;  • Czechia;  • Estonia;  • Finland;  • France;  • Ireland;  • Italy;  • Germany;  • Luxembourg;  • Norway;  • Poland;  • Portugal;  • Romania;  • Slovenia;  • Spain;  • Sweden.  For each country, an analysis of the roles and duties of CSIRTs, LE and the Judiciary is  provided, first. It follows a description of synergies and potential interferences. Finally, some  examples of existing training programmes are provided.  In each country section, a subsection is dedicated to the ‘roles and duties’ of competent  authorities and departments that perform duties related to preventing and fighting cybercrime.  The tables of competent authorities and departments provided are not exhaustive but rather aim  to present the reader with a quick overview. Additional information on the authorities and  departments and their roles and duties can be found in the subsections that follow these tables.  It should be noted that each country has its own organisations in terms of CSIRTs, including  national and governmental CSIRTs (as well as other CSIRTs), and also LE and judiciary  authorities.  The parts on countries already covered in the 2020 report (Czechia, France, Germany,  Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Romania and Sweden) are reproduced in this report, with some  minor changes.  2.1.  BELGIUM  Belgium is a ‘federal constitutional monarchy in which the king is the head of state and the  prime minister is the head of government in a multi-party system. Decision-making powers are  not centralised, but divided between 3 levels of government: the federal government, 3  language-based communities (Flemish, French and German-speaking) and 3 regions (Flanders,  Brussels Capital and Wallonia). Legally they all are equal, but have powers and responsibilities  for different fields’ (European Union, n.d.a).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  13  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Belgium is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Belgium legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Belgium published its National Cyber Security Strategy 2.0 2021-2025 in May 2021 (CCB,  2021) and legislation that transposes the EU NIS Directive (Law No 2019011507) in 2019  (CCB, 2019).  Belgium ratified the Budapest Convention in 2012.  2.1.1.  Roles and duties  In Belgium, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related  to preventing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  Centre for Cyber Security Belgium Centre pour la Cybersécurité Belgique  CCB  - Federal Computer Emergency  Response Team  Computer Emergency Response Team  Fédérale CERT.be  Police Police / Politie  - Federal Computer Crime Unit  Federal Computer Crime Unit FCCU  - Regional Computer Crime Units  Regional Computer Crime Units RCCU  - Local Computer Crime Units Local Computer Crime Units LCCU  Federal Public Service for the Economy  Service Public Fédéral Economie  Public Prosecution Services Ministère public  2.1.1.1. National cybersecurity agency  Created in 2014, the Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium is the central authority for  cybersecurity in Belgium, under the authority of the Prime Minister. It is in charge of the Belgian  national cybersecurity policy and of the management of CERT.be, the national CSIRT  (CERT.be, n.d).  The CCB’s main tasks are inter alia:  • ‘Monitoring, coordinating and supervising the implementation of Belgian policy on  the subject; […]  • Ensuring coordination between the relevant government departments and  governments, as well as the public authorities and the private or scientific sectors;  • Formulating proposals aimed at adapting the regulatory framework in the field of  cyber security;  • Ensuring crisis management in case of cyber incidents in cooperation with the  government's Coordination and Crisis Centre;  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  14  • Preparing, disseminating and supervising the implementation of standards,  guidelines and security standards for the various information systems of the  governments and public institutions; […]’ (CCB, n.d.).  The Belgian NCSS states that the CCB, ‘in collaboration with CERT.be, in its quality of national  CSIRT, is in charge of detecting and analysing cybersecurity problems and vulnerabilities and of  informing the users, with the support of Internet services providers’ (CCB, 2021).  ‘All entities may report [to CCB], on a voluntary basis, incidents that have a significant impact on  the continuity of the services they provide. This voluntary notification does not have the effect of  imposing obligations on the notifying entity that it would not have been subject to if it had not  made the notification. When processing a notification, the CCB may nevertheless give priority to  mandatory notifications imposed by the NIS Act over voluntary notifications’ (CCB, n.d. a).  By law, in the course of a cybercrime investigation, the CCB can be appointed as a judicial  expert. The CCB then provides technical expertise to the Police and both the police and the  CCB can share all the necessary information. Guidelines on how to appoint the CCB as an  expert during criminal investigations is being set up by the Public Prosecution Services. Criteria  are mentioned in the guidelines to determine in which situations the CCB can be appointed as  an expert, for example the level of complexity or the severity of the impact of the incident.  However, one of the experts interviewed explained that the CCB has no obligation and can  refuse to be appointed as an expert. Moreover, according to one of the interviewees, the CCB  has in reality rarely been appointed as an expert.  As highlighted by one of the interviewees, the Belgian criminal procedure system is a written- evidence based system: written statements are read by the court during a trial, but witnesses  are not called to court in person. The Belgian CSIRT can be called as a witness, but testifies  only via written statements.  The Cyber Emergency Plan (CCB, n.d. c) describes who can report an incident and how the  relevant stakeholders coordinate in the event of an incident, depending on the level of severity  of the incident:  • Level 1: there is one attack, usually not too complex, with only one victim involved;  • Level 2: the incident is not necessarily complex but has an impact at the national level,  with multiple victims;  • Level 3: the incident is a complex attack that leads to a very severe national crisis.  In case of very severe national crisis (complex cyberattack, with major impact on the Belgian  citizens), reaching the level 3 of the Cyber Emergency Plan, the CCB acts as the coordinator of  all the involved actors (the CCB, the Crisis Centre, intelligence agencies, the FCCU, the federal  prosecutor).  2.1.1.2. CSIRTs  Belgium’s national CSIRT, CERT.be, was established in 2009. It is the operational service of  the CCB. Its task is to detect, observe and analyse online security problems and to inform target  groups accordingly. It also publishes news on current cyberthreats, as well as various reports  and guidelines on the matter.  CERT.be delivers services to operators of essential services (OES) and critical infrastructures,  government services, public administrations, businesses and general public (CERT.be, n.d).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  15  As a government service, according to article 29 of the Belgian Code of Criminal Procedure, the  CSIRT should notify the prosecutions services of any crime it has knowledge of. Yet, an  interviewee reported that there might be exception due to the sometimes uncertain nature of the  information related to cyber incidents. Moreover, as there are a lot of many minor cyber  incidents, not all of them are systematically reported. However, when a national cyber incident  occurs, the CSIRT must immediately notify the Federal Prosecutor’s Office.  CERT.be is a member of the CSIRTs Network.  2.1.1.3. LE  The Federal Computer Crime Unit (FCCU), attached to the directorate for the fight against  serious and organised crime (DJSOC) of the Federal Police, is responsible for investigations  connected to cyberattacks and other cyber offences.  At the federal level, the FCCU handles cases related to critical infrastructures and Operators of  Essential Services (OES). If the case has a more local impact, it is more likely to be handled by  the Regional Computer Crime Units (RCCU) (see below). One of the interviewees explained  that by law the FCCU has to deal with cases related to critical infrastructures, however the  distribution of other cases between FCCU and RCCU is decided on a case-by-case basis in  coordination with the Federal Prosecutor’s Office.  The Regional Computer Crime Units (RCCU) ‘investigate cyber attacks and provide technical  and legal support in non-specific crime investigations. RCCU staffing numbers are set by  regional directors of the federal judicial police and vary’ considerably (Council of the European  Union, 2017g, p. 32).  Local Computer Crime Units (LCCUs) have been created by some Local Police zones (12).  The Federal Public Service for the Economy has a team of ‘investigators assigned to  prosecutions related to economic offences committed via the Internet’ (Council of the European  Union, 2017g, p. 32).  The Police response within the Cyber Emergency Plan of the CCB is provided by the Quick  Reaction Force (QRF), made of FCCU and RCCU staff. According to the interviewees, the QRF  has been put into action a few times, for example during the cyberattack on the Tournai hospital  (January 2021) (RTBF, 2021). Although the case was mostly handled at the regional level, the  QRF was tasked to gather evidence during the first week following the attack. The QRF was  involved in a few other cases but only as advisor, and was not deployed.  Finally, Belgium is part of the Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol,  n.d.c).  2.1.1.4. Judiciary  The Public Prosecution Service is composed of public prosecutors, who ‘prosecute offenders  in court, lead criminal inquiries, pursue perpetrators and call for the court to sentence suspects’  (Council of the European Union, 2017g, p. 29).  One of the interviewees reported that each of the fourteen prosecutor’s office has at least one  cybercrime prosecutor, however also dealing with cases related to other types of crime. At the  federal level, the Federal Prosecutor’s Services has a dedicated cyber unit consisting in three  prosecutors specialised in cybercrime, but also dealing with cases related to other types of  crime. No prosecutor is exclusively dealing with cybercrime cases.  In 2008, a decision was taken by the College of Principal Public Prosecutors to have a minimum  of one judge specialised in cybercrime within the public prosecutor’s office, the principal public  (12) See for instance the LCCU created by the Politiezone Regio Tielt (Belgian Police, n.d.).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  16  prosecutor’s office and the Federal Prosecutor’s office. Cybercrime judges are expected to  undertake specialist cybercrime training. Moreover, ‘the College of Principal Public Prosecutors  has created a cybercrime experts’ network [emphasis added] with representatives of the  federal, principal and first-instance public prosecutor’s offices, the federal police (FCCU), the  CCD and, by invitation, examining judges, to increase the relevant expertise of the Public  Prosecution Service [and] facilitate communications’ (Council of the European Union, 2017g, p.  30).  Belgium cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.1.2. Synergies and potential interferences  The experts interviewed assessed the cooperation among CSIRT, LE and the Judiciary as  overall very good. Complementary synergies are existing and fostered by good communication  between the three communities. The information flow between the CSIRT, the FCCU and the  Judiciary is very efficient and enhanced by a trusting relation. An informal chat group is existing  between the three communities, which allows each of them to be immediately aware in case of  a cyber incident, each community is aware immediately.  The prosecutor leading the investigation must appoint the CSIRT as an expert to allow for full  cooperation and information sharing with the Police. According to one of the interviewees, this  mechanism can be used for either ‘regular’ cases or in the framework of the Cyber Emergency  Plan, but tends to be used more for the latter.  Regarding the Cyber Emergency Plan, the NCSS foresees that it ‘continues to be  operationalised. Through optimal cooperation between the CCB’s national Computer  Emergency Response Team (CERT.be), the Integrated Police Services and the National Crisis  Centre (NCCN), incidents are dealt with quickly and effectively and legal investigations are  immediately integrated’ (CCB, 2021).  One of the experts interviewed underlined that in general ‘the CSIRT assists the FCCU in terms  of analytical capability when they are appointed as experts in a cybercrime case’.  One specific  synergy identified during the interviews is the technical complementarity between the CSIRT  and the LE. For example, the CSIRT gathers indicators of compromise (IoC), which can be very  useful for the Police’s investigation.  Another strong synergy, as specified by one of the interviewees, is that the FCCU can identify  who is behind IP addresses, upon request from the Public Prosecutor, whereas the CSIRT  cannot legally do it. This led to the development of a workflow around C2 services (control &  command used for malware/ransomware): CERT.be had a list of active C2 services in Belgium,  so they knew the IP addresses from which the threats emanated, but could not identify who they  belong to. In coordination with the Public Prosecutor, the FCCU set up a workflow where they  could identify who is behind the IP addresses which were in possession of the CSIRT.  Moreover, every three months, all the relevant actors (the CCB, CERT.be, the Federal  Prosecutor, Military Intelligence, the FCCU and the Crisis Centre) meet to discuss recent cases.  No major interferences and/or overlaps were experienced by the experts interviewed. The good  communication between the three communities allows them to find a solution to potential  differences of interest.  It was however underlined that there may sometimes be ‘duplication of analysis if the CSIRT  and the police have access to the same evidence and start analysing them at the same time’.  Moreover, the loss of digital evidence might sometimes be the result of the prevention of further  damage following a cyber incident. One interviewee stated that the ‘decision [to potentially  delete evidence to mitigate damage] should be balanced, taking into consideration all aspects’  and specified that ‘in the majority of cases, priority is given to the prevention of further damage’.  OPTIMAL  COOPERATION  TO DEAL WITH  INCIDENTS  QUICKLY AND  EFFECTIVELY  ‘Through optimal  cooperation between  the CCB’s national  Computer  Emergency  Response Team  (CERT.be), the  Integrated Police  Services and the  National Crisis  Centre (NCCN),  incidents are dealt  with quickly and  effectively and legal  investigations are  immediately  integrated’ (CCB,  2021).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  17  According to another interviewee, as the situation starts to calm down after a period of close  cooperation (e.g. at the height of a crisis), it can sometimes take longer for the Police to obtain  evidence or reports from the CSIRT as the incident is no longer the CSIRT’s main focus.  Finally, as it emerged from one of the interviews, from the victim’s point of view, ‘it can  sometimes be unclear who is in charge and who they should provide the evidence to, as they  are sometimes asked to provide evidence twice, by both the CSIRT and the police’.  Despite good cooperation, challenges exist. As emerged from the data collected via interviews,  ‘Mutual understanding […] is sometimes lacking, more specifically [on] what the other  community can and cannot do. More specifically, the CSIRT can sometimes encounter  difficulties in understanding the legal process’ and framework, and the prosecutors may have  difficulties in understanding the technical aspects. However, to ease this challenge: CSIRT  representatives and prosecutors participate in common courses, such as the SANS courses,  offered by the CCB to federal actors (LE, Judiciary). One of the interviewees explained that  these courses are very beneficial as they give prosecutors ‘a very good understanding of most  of the technical aspects’ of cybercrime cases, which also allows them ‘to take appropriate legal  measures’.  One recommendation made by one of the interviewees to address the challenges the three  communities could have in understanding each other was to set up common guidelines for  cooperation between the CSIRT, the LE and the Judiciary.  2.1.3. Examples of training  The CCB provides technical training, but also training on the role and duties of the CCB. There  are also joint training opportunities between the prosecutors and the CCB staff, so the latter can  learn more about the legal aspects of cybercrime. Moreover, the CCB offers opportunities for  the Judiciary to participate in the SANS courses (according to one of the experts interviewed,  some nine prosecutors have participated and completed the course to date).  ‘Through the Federal Public Service Policy and Support, the Centre for Cyber Security Belgium  (CCB) provides a specialised range of cybersecurity training courses. This involves thorough  basic training as well as more specialised training in a specific field for federal public officials’  (CCB, n.d. b).  The FCCU has participated in several tabletop exercises with the CSIRT, the Judiciary and  military intelligence. According to one interviewee, a large tabletop exercise took place a few  years ago to test what would happen if a major cyberattack occurred during elections.  In addition, in 2019, the FCCU made a substantial contribution to European training projects on  the dark web, organised under the aegis of the European Police College (CEPOL). Two  sessions were organised, in which about sixty LEA representatives from different European  countries took part. That same year, after an interlude of a few years, the FCCU organised a  training course for the Computer Crime Unit functional certificate. Since then, around sixty  people have taken the basic module (Federal Police, 2019).  For the Judiciary, the Belgian Institute for Judicial Training has set up a three-level cybercrime  training for new prosecutors, to which CSIRT, FCCU and RCCUs representatives are invited on  a regular basis as speakers:  1. Basic cybercrime training, for all judicial trainees;  2. Advanced training, for judges and prosecutors specialising in cybercrime;  3. Specialised courses, on topics like virtual currencies, specific investigation methods in a  virtual environment, international cooperation, etc.  Moreover, one expert underlined that the Judiciary and LE representatives are encouraged to  meet regularly within ‘regional cybercrime task forces’ to share experiences and enhance  cooperation. Cybercrime policy guidelines are being elaborated: they will include a minimum  training on cybercrime for prosecutors, as well as the obligation to participate in these  ‘cybercrime task forces’ to share knowledge and best practices.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  18  2.2. CZECHIA  Czechia is a ‘parliamentary republic with a head of government, the prime minister – and a head  of state, the president. The country is divided into 14 regions, including the capital, Prague’  (European Union, n.d.b).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Czechia is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Czech legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  In 2014 Czechia adopted its NCSS for 2015–2020 (NBÚ, 2015) (ENISA, n.d.e). Czechia  adopted late 2020 a new National Cybersecurity Strategy for 2021 – 2025 (NÚKIB, 2020a). To  date, the new Action Plan for the NCSS is not available, however expected for late 2021.  Cybersecurity has been regulated by the Cyber Security Act since 2014 (NCKB, 2014). The  Cyber Security Act regulates the rights and obligations of persons, as well as the powers and  competences of public authorities, in the field of cybersecurity. It also implements relevant EU  provisions (transposing, for example, the NIS Directive (European Parliament and Council,  2016)) and regulates the security requirements for electronic communications networks and  information systems.  In addition, a document called \"Concept for the development of the National office for Cyber and  Information Security\" was published in 2020 by the NÚKIB. It presents a long-term vision of the  NÚKIB development, as well as a capacity development plan until 2027, including capacity  building of the governmental CERT and regular training of the NÚKIB staff (NÚKIB, 2020).  Czechia ratified the Budapest Convention in 2013.  2.2.1.  Roles and duties  In Czechia, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related  to preventing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  National Cyber and Information Security  Agency (NCISA)  Národní úřad pro kybernetickou a informační  bezpečnost  NÚKIB  National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) Národní centrum kybernetické bezpečnosti  NCKB  GovCert.CZ: Government CERT of the  Czech Republic GovCERT.CZ: Vládní CERT České republiky GovCERT.CZ  National CSIRT of the Czech Republic Národní CSIRT České republiky CSIRT.CZ  Police of the Czech Republic – National  Centre Against Organized Crime – Unit of  Special Activities  Národní centrála proti organizovanému zločinu  – Útvar zvláštních činností  NCOZ – ÚZČ  Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Offices and  Judges Nejvyšší státní zastupitelství České republiky  2.2.1.1. National cyber security agency  The National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NCISA) is responsible for the  implementation of the NCSS in Czechia. It is ‘the central administrative body for cyber security,  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  19  including the protection of classified information in the field of information and communication  systems and cryptographic protection’ (NÚKIB, n.d.). It can also act as an ‘expert’ on  cybersecurity issues for LE and provide technical help in criminal investigations. NCISA  ‘operate[s] the government security team, the so-called Government CERT of the Czech  Republic (GovCERT.CZ)’ (NÚKIB, n.d. a). It also engages in dialogue with the other EU  Member States. NCISA cooperates with other national and foreign CSIRTs, supports education  and research and development in the field of cybersecurity, performs security audits and  exercises, and engages in international cooperation and policy work. It also offers legal and  policy support in the field of cybersecurity to other governmental bodies and their CSIRTs.  2.2.1.2. CSIRTs  In Czechia, there are officially two nationwide CSIRT teams recognized by the Cyber Security  Act: the governmental CERT (GovCERT.CZ) and a national CSIRT (CSIRT.CZ).  GovCERT.CZ is a public entity operated by the executive section of NCISA. GovCERT.CZ’s  ‘goal is to help [the critical information infrastructure and the state bodies] to effectively face  security challenges, react on the incidents, coordinate actions to solve them and effectively  prevent them’ (NÚKIB, n.d.). Its ‘constituency are public sector institutions and critical  information infrastructure of the Czech Republic’ (NCBK, 2015, p. 8). Operators of these  infrastructures are required by law to report cybersecurity incidents to NCISA. GovCERT.CZ is  therefore responsible for the evaluation of, and coordination of the response to, severe incidents  and the sharing of relevant information about incidents or threats with relevant authorities,  operators of relevant infrastructures and the public. GovCERT.CZ/NCISA may require regulated  entities to implement reactive or preventive measures in reaction to specific cybersecurity  incidents and threats.  CSIRT.CZ is a private entity operated by the Czech domain registry CZ.NIC on the basis of a  public contract arranged with NCISA. CSIRT.CZ fulfils the role of a national CSIRT, as defined  in the Cyber Security Act. It collects mandatory reports of cybersecurity incidents from operators  of important networks and digital services, coordinates the response to them and shares data  and information with GovCERT.CZ.  There are three main reasons why there are two nationwide CSIRTs in Czechia. The first  reason is because of the principle of the minimisation of state intervention – it is not necessary  for the state to strictly regulate all operators of information infrastructures; therefore,  GovCERT.CZ deals only with the most important infrastructures in terms of national security  and provides other infrastructures with the opportunity to cooperate through the national CSIRT.  The second reason is that private infrastructure operators are more willing to cooperate with  another private entity than with the state; therefore, a greater intensity and scope of cooperation  between the infrastructure operators and the private national CSIRT is expected. The third  reason is that a public institution can do only what the law expressly allows, whereas the private  national CSIRT has more room for manoeuvre in coordinating and organising the response to  cybersecurity incidents, as it can act praeter legem and can do anything that the law does not  explicitly prohibit it from doing (Government of the Czech Republic, 2020).  2.2.1.3. LE  The National Centre against Organized Crime (Národní centrála proti organizovanému  zločinu – NCOZ) was established in 2016 by merging the Organized Crime Detection Unit  (Útvar pro odhalování organizovaného zločinu – ÚOOZ) and the Corruption and Financial Crime  Detection Unit (Útvar pro odhalování korupce a finanční criminality – ÚOKFK). It currently plays  a key role in the fight against cybercrime in Czechia. As a central body, it specialises in the fight  against organised and large-scale cybercrime and cybercrime against critical and important  information infrastructures. NCOZ also plays a coordinating role and a role in the preparation of  standard and recommended procedures for cybercrime investigations.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  20  The Unit of Special Activities (Útvar zvláštních činností – ÚZČ) of the Police of the Czech  Republic intercepts and records telecommunication traffic, conducts surveillance of persons and  objects, and collects digital evidence and carries out other specialised actions aimed at securing  such evidence.  At the regional level there are information crime units at each of the regional criminal Police  directorates. These units include specialists and have technical equipment for investigating  cybercrime and securing electronic evidence. They conduct investigations and provide support  and technical equipment in cybercrime investigations to other organisational units.  2.2.1.4. Judiciary  ‘The Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Czech Republic is the competent central  authority in the pre-trial stage of criminal proceedings whereas the Ministry of Justice of Czechia  is the competent central authority for the trial stage of criminal proceedings and when the  execution of sentences is concerned’ (Council of Europe, n.d.b).  A network of prosecutors specialising in cybercrime has been formally established at the  national level (Council of the European Union, 2017).  At the level of the Public Prosecutor’s Office and courts, an informal expert group has been set  up at the Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Office, which focuses on computer crime.  Judges in Czechia are independent in the performance of their duties and there is no  specialisation of judges in criminal chambers. Cases are therefore assigned to judges according  to a random key and it is up to each judge to educate themselves on the issue at hand.  However, because of the increasing number of cybercrime cases, as well as cases in which  familiarisation with the issue of electronic evidence is necessary, there is an increased interest  in this area on the part of the judges. There is also a clear effort on the part of prosecutors and  the Police to provide relevant information on the context of, and to explain the technical details  of, cases, including in cooperation with CSIRTs, academia and other members of the  professional public.  Czechia cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.2.2. Synergies and potential interferences  As in most countries, useful synergies and also at the same time reciprocal potential  interferences in the activities of individual communities can be identified. In general,  representatives of these communities agreed that, if the activities of individual communities are  coordinated, they are significantly more effective. In such cases, individual communities can  support each other and share specific competences, powers, knowledge, information and  equipment.  Over the last few years, many steps have been taken to strengthen the effectiveness of inter- community cooperation. The Cyber Security Act has been adopted, regulating the obligation to  provide information and formulating the powers of NCISA and national and governmental  CSIRTs; a memorandum was concluded between NCISA and the Police; the position of liaison  officer to enable Police and CSIRT coordination was established; and cooperation mechanisms  have been set up and implemented. Such steps have improved the synergies among these  communities. In particular, they enable the immediate and effective bilateral transfer of  information on threats and incidents between LE and CSIRTs, the mutual use of professional  and technical capabilities of individual communities, mutual assistance in actions to fulfil  relevant obligations, and cooperation with other communities. One synergy specifically identified  during the interviews is that CSIRTs share with LE information obtained from a constituency or  cooperating mechanisms that would otherwise be unavailable to LE. However, although these  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  21  synergies are particularly evident between CSIRTs and LE, they are relatively new in the case  of the Judiciary.  There are also some interferences that may occur between the communities. According to the  interviewees the most important potential interference relates to the collection of digital  evidence and stems from the differences between the goals and approaches of the different  communities. Activities of CSIRTs focused on the mitigation of cyber incidents may seriously  hinder collection of the evidence necessary for a criminal investigation, or even destroy it or  render it inadmissible in court. In addition, one of the limitations of cooperation identified during  the interviews is due to the need of CSIRTs to maintain trust within their constituencies.  Although CSIRTs recommend that victims of cybercrime report incidents to and cooperate with  LEAs, they sometimes refuse to do so for different reasons. In such cases CSIRTs are  discouraged from sharing information about relevant incidents with LE because they fear a loss  of trust from their constituency. Another limitation identified is the lack of understanding,  specifically between the experts from CSIRT and Leon one side, and the Judiciary, on the other  side.  During the interviews, the following recommendations were formulated by the interviewees:  • provide more coordination of activities – through training, more precise legal and  procedural regulation and cooperation mechanisms;  • provide transparent information-sharing mechanisms;  • strengthen cooperation with the Judiciary (CSIRT-LE cooperation is mostly  already in place);  • provide better descriptions of individual groups/units, so that everyone knows who  to contact and when;  • implement sustainable and trustworthy cooperation routines for all the institutions  involved;  • involve all of the communities in training; the training should be focused on the  ability to rapidly share information between all communities.  2.2.3. Examples of training  The Action Plan of the Cyber Security Strategy of Czechia (NCKB) considers promoting the  development of Czechia’s Police capabilities with regard to cybercrime. It mainly aims to:  • reinforce the personnel of individual Police cybercrime departments;  • modernise the technological equipment of specialised Police departments;  • develop cooperation with foreign counterparts;  • provide professional education and training to Police specialists, including  language training.  The Conception of the Development of Capabilities of the Police of Czechia to Investigate  Cybercrime was drafted by the Police Presidium of Czechia and adopted by the National  Security Council in October 2015 (Council of the European Union, 2017).  Actions aimed at the prevention and public awareness of cybercrime are carried out by several  authorities within Czechia, such as the National Cyber Security Centre, LEAs, the private sector,  academia and non-governmental organisations.  The National Cybersecurity Competence Centre (NC3) (National Cybersecurity Competence  Centre, n.d.) at Masaryk University, Brno (Masaryk University , n.d.), has developed a special  tool, KYPO (Kybernetický polygon), which is a cyber range platform (KYPO, n.d.), and built a  laboratory that is used to organise cybersecurity exercises. These consist of large-scale  exercises held two to four times a year, with smaller exercises taking place a couple of times a  month, and are offered to public authorities, businesses and education providers. NC3 offers  INTERCOMMUNITY  COOPERATION  Cooperation  mechanisms have  been set up and  implemented  [enabling] immediate  and effective bilateral  transfer of information  on threats and  incidents between LE  and CSIRTs.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  22  training to judicial and Police academies, investigators and public prosecutors. NCISA, in  cooperation with NC3, also organises the annual Cyber Czech exercise using KYPO and its  laboratory (13).  Law enforcement and judicial authorities are provided with professional training on cybercrime.  The aim is to establish standard practices and knowledge for the detection and investigation of  cybercrime, with the main focus being to secure digital traces and evidence. Certain educational  activities on dealing with cybercrime also take place at Secondary Police Schools of the Ministry  of the Interior. Participation in national and international exercises in the field of cybersecurity,  organised by GovCERT.CZ, also serve as professional training.  The Police Academy (The Police Academy of the Czech Republic, n.d.) also takes cybercrime  into account in its lifelong training for officers. These training activities are organised with  CEPOL and many of the courses are the result of the EMPACT initiatives (Europol, n.d.d).  The Judicial Academy (The Judicial Academy, n.d.) organises training activities for LE and  prosecutors on cybercrime and electronic evidence in cooperation with the Police Academy.  Finally, tabletop exercises take place between CSIRTs and LE and help to improve  communication.  2.3.  ESTONIA  Estonia is ‘a parliamentary republic. The head of government, the prime minister, is nominated  by the president and approved by the Parliament. He/she is in charge of the executive power  vested in government. The head of state, the President, is elected by Parliament or electoral  college for 5 years. The Parliament has 101 members, elected every 4 years. The country is  divided into 15 counties and 79 municipalities’ (European Union, n.d.c).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Estonia is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Estonian legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  The Estonian NCSS 2019-2022 is the third national cybersecurity strategy document (Estonian  Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, 2019). It is based on lessons learned during  the two previous strategy periods (2008-2013 and 2014-2017). The new Cybersecurity Act  came into force in 2018 (Riigi Teateja, 2018a). It transposes requirements from the NIS directive  and the GDPR into national legislation.  Estonia ratified the Budapest Convention in 2003.  2.3.1.  Roles and duties  In Estonia, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related to  preventing and fighting cybercrime.  (13) This is the main cybersecurity exercise organised by Czechia – it is focused mainly on technical issues, but also  deals with cooperation, legal and organisational issues. It involves the simulation of cooperation between CSIRTs,  the police, the media, data protection authorities, users, other infrastructure operators, etc. For more information see  https://csirt.muni.cz/projects/cyber-czech.  https://csirt.muni.cz/projects/cyber-czech  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  23  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  Information System Authority  Riigi Infosüseemi Amet RIA  - CERT Estonia CERT Eestis CERT-EE  Criminal Police Kriminaalpolitsei  - Cybercrime Unit Küberkuritegude büroo  Prosecutor’s Office Prokuratuur  2.3.1.1. National cybersecurity agency  Under the responsibility of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, the Estonian  Information Security Authority (RIA) is responsible for developing the national IT systems,  managing and protecting the state Internet network and ensuring national cybersecurity of  Estonia (RIA, n.d.).  RIA operates the Estonian national CSIRT, CERT-EE.  2.3.1.2. CSIRTs  Established in 2006, CERT-EE is a department of the Cyber Security Branch of the Information  System Authority (RIA) and is funded by the state budget (RIA, n.d.a).  CERT-EE’s primary constituents are Estonia’s state institutions and local authorities, in addition  to Operators of Essential Services (OES) and Digital Service Providers (DSP) in the context of  the NIS directive, and critical IT infrastructure. The level of support provided by CERT-EE  depends on the type and severity of the incident or issue, and on the impact on Estonian critical  infrastructure.  ‘CERT-EE deals with security incidents that occur in Estonian networks, start there, or which it  has been notified about by citizens or institutions either in Estonia or abroad’ (RIA, n.d.a).  CERT-EE's role is to:  • Monitor the state of information security in Estonia;  • Prevent security incidents and reduce security risks;  • Provide assistance and advice to institutions victims of cybersecurity incidents. CERT-  EE can also facilitate contact with LEAs.  CERT-EE is the NIS Directive Single Point of Contact. Its role also covers awareness raising for  government and non-government entities, and educating the nation and national IT sector on  cyber threats.  As the Estonian Code of criminal procedure (Riigi Teateja, 2003) allows the involvement of  experts in criminal proceedings, CERT-EE can be appointed as an expert body by the  prosecutor in charge of the case. The CERT-EE T’s representatives can also be called as  witnesses to court as necessary.  CERT-EE is a member of the CSIRTs Network.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  24  2.3.1.3. LE  Within the Criminal Police, cybercrime is tackled by the Cybercrime Unit, which was set up in  2016 (e-GA, 2021).  The Cybercrime Unit is responsible for the investigation of cybercriminal acts. It gathers and  analyses intelligence on criminal offences. It used to be responsible for digital forensics, which  is now the responsibility of a separate unit.  In 2020, the Cybercrime Unit opened the website ‘cyber.politsei’ (Politsei, n.d.) to report  cybercrime to the Police. The website also gives information and tips on how to recognise  phishing e-mails or restore access to personal accounts.  2.3.1.4. Judiciary  ‘The Prosecutor's office [emphasis added] is a government agency within the area of  government of the Ministry of Justice which participates in the planning of surveillance  necessary to combat and detect criminal offences, directs pre-trial criminal procedure and  ensures the legality and efficiency thereof, represents public prosecution in court’ (Riigi Teateja,  2018).  Until some years ago there were no specialised cybercrime courts or prosecutor's offices in  Estonia (Council of the European union, 2017d). One of the experts interviewed specified that  the prosecutor in charge of international cooperation also dealt with cybercrime. Moreover,  District Prosecutors could be assigned to tackle cybercrime cases, while simultaneously working  with other types of crime. The situation changed in 2019 and there is currently one prosecutor  specialised in cybercrime within the Prosecutor General’s Office, who deals exclusively  with cybercrime cases.  Cybercrime connected to State security or of very high priority are prosecuted by the Prosecutor  General’s Office. The four District Prosecutor’s Offices also have smaller units able to deal with  cybercrime, to which the Prosecutor General’s Office can give guidance. In some specific  cases, the Prosecutor General’s Office can take the decision to take over the case.  The cybercrime prosecutor gives guidance to the Police during the investigation and, once the  investigation is completed, decides, based on the evidence collected, whether or not to start  prosecution.  The Prosecutor General’s Office is also responsible for informing the public about the risk of  cybercrime.  Estonia cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.3.2. Synergies and potential interferences  The situation in Estonia is specific as it is a small country in terms of size and population (14).  Representatives from the three communities know each other well and have built a solid  cooperation based on trust. As highlighted by one interviewee, ‘the police and the prosecutor in  charge of cybercrime work as a team’, and there are no overlaps in their roles and duties.  Phone calls are usually organised every day and meetings in person on a weekly basis to  ensure smooth cooperation.  An example of synergy was given by one of the experts interviewed: in a recent case, the  CSIRT went on site to assess the gravity of a cybersecurity compromise and the damage  caused, from the victim’s point of view. This assessment made by the CSIRT helped LE better  understand the attackers’ infrastructure and the victim’s point of view. This combination of  (14) Estonia is a country of 43,339 km2 and 1.3 million inhabitants (European Union, n.d.q)  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  25  CSIRT and LE expertise allowed the two communities to draw a better and more  comprehensive picture of the incident and its consequences.  One interviewee highlighted that there were cases where CSIRT representatives were allowed  by the prosecutor to take part in the hearings of cybercrime perpetrators. This significantly  fostered the CSIRT’s understanding of the cases and ultimately helped them improve the way  the two communities work together.  Despite this, the interviews highlighted that there may be a difference of interests among the  communities: at the beginning of an investigation, the priority of both the Police and the  Prosecutor’s Office is to gather as much evidence as possible, sometimes before the CSIRT  acts, whereas the CSIRT, responsible for (State) cybersecurity, aims to quickly stop the  incident, recover the system and inform the public. The investigative procedures can be slower  and more bureaucratic than the CSIRT’s, which can be a challenge.  However, thanks to very good communication, no conflicting situations were experienced by the  interviewees. In case of a disagreement between LE and the CSIRT, the prosecutor has the  final say.  2.3.3. Examples of training  Joint training opportunities are mostly bilateral and rarely involve all three communities. One of  the interviewees mentioned that joint trainings are not especially necessary as ‘real life is the  best way to train on how to work together’.  The cybercrime prosecutor provides training to LE and other institutions responsible for  cybercrime. The training covers topics like e-evidence or international cooperation. The Police  also provides training to the Prosecutor’s Office, on specific subjects, such as open source  intelligence gathering.  One expert interviewed explained that informal joint events were organised regularly between  the LE and the CSIRT before the COVID-19 pandemic. These events allowed each community  to enhance their understanding of the other’s work.  2.4. FINLAND  Finland is a ‘parliamentary republic with a head of government, the prime minister, and a head  of state, the President. The central government is based in Helsinki and the local governments  in the 311 municipalities (towns and cities)’ (European Union, n.d.p).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Finland is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Finnish legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  The latest Finnish NCSS was published in 2019 (Finnish Security Committee, 2019). It is based  on the general principles of Finland’s 2013 NCSS. The 2019 NCSS foresees the development  of legislation enabling the fight against cybercrime.  The NIS Directive is transposed into Finnish law. The amendments to implement this directive  entered into force in 2018.  Finland ratified the Budapest Convention in 2007.  A STRONG  COOPERATION  BASED ON  TRUST  As Estonia is a small  country,  representatives of  the three  communities know  each other well and  have built a solid  cooperation based  on trust.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  26  2.4.1.  Roles and duties  In Finland, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related to  preventing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  National Cyber Security Centre Kyberturvallisuuskeskuksen NCSC-FI  National Bureau of Investigation Keskusrikospoliisi KRP  - Cybercrime unit Poliisin Kyberrikostorjuntakeskus  National Prosecution Authority  Syyttäjälaitos  2.4.1.1. National cybersecurity agency/CSIRTs  The National Cyber Security Centre of Finland (NCSC-FI) carries out the CERT function  (NCSC-FI, n.d.). It acts as both the national and governmental CSIRT.  The NCSC-FI was established in 2014. It is part of the Finnish Transport and Communications  Agency (Traficom). ‘NSCS-FI’s CSIRT duties include:  • Addressing information security violations and threats against networks,  communications and value-added services;  • Gathering information on such incidents;  • Disseminating information on information security matters’ (Traficom, n.d).  As described in the NCSC-FI’s RFC 2350, the NCSC-FI is ‘the National CSIRT of Finland and  the CSIRT for last-resort in cases where reporter cannot find more direct reporting contact in  Finland. The NCSC-FI also acts as the Finnish governmental CSIRT. Telecommunications  providers have a legal obligation to report major information security incidents, threats to  information security and faults and disturbances to the NCSC-FI’ (Traficom, n.d.a).  The NCSC-FI can be called to court as an expert to testify in a cybercrime case, however,  according to one interviewee, this happens very rarely.  NCSC-FI is a member of the CSIRTs Network.  2.4.1.2. LE  The Cybercrime unit was established in 2015 as part of the National Bureau of Investigation  (NBI). It is responsible for the investigation of the most serious cybercrime, internet and network  intelligence, and maintenance of situational awareness. One of the experts interviewed  explained that he NBI is also in charge of developing ‘new investigation methods and provides  technical, judicial and operational support to local police in cybercrime investigations’.  All police districts can investigate cybercrime, but the Cybercrime unit of the NBI ‘is responsible  for international, organised, technically challenging and larger cybercrime cases’ (Council of  Europe, n.d.c).  Police districts are responsible for the offences which occur in their region. They all have  dedicated digital forensic experts. The ways districts conduct investigations of cybercrime vary  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  27  significantly as only few districts have investigators specialised in cybercrime (Council of  Europe, n.d.c).  2.4.1.3. Judiciary  The National Prosecution Agency ‘is involved at all stages of the processing a criminal matter:  the pre-trial investigation, the consideration of charges and the trial’ (National Prosecution  Authority, n.d.). When the Police open an investigation, they request the naming of a prosecutor  for the pre-trial investigation. In Finland, the prosecutor does not lead the investigation, but  supports the Police during the investigation. Once the investigation is completed, the prosecutor  decides whether or not to prosecute the case. In specific cases where the crime has been  committed abroad but there are victims in Finland, the prosecutor is responsible for requesting a  police investigation.  Within the National Prosecution Authority, ‘the Prosecutor General’s Office acts as the general  administrative unit’ (National Prosecution Authority, n.d.a). There are five prosecution districts:  Southern Finland, Western Finland, Northern Finland, Eastern Finland and Åland (National  Prosecution Authority, n.d.a).  In Finland, a prosecutor can specialise in certain types of crime (specialised district prosecutor),  among which computer crime. Although there is no prosecutors or courts exclusively  responsible of cybercrime cases, ‘a group of prosecutors in local prosecution units prosecute  most of such crimes’ in addition to other tasks (Council of Europe, n.d.c). One expert  interviewed explained that prosecutors ‘began working on cybercrime related cases some  seven or eight years ago’. There are currently five or six prosecutors specialised in cybercrime.  The cases tend to be scattered, and one cybercrime prosecutor does not necessarily know what  the others are doing. There are not many complex cybercrime cases.  Finland cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.4.2. Synergies and potential interferences  The designated prosecutor leads the police investigation. The CSIRT does not usually interact  with the judiciary: the cooperation between the CSIRT and the Judiciary is operated via the  police, which interacts with both.  As highlighted during the interviews, weekly meetings are organised between the CSIRT, the  Cybercrime unit of the NBI, the Police and other relevant organisations, where ‘general  information about ongoing cybercrime cases is shared’. The Cybercrime unit also receives  weekly and monthly reports from the CSIRT. However, detailed information about ongoing  criminal investigations is shared by the LE to the CSIRT only when considered necessary to  prevent a cybercrime or to limit further damages.  One of the interviewees added that ‘weekly and quarterly meetings [are organised] where  information on phenomena and trends are shared and discussed between the CSIRT and the  police’. This was presented as an example of excellent synergy.  Another example of complementarity is the Finnish Police’s Net Tip-Off service (15), which  allows citizens to anonymously report offences, even if not directly a victim. In certain situations,  tip-offs can be forwarded to the CSIRT (for example, if there is not enough to warrant a Police  investigation), which can then act within the scope of its duties (e.g. asking for a website to be  taken down).  In addition, one expert specified that both the CSIRT and LE have highly-skilled personnel,  which, when working together, make ‘an extremely skilled team’. This specifically ‘tailored task  force’ was used in a few cases where ‘they have proven to be very creative and therefore very  useful’. One case was given as an example, where specific forensics solutions were needed. A  (15) https://poliisi.fi/en/net-tip  BILATERAL  SYNERGIES  The synergies are  existing bilaterally,  rarely involve the  three communities.  The LE and the  CSIRT meet  regularly to share  information on  ongoing cases.  Regular trainings are  organised between  the LE and the  Judiciary.  https://poliisi.fi/en/net-tip  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  28  ‘task force’ was set up with staff members from the CSIRT and LE, which found relevant  evidence that quickly brought the criminal investigation on the right track.  The interviewees stated that they did not experience major interferences in the work of the  CSIRT and LE, but mentioned a difference of interests between the two communities. Moreover,  the legal framework allowing the two communities to share information was presented as  sometimes restrictive, as each community would appreciate receiving more information from the  other but is limited by law. One limitation was mentioned during the interviews: the CSIRT ‘lacks  proper specific procedures to preserve the chain of custody to hand e-evidence over to law  enforcement and ensure it is applicable in court’.  Moreover, although prosecutors receive cybercrime training on a regular basis, one of the  interviewees highlighted that more training would be beneficial for all the prosecutors to stay up- to-date with the technical aspects of cyber related criminal offence.  As ‘cybercrime cases can be complex and very technical’, one interviewee underlined that ‘it is  essential that we speak the same language and [that] the communication is clear, leaving no  room for misinterpretations’. The prosecutors and judges should have a good understanding  and awareness of the technical aspects to be prepared to such situation when it occurs.  Cybercrime prosecutors also experience organisational issues, as, according to one  interviewee, they could further coordinate with each other. Additionally, some cases are  sometimes handled by local prosecutors who are not specialised, which can affect the way the  Police investigates.  Finally, according to same data collected during the interviews, judges ‘tend to be reluctant to  work with the police to avoid compromising the objectivity of the courts’. There is no legal  framework for cooperation between judges and prosecutors, or between judges and Police.  2.4.3. Examples of training  The Police University College of Finland organises various courses, conferences and seminars  for police staff. Cybercrime is one of the topics covered by these courses.  The Police University College runs various research, development and innovation (RDI) projects  dedicated to enhancing cybercrime training of police forces. The most recent is \"Cyber  competence 2020\" (2017-2020, funded by the Internal Security Fund of the European Union),  which aimed to develop and increase ‘the provision of cyber training and education at the Police  University College of Finland to enable the launch of a specialist education study module in the  prevention of cybercrime’. The purpose is to ‘improve public authorities’ knowledge of and skills  in the prevention of cybercrime’ (Police University College of Finland, n.d.). Research results in  the cyber field will be used in the preparation of training. The education and training prepared in  the project is targeted at civil servants employed by the key public authorities engaged in the  prevention of cybercrime.  In 2013, the Police University College of Finland held the CEPOL course 15/2013 “Cybercrime  vs. Cyber security”, in which the NCSC-FI participated as an expert (CEPOL, 2013). In 2018,  Finland hosted the CEPOL course 81/2018, in cooperation with EJTN, on \"Forensic science and  evidence - challenge for policing\", of which the target audience was LE and judges/prosecutors  (CEPOL, 2018). One part of the course was focusing specifically on digital evidence.  One of the interviewees highlighted that specialised cybercrime prosecutors are offered training  both nationally and abroad, and are also tasked to train other prosecutors who do not handle  cybercrime cases regularly. These courses ‘are not mandatory but they have been very  welcomed among other prosecutors.  The experts interviewed explained that the Police and the prosecutors regularly participate in  joint trainings. Moreover, the Police has participated in prosecutors' training for several years,  and prosecutors in police training too, where they learn about technical aspects such as  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  29  networks, communications or cryptocurrencies. Joint trainings are seen as beneficial, as they  help ‘harmonise terms, language and understanding of cyber and cybercrime’.  One expert explained that a joint cyber exercise bringing together ‘the core of security in  Finland’ (Police, border controls, Finnish governmental ICT providers) is organised every year.  The NCSC-FI has a supporting role in this training and provides threat intelligence and expertise  as necessary. There are otherwise very few joint trainings between the CSIRT and the LE. The  cooperation is developed by working on common cases rather than training together.  However, it was highlighted during the interviews that there are no joint trainings involving all  three communities, although on expert underlined that this ‘could help in integrating, unifying  practices, understanding phenomena and, last but not least, taxonomy in cyber related issues’.  2.5.  FRANCE  France is ‘a semi-presidential republic with a head of government, the prime minister, appointed  by the president who is the directly elected head of state. France’s territory consists of 18  administrative regions – 13 metropolitan (i.e. European France) and 5 overseas regions’  (European Union, n.d.d).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in France is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant French legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  France adopted its updated NCSS in 2015 (ANSSI, n.d.) (ENISA, n.d.h). ‘An initial cybersecurity  strategy was developed in France in early 2010 and was published in early 2011’ (Prime  Minister of France, 2015, p. 7). In February 2021, the French President announced an  acceleration of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, which should include a strengthening of the  cooperation between the Law Enforcement community and the judiciary (Présidence de la  République française et du Palais del 'Élysée, p. statement at 3’7”).  France ratified the Budapest Convention in 2006.  2.5.1.

National cyber security agency  The National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (Agence nationale de la sécurité  des systèmes d’information – ANSSI) is responsible for implementing the NCSS in France. ‘The  role of ANSSI is to foster a coordinated, ambitious, pro-active response to cybersecurity issues  in France, to drive raising-awareness actions, as well as to spread French vision and expertise,  and European values, abroad’ (ANSSI, n.d. a).  2.5.1.2. CSIRTs  France has an officially recognised national CSIRT, CERT-FR (French Government CERT,  Centre gouvernemental de veille, d’alerte et de réponse aux attaques informatiques).  CERT-FR is part of ANSSI. ‘Its mission is to coordinate and investigate IT security incident  response for the French government, critical national infrastructure operators and operators of  essential services as defined by the French law.  CERT-FR’s missions cover prevention, detection, response and recovery by:  -  Helping to prevent security incidents by setting up necessary protection measures;  -  Detecting vulnerabilities on networks and systems;  -  Managing incident response, with the support of trusted partners if necessary;  -  Organizing trusted networks of CSIRT’ (ANSSI, 2018).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  31  As a national CSIRT it is the preferred international contact point for any cyber-related incident  affecting France. It operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  CERT-FR is a member of well-known networks of CSIRTs such as the CSIRTs Network, the  FIRST and it participates in the TF-CSIRT activities. CERT-FR also creates a French initiative to  structure the national incident response ecosystem called InterCERT-FR. As part of ANSSI,  CERT-FR also work closely with the CyCLONe’s officers.  CSIRT of the Judicial Police (CSIRT Police Judiciaire – CSIRT-PJ) is the CSIRT of the Central  Directorate of the Judicial Police, operating under the Cybercrime Centre (CSIRT-PJ, n.d.).  CSIRT-PJ aims to provide LE with CSIRT-like services: incident response, threat intelligence,  and malware analysis tooling. It is a member of TF-CSIRT (listed) and belongs to the French  CSIRT community called InterCERT France (CERT-FR, n.d.).  2.5.1.3. LE  The National Police (Police nationale) has the principal mission of fighting against any form of  criminality and delinquency including cybercrime.  One of the directorates of the National Police is the Central Directorate of the Judicial Police  (Direction centrale de la police judiciaire – DCPJ), which performs investigative tasks and  supports the prosecution service in cybercrime cases. Within the DCPJ, a sub-directorate for  ICT-related offences has been established for the fight against cybercrime (Sous-direction de  lutte contre la cybercriminalité – SDLC), which includes the Central Office for Combating  Information and Communication Technology Crime (Office Central de lutte contre la Criminalité  liée aux Technologies de l’iInformation et de la Communication – OCLCTIC) (16), a cyber- intelligence unit. The Anticipation and Analysis Division (D2A) is the technical support of the  OCLCTIC, with forensics and reverse capacities. The CSIRT-PJ is also embedded within the  OCLCTIC. The SDLC operates sixteen digital investigation laboratories, which can support  police services during digital investigations (French Senate, 2020).  The National Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie nationale) is a branch of the French Armed Forces  that is placed, as far as its civilian role goes, under the jurisdiction of the Home Office.  Within the Directorate-General of the National Gendarmerie (Générale de la Gendarmerie  Nationale – DGGN) there are the Intelligence Division (Direction du renseignement - DR) that  produces analyses regarding cybercriminals trends, the Institute for criminal research (Institut  de recherche criminelle de la Gendarmerie nationale - IRCGN) that has research labs not only  cyber and that provides technical support for reverse engineering, the Research Sections  (Sections de Recherche  - SR)  that can have specific cyber capacities and conduct dedicated  investigation if incidents happen on their territory.  The Central Criminal Intelligence Service of the National Gendarmerie (Service central de  renseignement criminel de la Gendarmerie nationale – SCRCGN) is responsible for providing  information and a precise understanding of organised and mass crime, to guide actions in the  fight against crime in the pre-judicial and judicial phases. In parallel, within the SCRCGN, the  Centre for the Fight against Digital Crimes (Centre de lutte contre les criminalités numériques –  C3N) aims to conduct or coordinate investigations of national scope relating to cybercrime, and  to carry out permanent surveillance of the internet, to detect and collect evidence of any  offences that may be committed there.  Under the structure of the Paris Police Prefecture (Préfecture de police), the Cybercrime Unit  (Brigade de lutte contre la cybercriminalité – BL2C) is assigned with cybercrime investigation  (16) The SLDC responds to the need to develop a global policy to combat cybercrime. It defines the strategies to be  implemented in the operational, training and prevention areas for the general public and the financial sector.  Strategic coordination of SDLC activities is handled by the OCLCTIC.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  32  tasks, in the capacity of judicial Police (CSIRT-PJ, n.d.). However, the BL2C is not responsible  for investigating cyberincidents impacting operators of essential services.  The Directorate-General for Internal Security (Direction générale de la sécurité intérieure –  DGSI), among other duties, has jurisdiction over investigations into cyberattacks with a national  security component. More precisely, the DGSI has exclusive judicial competence to carry out  cybercrime investigations related to attacks against critical infrastructure, national institutional  networks and operators of essential services (Ministère de l'Interieur, 2019) or when any  national fundamental interest is threatened (if related to terrorism, for example).  Since 2009, the French National Directorate for Customs Intelligence and Investigations  (Direction nationale du renseignement et des enquêtes douanières - DNRED) has its own  internal structure to fight cybercrime (called \"cyberdouanes\" or \"cellule Cyberdouane\") under the  scope of customs activities (such as collection and exploitation of data on illegal activities using  Internet) (French Senate, 2020).  Finally, France is part of the Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol,  n.d.c).  2.5.1.4. Judiciary  The French judicial system consists of ordinary courts, which include the criminal courts, and  administrative courts. The Court of Cassation (Cour de Cassation) is the supreme court in the  French judicial system of ordinary courts. The public prosecutor is the authority exercising  prosecution tasks, referring cases to the ‘investigative judge’ (juge d’instruction) and overseeing  the criminal investigation process and the judicial Police (European Union, n.d.g) (Ministère de  la Justice, 2012).  Within the public prosecutor’s offices, ‘an internal organisation has been set up to include a  “specialist judge” (magistrat référent) for cybercrime, who can provide technical support to  colleagues involved in cybercrime cases’ (Council of the European Union, 2015).  The Prosecutor of Paris now has national jurisdiction for cybercrime cases. As was highlighted  during one of the interviews, the prosecutor can evoke any case on national territory. This  approach provides better management of expertise as judges are specialised and handle a  great number of cases. The Prosecutor of Paris has a cell of three magistrates who specialise in  cybercrime.  In early 2020, a structural reorganisation of the Paris Prosecutor’s Office led to the renaming of  the Cybercrime unit (from F1 to J3), which is under the responsibility of the Paris’ circuit courts  (Cour d’assises). J3 can investigate complex cybercrime cases at the national level (such as  cases involving operators of essential services, ministries, etc.) (French Senate, 2020).  One of the interviewees reported that the Mission against Cybercrime was established in 2015  within the French Ministry of Justice. This mission has a more strategic role. The following  information emerged in this interview: ‘The tasks undertaken are not at an operational level but  directly at the ministry level, to analyse the phenomenon, represent the ministry and provide  official guidelines to handle relevant cases. An example of its work is to issue official guidelines  for Prosecutors to treat and prosecute some cases, such as a document to centralize judicial  treatment of ransomware. Public policy on the fight against cybercrime is elaborated at the level  of this Mission to support the judiciary.’  France cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  33  2.5.2. Synergies and potential interferences  As emerged from the interviews ‘ANSSI/CERT-FR and FR law enforcement perimeters and  mandates are complementary. As part of the national authority on cybersecurity, ANSSI/CERT- FR has the expertise on many cyber-related topics.’ ANSSI/CERT-FR helps both LE and the  judiciary ‘by sharing […] expertise in cybersecurity and […] knowledge on threats’. As was  stated during one of the interviews, ‘There are different directions [of interaction] between  CSIRTs and LE but also the judiciary from the administrative and the operational side. ANSSI  […], according to French law, […is] a public agency [and] has the obligation to inform the  competent authorities in the event of a suspicious criminal case’. Therefore, ANSSI informs the  Prosecutor Office when it becomes aware of a crime. On the other hand, the prosecutors can  also ask for ‘help from ANSSI (e.g. on particular infrastructure data and on modus operandi), but  this is still quite rare. There are [indeed] rather few cases […where] the judiciary has initiated a  contact with the CSIRTs to handle a case.’  Usually, ANSSI is informed of an attack on its constituency (critical infrastructure operators)  directly or the victim files a complaint to LE. ANSSI teams collect evidence in a legally sound  manner and begin remediation. LE then receives and processes the evidence and conducts its  analysis (on network logs, for example). The objective of LE is different from that of ANSSI:  ANSSI is looking for every details of intrusion while LE is looking for identification information.  Thus, ANSSI is able to suggest efficient remediation actions to the victim. In addition, as the  interviewees noted, ‘a liaison officer has been appointed between the ANSSI/CERT-FR and the  Ministry of [the] Interior and a dedicated process has been set up to share information on  incidents that are reported to ANSSI and are relevant for [French] LE entities’.  Nevertheless, according to the interviewees, restrictions on information sharing may occur, such  as ‘when an investigation is launched on a […] case [that is under judicial examination]’. In such  cases, ‘ANSSI/CERT-FR has to follow strict rules on information sharing with its other partners  in order to respect the confidentiality of investigations’. Eventually, ANSSI may request  authorisation from the judiciary for information sharing with other members of the CNW for  prevention purposes; a known C2 IP can help other CSIRTs protect their constituency. As  emerged from the interviews, the information-sharing process with international partners could  therefore be delayed in some cases. As ‘threats are international but the law enforcement  administration is national’, the main challenge identified is to address these delays.  Furthermore, as one of the interviewees highlighted, another challenge that may arise is to have  the victim ‘file a legal complaint, in order to allow LE to take over before [launching the]  remediation actions that could potentially alter the evidence’.  To better understand each other’s work, some public prosecutor’s offices have regular formal  meetings with specialised police investigation services. In addition, such meetings help to clarify  which investigative tasks can be requested of local Police to avoid overloading the specialised  services. Indeed, the communities are committed to a ‘continuous improvement of the close  relations’ that they have established.  A new legal measure (Article 706-105-1 – Code of Criminal Procedure) came into force in July  2021, opening the possibility of further cooperation and communication between the Paris  Public Prosecutor and non-judicial services (Code of Criminal Procedure, 2021). Concretely,  this measure enables the Paris Public Prosecutor, on his/her own initiative or when requested to  do so, to communicate or share judicial information of any nature to relevant state services even  if non-judicial. These services could be n/g CSIRTs. This can be done when necessary for the  state’s duties related to the security and defense of information systems. More precisely, this  measure is available when the investigation falls under the scope of Article 706-72 which  encompasses any offences against automated information processing systems (Code of  Criminal Procedure, 2021a).  EXAMPLE OF  SYNERGY –  THE CSIRT-PJ  The CSIRT Police  Judiciaire is part of  French LE. It  supports  investigations into  cybercrime. As full  member of the  CSIRT community, it  is a privileged actor  in terms of  cooperation and  information  exchange.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  34  In addition, under the framework of the French cyber defence strategy entitled “La Revue  stratégique de cyberdéfense”, a public–private initiative was launched in 2017 to raise  awareness of the risks of cyberattacks to society and to support the victims of such attacks. The  initiative is handled by the Public Interest Group for Action against Malicious Cyber Activities (Le  Groupement d’Intérêt Public Action contre la Cybermalveillance (GIP ACYMA). The state actors  involved are ANSSI, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economy  and Finance and the Secretary of State in charge of the digital sector. Civil society is also  represented in this Public Interest Group through consumer associations or victim support  entities, as well as trade and labour unions. This public–private initiative also handles the online  cybersecurity platform Cybermalveillance.gouv.fr, which was put in place to guide individuals,  small businesses and local authorities in taking preventive steps against cyberattacks and  addressing malicious events once they occur (Cybermalveillance.gouv.fr, 2019).  Furthermore, InterCERT France is a group gathering all organisations with Incident response  Team (IRT) activities on French soil. InterCERT France’s objective is to strengthen the  stakeholders’ capacity to detect and deal with security incidents. This initiative is driven by  several working groups, including members from law enforcement or judiciary entities, which  enhances the cooperation between CSIRT and LE (CERT-FR, n.d.).  Finally, ANSSI recently announced a funding and incubation framework to establish regional  CSIRTs in France. These CSIRTs will work very closely with law enforcement, which should  create a strong territorial network (ANSSI, n.d. b).  2.5.3. Examples of training  ANSSI offers free cybersecurity training to public organisations, among them LEAs, covering a  wide variety of topics and expertise levels. A lot of the training addresses basic security for end  users, as well as system administrators. It also deals with a wide range of advanced topics such  as security audits, network security, security certificate management and implementation of  cybersecurity certification. Finally, it provides training on very specialised topics such as radio  security against TEMPEST attacks.  As discussed during the interviews, the communities could benefit from joint training, as this  would ‘be useful to help strengthen the relationship between the CERT-FR/ANSSI and the LE  [and] judiciary [communities]’. Moreover, the communities could benefit from learning more  about each other’s counterparts in the ‘international cooperation process, [the] mechanisms and  [the] main players [involved]’ to overcome the difficulties that occur in identifying competent  actors and the actions to be expected.  ‘Trainees at police, gendarmerie and judicial academies […] receive basic training […] on  cybercrime’. These courses are often complemented ‘by conferences or scientific and technical  police workshops (Council of the European Union, 2015).  The OCLCTIC of the National Police organises on an annual basis a training course for French  judges and investigators entitled ‘Approach to cybercrime’, focusing on legal aspects related to  cybercrime and the special investigation techniques. It also organises a ‘first responder’ training  course aimed at Police officers who have to carry out basic cybercrime-related investigative  procedures (Council of the European Union, 2015).  The BL2C, part of the Paris Police Prefecture, participates in private sector training and  provides two approved training courses to the judiciary and customs officers on digital police  investigations.  The Information Systems Security Training Centre (CFSSI) is the main point of contact for  ANSSI for the training of various agencies. It is also involved in the definition and  implementation of the training policy.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  35  CECyF, also called F-CCENTRE, is the French Expert Centre against Cybercrime. CECyF  started in the context of the European project 2Centre (Cybercrime Centres of Excellence  Network for Training Research and Education). CECyF provides support to LE researchers from  both academia and the private sector and educational institutions to create projects that  contribute to training, education and research on cybercrime (CECyF, n.d.).  Finally, the French National School for the Judiciary (Ecole nationale de la magistrature – ENM)  provides multidisciplinary training to French and foreign judges, police officers, gendarmerie and  customs officers on recent legislative developments, as well as specific aspects of digital  investigations and the judicial handling of cybercrime.  2.6.  GERMANY  Germany is ‘a federal, parliamentary republic, with a head of government, the chancellor, and a  head of state, the president, whose primary responsibilities are representative. The country  comprises of sixteen federal States (Länder), which each have their own constitution and are  largely autonomous regarding their internal organisation’ (European Union, n.d.f). Power is  distributed between the federal and the state governments. Considering the state structure in  the country, preventing and responding to cybercrime require close cooperation at the federal  and Länder levels.  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Germany is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant German legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Germany adopted its NCSS initially in 2011 (BMI, 2011); this was updated in 2016 (ENISA,  n.d.f), alongside the Digital Strategy 2025, which sets out legal measures and instruments to  ensure the country’s digital transformation (BMWi, 2016).  In May 2021, Germany endorsed an IT Security Act 2.0, extending reporting obligations and  standards to be applied to critical infrastructures and reinforcing the BSI’s mandate to set  standards for Federal authorities and to monitor their compliance to afore-mentioned standards.  Germany ratified the Budapest Convention in 2009.  2.6.1. Roles and duties  In Germany, the following authorities and departments in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in English Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name  in the original language  (if applicable)  Federal Office for Information Security  Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der  Informationstechnik BSI  - CERT-Bund (part of BSI) CERT-Bund CERT-Bund  National Cyber Response Centre  Nationale Cyber-Abwehrzentrum Cyber-AZ  Central Office for IT - Federal ministry of the  Interior  Zentrale Stelle für Informationstechnik im  Sicherheitsbereich ZITiS  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  36  Federal Criminal Police Office Bundeskriminalamt BKA  - Division CC – Cybercrime Abteilung ‘Cyber-crime’  CC  Federal Police Bundespolizei BPOL  Criminal Police Offices of the Federal States  (Länder) Landeskriminalämter LKAs  The Federal Public Prosecutor General and the  Federal Court of Justice  Der Generalbundesanwalt beim  Bundesgerichtshof and  Bundesgerichtshof  GBA and BGH  Public Prosecutor’s Offices and Courts of the  federal states (Länder)  Die Staatsanwaltschaften der Länder and  Landgerichte Individual per federal state  2.6.1.1. National cyber security agency  The Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der  Informationstechnik – BSI) is the federal cybersecurity authority that ‘shapes information  security in digitization through prevention, detection and reaction for government, business and  society’ (BSI, n.d.). Its ‘goal […] is to promote IT security in Germany. The BSI is first and  foremost the central IT security service provider for the federal government in Germany’ (BSI,  n.d.). CERT-Bund is part of the BSI. The mandate and competences of the BSI are provided by  the Act on the Federal Office for Information Security of 2009, last amended on 2017 (BSI,  2017).  The National Cyber Response Centre (Nationale Cyber-Abwehrzentrum – Cyber-AZ) has  been set up to ‘optimize operational cooperation between all state authorities and improve the  coordination of protection and response measures’. Different governmental agencies are part of  this centre (BSI, BKA, BW-KdoCIR, BBK, BPOL, BfV, MAD and BND). ‘Cooperation in the  National Cyber Response Centre […] strictly observe[s] the statutory tasks and powers of all  authorities involved on the basis of cooperation agreements.’  2.6.1.2. CSIRTs  As mentioned, CERT-Bund is part of the BSI. CERT-Bund is the national CSIRT and ‘acts as  the central point of contact regarding IT-security incidents concerning the German government.  In addition it provides services to critical infrastructure, industry and SME [small and medium- sized enterprises] as well as citizens. Germany’s national IT Situation Centre and the national  Cyber Response Centre are supported by CERT-Bund’ (BSI, n.d. a). CERT-Bund is therefore  responsible for a large constituency and handling IT security incidents related to government  institutions, federal authorities, critical infrastructures and organisations.  The services that CERT-Bund offers are:  • ‘24-hour on-call duty in cooperation with the IT Situation Centre;  • analysis of incoming incident reports;  • creation of recommendations derived from incidents;  • support during IT security incidents;  • operation of a warning and information service;  • active alerting of the Federal Administration in case of imminent danger’ (CERT-Bund,  n.d.).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  37  CERT-BPOL (17) is part of the Federal Police (Bundespolizei). ‘After an attack in 2017, the  CERT-BPOL was founded as the cyber attack analysis and defense center and has been  reinforced continually ever since. The team comprises IT security staff from the Federal Police.  The team consists of IT experts from the Federal Police supported by experts from industry and  science. In order to detect and investigate incidents in the German Federal Police infrastructure,  intrusion prevention systems are operated and infrastructure vulnerabilities are identified by  CERT-BPOL. Liaison officers from CERT-BPOL represent the Federal Police Headquarters at  the […] Cyber-AZ’ (Bundespolizei, 2017).  Following the cyberattack against the Bundestag in 2015, Mobile Incident Response Teams  (MIRTs) were established within the BSI (ENISA, 2017b). The MIRT provides on-site support to  the federal administration and operators of critical infrastructures in the event of an  cybersecurity incident and supports incident response. In particularly serious cases, the BSI can  also provide on-site support with the CERT-Bund, then the MIRT operates as the mobile arm of  the CERT-Bund. After an inital assessment of the situation and of the consequences, the MIRT  carries out technical analyses and advises the organisation on how to deal with the incident  (BSI, 2019).  2.6.1.3. LE  As of 1 April 2020, the German Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt - BKA,  n.d.) includes a separate division dealing with cybercrime, named Division CC – Cybercrime  (Abteilung ‘Cyber-crime’). This division emerged from the Cybercrime and Information and  Communication Crime (ICT) group of the Serious and Organised Crime (SO) Department.  The main tasks of the Division CC – Cybercrime are to investigate cybercriminals and provide  support to other departments, analyse information, protect federal institutions and critical  infrastructures against cyberattacks and provide training to non-specialist employees of the  BKA, as well as provide advice on relevant legal provisions (BKA-CC, n.d.).  The BKA is in communication with prosecutors and judges. The BSI has appointed a CSIRT-LE  liaison officer to the BKA.  The German Federal Police is a (primarily) uniformed federal Police force (Bundespolizei, n.d.).  It is subordinate to the Federal Ministry of the Interior (Bundesminister des Innern, für Bau und  Heimat (BMI), n.d.).  LE authority is also exercised at the state level: the criminal police offices of the Länder  (Landeskriminalämter – LKAs) are independent LEAs in all sixteen states (Länder) and are  subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior. The State Police are known as the Landespolizei.  They are the main points of contact for cybercrime for most of the Länder. The ‘16 federal states  (Länder) [have] the authority to maintain their own police forces within their territory, along with  the right to pass legislation and exercise police authority’ (BMI, n.d.).  Established in April 2017, the Central Office for IT of the Federal ministry of the Interior  (ZITiS), although not a LEA, takes on a central role in researching and developing cyber-related  solutions. It is tasked with digital forensics, telecommunication surveillance, crypto analysis, big  data analysis and fight against crimes, counter espionage, R&D of methods and the  development of tools and strategies for security agencies (ZITiS, n.d.).  Finally, Germany is part of the Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol,  n.d.c).  (17) CERT-BPOL is listed in the ENISA inventory: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-  inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map#team=CERT-BPOL  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map#team=CERT-BPOL https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map#team=CERT-BPOL  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  38  2.6.1.4. Judiciary  Following the federal structure of Germany, ‘the court system is also structured federally.  Jurisdiction is exercised by federal courts and by the courts of the sixteen federal states  (Länder). The main workload of the administration of justice lies with the Länder’ (European  Union, n.d.o).  The BGH (Federal Court of Justice) is at the head of the local, regional and higher regional  courts and functions as a court of appeal for both civil and criminal cases. In general its  interpretations of the law are adopted by all regional courts and therefore do have far-reaching  effects on German jurisdiction in general.  ‘The prosecution offices are set up at every regional court’ and ‘are competent to investigate all  kinds of criminal offences except of offences against the state and other offences falling within  the competence of the Federal Public Prosecution Office’. […] ‘On the federal level there is only  one prosecution office, the Federal Public Prosecution Office which has its seat in Karlsruhe. In  the area of investigation and prosecution of crimes, the Federal Public Prosecution Office is  competent to investigate and prosecute crimes against the state and terrorist crimes as well as  other cases, if they involve serious crime that goes beyond individual Länder borders’ (EJN,  n.d.a).  Certain State Prosecutor’s Offices, such as the one in North Rhine-Westphalia, have a central  cybercrime unit dealing ‘with significant cybercrime proceedings’ (Council of the European  Union, 2017a, p. 28).  ‘There are no courts with specific jurisdiction in most of the Länder. In North Rhine-Westphalia,  however, Cologne regional court has a criminal division with special jurisdiction on account of  the Central Cybercrime Unit and Contact Point located at Cologne Public Prosecution office’  (Council of the European Union, 2017a, p. 28). Indeed, as was also highlighted during one of  the interviews conducted, ‘Certain major courts have created special chambers with judges  specifically trained in cybercrime cases (example of Chamber in the High Regional Court of  Cologne).’ For more information on this point see (Landgericht Köln, pp. 90, section 242,  subsections c) and d) ).  Germany cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.6.2. Synergies and potential interferences  As emerged from both the desk research and the interviews, there are several synergies  between the communities, and the Cyber-AZ plays an important role in bringing the  communities together and facilitating their synergies. For instance, as one of the interviewees  explained, the different agencies that are part of this centre (BSI, BKA, BW-KdoCIR, BBK,  BPOL, BfV, MAD and BND) have ‘a daily interaction and coordination on handling and treating  cases’. In addition, the agencies involved collaborate in ‘producing situation reports to cover the  different aspects of an incident, from the perspective and within the limits of each agency’s  [competence]’.  As emerged from the interviews, ‘there is a daily flow of exchange of information [between  CSIRTs and LE] for ongoing investigations and in the framework of analysing projects and  indicating prevention measures.’ For instance, the BSI may ‘recover data and information from  suspected systems’, which could also be used to support LE investigations and ‘be presented in  Court as testimonies by BSI experts’.  As one of the interviewees explained, the current legal framework does not anticipate having  CSIRT personnel permanently assigned to prosecution authorities. Instead, according to the  German Code of Criminal Proceedings, the role that CSIRTs may play is either that of a witness  or that of an expert. The CSIRT community can help prosecution authorities when there is a  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  39  need for a qualified technical expert. Indeed, ‘Even if the CSIRTs contacted do not have the  specific qualified technical experts within their team, they can still support the prosecution  authorities as they have many links in the technical community.’ Moreover, CSIRTs can provide  support to prosecution authorities by reaching out to civil organisations and non-governmental  organisations, as they are in a better position to perform this task.  As one of the interviewees highlighted, ‘The major field of interference during an investigation  [between the different communities] is how to deal with the incident. The prosecution service  aims at gathering proper judicial evidence, while the CSIRTs aim at dealing with the incident  and fixing the issue. From the prosecutor’s perspective, gathering evidence takes much longer  time than the CSIRTs would want. In any major case the usual discussion is what can be done  to gather evidence and close the collection process as soon as possible in order to proceed with  the CSIRT activity of unlocking the system.’  2.6.3. Examples of training  The BKA has developed various national training programmes on cybercrime, including in the  field of information and communication technology (ICT) forensics. The BKA is also responsible  for training experts in the Federation and the Länder. As part of this training, it is possible to  specialise in specific operating systems, networks/internet, mobile forensics and cryptology. The  BKA also organises an internal basic training course on cybercrime once a year (Council of the  European Union, 2017a).  Courses on cybercrime are offered at all levels, from basic to advanced/specialised, for all  police officers and court experts in Germany.  The German Judicial Academy (Deutsche Richterakademie) also offers further training on  criminal law and the internet on an annual basis and organises conferences and training on  criminal law, forensics, criminal proceedings and investigative measures for judges and public  prosecutors who are involved in combating internet crime (German Judicial Academy, n.d.).  The Brandenburg Judicial Academy (Justizakademie des Landes Brandenburg) organises  regular training sessions for senior judiciary who handle cybercrime cases (Brandenburg  Judicial Academy, n.d.). In addition, at a local level, training is organised (e.g. by the Joint  Judicial Examination Office of the Länder of Berlin and Brandenburg) on combating cybercrime,  including topics such as preservation of computer evidence, data network investigations,  including a cross-border dimension, the challenges presented by big data and data protection- related issues.  At the Länder level, various training initiatives are offered for LE officers and prosecutors, such  as in North Rhine-Westphalia, which organises ‘a joint training programme for specialists from  the Land police force and public prosecutors’. However, practices such as working meetings  and exchange of information are more common between the Police and the public prosecutor’s  offices on different aspects of combating cybercrime (Council of the European Union, 2017a).  As emerged from the interviews, joint training takes place between the CSIRTs and LE, and, in  particular, the Quick Reaction Force (QRF), with judiciary representatives also invited to  participate in this training as observers.  As an interviewee explained, ‘In a joint exercise/practical training on critical infrastructures,  which was held with the support of a private company, a representative from the prosecution  office was invited to actively participate and the prosecutor was then on call during the real-life  scenario.’ As another interviewee underlined, ‘The judges are usually not involved in such joint  trainings, also due to [their] obligation to remain neutral/impartial (e.g. there could be a conflict if  a training is organised by a private entity or an exercise hosted in a company’s premises).’  AN EXAMPLE  OF  FACILITATING  SYNERGIES  The Nationales  Cyber- Abwehrzentrum  (National Cyber  Response Centre)  plays an important  role in bringing the  communities  together and  facilitating their  synergies.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  40  In addition, it should be noted that, as stated by one of the interviewees, the ‘Prosecution team  has the responsibility for providing State justice academy trainings to LE officials. Regarding the  CSIRT community, prosecutors actively engage in seminars and training sessions also involving  the BSI. Through these, they are trying to share the information by inviting CSIRT experts in  such events or participating respectively in trainings of the CSIRT community.’  However, what emerged from the interviews is that CSIRTs and LE work closely together on a  daily basis and that they ‘have managed to learn from each other and understand each entity’s  role and actions’. Since CSIRTs and the judiciary – because of their mandates and the legal  framework – do not have many opportunities to work so closely together, the judiciary could  ‘benefit greatly’ if the CSIRT community could provide training for prosecutor and judges to  further improve their technical skills.  2.7.  IRELAND  Ireland is ‘a parliamentary republic consisting of 26 counties. The head of government, the  prime minister [(Taoiseach]), is appointed by the President after nomination by the Lower House  (Dail) and exercises executive power. The head of state, the President, mostly has ceremonial  powers. The Parliament has 2 chambers (an Upper and Lower House)’ (European Union, n.d.r).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Ireland is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Irish legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  The current National Cyber Security Strategy was published in 2019 and covers the period  2019-2024. In terms of cybercrime, the strategy foresees supporting ‘international cooperation  to combat cybercrime and promote formal and informal cooperation in cyberspace, including by  engaging in sustainable capacity building in third countries’ (Department of Justice and Equality,  2020).  Ireland signed the Budapest Convention in 2002 and it is working towards its ratification  (Department of Justice and Equality, 2020, p. 4).  Ireland adopted the legislation transposing the NIS directive (Statutory Instrument No. 360 of  2018) in 2018 (NCSC, n.d.b).  2.7.1.  Roles and duties  In Ireland, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related to  preventing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  National Cyber Security Centre National Cyber Security Centre NCSC  - CSIRT-IE CSIRT-IE CSIRT-IE  National Police An Garda Siochana  Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau  Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau GNCCB  Director of Public Prosecutions Director of Public Prosecutions DPP  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  41  2.7.1.1. National cybersecurity agency  The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) of Ireland is the primary State cybersecurity  authority (NCSC, n.d.b). It primarily focuses on securing government networks and securing  critical national infrastructure. The Irish national and governmental CSIRT (CSIRT-IE) is part of  the NCSC.  Since 2017, the NCSC ‘has developed an extensive threat intelligence database that is used to  assist [government] Agencies and Departments in protecting their networks’ against high-end  threats actors/cybercriminals (Government of Ireland, 2019).  The constituent base of the NCSC is around one hundred thirty members. This base includes  government departments and agencies, and key entities across the financial sector, critical  national infrastructure providers and other operators of essential services (OES). NCSC’s  constituency, which includes An Garda Siochana, the national Police, receive (email and text)  alerts and advisory services as necessary.  In case of cybercrime, the NCSC provides incident response and technical analysis (it has  specific expertise in infrastructure tracking and malware analysis).  The experts interviewed explained that there are secondment opportunities between the Garda  National Cyber Crime Bureau and the NCSC.  2.7.1.2. CSIRTs  Established in 2011, CSIRT-IE is a body within the NCSC which provides assistance to the  NCSC’s constituents in responding to cybersecurity incidents at national level (NCSC, n.d.a).  CSIRT-IE's responsibilities include:  • ‘Monitoring incidents at national level;  • Providing early warning, alerts, announcements and dissemination of information to  relevant stakeholders about risks and incidents;  • Responding to incidents;  • Providing dynamic risk and incident analysis and situational awareness’ (NCSC, n.d.a).  In 2017, CSIRT-IE set up an integrated incident response and analytics platform. Today,  CSIRT-IE has a more ‘proactive position’, thanks to ‘the deployment and use of MISPs  (Malware Information Sharing Platforms) to share threat intelligence directly with Critical  National Infrastructure Providers, and the evolution and use of a series of tools to identify, parse  and analyse open source intelligence (OSINT). CSIRT-IE ‘has also developed, tested and  deployed the ‘Sensor’ platform, now operational on the infrastructure of a number of  Government Departments, to detect and warn of certain types of threat’ (Government of Ireland,  2019).  According to one interviewee, the CSIRT could be called to court to testify in a cybercrime case,  as it is possible to summon anyone as a witness.  CSIRT-IE is a member of the CSIRTs Network.  2.7.1.3. LE  Investigation of crime is the exclusive jurisdiction of An Garda Siochana (national Police),  however the police can receive advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions, which is an  independent entity.  The Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau (GNCCB) was established as the Cyber Crime  Investigation Unit of An Garda Siochana in 1991, and re-established as the Garda National  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  42  Cyber Crime Bureau in 2017. It is ‘tasked with the forensic examination of computer media  seized during the course of any criminal investigation. […] The unit also conducts investigations  into cyber dependent crime which are significant or complex in nature such as network  intrusions, data interference and attacks on websites belonging to government departments,  institutions and corporate entities’ (GNCCB, n.d.). One interviewee underlined that since there  are elements of digital forensics in the majority of investigations, it represents the largest part of  the GNCCB’s activities.  Two pilot regional cyber units were set up in 2017 (Council of the European Union, 2017e).  As  explained during the interviewees, there are currently four of these “satellite hubs” established  throughout the country. Two more are planned to be set up in the near future. For the moment,  they have a small number of staff, therefore the capacity to handle only a limited number of  operations.  As mentioned above, there are secondment opportunities between the GNCCB and the NCSC.  2.7.1.4. Judiciary  Under Ireland’s common law system, the Director of the Public Prosecutions (DPP) has no  investigative functions and no power to direct An Garda Siochana in their investigations (DPP,  n.d.) (Department of Justice and Equality, 2020). Once the investigation is complete, the DPP  considers the file and directs the prosecution.  However, the DPP can advise An Garda Siochana during the investigation as well as provide  guidance in case of complex prosecutions, while remaining independent. There are no  investigation judges in Ireland.  There is no court, prosecution office or judge exclusively specialised in cybercrime (Council of  the European Union, 2017e), however some prosecutors are specialised in cybercrime matters,  although they also deal with other types of crime.  Ireland cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.7.2. Synergies and potential interferences  Synergies exist as the CSIRT, LE and the judiciary have complementary roles and duties. In  case of a cybercrime, LE is in charge of the investigation, while the CSIRT is in charge of  incident response and technical analysis. It provides specific expertise in infrastructure tracking  and malware analysis. The Judiciary is responsible for the prosecution and trial.  The experts interviewed highlighted that a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is currently  being developed between the CSIRT and LE to provide a framework of cooperation.  As explained during the interviews, LE is in discussion with the Director of Public Prosecutions  (DPP) to set up a training programme on cybercrime to share knowledge on the subject and  understanding of each other’s work. The same initiative has been proposed to judges.  One interviewee however underlined that the roles of each community and the processes could  be better defined, as ‘there is not enough legal definition to accurately articulate [these] roles’.  As highlighted during the interviews, the three communities sometimes have different priorities,  especially the CSIRT and LE. The CSIRT’s priority is to protect victims, while LE’s is to identify  and find the criminal. This can lead to interferences in their work.  Understanding technical language can be challenging for the Judiciary. In 2011, during the  investigation of the hacking of an Irish political party’s website by Anonymous, the DPP asked  the Cybercrime Bureau to add a glossary of cyber terms at the back of each report and  statement. This allows the DPP to better understand technical terms while working on the case.  A MOSTLY  BILATERAL  COOPERATION  Synergies are mostly  bilateral (CSIRT-LE  and LE-judiciary).  The three  communities actively  work at overcoming  challenges that could  potentially impact  their cooperation,  especially thanks to  trainings and  exercises.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  43  2.7.3. Examples of training  The ECTEG (European Cybercrime Training and Education Group) and the Irish UCD Centre  for Cybersecurity and Cybercrime Investigation (UCD-CCI) have developed a Digital First  Responders course which was provided to over two hundred police detectives in 2020. The  training was delivered by the GNCCB and the UCD-CCI. The course covered the following  topics: Online Investigation Techniques, Site Search Intelligence, Digital Forensic Challenges  Encryption, Digital Forensic Challenges Virtual Machines, Internet Security (VPN), Search and  Seizure Guidelines, How to deal with a live computer at search scene, Live data forensics using  “First”, Post Search Analysis, Live Data Forensic (First Tool) Practical, Final Assessment  (practical examination) (UCD-CCI, 2020).  Along with other European LEAs, An Garda Siochana contributes to the development of  CEPOL's \"First responders e-learning package\" (E-First), focusing on essential IT forensics and  IT crime knowledge. The aim is to provide a sound common reference for all LEA first  responders (non-specialised field police officers), as well as digital forensic courses to more  expert attendees (ECTEG, 2021).  In Ireland, judges and prosecutors attend national and international training events in the area  of cybercrime on an ad hoc basis. One interviewee underlined that a joint training between the  DPP and An Garda Siochana was organised a few years ago and that it was very useful. The  DPP is currently setting up more trainings with law enforcement.  Some trainings and exercises are organised between the CSIRT and LE, but according to an  interviewee the idea of having additional ones should be considered. Interviewees were  unaware of trainings organised between the CSIRT and the Judiciary.  2.8.  ITALY  Italy is ‘a parliamentary republic with a head of government - the prime minister - appointed by  the President, and a head of state - the President. The Parliament is composed of 2 houses: the  Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic. The country is subdivided into 20 regions.  5 of these have a special autonomous status, enabling them to pass legislation on some local  matters’ (European Union, n.d.h).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Italy is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Italian legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  A major national cybersecurity reform is currently ongoing in Italy, which includes the  establishment in June 2021 of the National Cybersecurity Agency (see below).  The latest Italian Cybersecurity Action Plan was published in 2017 (Presidency of the Council of  Ministers, 2017). It foresees the improvement of incident and cybercrime integrated response  capabilities, as well as new legislative initiatives to create technical intervention teams to quickly  support central administrations, operators of essential services and critical infrastructures in  case of major cyber events.  In Italy, the NIS Directive was implemented by Legislative Decree no. 65/2018 (Official Journal  of the Italian Republic, 2018).  Italy ratified the Budapest Convention in 2008.  2.8.1.  Roles and duties  In Italy, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related to  preventing and fighting cybercrime.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  44  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  National Cybersecurity Agency Agenzia per la cybersicurezza nazionale  - Cybersecurity Unit (to be set up) Nucleo per la cybersicurezza  - Computer Emergency Response  Team Italy CSIRT Italia CSIRT Italia  State Police  Polizia di Stato  - Post and Communications Police Polizia Postale e delle Comunicazioni  Financial Police  Guardia di Finanza  Carabinieri Corps  Arma dei Carabinieri  - National Anti-crime Computer Centre  for the Protection of Critical  Infrastructure  Centro Nazionale Anticrimine Informatico per  la Protezione delle Infrastrutture Critiche CNAIPIC  Public Prosecutor’s Office Procura della Repubblica  2.8.1.1. National cybersecurity agency  A major reform of national cybersecurity is currently ongoing in Italy. The legislative decree on  the establishment of the National Cybersecurity Agency was approved by the Italian Council  of Ministers on June 10th, 2021(18). It states that the new National Cybersecurity Agency will be  under the responsibility of the president of the Council of Ministers and the Delegate Authority  for the Security of the Republic (Autorità delegata per la sicurezza della Repubblica). The  legislative decree was converted into a law on August 4th, 2021 (19), which entered into force on  August 5th, 2021 (Official Journal of the Italian Republic, 2021).  According to the decree, the Agency will, among other matters, be in charge of:  • Exercising the functions of national authority in the field of cybersecurity, to protect  national interests from cyberthreats and ensure the resilience of services and essential  functions of the State;  • Developing national capabilities for preventing, monitoring, detecting and mitigating,  and coping with cybersecurity incidents and cyberattacks, also thanks to CSIRT Italia;  • Contributing to the enhancement of the security of Information and communications  technology (ICT) systems of subjects included in the national cybersecurity perimeter,  public administrations, operators of essential services and digital service providers;  • Exercising the functions of single national interlocutor for public and private entities in  the field of security measures in the areas that fall under the scope of national  cybersecurity, and network and information systems security (NIS Directive);  • Representing Italy in the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre  (Senato della Repubblica, 2021).  18) Disposizioni urgenti in materia di cybersicurezza, definizione dell’architettura nazionale di cybersicurezza e istituzione  dell’Agenzia per la cybersicurezza nazionale (D.L. 82/2021 – A.C. 3161)  (19) https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2021/08/04/21G00122/sg  https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2021/08/04/21G00122/sg  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  45  A Cybersecurity Unit (Nucleo per la cybersicurezza) will be set up within the Agency and will  closely cooperate with CSIRT Italia. CSIRT Italia will communicate to this Cybersecurity Unit  any cases of breach or attempt to breach security, or loss of integrity which pose threats to the  proper functioning of the networks and services. The Cybersecurity Unit can also receive such  alerts from other CSIRTs established in Italy.  CSIRT Italia will also send incident notifications to the Cybersecurity Unit.  2.8.1.2. CSIRTs  CSIRT Italia was set up in 2019 under the responsibility of the Presidency of the Council of  Ministers. The legislative decree of June 10th, 2021 on the creation of the National  Cybersecurity Agency, will see CSIRT Italia become part of this Agency.  By the above-mentioned decree, CSIRT Italia will become the national and governmental  CSIRT as it will exercise the functions of the national and governmental CSIRT (Senato della  Repubblica, 2021). Before the adoption of the legislative decree on the establishment of the  National Cybersecurity Agency, the role of national CSIRT was undertaken by a department of  the Ministry for Economic Development, and the role of governmental CSIRT by CERT-PA  (within the Agency for digital Italy-AGID).  CSIRT Italia’s tasks are:  • Monitoring of incidents at the national level;  • Issuing early warnings, alerts, announcements and disclosure of information to  interested parties regarding risks and incidents;  • Intervention in case of an incident;  • Risk and incident analysis;  • Participation in the CSIRTs network.  The decree foresees that operators of essential services (OES) must notify CSIRT Italia  immediately in case of an incident having a significant impact on the continuity of the services  provided. CSIRT Italia must immediately forward the notifications to the Cybersecurity Unit of  the Agency and to the Post and Communications Police (Senato della Repubblica, 2021).  The decree underlines that incident notifications fall within the duties of CSIRT Italia and is part  of the reporting obligations established by Article 331 of the Criminal Procedure Code, on the  reporting by public officials and persons in charge of a public service (Senato della Repubblica,  2021).  CSIRT Italia is a member of the CSIRTs Network.  2.8.1.3. LE  By law (Interministerial Decree of 19 January 1999), the Post and Communications Police is  the ‘central body of the Ministry of the Interior responsible for the security of telecommunications  services’ in Italy (Polizia di Stato, n.d.). It is responsible for:  • Ensuring, at a general level, the integrity and functionality of the computer network,  including the protection of critical infrastructures, the prevention of, and fight against,  computer attacks on domestic strategic structures, and the security and regularity of  telecommunications services;  • The fight against online Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM);  • Intelligence activity for the prevention of, and fight against, the use and forgery of  means of payment (Post and Communications Police, n.d.).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  46  The Central Service of the Post and Communications Police is based in Rome and coordinates  twenty regional units and eighty local units. The local units are operational: they handle cases  and emergencies which arise from complaints made by citizens through the hotline of the Post  and Communications Police.  Within the Post and Communications Police, the Cybercrime Analysis Unit (Unità d'analisi del  crimine informatico - UACI) is in charge of studying and analysing cybercrime phenomena in  collaboration with major Italian universities.  Although ‘specialised investigative tasks are assigned by law to the Post and Communications  Police, [which is part of the State Police (Polizia di Stato, n.d.a)], other police forces […] [in  particular], Arma dei Carabinieri [ (Arma dei Carabinieri, n.d.)] and Guardia di Finanza [  (Guardia di Finanza, n.d.))] may as a rule conduct investigations into cybercrime’ (Council of  Europe, n.d.d).  The National Anti-crime Computer Centre for the Protection of Critical Infrastructure  (CNAIPIC) belongs to the Post and Communications Police. It is in charge of the prevention and  repression of cybercrime actions targeting critical infrastructures (Post and Communications  Police, n.d.a).  The CNAIPIC has an Operations Room, available 24/7, which acts as the single point of contact  for critical infrastructures and any other actors engaged in the protection of critical  infrastructures, including international actors.  Finally, Italy is part of Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol, n.d.c).  2.8.1.4. Judiciary  Under Law 48/2008 and the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Public Prosecutor’s Office,  ‘attached to the Court of the main city of a Court of Appeal District […] holds jurisdiction to  conduct the investigations into cybercrime’ (Council of Europe, n.d.d). There are prosecutors  specialised in cybercrime, but there are no specialised judges (Council of Europe, n.d.d).  Specifically in Milan, according to the Milan Prosecutor’s Office’s website, cybercrime was  tackled by the High Tech Crime unit of the Counter-terrorism Department from 2012 to 2018,  but currently falls under the competence of the Fraud and Consumer Protection Department,  made up of 7 prosecutors. The Public Prosecutor’s Office in Milan has also established a  cybercrime victim support bureau (Milan Prosecutor's Office, 2013) (Milan Prosecutor's Office,  2015) (Milan Prosecutor's Office, 2018).  Cybercrime prosecutors are in charge of supervising the investigation and leading the  prosecution of criminal offences. They cooperate with the Post and Telecommunications Police,  whose role is to investigate cybercrime. Other police forces can also investigate cybercrime  cases and cooperate with prosecutors, such as the Carabinieri and the Guardia di Finanza.  Italy cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.8.2. Synergies and potential interferences  In June 2021, the National Cybersecurity Agency was created by legislative decree and this  might change the way the three communities cooperate.  As also highlighted during the data collection via the interview, synergies are possible when  trust is established and each community ‘is aware of the other’s competences [and]  understands the other’s difficulties’. While no specific interferences with the CSIRT community  were experienced, it was highlighted that however some difficulties may arise in the cooperation  between the communities because their interests are sometimes different.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  47  A key challenge mentioned during the interview was the need for more cybercrime training of  the Judiciary: the Judiciary does receive training on cybercrime investigations, but not on a  regular basis, especially as cybercrime raises fundamentally new issues and challenges.  2.8.3. Examples of training  The Interagency Law Enforcement Academy of Advanced Studies (Scuola di Perfezionamento  per le Forze di Polizia) provides advanced training courses for police forces on \"Instruments to  prevent and counter cybercrime. Protection of National Critical Infrastructures\" and  \"International cooperation in the fight against terrorism, against cybercrime and in the field of  digital investigations\" (Interagency Law Enforcement Academy of Advanced Studies, 2020). In  addition, the programme of the second level crime analysis course includes one module on  open source analysis, covering topics such as: open source intelligence (OSINT), research  through the network, social networking and processing, deepweb and darkweb (Interagency  Law Enforcement Academy of Advanced Studies, 2020).  Along with other European LEAs, the Post and Communications Police contributes to the  development of CEPOL's \"First responders e-learning package\" (E-First), focusing on essential  IT forensics and IT crime knowledge. The aim is to provide a common sound reference for all  LEA first responders (non-specialised field police officers) as well as digital forensic courses to  more expert attendees (ECTEG, 2021).  The Public Prosecutor’s Office in Milan provides training courses. The teaching method,  developed by LE investigators, combines lectures, labs and workshops. The course is based on  the MOOC system as well as technical and didactic tutoring service, created specifically for all  the investigators of the Milan Court of Appeal District (Milan Prosecutor's Office, n.d.).  The expert interviewed was not aware of any joint training opportunities on cybersecurity  aspects. However, both LE and the Judiciary participate in training on digital forensics.  2.9.  LUXEMBOURG  Luxembourg ‘is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy (Grand Duchy) with a head of  government, the prime minister, and a head of state, the Grand Duke. The country is divided  into 4 […] regions, 12 […] cantons and 105 communes’ (European Union, n.d.i).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Luxembourg is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Luxembourg legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Luxembourg adopted its NCSS in 2018 for the period 2018–2020 (ENISA, n.d.g). The fourth  version is planned to be published in 2021(20). In parallel, in February 2021, the ministry of  Foreign and European Affaires’ Directorate of Defence published the first Cyber Defence  Strategy, which covers a 10-years period.  Luxembourg ratified the Budapest Convention in 2004.  2.9.1. Roles and duties  In Luxembourg, the following authorities and departments, in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.  (20) Not available at the cut-off date of the data collection. The cut-off date for data collection was 3rd August 2021;  however, some additional input received between August and October 2021 was also integrated in this report  RECENT  CREATION OF  THE NATIONAL  CYBERSECURI TY AGENCY  The creation of the  National  Cybersecurity  Agency in June 2021  might impact the way  the CSIRT, LE and  judiciary  communities  cooperate to fight  cybercrime.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  48  Name of the  authority/department in English  Name of the authority/department  in the original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  National Agency for the Security of  Information Systems  Agence nationale de la sécurité des  systèmes d’information ANSSI  CERT.LU  CERT.LU CERT.LU  Computer emergency response  team of the Government of the  Grand Duchy of Luxembourg  Équipe Gouvernementale de  Réponse aux Urgences  Informatiques  GOVCERT.LU  Computer Incident Response  Center Luxembourg  Computer Incident Response Center  Luxembourg CIRCL  National CERT Luxembourg National CERT Luxembourg NCERT.LU  Grand-Ducal Police Police Grand-Ducale  High Commission for National  Protection  Haut-Commissariat à la Protection  Nationale HCPN  Public Prosecution and Judges  Ministère de la Justice  2.9.1.1. National cyber security agency  The National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (Agence nationale de la  sécurité des systèmes d’information – ANSSI) is part of the High Commission for National  Protection (Haut-Commisariat à la Protection nationale – HCPN) and is responsible for  establishing information security policies and guidelines on non-classified information within the  Luxembourg state bodies (ministries, state departments and administrations). ANSSI assists  these bodies with risk analysis in the domain of information security, in order to help build up a  culture of risk-based governance within the Luxembourg state, as required by the general  information security policy. Furthermore, ANSSI is in charge of promoting information security  awareness and may advise the Luxembourg state’s training institute on training programmes in  the domain of information security.  2.9.1.2. CSIRTs  National CERT Luxembourg (NCERT.LU), the CERT of the Government of the Grand Duchy of  Luxembourg (Équipe gouvernementale de réponse aux urgences informatiques –  GOVCERT.LU) and the Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg (CIRCL) are the  main actors responsible for the detection of and response to incidents.  NCERT.LU, run by GOVCERT.LU, is the national CSIRT (GOVCERT.LU, n.d.b). NCERT.LU  gathers and disseminates information about security incidents that affect information and  communication systems in Luxembourg. It also serves as interlocutor for natural and legal  persons, entities and bodies, both national and international. Once it has received information,  NCERT.LU must convey it to the CERTs in charge of the affected victim’s sector or, if no  sectorial CERT exists, directly to the victim. NCERT.LU also advises about the specific points of  contact according to the targeted sector.  CERT.LU, run by SECURITYMADEIN.LU, is the Cyber Emergency Response Community  Luxembourg (CERT.LU, n.d.). It is an initiative to enhance collaboration between public and  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  49  private CERTs in Luxembourg. The objective is to create a community of all of the major actors  for sharing expertise.  GOVCERT.LU, the governmental CSIRT, ‘is the single point of contact dedicated to the  treatment of all computer related incidents jeopardising the information systems of the  government and defined critical infrastructure operators, whether they are public or private’  (GOVCERT.LU, n.d.). The services provided by GOVCERT.LU include incident handling,  coordination and resolution, and also proactive services such as notification of malware and  vulnerabilities, as well as compromised (infected) systems, among others. ‘The Constituency of  GOVCERT.LU “includes and is limited to:  • The ministries, administrations and public services of the Government of Luxembourg  including military organisations, and  • critical infrastructure operators’ (GOVCERT.LU, n.d.a)  CIRCL ‘is a government-driven initiative designed to gather, review, report and respond to  computer security threats and incidents’ (CIRCL.LU, n.d.). ‘CIRCL is the CERT for the private  sector, communes and non-governmental entities for the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg’  (CIRCL.LU, n.d. b).  CIRCL provides incident response capacities and remediation to national ICT users. It also  takes a coordinator’s role during incidents involving multiple actors, both national and  international. It is also charged with collecting information about incidents to enhance future  responses. CIRCL also handles vulnerability management and disclosure and incident  response training (CIRCL, 2020).  CIRCL has created a large number of tools applicable to forensics, incident responses, network  analysis, dark web monitoring and threat intelligence. The most successful of these tools is  MISP (Open Source Threat Intelligence Platform & Open Standards For Threat Information  Sharing), which is a threat intelligence database with very large information-sharing capabilities.  It is used by more than 6000 entities worldwide and is becoming a de facto standard in the  CSIRT community.  CIRCL already has a strong LE cooperation culture through frequent informal exchanges and  training programmes, such as the Horizon 2020 ENFORCE project and the NEOLEA initiative  (CIRCL.LU, n.d. a).  The HCPN is a coordinating mechanism for responding to serious cyberattacks (HCPN, n.d.). It  also includes a Cybernetic Risk Evaluation Cell (Cellule d’Evaluation du Risque Cybernétique)  known as CERC (The Luxembourg Government, 2018).  2.9.1.3. LE  The Grand-Ducal Police (Police Grand-Ducale, n.d.) is the primary LEA in Luxembourg.  The Directorate of the Judicial Police Service (SPJ) ‘is responsible, inter alia, for the  Coordination of judicial activities at the national and international level. It is also responsible for  defining and managing, in collaboration with the judicial authorities, judicial investigations.’  Within the SPJ the Department of Property Crime has a section on cybercrime (OSCE, n.d.a).  The SPJ is composed of two units:  • Cybercrime Unit. This unit deals with pure cybercrime mainly against ICT systems. It  handles felonies such as data theft, modification and erasure, as well as cyberbullying  and property scam. It is the international point of contact for Europol, Interpol and 24/7  networks.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  50  • High Tech Analysis Unit. This unit provides forensic support to other police units. It  handles lawful evidence collection, interception management and maintenance for  audio/video special equipment.  To prevent and combat cybercrime, LE in Luxembourg cooperates with the following authorities:  • Principal Public Prosecutor’s Office (mutual legal assistance);  • Public Prosecutor (investigation and prosecution)/Parquet général;  • Office of the Examining Magistrate (preparatory enquiries and enforcement action);  • Financial Intelligence Unit (financial crime using new technologies);  • criminal courts.  2.9.1.4. Judiciary  The judicial system of Luxembourg is ‘divided into a judicial branch’, including the criminal  courts, ‘and an administrative branch’ (European Union, n.d.e).  Some magistrates from the Public Prosecutor’s Office and a magistrate at the level of the  Financial Intelligence Unit are responsible, among other duties, for cybercrime cases.  Luxembourg also cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.9.2. Synergies and potential interferences  The different communities in Luxembourg have a strong tradition of cooperation and  collaboration. The CSIRT/LE and Judiciary cybercrime working group brings together national  authorities (Public Prosecutor’s Office, LE and CSIRTs) to exchange information regularly, for  instance on their interactions with service providers.  The Police rely on mutual legal assistance instruments and the direct exchange of information  with Europol and Interpol, but also on the voluntary sharing of information by communication  service providers.  An interesting case of synergies was mentioned during the interviews. This was a case ‘where  the LE performed a significant data interception, that CSIRTs were not allowed to do but  onwards CSIRTs supported in analysing this data package. Similarly, [synergies are achieved]  in cases of seizing of equipment performed by the LE, later on, analysed with the support of  CSIRTs.’  An example of synergies in developing training was also provided during the interviews, in the  context of the ENFORCE project (CIRCL.LU, n.d. a) during the training, CSIRT technologies  were shown and feedback from the LE received and improvements in tools.  CSIRTs (such as CIRCL) can provide technical pre-investigation and investigation support  before LE intervention. They also support requests from the Judiciary and other LEAs for  technical assistance.  Information sharing is carried out automatically using MISP, using sharing groups to implement  information sharing rules. Specific information regarding financial fraud is shared with the  Judiciary.  Main synergies occur through cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs. LEAs have legal tools to  enable data acquisition by seizing and intercepting servers. Other synergies can be handled  during training (see below). There is a memorandum of understanding between CSIRTs and  LE.  TRADITION OF  ACHIEVING  SYNERGIES  The different  communities in  Luxembourg have a  strong tradition of  cooperation and  collaboration.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  51  Potential interferences can occur when LEAs and CSIRTs come into conflicts. LEAs may disturb  CSIRT monitoring operations when seizing a piece of infrastructure studied by CSIRTs.  Outside the EU, the use of Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) can cause extensive delays  and impede cooperation.  Another challenge is the discrepancy in data-handling capacities. CSIRTs generate a lot of  data, for example in the field of child abuse. Since LEAs works on a case-by-case model, they  cannot handle large numbers of data without predefined agreements.  The final challenge is to improve evidence handling by MISP: large data sets need to be  handled in such a way as to preserve the chain of custody.  One way to improve synergies would be to share information in real time. This is legally  challenging but would be more profitable for all entities.  2.9.3. Examples of training  ‘Law enforcement officers are trained at the Police school of the Grand-Ducal Police. […]. In  addition, the Police school is responsible for managing the continuing education of the  personnel of the Grand-Ducal Police’ At the Police School, cybercrime is covered during basic  training and professional development for police officers and investigators (OSCE, n.d.a).  To increase opportunities to provide specialised training to IT forensic experts and investigators  working on cybercrime cases, the SPJ arranges training in coordination with neighbouring  police agencies. It is also common practice for personnel attending external training to pass on  their knowledge to others by organising internal training sessions.  Luxembourg ‘does not have a specific institution or school for the training of its judges and  prosecutors, [therefore,] the Ministry of Justice has reached an agreement with the French  Ecole Nationale de la Magistrature and the German Judicial Academy’ (Deutschen  Richterakademie) (EJTN, n.d.).  In addition, the New Technologies Section of the SPJ provides training for judges, especially on  new tools and methods used by cybercriminals (darknet, bitcoin, etc.).  In the interviews, further examples of training were discussed. For example, when customers  share their issues and needs in the field of cybercrime, this helps CSIRTs understand the  requirements of cybercrime investigations. Further, the Prosecutor’s Office also provides  training related to the four ways of filing a complaint for a CSIRT’s constituency.  As emerged from the interviews, ‘There is a set of training that is already provided by CSIRTs to  LE, i.e. for OSINT [open-source intelligence], cryptographic keys ([…] published under the  ENFORCE project) and forensic tools, including forensics acquisition. There are cases of  prosecutors and judges that joint such trainings, as they had a demonstrated interest in the field’  LE and CSIRTs also participate in training exercises provided by the ENFORCE Project. The  ENFORCE project is a ‘European project co-funded by the European Commission in the  framework of the Internal Security Fund – Police. […]. The ENFORCE project aims at designing,  setting-up, and disseminating a cybercrime training curriculum at the European level. This  curriculum will be validated during a training exercise allowing different European public (e.g.  law enforcement agencies and CSIRTs) and private actors fighting cybercrime to train together  using state-of-the-art training technology’. CEIS, the coordinator of the ENFORCE Project, also  co-organizes a cybercrime training with the Luxembourgian CIRCL and the French National  Police” (CEIS, n.d.). This training material specifically addresses aspects of cooperation.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  52  According to the data collected during the interviews, CSIRTs have received training from the  Customs Authority. This was in the form of a workshop, where the Customs Authority shared  concerns related to cybercrime and was able to discuss how CSIRTs can help (e.g. when  seizing equipment at the borders and how this should be handled before being submitted for  analysis  2.10. NORWAY  Norway is a constitutional monarchy and a member country of EFTA and a signatory to the  European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement (EFTA, n.d.a), (EFTA, n.d.).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Norway is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Norwegian legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Norway adopted a new NCSS in 2019; this is the fourth edition of the NCSS, with the first  strategy published in 2003 (ENISA, n.d.i) (Norwegian Ministeries, n.d.).  Norway ratified the Budapest Convention in 2006.  2.10.1.

National cyber security agency  The Ministry of Justice and Public Security is primarily the responsible authority for network and  information security in Norway. The Norwegian National Security Authority (Nasjonal  sikkerhetsmyndighet – NSM) is the national organisation focusing on cybersecurity in the  country. Under the NSM, organisations run different functions related to cybersecurity and  cybercrime, such as the Norwegian CERT (NorCERT) and the Norwegian National Cyber  Security Centre (Nasjonalt cybersikkerhetssenter – NCSC) (NSM, n.d.).  In addition, the NSM established partnerships with other entities such as the Norwegian Centre  for Information Security (NorSiS), an independent organisation (established in 2002 as a project  and founded in 2010 by governmental request, who collect and disseminate cybersecurity  knowledge among Norwegian companies, local government and individuals. Among its  activities, NorSIS coordinates, on behalf of the Ministry of Justice, the National Security Month,  the pan-European exercise to protect EU infrastructure against coordinated cyber attacks.  2.10.1.2. CSIRTs  Norway has an officially recognised national and governmental CSIRT (NSM, n.d.). The NSM is  responsible for NorCERT, which handles severe cyberattacks against critical infrastructures and  information.  The main activities of NorCERT are ‘response to cyber threats in [… the NorCERT] technical  threat operation centre 24/7; operate and organise a national sensor network on the internet to  detect data breaches in critical infrastructure across sectors; reverse engineering, forensics,  network analysis and counterintelligence’ (NCSC, n.d.).  In addition, Norway has different sectorial CSIRTs, such as:  • HelseCERT, which supports the Norwegian healthcare sector (HelseCERT, n.d.)  • UNINETT CERT, of the UNINETT ‘ICT infrastructure company in Norway’ (UNINETT,  n.d.) (UNINETT , n.d a).  • UiO-CERT, the University of Oslo’s CSIRT (UiO-CERT, n.d.).  2.10.1.3. LE  The Norwegian Police Security Service (Politiets sikkerhetstjeneste – PST) is the national  security service of Norway. The activities of the PST are assigned by the Police Act and it  reports directly to the Ministry of Justice and Public Security.  The main aim of the National Criminal Investigation Service (Den nasjonale enhet for  bekjempelse av organisert og annen alvorlig kriminalitet – Kripos) is to prevent and combat  serious organised crime. Its main functions are criminal investigations, forensic investigations,  gathering criminal intelligence and undertaking international police cooperation (Politiet, n.d.).  The National Cybercrime Centre (NC3), set up in January 2019, falls under Kripos. The main  activities of NC3 fall under the following areas: cybercrime investigations, digital forensics,  internet investigations and internet crimes against children (Politiet, n.d. a). The NC3 provides  assistance to the police district, conducts its own cybercrime investigations while developing  national Police’s cyber expertise. It aims to become \"the national centre of expertise and  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  54  knowledge in terms of technology-related policing, with about 150 employees\" (Politiet, n.d. a)  by the end of 2022. The NC3 is structured around 6 sections (incoming request, online police  presence, Internet crimes against children, cybercrime, digital forensics, investigative support)  and 3 underlying units (Intelligence, technique development, digital support). Within Kripos there  is also a high-tech crime division that acts as a 24/7 point of contact.  The National Police Directorate is the highest police authority in Norway and ‘falls under the  Ministry of Justice and Public Security’. The National Police Directorate supports police bodies  and special units and provides expertise (Politiet, n.d.c).  As emerged from one of the interviews conducted, in relation to cybercrime, the role of the  national Police in Norway, in particular Kripos, is prevention and investigation and intelligence  gathering. For LEAs in Norway, fighting cybercrime is no different from fighting other crimes.  Prosecutors are integrated into LEAs, sharing the same offices with LE personnel; hence, there  is a seamless exchange of information and close cooperation between the two. On the legal  framework side a specific Police Act allows Police to share information with the national CERT  to prevent criminal activities.  Finally, Norway is part of the Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol,  n.d.c).  2.10.1.4. Judiciary  The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority (Påtalemyndigheten) is the competent authority for legal  prosecutions in Norway. It handles investigations and prosecutions of criminal cases.  The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority is divided into the following levels:  • the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP);  • the Regional Public Prosecution Offices (PPO);  • the Prosecuting Authority in the Police (Higher Prosecuting Authority, n.d.)  The National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime  (Den sentrale enhet for etterforsking og påtale av økonomisk kriminalitet og miljøkriminalitet –  Økokrim) provides services as a police unit but also as a prosecution authority with specific  expertise in computer crime and fraud (Økokrim, n.d.).  In Norwegian judicial system, the supreme court ‘is the highest court in Norway […] and has an  authority in all areas of the law’ (Domstol, n.d.). Judicial cooperation in criminal matters with EU  Member States is based on the principles of mutual recognition and direct contact between the  judicial authorities.  Norway also cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.10.2. Synergies and potential interferences  As mentioned above, Økokrim, because of its dual nature as a police unit and a prosecution  authority, cooperates with a number of other authorities, such as surveillance authorities, the  business sector, in combating economic and environmental crime.  In addition, the Joint Cyber Coordination Centre (Felles cyberkoordineringssenter – FCKS) is a  key collaborative hub that consists of representatives from the NSM, the Norwegian Intelligence  Service, the PST and Kripos. The FCKS is also coordinated by the NSM (FCKS, n.d.).  ESTABLISHED  SYNERGIES  Through the Joint  Cyber Coordination  Centre, prosecutors  hold monthly  meetings with the  legal officers of the  CERT communities.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  55  NC3 cooperates closely with public and private security entities in Norway and abroad,  especially regarding the exchange of information (Politiet, n.d.b). Cooperation mechanisms  have also been established between LE and NorCERT.  The interviews showed that a lot of synergies are established in tactical operations and at  strategic levels. There are cases of LEAs and national CERTs attending crime scenes together  and conducting investigations together, to complement each other’s capabilities. For instance, if  information is discovered by LE that is deemed important for a national CERT, this information  is passed on to the CERT. Joint reports are prepared and submitted to the government in the  field of cybercrime, including on risks. Another example is LEAs and CERTs discussing and  analysing the issues together. Through the Joint Cyber Coordination Centre, prosecutors hold  monthly meetings with the legal officers of the CERT communities.  However, as emerged in the interviews, there are also potential interferences. In one example, in  the early stages of cooperation the national CERT found a command and control (CC) server  abroad and passed the information to the hosting country. The hosting country could have  decided to shut down the server, which may have been problematic for the LEA and its operational  plan.  2.10.3. Examples of training  The Norwegian Police University College (Politihøgskolen – (NPUC) ‘is the central educational  institution for the police service in Norway. Basic training for police officers is a three-year  university college education aimed at providing a broad practical and theoretical foundation’.  The college provides education in areas such as ‘policing, crime investigation and prevention,  and prosecution and administrative responsibilities’ (OSCE, n.d.b.).  The college also provides training in areas such as:  • international civil crisis management;  • Schengen Border and Immigration Service;  • Nordic Baltic Police Academy (NPUC, n.d.) (OSCE, n.d.b.).  The NPUC is also a member of the European Cybercrime Training and Education Group  (ECTEG) (ECTEG, n.d. a).  The Norwegian Center for Cyber and Information Security (CCIS) develops cybersecurity  competences for Norwegian agencies, companies and academia, for example by organising a  Security Hackathon and workshops. It is supported by the Ministry of Justice and Public  Security and members of its board of directors come from authorities such as the NSM, the  Police Directorate and the NPUC, among others (CCIS, n.d.).  From the data collected in the interviews, it emerged that the different communities (CSIRTs, LE  and Judiciary) participate in shared exercises with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO), as well as other national exercises held by private partners. LEAs also participate in  such training activities along with the private sector, mostly in the telecoms field.  NC3 organises training for LEAs as well as prosecutors.  2.11. POLAND  Poland is ‘a parliamentary republic with a head of government - the prime minister - and a head  of state - the president. The government structure is centred on the council of ministers. The  country is divided into 16 provinces, largely based on the country’s historic regions.  Administrative authority at provincial level is shared between a government-appointed governor,  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  56  an elected regional assembly and an executive elected by the regional assembly’ (European  Union, n.d.s).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Poland is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Polish legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  The current NCSS is the Cybersecurity strategy of the Republic of Poland for 2019-2024  (NASK, 2019). The Strategy highlights the necessity of cross-border cooperation of LEAs and  CSIRTs and that, as time is a critical factor in procedural actions and operational investigations,  efficient and reliable information-sharing channels between LEAs of different countries are  required.  The NIS Directive was fully implemented in Poland on 21 November 2018, when the Regulation  on serious incidents thresholds applicable to operators of essential services (Dz.U. 2018 poz.  2180) was published. The implementation of the directive began when Poland adopted the Act  on the National Cybersecurity System (Dz.U.2018.1560) on 5 July 2018 (Polish Parliament,  2018).  In 2015, the National Security Bureau (BBN) published the Polish Cybersecurity Doctrine  (National Security Bureau, 2015).  Poland ratified the Budapest Convention in 2015.  2.11.1. Roles and duties  In Poland, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related to  preventing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  Internal Security Agency  Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego  - Governmental Computer Security  Incident Response Team  Zespół Reagowania na Incydenty  Bezpieczeństwa Komputerowego CSIRT-GOV  CSIRT NASK CSIRT NASK CSIRT NASK  - CERT Poland CERT Polska CERT Polska  National Police Headquarters Komenda Główna Policji  - Cybercrime Bureau Biuro do Walki z Cyberprzestępczością  Central Forensic Laboratory of the Police Centralne Laboratorium Kryminalistycznego  Policji CLKP  General Public Prosecutor's Office Prokuratura Krajowa  2.11.1.1. National cybersecurity agency  Poland does not have a dedicated cybersecurity agency. Two entities deal with cybersecurity at  governmental and national levels.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  57  The Internal Security Agency (Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego) ‘is a government  institution which protects the internal security of the Republic of Poland and its citizens’ (Internal  Security Agency, n.d.). It tackles crimes such as ‘terrorism, espionage, breach of State secrets,  […] crimes connected with production of and trade in goods, technologies and services of  strategic importance for the State’s security, illegal production and possession of and trade in  arms’, etc. (Internal Security Agency, n.d.). The Internal Security Agency operates CSIRT-GOV,  the Polish governmental CSIRT.  The NASK is a national research institute (see below) under the supervision of the Chancellery  of the Polish Prime Minister. It operates the Polish national CSIRT.  2.11.1.2. CSIRTs  The Act on the national security system, which implements the NIS Directive into the Polish  legal system, appoints three institutions to serve as response teams (NASK, n.d.):  • The Internal Security Agency, via CSIRT-GOV;  • The NASK (Research and Academic Computer Network - Naukowa i Akademicka  Sieć Komputerowa), via CSIRT NASK;  • The Ministry of National Defence, via CSIRT-MON (which is not described here as  from the data collected did not emerged that it plays a role in the cooperation between  CSIRTs and LE in fighting cybercrime).  The Polish national CSIRT, CSIRT NASK, operates in accordance with the Act on the national  security system. It is responsible for handling incidents from the public and private sectors, local  governments and other entities which are not part of the central government or of a critical  infrastructure (NASK, n.d.). CSIRT NASK can be called to court as an expert witness for  cybercrime cases. According to one of the interviewees, CSIRT NASK is often appointed as an  expert witness by judges. Its testimonies are provided in the form of written reports. By law, it  could be called to court physically, however in practice, this is very rare.  Additionally, as NASK is a national research institute, it conducts research and develops  capabilities and tools for efficient monitoring and handling of security incidents. For example,  CSIRT NASK maintains the “Warning List” (CERT.PL, 2020), a service which provides a  frequently updated list of dangerous/malicious domains. Many Internet service providers,  including telecom operators, use this tool so the Internet users receive a warning message  when trying to access a domain used for phishing or malware distribution. CSIRT NASK also  maintains and develops MWDB (CERT.PL), a Malware Analysis Platform, Database and  Community, to which cybersecurity professionals can request access.  CSIRT NASK can also provide advice to LE, such as on the data which might be useful for an  investigation and the actions which should be taken or procedures which should be followed to  gather more information.  CERT Poland operates within CSIRT NASK. It was established in 1996 as the first Polish  CERT. Active 24/7, it coordinates responses to incidents occurring in the Polish civilian  cyberspace reported by OES, digital service providers, local authorities and individuals. It also  monitors online threats and carries out expert and forensic computer analyses, using its  analytical and R&D facilities to identify malware and vulnerabilities, assessing and measuring  the scale of threats and mitigating them (CERT Polska, n.d.) (Trusted Introducer, n.d.).  CERT Poland is a member of the CSIRTs Network.  A team called “Dyżurnet.pl” also operates within CSIRT NASK. The Dyżurnet.pl team is a point  of contact which ‘responds to anonymous reports received from Internet users about potentially  illegal material, mainly related to sexual abuse of children’ (NASK, n.d.a).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  58  CSIRT-GOV is under the responsibility of the Head of the Internal Security Agency. It acts as  the governmental CSIRT responsible for coordinating the process of responding to computer  incidents occurring in the area indicated in Art. 26 (7) of the Act of 5 July 2018 on the national  cybersecurity system (public administration bodies and critical infrastructures) (Polish  government, 2019) (CSIRT-GOV, n.d.).  2.11.1.3. LE  Established in 2016, the Cybercrime Bureau of the National Police Headquarters (Policja,  n.d.):  • Supervises, coordinates and supports activities aiming to combat cybercrime  conducted by the National Police Headquarters in cooperation with the Central Police  Investigation Bureau;  • Coordinates the activities of the Police in preventing and fighting cyberthreats;  • Cooperates with the Office for International Police Cooperation;  • Conducts and supports R&D projects on new solutions to fight cybercrime.  The Cybercrime Bureau is composed of the following departments:  • Intelligence Department;  • Operations Department;  • Forensics Department.  Investigations are conducted by the Operations Department of the Cybercrime Bureau.  The Cybercrime Bureau supervises cybercrime units in the field. There is a regional cybercrime  unit in each voivodeships (regions) of Poland.  The Central Forensic Laboratory of the Police is responsible for the development and the  supervision of forensic activities within the Polish Police (Central Forensic Laboratory of the  Police, n.d.). Its tasks include the examination of computer hardware and digital services:  • Identification of computer hardware and peripheral devices;  • Determination of the application of computer devices, their performance and memory  size;  • Analysis of data saved on digital devices;  • Data recovery from digital devices.  Finally, Poland is part of Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol, n.d.c).  2.11.1.4. Judiciary  Criminal investigations and prosecutions are carried out under the responsibility of prosecutors.  The Public Prosecutor's Office consists of the Prosecutor General, the National Prosecutor  and deputy Prosecutors General (Public Prosecutor's Office, n.d.). There are also regional  Public Prosecutor's Offices.  Within the Prosecutor General's Office, ‘several prosecutors have been designated to provide  coordination and support’ in cases involving cyberattacks/incidents (Council of the European  Union, 2017f). There is a division for cybercrime (Cybercrime, IT and Analysis department)  within the General Prosecutor's Office and cybercrime departments in the regional Offices.  Poland cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  59  2.11.2. Synergies and potential interferences  The cooperation between the three communities was assessed overall by the interviewees as  good, especially as the three communities have different roles and duties.  As highlighted during the interviews, CSIRT NASK cooperates daily with LE. It was mentioned  during the interviews that the CSIRT’s hotline is often used by LE in the course of an  investigation, which is ‘extremely useful, as many police units (especially in smaller  municipalities) might not have a dedicated cybercrime unit’. In such cases, the CSIRT ‘can  provide advice on the data that might be useful for an investigation, on the actions that should  be taken or procedures that should be followed to gather more information, etc.’. However, LE  must submit a formal request to the CSIRT to receive specific information related to a  cybercrime case.  One example of a successful synergy between the national CSIRT, the LE and the Judiciary is  the case involving the Vortex ransomware, used for several attacks across Poland. The  cooperation between the national CSIRT, the Cybercrime Bureau of the National Police  Headquarters and the Warsaw Prosecutor’s Office led to the arrest of a criminal who used this  ransomware. They also managed to secure the encryption keys and CSIRT NASK could  develop and publish a decryption tool for this type of ransomware (CERT Polska, 2018).  One of the experts interviewed underlined that LE and the Judiciary could benefit from more  training regarding new technologies and technical aspects of cybercrime, as not all police  departments have units specifically dedicated to fighting cybercrime, and judges and  prosecutors could improve their understanding of the specificities of cyberspace.  It was also mentioned during the interviews that ‘cybercrime-fighting entities would greatly  benefit from a central system that would be a single source of knowledge (including IoCs)  regarding cybercrime incidents being investigated’. This could be especially useful to identify the  victims of a widespread attack and to make it one single case. Currently, it is difficult for local  police departments to link one complaint or one notification of a suspected crime to a wider  campaign. They often ask the national CSIRT to share information on a specific incident, which  allows the CSIRT to identify other potential victims.  2.11.3. Examples of training  NASK organised and led a series of training for police officers as part of a dedicated  programme. Training covered fighting cybercrime and children’s safety in the cyberspace.  CSIRT NASK also provides training and workshops to police officers and prosecutors on  cybercrime related topics, such as the darkweb, cryptocurrencies, and OSINT. However, CSIRT  NASK does not provide training to judges.  Additionally, the Cybercrime Bureau of the National Police Headquarters organises trainings for  the prosecutors to enhance their knowledge in cybercrime matters.  The experts interviewed were not aware of a training initiative involving the three communities.  2.12. PORTUGAL  Portugal is ‘a semi-presidential republic with a head of government, the prime minister, and a  head of state, the president, who has power to appoint the prime minister and other government  members. The country is administratively divided into 308 municipalities, subdivided into 3 092  civil parishes’ (European Union, n.d.k).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Portugal is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Portuguese legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  AN EXAMPLE  OF TRAINING  TO FOSTER  SYNERGIES  CSIRT NASK  provides training and  workshops to police  officers and  prosecutors on  cybercrime related  topics, such as the  darkweb,  cryptocurrencies,  and OSINT.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  60  Portugal adopted its first NCSS in 2015. In 2019, the Portuguese government issued the NCSS  for 2019–2023 (ENISA, n.d.j).  Portugal ratified the Budapest Convention in 2010.  2.12.1. Roles and duties  In Portugal, the following authorities and departments, in particular21, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department  in English  Name of the authority/department in  the original language  Abbreviation/short  name in the original  language (if  applicable)  CERT.PT CERT.PT CERT.PT  Portuguese National  Cybersecurity Centre  Centro Nacional de Cibersegurança  CNCS  National Communications Agency Autoridade Nacional de  Comunicações ANACOM (22)  Judicial Police  Polícia Judiciária PJ  Public Security Police  Polícia de Segurança Pública  PSP  National Unit to Combat  Cybercrime and Technological  Crime  Unidade Nacional de Combate ao  Cibercrime e à Criminalidade  Tecnológica  UNC3T  Internal Intelligence Service Serviço de Informações de Segurança SIS  Prosecutor General’s Office Procurador-Geral da República PGR  Public Prosecution Service Ministério Público MP  Central Department of Criminal  Investigation and Prosecution  Departamento Central de Investigação  e Ação Penal DCIAP  Judicial system  2.12.1.1. National cybersecurity agency  The Portuguese National Cybersecurity Centre (Centro Nacional de Cibersegurança –  CNCS) (CNCS, n.d.) monitors and coordinates the implementation of the NCSS and is the  single point of contact. Its main focus is informing and raising the awareness of not only public  entities and critical infrastructures but also the business sector and civil society.  2.12.1.2. CSIRTs  Portugal has an officially recognised national CSIRT, CERT.PT (CNCS, n.d.a). CERT.PT ‘is a  service integrated in the Portuguese National Cybersecurity Centre that coordinates the  (21) The authorities and departments presented here are the main authorities/departments responsible for preventing,  analysing and fighting cyber incidents/cybercrime. Other authorities/departments not presented here might play a role on an  ad hoc basis.  (22) For a description of the role of ANACOM see below Section 2.12.2.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  61  response to incidents involving State entities, operators of Critical infrastructures, operators of  essential services, digital service providers and, in general, the national cyberspace, including  any device belonging to a network or address block attributed to an operator of electronic  communications, institution, collective or singular person based, or physically located, in  Portuguese territory’ (CNCS, n.d.a) (CNCS, n.d.e). Its mission is to enhance national capacity in  cybersecurity by creating new CSIRTs and developing the capacities of existing ones. CERT.PT  is a member of the National CSIRT Network and a national representative in the CSIRTs  Network.  2.12.1.3. LE  The Judicial Police (Polícia Judiciária, n.d.) investigates violent crime, organised crime and  financial crime. It is ‘a higher criminal police force falling under the Ministry of Justice. Its  mission is to assist judicial and prosecuting authorities with investigations and to develop and  foster preventive, detection and investigative actions, falling within its remit or entrusted with by  the competent judicial and prosecuting authorities. […]. Polícia Judiciária is also responsible for  ensuring the operation of the Europol National Unit and the Interpol National Central Bureau,  within the framework established by national legislation” (Europol, n.d.b).  With the aim to fight against cybercrime, the Judicial Police established in February 2017 the  National Unit to Combat Cybercrime and Technological Crime (Unidade Nacional de Combate  ao Cibercrime e à Criminalidade Tecnológica), also known as UNCT3. A specialised team  within the UNCT3 supports criminal investigations with technical and legal aspects (Polícia  Judiciária, n.d.a). The Judicial Police also relies on its Central Investigation Section for IT and  Telecommunications.  The Public Security Police (Polícia de Segurança Pública – PSP) is responsible for maintaining  security and public order and investigating non-organised crimes and violent crimes (PSP, n.d.).  The Internal Intelligence Service (Serviço de Informações de Segurança – SIS, (SIS, n.d.)  produces security intelligence to assist political decision-makers in fighting cybercrime, among  other crimes. To accomplish its mission, the SIS is supported by all of the security and LEAs  and public authorities in general.  According to the data collected in the interviews, the organisation in Portugal in charge of  cybercrime is Judicial Police, the police force that deals with anti-corruption, counter-terrorism,  drug prevention and serious cybercrime.  2.12.1.4. Judiciary  The Portuguese judicial system ‘has two separate sets of courts, the civil courts and the  administrative courts. Provision is also made for other courts, such as the Constitutional Court.  In the civil sphere, the ordinary courts with civil and criminal jurisdiction are the judicial courts’  (European Union, n.d.j).  The Public Prosecution Service (Ministério Público – PPS) (PPS, n.d.) is the Portuguese  prosecution authority. Within the PPS, the Prosecutor General’s Office (Procurador-Geral da  República – PGO) (PGO, n.d.) acts as the central authority for international judicial cooperation  in criminal matters. In addition, within the PPS, the Central Department of Criminal Investigation  and Prosecution (Departamento Central de Investigação e Ação Penal – DCIAP) (DCIAP, n.d.)  is a body entrusted with the coordination of the investigation of organised crime, as well as  crime prevention, while the Cybercrime Office of the Public Prosecution Service is in charge of  coordinating internally with the Public Prosecution Service, to provide specific training and to  establish communication with internet service providers to facilitate collaboration during criminal  investigations.  Portugal cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  62  2.12.2. Synergies and potential interferences  ‘The National Cybersecurity Centre is the operational coordinator and the Portuguese national  authority specialised in cybersecurity working in this field with State entities, operators of Critical  Infrastructures, operators of essential services and digital service providers, ensuring that the  cyberspace is used as an area of freedom, security and justice, for the protection of all the  sectors of society that materialize national sovereignty and the Democratic State under the rule  of law’ (CNCS, n.d.b) (CNCS, n.d.f).  ANACOM (National Communications Authority, Autoridade Nacional de Comunicações) is the  regulator, supervisor and representative of the communications sector in Portugal. The authority  is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Electronic Communications Law (ANACOM,  n.d.). In terms of criminal investigations, there is close cooperation between ANACOM, the  Judicial Police and the Prosecutor General’s Office on combating cybercrime and obtaining  digital evidence (ANACOM, n.d a).  As highlighted by one of the interviewees, ‘Nothing prevents the cooperation between CSIRTs,  LE and […judiciary]. However, there are no particular laws in place’. ‘CSIRTs officers have the  obligation to report malicious/suspicious events to the prosecution service’, which derives from  the general rule stating that all ‘public institutions have the obligation to cooperate with the LE  and the prosecution service during criminal investigations’.  CERT-PT ‘coordinates the response to incidents involving State entities, operators of essential  services, operators of national critical infrastructures and digital service providers. In addition,  the National Unit to Combat Cybercrime and Technological Crime (UNC3T) collaborates and  directly supports the actions of prevention, detection and mitigation developed by national  entities (Polícia Judiciária, n.d.a). Finally, the Internal Intelligence Service (SIS, n.d.)  collaborates closely with LEAs and public authorities, as well as providing support when this is  requested.  As emerged from the interviews, one example of synergy is the sharing of methodologies: both  CSIRTs and LEAs run regular laboratories and/or joint exercises and share methodologies.  Another example is the sharing of information: LEAs frequently share indicators of compromise  or indicators of threat with the other G4 members through the communication channel to verify  the information. There are also synergies across the different communities with regard to  training: the Police provide lectures to the school of magistrates and criminal police schools, as  well as annual lectures to magistrates and the academic community.  Since the transposition of the NIS Directive, a new national law (Cybersecurity law) mentioned  the needs of cooperation between the Portuguese CERT (the Portuguese national CERT is  within the Cyber Centre) and other national CSIRTs. In addition, there is a clause in the law  stating that the CNCS and the national criminal Police should cooperate. This group involves  four entities (known as G4):  • 1) the CNCS  • 2) the Judicial Police  • 3) the Cyber defence and  • 4) the intelligence services.  The G4 group collaborates with cyber diplomacy, a body within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  which is also tasked with supporting national services with information exchange in the EU  space.  However, magistrates are not part of the G4 group because they have their own powers and  can act directly/ask LE and the CNCS for services and information. They are therefore not  SYNERGIES IN  MULTIPLE  LEVELS  Examples of  synergies include  sharing of  methodologies,  sharing of  information and  training activities.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  63  explicitly mentioned in the legal act. Members of the G4 group have regular meetings and  occasionally, if needed, undertake joint operations.  Nevertheless, addressing cybersecurity means dealing with the global security of cyberspace  and sometimes there is an overlap between the CNCS and the Police. For example, if a CSIRT  decides to bring down (‘takedown procedure’) a botnet without consulting a LEA that may be in  the process of investigating it, this can cause disruptions. The G4 group was created to try and  avoid conflicts and overlapping activities, and weekly meetings increase the levels of  communication between the parties.  2.12.3. Examples of training  The CNCS ensures that suitable training activities are provided to the CSIRT community,  including but not limited to training sessions for CSIRT operators and coordination of national  cybersecurity exercises and participation to international cybersecurity exercises. In addition,  the CNCS supports the establishment of new CSIRTs, defines the required capabilities and  circulates best practices for the handling of cybersecurity incidents (CNCS, n.d.c.).  In terms of LE training, the PSP offers both training/teaching courses at a basic level and  specialised courses. The courses are taught by the Higher Institute of Police Sciences and  Internal Security (Instituto Superior de Ciências Policiais e Segurança Interna – ISCPSI)  (ISCPSI, n.d.) and the Police Training School (Escola Prática de Polícia). The Police Training  School provides training in criminal investigations. In addition, UNC3T is responsible for  ensuring collaboration and direct participation in initial and ongoing training on cybercrime for  staff involved in criminal investigations and in supporting the Judicial Police.  The recent project \"Homeland Security Fund\" (Fundo para a Segurança Interna) of the Judicial  Police aims to develop its internal capacity, in particular its know-how regarding the collection of  cybercrime evidence (Policia judiciaria, 2018). Launched in April 2020 and expected to be  finalised by the end of 2021, the project includes the certification of experts within the Judicial  Police, the creation of an internal trainer pool, the conduct of trainings as well as the  decentralisation of the training infrastructure.  In addition, the Portuguese Judicial Police is a co-founding member of ECTEG (European  Cybercrime Training & Education Group) and participate actively to its activities, such as the e- First project in 2019 held on its facilities. The project targets as final product the delivery of a  self-training platform available 24/7 specialised on cybersecurity and cybercrime.  The Centre for Judiciary Studies (Centro de Estudos Judiciários – CEJ) (CEJ, n.d.) provides  training for the Judiciary on cybercrime and digital evidence, as well as on cyber components of  the penal code and criminal investigations, aiming to provide to all judges and prosecutors a  minimum level of knowledge and information on cybercrime. As reported during one of the  interviews, the ‘judiciary community has established initiatives that usually try to involve experts  from the other communities in their training activities (provided for prosecutors, judges,  sometimes lawyers and LE). This is a common practice as they have observed the benefits of  such an exchange.’ This will also help ‘to ensure that Judiciary experts provide guidance to  CSIRTs’.  The interviews revealed that CSIRTs and LE carry out joint exercises; however, in 2020 any  planned training was not held because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Judiciary (prosecutors  and judges) do not currently participate in such activities. The interviewees noted that CSIRTs  and LE want to find a common approach. Once this is accomplished, they will expand the  training to the Judiciary community as well.  From the data collected in the interviews, it emerged that LE personnel participate in civil  postgraduate programmes (legal or engineering programmes). Efforts are also being made to  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  64  provide more engineering courses to legal actors and more legal knowledge to engineers and  set up links with the academic community. This is something that LE supports heavily through  liaising with professors and students to inspire collaborations. LE participates in lectures e.g. on  cybercrime law, digital forensics and ethics.  As indicated in the interviews, the CNCS delivers such training online along with awareness  courses for the public. LEAs receive training provided by the school of magistrates and criminal  police schools, with the CNCS also providing annual lectures to magistrates.  2.13. ROMANIA  Romania is ‘a semi-presidential republic with a head of government – the prime minster – and a  head of state – the president. The country is divided into 41 counties and the municipality of  Bucharest’ (European Union, n.d.l).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Romania is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Romania legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Romania adopted its NCSS in 2013 (ENISA, n.d.k) and legislation that transposes the EU NIS  Directive (Law No 362/2018) in 2018 (CERT RO, 2020).

Currently, the Romanian National  Computer Security Incident Response Team (Centrul Național de Răspuns la Incidente de  Securitate Cibernetică – CERT-RO) (CERT-RO, n.d.) no longer operates under the Ministry of  Communication and Information Society (MCSI), but is coordinated by the Chancellery of the  Prime Minister (Portal Legislativ, n.d.). According to the law transposing the NIS Directive (Law  No 362/2018), CERT-RO is the national competent authority for network and information  systems and has an operational role (CERT RO, 2020).  2.13.1.2. CSIRTs  Romania has an officially recognised national CSIRT: CERT-RO ‘is the National CERT of  Romania, established as an independent structure for research, development and expertise in  the field of cyber-security. It is a specialized organization responsible for preventing, analysing,  identifying and reacting to cyber incidents. CERT-RO is the national contact point for similar  structures. CERT-RO is responsible for elaborating and distributing public politics for prevention  and counteracting the incidents that occur within national cyber infrastructures’ (CERT-RO, n.d.  a).  CORIS-STS (Operational Response Centre for Security Incidents, Centrul Operațional de  Răspuns la Incidente de Securitate) is the Romanian governmental CSIRT and is part of the  Romanian Special Telecommunications Service (STS). This CERT ‘is designated to prevent  and respond to security incidents related to information and communications systems of the  Special Telecommunications Service and its clients’ (CORIS-STS, n.d.). The beneficiaries of the  CORSI-STS are public high-level authorities, such as the Parliament, the Presidency, the  overnment, defence related entities, central and local administration and judicial related entities.  CERT-MIL (Cyber Security Incident Response Center, Centrul de Răspuns la Incidente de  Securitate Cibernetică) (CERT-MIL, n.d.) is the Romanian Military CSIRT, under the Ministry of  Defence CSIRT, and is responsible for the management of cybersecurity incidents in the  relevant cyber infrastructures, ensuring their detection, investigation and response in  accordance with the regulations and procedures in force under the Ministry of National Defence.  It was established in 2007 within the Ministry of National Defence and since 2020 has been the  responsibility of the Cyber Defence Command.  The National Cyberint Centre (Centrul Național Cyberint) is the cyber intelligence centre of the  Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI). Its main focus is on counter-espionage, economic  security, transnational threats and the protection of classified information. The SRI focuses on  cyberattacks, including those that originate in other states, and cybercrime groups, which may  also be associated with terrorist organisations or extremists (hacktivists) (SRI, n.d.).  2.13.1.3. LE  The Central Cybercrime Unit within the Romanian Police (Politia Romana, n.d.) is the primary  LEA dealing with cybercrime, with local capacities as well. More specifically it deals with:  • online fraud and fraud committed with electronic payment instruments;  • digital forensics;  • online child abuse;  • computer-related crimes (crimes against/through computer systems; unauthorised  computer/data access or data transfer).  It is a specialised unit (Politia Romana, n.d.a), with general territorial competence, that is  involved in combating and coordinating the fight against organised crime, including cybercrime,  at the national level. The activities carried out by the Directorate for Combating Organized  Crime include:  • Operational activity  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  66  • Control, support and guidance decisive in obtaining results at territorial level  • Information and decision support  • International representation/training (Politia Romana, n.d.a).  The challenges facing this specialised unit in 2020 are phishing campaigns/mobile malware  distribution related to COVID-19, ransomware attacks on health facilities/hospitals, attacks  against critical infrastructure holding personal data on COVID-19 patients, online fraud and SIM  SWAP scams (Council of Europe, 2020c).  Finally, Romania is part of the Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol,  n.d.c).  2.13.1.4. Judiciary  The supreme court in Romania is the High Court of Cassation and Justice. The judicial  authorities are divided by the regional and specialised jurisdiction (European e-Justice Portal,  n.d.)  Within the Prosecutor’s Office, which is under the responsibility of the High Court of Cassation  and Justice, the Service for Preventing and Combating Cyber-Crime is specifically dedicated to  fighting cybercrime and is made of two different units: the Office for Countering Cybercrime and  the Office for Countering Crimes Committed with Credit Cards and other Electronic Payment  Instruments. The service for Prevention and Combatting Cybercrime conducts investigation in  case of cybercrime and acts as the permanent point of contact for the network created under  the Budapest Convention.  In Romania, the issuing and execution of the request for international judicial cooperation in  criminal matters is under the competence of the courts and prosecution offices (EJN, n.d.a).  The Ministry of Justice, the Prosecutor’s Office of the High Court of Cassation and Justice and  the Ministry of Internal Affairs have responsibility for international judicial cooperation in criminal  matters (EJN, n.d.).  Romania cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.13.2. Synergies and potential interferences  ‘National cyber security system is the general framework of cooperation which brings together  public authorities and institutions with responsibilities and capabilities in the field in order to  ensure coordination of actions at national level for cyberspace security, including through  cooperation with academia and business, professional associations and organizations NGOs’  (CERT-RO, n.d.b).  Romania has developed official programmes for cybersecurity interagency cooperation and  information sharing, with CERT-RO playing a major role. CERT-RO has ‘signed a Memorandum  of Understanding (MoU) and Protocols with public institutions in the cybersecurity field’ (ITU,  n.d.).  The Romanian CSIRT, LE and Judiciary are cooperating on cybercrime cases under the  national legal framework, which is expected to be updated to provide further support for this  kind of cooperation, for example to stipulate in the criminal procedure code that CERT-RO could  be called to provide expertise to the Prosecutor’s Office and in court.  One example of this cooperation is the Romanian CSIRT, LE and Judiciary working together to  fight banking/financial malware (botnets) affecting Romanian citizens and financial institutions.  SYNERGIES IN  FIGHTING  CYBER  THREATS  The Romanian  CSIRT, LE and  Judiciary cooperate  in fighting cyber  threats affecting the  national IT  infrastructure,  citizens and  organisations.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  67  In terms of synergies, CERT-RO and the Romanian Police are working together to continuously  adapt the framework for information exchange and cooperation. One important aspect of this is  the tools needed to support the cooperation framework, and here CERT-RO has made  important steps recently by implementing a National Cybersecurity Services Platform (NCSP)  that can be used by all stakeholders: LEAs, CSIRTs, internet service providers, public and  private partners, and other authorities.  Another common objective is to assure that technical training is provided for those who work in  the areas of cybersecurity and cybercrime. CERT-RO also has a leading role here by organising  regular technical workshops and seminars for all relevant stakeholders.  Possible interferences have been reduced drastically as a result of recent developments in  implementation of an optimal cooperation framework between the CSIRT, Police and Judiciary.  Some interferences may still occur in cybercrime investigations, mainly because of the different  focuses that these communities have, i.e. incident mitigation (CSIRTs) compared with evidence  preservation and criminal prosecution (LE and Judiciary).  2.13.3. Examples of training  Since 2017, a national cyber exercise called CyDEX has been organised by the SRI through its  National Cyberint Center, in cooperation with the national CSIRT (CERT-RO), the Ministry of  Defence, the Military Technical Academy, the STS, the Protection and Guard Service and  organisations form different private sectors. The latest exercise included participants from more  than 90 organisations in the public and private sector, including CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary.  Training for LE at a foundational level and at advanced levels is provided by the Police  Academy and the Police Officers School in Romania.  The training of judges and public prosecutors is the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice.  Since 2004, the Ministry of Justice, through its website, has made available guides and useful  information on judicial cooperation, such as handbooks and manuals, for Romanian judges and  prosecutors (Romanian Ministry of Justice, n.d.).  In addition, the Romanian Centre of Excellence for Cybercrime Investigation (CYBEREX-RO)  offers training to those organisations working to combat cybercrime in Romania, such as CERT- RO, the General Inspectorate of Romanian Police (Inspectoratul General al Poliţiei Române –  IGPR) – Fraud Investigations Directorate (GIRP-FID, n.d.), the Prosecutor’s Office attached to  the High Court of Cassation and Justice (POHCCJ, n.d.), the National Institute for Magistracy  (NIM, n.d.), the Police Academy and others (European Commission, n.d.).Currently, there are  no examples of joint training between the three communities.  2.14. SLOVENIA  Slovenia is ‘a parliamentary democratic republic with a head of government, the prime minister,  and a head of state, the president, who is directly elected. The government holds executive and  administrative authority. The prime minister and ministers are elected by the Parliament.  Slovenia has no regions, but is subdivided into 212 municipalities’ (European Union, n.d.m).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Slovenia is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Slovenian legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  The Slovenian Cyber Security Strategy was published in 2016 (Slovenian government, 2016). It  foresees the enhancement of the capacity of the Police and the Judiciary to fight cybercrime,  with a focus on digital forensics. This includes appropriate training of all LEAs operating in this  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  68  field. The Strategy also underlines that knowledge in cybercrime is necessary for the ‘successful  prosecution of classic types of crime’, which increasingly use the Internet. Objective 5 of the  National Cybersecurity Strategy on the fight against cybercrime ‘foresees actions on regular  training on cybersecurity for law enforcement participating in the development of cyber  capacities for public security and in combating cybercrime’ (Slovenian government, 2016)  (Council of Europe, n.d.a).  The Slovenian National Assembly adopted the Act on Information Security in 2018, which  implements the NIS Directive into the Slovenian legal system (PISRS, 2018).  Slovenia ratified the Budapest Convention in 2004.  2.14.1. Roles and duties  In Slovenia, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related  to preventing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  Information Security Administration Uprava Republike Slovenije za informacijsko  varnost URSIV  SI-CERT SI-CERT SI-CERT  SIGOV-CERT SIGOV-CERT SIGOV-CERT  Criminal Police Directorate Uprava kriminalistične policije  - Computer Investigation Centre Center za računalniško preiskovanje  State Prosecutor’s Office Vrhovno državno tožilstvo Republike Slovenije  2.14.1.1. National cybersecurity agency  The Information Security Administration (URSIV) is the competent national body for  information security. It is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Administration. It was  established in 2020 after the vote of the Information Security Act (2018) (Slovenian  governement, 2021).  The URSIV is the central coordinating body at the strategic level of the national information  security system and the single point of contact of the state for international cooperation in this  field and with the European network of CSIRTs. The URSIV keeps the government and the  National Security Council (SNAV) of the state informed in case of increased threat which could  lead to a critical incident or cyberattack (Slovenian governement, 2021).  2.14.1.2. CSIRTs  SI-CERT is the Slovenian national CSIRT, while SIGOV-CERT is the governmental one.  Established in 1995, SI-CERT is the national CSIRT of Slovenia as defined in the Act on  Information Security (Art. 28) (PISRS, 2018). SI-CERT is part of ARNES (Academic and  Research Network of Slovenia) within the Sector of National Internet Infrastructure (SI-CERT,  n.d) (SI-CERT, n.d.a). It is the ‘main contact point for reporting network security incidents  involving systems and networks located in Slovenia’ (Council of Europe, n.d.a).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  69  SI-CERT performs risk and incident handling in accordance with Article 28 of the Information  Security Act (PISRS, 2018), which defines following responsibilities:  • Offer of support, help and cooperation in case of incident;  • Sharing of data about risks and vulnerabilities with the affected systems’  administrators, and issues warnings;  • Cooperation with CSIRT groups and security operation centres in Slovenia and CSIRT  groups in other EU Member States;  • Raising the awareness of users in the area of cybersecurity;  • Cooperation with the competent national authority and offer of information upon  request.  SI-CERT is a member of the CSIRTs Network.  SIGOV-CERT is the Slovenian governmental CERT of Slovenia. It is a young structure, created  in 2019. Its constituency includes all networks, information systems and users of those systems  managed by the Ministry of Public Administration of Slovenia. However, the Ministry of the  Interior, the Ministry of Defence and the Slovenian Intelligence and Security Agency are  responsible for ensuring the security of their networks and information systems (Slovenian  government, 2021).  2.14.1.3. Judiciary  The State prosecution services of Slovenia are composed of:  • The State Prosecutor General’s Office, which supervises and coordinates the work  of eleven District State Prosecutors’ Offices (State Prosecutor’s Office, n.d.);  • The Specialised State Prosecutor’s Office, which deals with the most complex  criminal offences (State Prosecuror's Office, n.d.a).  State prosecutors operate at four levels:  • Supreme state prosecutors;  • Higher state prosecutors;  • District state prosecutors;  • Local state prosecutors.  State prosecutors perform their tasks in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Act (Policija,  2007). They can exercise their authority to give guidance and obligatory instructions to the  Police during the investigation. The cooperation between the Slovenian Police and the  prosecutors is ruled by the ‘Decree on the cooperation of the State Prosecutorial Service, the  Police and other competent State bodies and institutions in the detection and prosecution of  perpetrators of criminal offences and the operation of specialised and joint investigation teams’  (Official Journal of the Slovenian Republic, 2010).  State Prosecutors usually do not directly contact entities other than the Police, which means  that direct contact/communication with CSIRTs is relatively rare.  ‘There are no separate departments for prosecution of cybercrime [within the State prosecution  services], but some state prosecutors are specialised’ in this area (Council of Europe, n.d.a).  If a case is related to both cybercrime and criminal organisations, it can fall under the  competence of the Specialised State Prosecutor’s Office, otherwise any of eleven District State  Prosecutor Offices can be competent.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  70  Slovenia cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.14.2. Synergies and potential interferences  According to the data collected via the interviews, synergies exist between the three  communities, based on their specific roles and duties.  The CSIRT community can provide technical expertise to LE and the Judiciary, specifically on  how the systems and networks work and on malware analysis, while LE provides investigative  skills and knowledge in digital forensics. The Judiciary can provide legal support to the CSIRT  about relevant provisions related to criminal offences and procedures.  Interviewees did not identify major interferences in the roles and duties of the three  communities, however they highlighted that the communities have different interests and ‘speak  different languages’, which can be challenging. An example was given by one of the experts  interviewed, who experienced a situation where the CSIRT’s interest was to inform its  constituency of an incident, while the Police’s interest was not to reveal the incident while  investigating. In such cases however, LE and the CSIRT community usually coordinate to find  the best way to act.  Another challenge highlighted during the interviews is the difficulty the communities may have in  understanding each other. On the one hand for example, prosecutors and judges may  encounter difficulty in understanding the technical details of a criminal offence in a cybercrime  related case; on the other hand, a CSIRT representative may ‘find difficult to understand what a  prosecutor or judge needs from a legal point of view, and how the technical data/information  could be used during criminal proceedings’. During the interviews it was suggested that this  challenge could be addressed by organising joint seminars so the three communities could  exchange knowledge and experience.  2.14.3. Examples of training  SI-CERT and LE representatives participate in the annual workshop organised by ENISA and  Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). One interviewee explained that input provided  during one of these workshops by European counterparts on how they cooperate was very  beneficial: since then, the SI-CERT and the Slovenian Computer Investigation Centre try to  organise informal workshops every three months to enhance their cooperation. Due to the  pandemic, these workshops are currently organised online.  Additionally, once a year, the Computer Investigation Centre organises a joint meeting, to which  the CSIRT community is invited.  During these joint events, the two communities exchange best practices and lessons learned.  They present relevant cases and discuss them.  The experts interviewed were not aware of joint events or trainings involving the three  communities, although such initiatives would, according to them, be very beneficial.  2.15. SPAIN  Spain is ‘a parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy with a head of government,  the prime minister, and a head of state, the Monarch. A council of ministers is the executive  branch and is presided over by the prime minister. Spain is a unitary state, composed of 17  autonomous communities and two autonomous cities with varying degrees of autonomy’  (European Union, n.d.n).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Spain is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  JOINT EVENTS  TO FOSTER  COOPERATION  Participation in  yearly ENISA and  EC3 workshops  inspired SI-CERT to  organise more joint  workshops with  Slovenian LE to  enhance their  cooperation.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  71  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Spanish legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  The NCSS published in 2019 follows the 2017 NCSS and 2013 NCSS (CCN-CERT, 2019). It  sets out a number of measures to ‘reinforce capabilities or investigation and prosecution of  cybercrime, to guarantee citizens security and protect rights and freedoms in cyberspace’ (Line  of actions 3) (CCN-CERT, 2019).  The NIS Directive has been implemented in 2018 by the Royal Decree 12/2018 (Spanish  Official Journal, 2018).  Spain ratified the Budapest Convention in 2010.  2.15.1. Roles and duties  In Spain, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related to  preventing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  National Cryptology Center Centro Criptologico Nacional  - CSIRT of the National Cryptology  Center  Capacidad de Respuesta a Incidentes de  Seguridad de la Información del Centro  Criptológico Nacional  CCN-CERT  National Cybersecurity Insitute Instituto Nacional de Ciberseguridad INCIBE  - National Cybersecurity Insitute- CERT Instituto Nacional de Ciberseguridad-CERT INCIBE-CERT  Office for Cyber Coordination Oficina de Coordinación Cibernética OCC  National Police Policia Nacional  - Technological Investigation Unit  Unidad de Investigación Tecnológica  UIT  o Central Brigade for  Technological Research Brigada Central de Investigación Tecnológica BCIT  Guardia Civil Guardia Civil  - Group of Telematic Crime - Central  Operational Unit  Grupo de Delitos Telemáticos - Unidad Central  Operativa  GDT  General Prosecutor’s Office Fiscal General del Estado  2.15.1.1. National cybersecurity agency  Set up in 2002, the National Cryptology Centre (CCN) belongs to the National Intelligence  Centre (CNI). Its role is to guarantee ICT security in public administration entities and security  for systems which process, store or send out classified information (CCN, n.d.) (Council of the  European Union, 2016). The CCN operates the CCN-CERT, the Spanish governmental CSIRT  (CCN, n.d.).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  72  If a cybercrime is detected during an intelligence investigation, the CNI contacts the Spanish  LEAs to take actions. For cases falling under the scope of the NIS Directive, the Spanish Royal  Decree 43/2021 (Spanish Official Journal, 2021a), which specifies how the CSIRTs, competent  authorities and LEA should act in case of a major cyber incident, establishes that the CNI has to  implement a common national platform for incident notifications: when a victim reports such a  cyber incident to a CSIRT, it is reported on this national platform, accessible by the competent  authorities and LEAs, where the latter can share information on the incident. The CNI does not  usually communicate with the Judiciary. The LE acts as an intermediary.  Moreover, the CNI provides resources and training to the Spanish public sector on cybercrime  related matters.  The Spanish National Cybersecurity Institute (INCIBE) was established in 2014. It provides  cybersecurity services to businesses and professionals, and to the general public. Its role is also  to raise awareness on risks and to promote mechanisms for the prevention of and reaction to  cybersecurity incidents (INCIBE, n.d.) (Council of the European Union, 2016).  2.15.1.2. CSIRTs  In Spain the CCN-CERT is the governmental CSIRT, while INCIBE-CERT the national one.  The CCN-CERT belongs to the CCN. It was established in 2006. Its role is to handle cyber  incidents affecting its constituency (classified systems and systems belonging to public  administrations, companies and organisations of strategic interest).  When a incident related to cybercrime arises, CCN-CERT recommends to the victim(s) to report  the crime to the LE and provides technical supports. It also disseminates to its constituency,  including LEAs, new indicators of compromise (IOCs) obtained during the course of the  investigation. If required by a judge, CCN-CERT can provide technical reports to the Police  and/or support further technical investigations, especially in digital forensics (e.g. of mobile  devices).  In cases of a major cyber incidents, the CCN-CERT acts as a national coordinator of the  regional CSIRTs23. As regional CSIRTs are closer to victims, the CCN-CERT can decide to let  them handle the incident, except in cases of cyberespionage, where only the CCN-CERT can  be in charge and interact with victims.  CCN-CERT regularly and directly interacts with the National Police and Guardia Civil  cybercrime units. One of the experts interviewed explained that CCN-CERT has Intrusion  Detection Sensors (IDS) deployed in about 300 public organisations in Spain (central  government, regional governments, etc.).  Private entities, including OES and digital services operators, belong to INCIBE-CERT’s  constituency.  INCIBE-CERT can give technical support to Law enforcement and the Judiciary, but always in  coordination with the Office of Cyber Coordination (OCC). The OCC can request any relevant  information on the incidents from the CSIRTs. Criteria are established to determine which  incidents must be communicated to the OCC depending on their impact (high/very high/critical).  INCIBE-CERT can be requested by the National Police and the Guardia Civil (which have  cybercrime units) to provide technical support, the OCC must be informed of such requests.  23 There are several regional CSIRTs in Spain, such as AndaluciaCERT, Catalonia-CERT, and CSIRT.gal.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  73  One of the experts interviewed mentioned that digital ‘forensics tasks are usually run by private  companies. […] However, LE can ask INCIBE-CERT for its opinion on the forensics reports’.  INCIBE-CERT can be asked also by the Judiciary to provide technical reports, however this is  rare. As emerged from the interviewed, it has happened that INCIBE was called upon to testify  in court, but in general only written reports are communicated to the judges.  2.15.1.3. LE  The National Police and the Guardia Civil have their own cybercrime units. Some regional and  local police forces also have cybercrime units (Council of Europe, n.d.e). It is the role of LE to  communicate incidents to the Prosecutor’s Office.  The Spanish national Police has a Technological Investigation Unit (UIT). The UIT was  created in 2012 within the General Directorate of the Police. It is responsible for investigating  and prosecuting cybercrime at national level and acts as the ‘E-Crime Prevention and  Response Center’ of the Police (Policia, n.d.). The UIT is made up of two brigades:  • The Central Brigade for Technological Research (BCIT);  • The Central Cybersecurity Brigade.  The BCIT is in charge of investigating all forms of crime related to computer activities  (cyberattacks, threats or insults on the Internet, child sexual abuse, and frauds).  The Group of Telematic Crime (GDT) of the Central Operational Unit of the Guardia Civil was  created in 1996 to investigate crimes committed on the Internet. Its competence now covers  cybercrime, defined as criminal behaviours carried out through and against information systems.  Technological Research Teams (Equipos de Investigación Tecnológica - EDITE) were created  in each Spanish province to support the GDT's work.  Within CNPIC (National Critical Infrastructure Protection and Cybersecurity Centre), the Office  for Cyber Coordination (OCC) was first created as the Cybernetic Coordination Unit about ten  years ago, and renamed into OCC in 2020. On the one hand, OCC is responsible for the  technical coordination with the n/g CSIRTs (INCIBE-CERT and CCN-CERT), on the other hand,  it acts as the point of contact (PoC) with the Law enforcement cybercrime units of Spanish LEAs  (Council of Europe, n.d.e).  Regional police forces interact with the OCC through the Intelligence Center for Counter- Terrorism and Organised Crime (CITCO) of the Spanish Ministry of the Interior. Furthermore, in  March 2021 the Home Office approved the Strategic Plan Against Cybercrime, which reflects  different cooperation tools between national LEAs and regional police forces coordinated by  OCC (Ministry of Home Affairs, 2021).  Finally, Spain is part of Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol, n.d.c).  2.15.1.4. Judiciary  The General Prosecutor’s Office has a cybercrime unit and a network of specialised  prosecutors. The General Prosecutor’s Office delimited what is to be understood as cybercrime  in its Instruction 2/2011 of 11 October 2011 ‘Concerning Specialised High Prosecutors on  Computer-related Crimes and the Sections for computer-related crimes of the Prosecutor’s  offices’ (General Prosecutor's Office, 2011).  The cybercrime unit is coordinated by a prosecutor supported by two deputy prosecutors. In  each region, a Provincial Prosecutor´s Office is responsible for the respective provincial unit.  Every specialised unit has the number of prosecutors considered necessary depending on the  volume of relevant cases.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  74  Spain cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.15.2. Synergies and potential interferences  Existing synergies are mostly bilateral: between CSIRT and LE, and between LE and the  Judiciary. CSIRTs do not usually interact with the Judiciary. The cooperation was assessed by  the interviewees as good, overall.  As part of the implementation of the NIS Directive, the OCC has been designated as the  National Competent Authority for the OES for the private sector (European Commission, n.d.c)  (Spanish Official Journal, 2021a) (Spanish Official Journal, 2018a). In addition, as part of the  implementation of the 2013 Directive on Attacks against Information Systems, OCC has been  designated as the operational national PoC. Therefore, the OCC receives all incident reports  from OES. Its staff analyses the information received and sends it to the relevant LE units. The  OCC also does cyber intelligence.  According to the Royal decree 43/2021 (Spanish Official Journal, 2021a), the reference CSIRTs  (CCN-CERT and INCIBE-CERT) must report incidents presenting characteristics of a crime to  the OCC. Criteria are established to determine which incidents must be communicated to the  OCC depending on their impact (high/very high/critical impact). CCN and INCIBE share ticketing  tools (one each, although a common tool is planned to be implemented within two years) to  report incidents. The OCC analyses all information received from the CSIRTs and completes a  report, and updates it with any new elements received. It can request any relevant information  on the incidents from the CSIRTs. The OCC coordinates with LE and shares the report with  them via encrypted email.  CSIRTs provide technical expertise to LE, whereas LE and the Judiciary are in charge of  investigating and prosecuting crimes. As highlighted during the interviews, cooperation has  proven to be necessary in several situations requiring quick action, such as taking down  domains, sending request to preserve evidence in other countries, and seizing servers. One  example of synergy was the successful cooperation between LE and the CCN-CERT during the  incident at the Spanish National Employment Office in March 2021.  One interviewee explained that in 2020, a new working group on cybersecurity was established  at the national level as a technical group dedicated to the implementation of cybersecurity  measures, in which the Judiciary, at both regional and national levels, is involved.  Although no major interferences were experienced by the interviewees, some challenges due to  a difference of interests between the communities were identified. For example, when an  incident occurs, LE needs to preserve the system(s) impacted to conduct investigations,  whereas the CSIRT wants to act quickly to solve the incident, which it cannot do while the  Police is working. In such cases, LE and the CSIRT usually agree that LE make a copy of the  server to preserve evidence. This allows the CSIRT to start solving the incident with less delay.  Challenges related to the lack of technical skills in LE units and the lack of knowledge of legal  procedures in the CSIRTs were also highlighted during the interviews. According to one of the  experts interviewed, more training opportunities for the CSIRTs to have better knowledge of the  legal procedures related to the fight against cybercrime would be useful. On the other hand,  training of judiciary representatives would also be useful to improve their understanding of the  CSIRTs’ scope of work. To address these challenges, INCIBE’s legal department reviews the  requests received from judges before sending them to the technical department, so they are  better understood, and the other way around.  The following recommendations were formulated during one interview to address potential  challenges in the cooperation between the three communities:  • To broaden the legal scope allowing the three communities to exchange information;  • To set up common formal procedures to exchange information and send requests;  EXISTING  SYNERGIES  The existing  synergies, ensuring  good cooperation,  could benefit from  more joint trainings  and better  knowledge of each  other tasks.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  75  • To set up more IT and cybersecurity training for LE/Judiciary;  • To improve the LE/Judiciary’s knowledge of the CSIRTs’ functions and tasks.  2.15.3. Examples of training  One of the experts interviewed highlighted that the OCC recently received a budget for technical  training: in September 2021, it will organise a technical training for OCC and LE units, which will  focus on certified ethical hackers and OSINT techniques.  Furthermore, the OCC and INCIBE have an agreement for the CyberEx exercise (INCIBE,  2021), conducted with OES’ technical team. CyberEx focuses on cyber incident handling.  As the governmental CSIRT, CCN-CERT is responsible for training civil servants and  cybersecurity experts in Spain. Every year, it organises about twenty courses on technical  issues (e.g. IDS, digital forensics courses, and collection of e-evidence). LE representatives  participate in these courses. CCN-CERT also provides specific courses to the National Police  and the Guardia Civil in the Police Academy and Guardia Civil Academy. Although CCN-CERT  provides training to LE, it does not participate in joint trainings with them.  CCN-CERT also has a very large portfolio of cybersecurity tools, norms and publications  available for the public sector, including LE and the Judiciary.  Finally, CCN-CERT organises workshops on cybersecurity related matters within the group  CSIRT.es, which gathers CERTs from private and public sector, as well as LEAs.  INCIBE-CERT provides technical training to LE and the Judiciary:  • The Cybersecurity Summer BootCamp (INCIBE, n.d.a), organised annually since 2016  by INCIBE and the Organization of American States (OAS). It provides both strategic  and practical trainings. The Cybersecurity Summer bootcamp goes from basic to  medium level. It gives LE and the Judiciary (prosecutors and judges) knowledge and  reference on topics like malware analysis, and OSINT. CCN-CERT representatives  and private companies’ representatives are usually invited as speakers. The  Cybersecurity Summer bootcamp is assessed as very useful for the Judiciary to  enhance their technical knowledge. As LE have a better understanding of the technical  aspects, they come to the Cybersecurity Summer bootcamp to enhance specific skills,  such as malware analysis;  • A \"Basic Cybersecurity for Security Forces and Bodies\" MOOC, designed for LE: it is a  basic course presenting the tasks of the police forces in fighting cybercrime:  prevention, awareness and protection of citizens against cybercrime (INCIBE, n.d.c).  According to one of the interviewees, about 1,780 participants already attended this  MOOC;  • An \"Advanced Cybersecurity for Security Forces and Bodies\" MOOC, designed for LE:  an advanced course which covers advanced and specific topics such as malware,  open source intelligence and the deep web (INCIBE, n.d.c). According to one of the  interviewees, about 1,820 students were enrolled.  In addition, the Spanish Police Studies Institute (Instituto de estudios de la Policía) has  developed a Master’s in cybercrime, aimed at chief inspectors, inspectors or sergeants who are  the heads of groups or units tackling cybercrime. The first edition was initiated in October 2016.  Finally, the Spanish National Police School (Escuela Nacional de Policía) and ECTEG created  the C1b3rWall Academy in 2018, which led to the Congress on Digital Security and  Cyberintelligence, organised in 2019 at the headquarters of the National Police School  (ECTEG, 2020). The C1b3rWall Academy currently offers online training dedicated to LEAs on  topics such as cryptography, security and infrastructures, digital forensic analysis, legal hacking,  blue team, red team, and cryptocurrencies (ECTEG, 2020).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  76  2.16. SWEDEN  Sweden is ‘a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy with a head of government  – the prime minister – and a head of state – the monarch. Sweden is a unitary state, divided into  20 counties and 290 municipalities’ (European Union, n.d.t).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Sweden is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Swedish legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Sweden adopted its NCSS in 2017, followed by a comprehensive cyber security action plan for  the period 2019–2022 (ENISA, n.d.l) (Swedish Government, n.d.) (Comprehensive cyber  security action plan 2019–2022, 2019).  Sweden ratified the Budapest Convention in 2021.  2.16.1. Roles and duties  In Sweden the following authorities and departments, in particular (24), are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.

National cyber security agency  The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (Myndigheten för samhällsskydd och beredskaps –  MSB) is the responsible authority for network and information security in Sweden (MSB, n.d.).  The cybersecurity action plan of Sweden contains measures that the MSB will undertake, along  with the authorities mentioned above in Section 2.16.1.  (24)The authorities and departments presented here are the main authorities/departments responsible for preventing,  analysing and fighting cybercrime. Other authorities/departments not presented here might play a role on an ad hoc basis.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  77  The National Centre for Security in Control Systems for Critical Infrastructure is in charge of  raising awareness and disseminating knowledge and experience of cybersecurity. Established  in 2008, it works in collaboration with the MSB.  2.16.1.2. CSIRTs  CERT-SE is the officially recognised national and governmental CSIRT (CERT-SE, 2015). The  MSB is the authority that operates the national CSIRT.  CERT-SE also collaborates with the military CERT of Sweden, Försvarsmakten FM-CERT (FM- CERT, n.d.) (Council of the European Union, 2017b).  PM-CERT, the Swedish Police CERT is responsible for protecting the Police's IT infrastructure  and network.  SUNet-CERT is the Swedish University Network CERT. It supports academic and educational  institutions as well as other organisations connected to the SUNET network (SUNet-CERT,  n.d.).  2.16.1.3. LE  The Swedish Police Authority (Polismyndigheten) (Polisen, n.d.) falls under the Ministry of  Justice. The LEAs listed below undertake cybercrime investigation tasks, among other types of  criminal investigations, and are overseen by the Swedish Police Authority:  • the Swedish Cybercrime Centre (SC3);  • the National Fraud Centre;  • the National Forensic Centre (Nationellt forensiskt centrum – NFC);  • the National Operations Department (Nationella operativa avdelningen – NOA), which  includes a Cybercrime unit.  The SC3 was established ‘to investigate all forms of cybercrime. [SC3] is responsible for  detecting, preventing and averting serious cybercrime’. The SC3 shares information on threats,  as well as technical methods to combat cybercrime, with partner agencies (Council of the  European Union, 2017b); see also (Polisen, n.d. a).  The main tasks of the NFC are to conduct forensic investigations and analyses for the judicial  authorities (NFC). The National Fraud Centre has a coordinating and supportive role. The  centre supports investigators regionally and locally and shares best practices. It collaborates  with the NFC and the SC3 (Council of the European Union, 2017b) (Polisen, n.d. a).  The NOA has a leading role in operational activities. The International Affairs Division within the  NOA acts as the National Unit of Europol and is the national point of contact for international  police cooperation (Polisen, n.d. a).  Finally, Sweden is part of the Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol,  n.d.c).  2.16.1.4. Judiciary  The Swedish Prosecution Authority (Åklagarmyndigheten) and the Swedish Economic  Crime Authority (Ekobrottsmyndigheten) are the national authorities that carry out public  prosecution tasks (Council of the European Union, 2017b) (Åklagarmyndigheten, n.d.)  (Ekobrottsmyndigheten, n.d.).  The Swedish Prosecution Authority comprises the following offices:  • the National Anti-Corruption Unit, which deals with corruption;  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  78  • the National Unit for Environment and Working Environment Cases, which deals with  the environmental crimes;  • the National Security Unit, which deals with security-related cases;  • the National Unit against Organised Crime, which deals with organised cross-border  crime.  Cybercrime and criminal investigations fall under the responsibility of the general prosecution  service. In addition, the Swedish Prosecution Authority has developed a network of prosecutors  who deal with cybercrime in the different regions of the country (Council of the European Union,  2017b).  The Swedish judicial system has ‘two parallel types of courts: Ordinary courts, which deal with  criminal and civil cases, and general administrative courts, which deal with cases relating to  public administration’ (European Union, n.d.l.).  ‘Cybercrime acts are dealt with by the general courts […] in the same manner as other criminal  acts’ (Council of the European Union, 2017b). The Swedish National Courts Administration  (Domstolsverket) (Swedish National Courts Administration, n.d.) is the coordinating organisation  for the Swedish courts.  Sweden also cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.16.2. Synergies and potential interferences  ‘The SC3 and the Civil Contingencies Agency are developing cooperation mechanisms at  operational as well as at strategic level’ (Council of the European Union, 2017b).  Cooperation mechanisms have also been established between LE and the CERT-SE. In  addition, collaboration between the private sector and financial institutions and LE has been  established, mainly based on information sharing.  As indicated in the interviews, there is a frequent exchange of information between the CSIRT  and LE communities as part of monthly meetings established to support their cooperation. In  addition, there is ‘spontaneous communication on a daily basis’ under the principle that ‘it is  better to share than not to share’. The cooperation mechanisms established between the two  communities have allowed them to complement each other when performing different tasks.  This is particularly the case in interactions with the victims of an incident/cybercrime. ‘In some  cases the LE provide CSIRTs with information’ so that they can notify ‘their community and […]  the victims. Examples are cases of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks and  ransomware’. The CSIRT community ‘has a responsibility to advise the victims of an  incident/cybercrime but cannot report the incident on behalf of the victim. CSIRTs do not have a  mandate that would allow them to reach out to the victims to obtain information. [On their side,  however,] LE are able to contact the victim and ensure their cooperation during an investigation  process.’ It was also stressed that the CSIRT community relies on the trust relationships  established with other CSIRT teams and organisations to ensure a flow of information and  smooth collaboration. On the other hand, ‘the LE community has a strong legal framework that  allows them to enforce their role and access information’.  As emerged from the interviews, ‘The national CSIRT [also] provides their technical expertise’ in  cases where they are ‘called as expert witnesses in court proceedings. An example was a fraud  case where CSIRT provided technical support in analysing evidence.’  Based on the feedback provided by the interviewees, ‘interferences have been noted due to the  different tasks that the CSIRT and LE community have. But through mutual efforts [and trust],  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  79  they have developed an understanding and have managed to benefit from each other’s skills.’  For instance, CSIRTs have been able to ‘support LE in evidence preservation if requested’.  Concerning the interaction between LE and the Judiciary, LEAs share with prosecutors  information connected to investigations. LEAs ‘share information with the judges only for court  proceedings. Intervention by a judge during an investigation is rare (mainly limited to cases  where decision needs to be made about restricting fundamental freedoms).’  2.16.3. Examples of training  The Swedish National Police Academy (Polishögskolan) provides training for police officers  (Polishögskolan, n.d.). The academy organises basic training for police officers in collaboration  with higher education institutes such as Växjö University and Umeå University. It also  coordinates participation in international courses such as those organised by CEPOL and the  Association of European Police Colleges (AEPC) (OSCE, n.d.).  The SC3 also organises training for LE and coordinates the exchange of expertise through its  website. It also participates in the ‘first responders e-learning’ package on IT forensics and IT  crime knowledge, in cooperation with ECTEG and supported by Europol, CEPOL, the United  Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Council of Europe (ECTEG, n.d.)  (Polisen, n.d. a).  The SC3 organises some training also for the prosecutors.  The Training Centre of the Swedish Prosecution Authority provides a specialised course on  cybercrime ‘in the mandatory initial training and in the further training for prosecutors’. In  addition, training in different areas is provided, such as on international legal assistance and on  the legal systems of other countries. The Prosecution Authority also shares through its website  a platform for prosecutors to exchange information and knowledge (Council of the European  Union, 2017b).  The Swedish Judicial Training Academy organises training programmes for the Judiciary.  Although specialised training on cybercrime is not offered, ‘the Academy organises annual  criminal law seminars on relevant topics’ (Council of the European Union, 2017b) (The Swedish  Judicial Training Academy , n.d.).  2.17. FINAL REMARKS  2.17.1. Overview of skills and competences  The technical complexity and the cross-border nature of cybercrime has challenged the  competences (including skills, knowledge, attributes and behaviours (IAEA, n.d.) (UN, n.d.)  (OECD, 2014) of CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary, driving the three communities to refine their  expertise and establish cooperation mechanisms. Interviews with country experts affirmed that  interferences can occur during incident handling and cybercrime investigations, but that the  communities make efforts to avoid such interferences, create effective partnerships and take  advantage of their synergies.  The CSIRT community holds the technical expertise that is required to detect and mitigate  cybersecurity incidents and restore cyber-secure environments. The LE and judiciary experts  interviewed highlighted that the technical competences of the CSIRT community are also  particularly valuable when it comes to assisting with evidence collection, preservation and  presentation before a court of law. In addition, several interviewees confirmed that the  information flow between CSIRTs and LE has been fundamental in ensuring operational and  strategic awareness of cyberthreats.  A CULTURE OF  SYNERGY  Established  cooperation and  spontaneous  communication  under the principle  that ‘it is better to  share than not to  share’.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  80  Although each Member State has its own specific operational and legal framework for shaping  the response to cybercrime, it emerged from the interviews that the LE community has an  institutional role and carries out the following tasks: determining whether a cybersecurity  incident has a criminal nature, conducting the investigation of cybercrime cases and reaching  out to the victims of such cases to advise them and ensure their collaboration. To perform these  tasks, the LE community applies its knowledge and expertise in digital forensics and criminal  investigations. Provided they have a legal mandate and the technical expertise, LEAs can  aggregate pertinent information on cybercrime cases using their own evidence collection  methods, directly from victims, but also through their LE counterparts in other countries and the  CSIRT community. In the evidence collection framework, the LE community bears the  responsibility for preserving the chain of custody and following the necessary procedures to  bring criminals to justice.  The LE investigative activities are closely monitored by the Judiciary and, in particular, by public  prosecution authorities. Depending on the judicial system of each Member State, a prosecutor  or an investigative judge is responsible for leading the cybercrime investigation process and has  the authority to issue warrants and instructions to support evidence collection activities. The  judiciary community (prosecutors or judges) assesses the admissibility of the evidence  collected, examines the witnesses and pronounces the verdict, determining the criminal and civil  liability of cybercrime perpetrators. In addition to their legal competences, given the technical  nature of cybercrime, the Judiciary needs to understand the technical matters to the extent  required to be able to judge whether a suspect has committed a crime and the relevant  circumstances to determine the sentence and they may require the support of the CSIRT  community, who provides technical reports and whose delegates may be invited as expert  witnesses before the courts.  The interviewees provided examples of training activities involving more than one community,  sometimes in the form of workshops or joint exercises. These joint training initiatives help  enhance the competences required to respond to cybercrime. As one of the interviewees  mentioned, joint trainings help the three communities to ‘harmonise terms, language and  understanding […] of cyber and cybercrime’. The three communities can then reach a ‘better  understanding [of] the role and how the other communities work’, they become more aware of  the skills and strengths of the other communities and can enhance their competences by  learning from each other. This also ‘helps them better understand their own role in the broader  picture’. For instance, the CSIRT community can learn more about investigative techniques and  ‘data acquisition, so that the data acquired by […CSIRTs] could more easily serve as evidence  in criminal and other types of proceedings’, and can acquire legal knowledge, for example ‘how  to identify if an incident is a crime, and what role LE has on that’. The LE community can obtain  a better insight into the different ways that the CSIRT community shares information, as well as  the tools used, and further knowledge on analysing data logs and performing incident analysis  in specific areas. The judiciary community can benefit by gaining more awareness of  cyberthreats and developing, in general, a better understanding of the technical aspects of  cybercrime. This is especially important as the interviews showed that each community tends to  lack a precise understanding of the others’ tasks. In fact, in most countries, interviewees of the  different communities provided different answers in some entries of the SoD matrix.  Moreover, because of the cross-border nature of cybercrime, all three communities need to  know about the different EU and international legal frameworks (notably the Convention on  Cybercrime (Council of Europe, 2003)). They also need to be familiar with existing architecture  including:  • The Blueprint for a Coordinated Response to Large Scale Cybersecurity Incidents and  Crises (‘the Blueprint’) (European Commission, 2017), the CSIRTs network and the  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  81  European Cyber Crises Liaison Organisation (‘EU CyCLONe’) network (25)), as well as  the European Cybercrime Centre (‘EC3’) and the Joint Cybercrime Taskforce (‘J- CAT’) at the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (‘Europol’),  the EU Law Enforcement Emergency Response Protocol (‘EU LE ERP’) and the 24/7  Points of Contact Network under the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (26)  (European Commission, 2021, p. Recital (5));  • The NIS Cooperation Group, the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre (‘EU INTCEN’),  the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox (Council of the European Union, 2017h) and cyber  defence-related projects launched under the Permanent Structured Cooperation  (PESCO) (27) (European Commission, 2021, p. Recital (5));  • ENISA that, as foreseen in the Cybersecurity Act (Article 7 par. 1), supports  ‘operational cooperation among Member States, Union institutions, bodies, offices and  agencies, and between stakeholders’ (European Parliament and Council of the  European Union, 2019) (European Commission, 2021, p. Recital (5));  • Integrated Political Crisis Response (‘IPCR’) arrangements via which the EU is able to  ‘coordinate its political response to major crises’ (European Commission, 2021, p.  Recital (5)).  Finally, the communities need to develop their competences and build organisational and  intercultural skills to liaise effectively with their counterparts from other EU/EEA Member States.  2.17.2. Differences of interests between the communities  Although the majority of interviewees experienced no major interferences in the cooperation  between the three communities, one of the main challenges identified was the difference of  interests between the communities, due to their distinct roles and duties.  For example, at the beginning of an investigation, the priority for both LE and the Judiciary is to  gather as much evidence as possible while keeping the case from the public, and to catch the  perpetrator(s), while the CSIRT’s work is to immediately stop the incident and mitigate damage.  CSIRTs often want to quickly inform their constituency and to announce that the incident or  attack has been stopped.  Furthermore, restoring a system after a cyberattack sometimes means losing precious  evidence, which means that LE must make a copy of the said system prior to the CSIRT’s  intervention. This can take up to a few days as it must be done following legal procedures, and  thus impacting the CSIRT’s response, which does not follow the same timescale as that of the  legal process. However, as underlined by one of the experts interviewed, ‘this is all about  maintaining the balance between handling the incident and investigating it by helping each other  and without interfering with each other’s work’.  Some organisational issues were also highlighted, especially the lack of resources allocated to  the fight against cybercrime, often resulting in a lack of capacity to efficiently deal with every  (25) The ‘EU CyCLONe aims at enabling rapid cyber crisis management coordination in case of a large-scale cross-border  cyber incident or crisis in the EU by providing timely information sharing and situational awareness amongst competent  authorities and is supported by ENISA, which provides the secretariat and tools. EU CyCLONe operates at the “operational  level', which is the intermediate in between technical and strategic/political levels.  The goals of EU CyCLONe are to:  • establish a network to enabling the cooperation of the appointed national agencies and authorities in charge of  cyber crisis management;  • provide the missing link between the EU CSIRTs Network (technical level) and the EU political level.  Due to its importance in the EU cybersecurity landscape, the European Commission proposal for the revised NIS Directive  envisions in Article 14 the formal establishment of the European Cyber Crises Liaison Organisation Network (EU –  CyCLONe)’ (ENISA, 2021m).  (26) A recent study of the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY) highlighted the benefits and  successful examples of international cooperation that stem from the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (Council  of Europe, 2020b).  (27) As stated in the Footnote 7 of the Commission Reccomandation (EU) 2021/1086 on building a Joint Cyber Unit  (European Commission, 2021), ‘In particular, the PESCO projects on ‘cyber rapid response teams and mutual assistance in  cyber security’ coordinated by Lithuania and on ‘cyber and information domain coordination centre’ coordinated by  Germany’.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  82  reported incident (CSIRTs and LE) and sometimes leading to an important lack of knowledge of  cybercrime related matters (Judiciary).  2.17.3. Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cooperation  It is indisputable that ‘The outbreak of COVID-19 has brought an immense change in the way  we conduct our lives. In this increasingly connected world, we can, fortunately, continue our  professional and private lives virtually’ (ENISA, n.d.b). Luckily, cooperation among the CSIRT,  LE, and judiciary communities has also continued during the pandemic crisis, and this is more  crucial than ever because ‘The COVID-19 pandemic renders individuals and society extremely  vulnerable in all respects’ (Council of Europe, 2020a) and ‘Criminals have quickly adapted their  techniques to exploit [the situation and] our fears around the COVID-19 pandemic’ (Europol,  2020).  It emerged in quite an unequivocal manner from the data collected in the interviews that, in all  sixteen countries analysed in this study, overall, the COVID‑19 pandemic has not hindered  cooperation between the CSIRT, LE and judiciary communities; instead, it has generally  become even closer and more frequent as online meetings tend to be less time-consuming than  in-person meetings.  Most of the interviewees highlighted that meetings in person occurred less frequently, although  in some countries ‘Face-to-face meetings continued to take place to discuss sensitive matters’.  Some meetings were postponed and some ‘joint training plans [were] disrupted’; however, more  meetings took place using video/teleconferencing, several events were moved online and  electronic communication, as well as the automatic exchange of information, overall seemed to  have increased: ‘There is more information sharing. The big change is that we moved physical  meetings to virtual ones.’ One of the interviewees stated that ‘Operations [were] still ongoing  despite the pandemic, to avoid interrupting investigations in most of the cases’. Some meetings  and court hearings were suspended and this represented a challenge, although it was  mentioned during an interview that in one of the countries analysed online courts were arranged  and this new practice allowed to drastically diminish the backlog.  In general, ‘the pandemic crisis did not negatively impact the effectiveness of the cooperation’  between the CSIRT, LE and judiciary communities. Most of the interviewees noted that at the  peak of the crisis, the COVID-19 restrictions ‘did not change the communication but rather made  it more present and more frequent – almost a daily interaction and exchange of information was  established. During this period [indeed], joint work and joint approaches were established  covering a broader scope of activities, including joint statements. In other words, COVID made  the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE take place not only on criminal investigations and  incidents but also on raising awareness.’ According to the interviewees, ‘The crisis [actually]  helped the institutions to enhance their distance working capacities, e.g. to organise meetings  through secure videoconference platforms’, and during the pandemic crisis ‘there was more  close cooperation on updates that needed to be provided to the Government’. One of the  interviewees defined the pandemic period as ‘a productive work period in terms of  communication since the exchanges were multiplied between the entities, especially CSIRTs  and LE. Cooperation with other communities was facilitated at the end. They had to adapt to the  electronic means and work more hours but they adapted well in the new situation.’  Interviewees however unanimously underlined that in-person meetings provide more  opportunities to network and develop trust. Concerns were expressed by the interviewees  regarding establishing trust with new members of the communities in a merely virtual  environment. The fact that such meetings cannot take place due to COVID-19 restrictions might  in the long run impact the cooperation among the communities as people get to know each  other less than if they regularly met in person.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  83  3. CONCLUSIONS AND WAYS  FORWARD  3.1.  CONCLUSIONS  This report is an updated and expanded version of the 2020 Report on CSIRT-LE Cooperation:  A Study of Roles and Synergies among Selected EU Member States/EFTA Countries published  in January 2021 (ENISA, 2021a).  Data for this report has been collected via desk research, interviews and compilation of a  Segregation of Duties (SoD) matrix. This report addresses the cooperation between CSIRTs  and LE and their interaction with the Judiciary, by discussing their roles, synergies and  interferences, competences and training initiatives.  The analysis in this report focused on Belgium, Czechia, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,  Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.  Using the analysis of the data collected, the conclusions summarised below were drawn.  • All countries analysed have signed the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on  Cybercrime and almost all of them have ratified it and the Additional Protocol on the  criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer  systems. A Second Additional Protocol to the Cybercrime Convention, on enhanced  co-operation and disclosure of electronic evidence adopted by the Committee of  Ministers of the Council of Europe in November 2021 ‘should be opened for signature  in May 2022’ (Council of Europe, n.d.f). Each country, however, has specific legislation  on cybercrime, which is mandated through many different national laws and different  criminal procedural law that governs investigations and the prosecution of  (cyber)crime.  • All countries analysed have a NCSS, which sets up the general framework for the  coordination and cooperation of all authorities and defines their roles and  responsibilities.  • In terms of incident response, in line with the NIS Directive, all countries analysed have  established national CSIRTs. However, although there are similarities, the way they  are organised and the position they have in the national institutional framework vary  from country to country.  • The way LEAs’ activities related to cybercrime are organised also varies from  country to country: some countries have specialised central cybercrime units, whereas  others have decentralised specialised units or both.  • The structure and organisation of the Judiciary also vary by country: in some  countries there are ‘specialised prosecutors or specialised structures within the  Prosecution Services dealing with cybercrime offences’, while in other countries ‘the  responsibility for dealing with such crimes usually lies “de facto” with specialised public  prosecutors and judges, who have been trained or have experience in the area of  cybercrime’ (Council of the European Union, 2017c).  • Among the three communities – CSIRTs, LE and Judiciary – different approaches and  different levels of cooperation exist. While operational cooperation, especially in  daily interactions and informal communication, seems to be well established,  sometimes it appears that more structured cooperation would be useful in order to  achieve a less fragmented information flow between the three communities. In  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  84  addition, there is a bigger gap in the interaction between CSIRTs and the Judiciary  than in the cooperation established between LE and the Judiciary and between LE and  CSIRTs.  • Normally LEAs are not solely involved in the detection and investigation of  cybercrimes. A key component of their role is the preventive aspects of cybercrime,  and it is here that cooperation with other communities, particularly the CSIRT  community, is very important to support preventive strategies. In particular, the  responsibility of cybercrime prevention is shared with CSIRTs since in most of the  cases they are the first of the three members detecting cyber incidents of criminal  nature within their constituents.  • CSIRTs and LEAs need to cooperate to decrease the risk of evidence being  compromised or destroyed.  • CSIRTs and LE may also cooperate during the analysis of evidence.  • CSIRTs play an important role in informing (potential) victims of cybercrime and in  providing them with information on how to report a crime to the Police and how to  enhance protection against future cybercrimes.  • CSIRTs may be called as witnesses in court, although this is not practised in all the  countries analysed. Moreover, when it happens, CSIRTs often provide written reports  and are rarely physically called to court.  • Several competences are required for incident handling and cybercrime investigation;  while each community has developed its own set of skills and knowledge, each could  benefit from the competences of the other communities.  • Some initiatives are in place to facilitate trainings within each community. Most of the  joint trainings involve two of the communities (e.g. CSIRTs and LE, or LE and the  Judiciary); however, there is a need for further initiatives and for trainings and  exercises that involve the three communities together.  • Secondment opportunities between the CSIRTs and the LE are rare. The reason  why varies depending on the country (e.g. lack of resources, organisational aspects,  and/or level of maturity of the CSIRTs).  • The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way CSIRTs, LE and the Judiciary  work together and interact. The greatest impact has been on training and workshop  events, as well as face-to-face meetings, which were cancelled in the early stages of  the pandemic and later delivered online. As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued,  the use of online tools to facilitate meetings and events has become in some instance  the norm and the communities adapted to the new way of working. Establishing trust  with new members of the communities in a merely virtual environment can be  challenging, but alternating virtual and physical meetings and/or organise hybrid  meetings (meetings with some participants in person and some participating remotely),  when possible, might help. Overall, there does not appear to have been a significant  impact of the pandemic on the ability of the three communities to cooperate. In some  instances, the level of vigilance and interaction among the communities has  actually increased, with even daily interaction taking place, to ensure that each  community is kept up to date.  COVID-19  The pandemic crisis  has changed the way  that CSIRTs, LE and  the judiciary work and  interact together. In  some instances, it has  actually meant  increased interactions  among the  communities.  Establishing trust with  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  85  3.2.  WAYS FORWARD  3.2.1. Possible extension of the analysis to additional countries  This report could be further expanded to cover all the remaining EEU/EEA Member States28.  With some adaptation of the methodology presented in the 2020 ENISA Report on CSIRT-LE  cooperation (ENISA, 2021a) the analysis could be extended also to additional countries other  than EU/EEA Member States.  3.2.2. Use the results to develop additional training material  In its continuous effort to provide training material for the CSIRT community, including on  cooperation with the LE community and other operational communities (ENISA, n.d.), ENISA  with the support of Europol’s EC3 has developed a handbook and a toolset which has been  published in January 2021 (ENISA, 2021). Such material has been piloted through two training  sessions (in August and October 2021) and further improved by ENISA in 2021 based on the  feedback received. In these pilot sessions representatives from Member States (from CSIRTs,  LE and Judiciary) and some European Union Institutions, Bodies and Agencies (EUIBAs)  discussed, also based on scenarios, topics related to the cooperation across the three  communities and learned more about these communities, including their needs and potential  synergies they could exploit.  Additional training material could be developed in the future based on the results of an analysis  extended to the remaining EU/EEA Member States29, and possibly also other countries, e.g.  Western Balkans 30.  3.2.3. Use the results to develop a catalogue of competences across  authorities in EU Member States and EFTA countries  A catalogue of the competences required during incident handling and cybercrime  investigations, with an indication of the authorities in each EU/EEA Member State that could  offer such competences, would help CSIRTs, LE and the Judiciary become more aware of the  skills and strengths of other communities in their country, and also across the EU and EEA  area. This would allow authorities to learn from each other’s initiatives and also facilitate the  provision of expertise where required for incident handling and/or criminal investigation. Such a  catalogue of competences could be developed using information collected using this  methodology (slightly adapting the questionnaire and the SoD matrix, if necessary, to further  focus on competences).  3.2.4. Use the results to develop decision support systems  The results of an extended analysis could help complete the picture and serve as a basis for the  development of decision support systems that a CSIRT, LE or Judiciary authorities could easily  consult to obtain information on which authorities play a role in the response to cyber incidents  of criminal nature These support systems can aid in decision-making and in taking actions in  cases where the evidence is located in several countries.  3.2.5. Develop common platforms to share information between LE and  CSIRT communities  Developing a common information sharing platform at national level could facilitate information  exchange between the three communities during the investigation of a cyber related criminal  28 The EU/EEA Member States not covered in this report are: Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Greece, Iceland,  Hungary, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Malta, Netherlands, and Slovakia.  29 See previous footnote.  30 For more information on Western Balkans, see for instance (European Commission, n.d. b)  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  86  offence. This could also help harmonise information sharing processes and as a consequence  limit the potential delays to the police investigation and the CSIRT intervention.  3.2.6. Organise joint training and exercises for the three communities  Wherever possible initiatives involving all three communities should take place at national and  cross-countries level. Examples of these initiatives are the two pilot training sessions organised  by ENISA in 2021 and described above.  Joint training would help the communities better understand each other’s capabilities, needs  and boundaries, to enable them to better respond in practice to cyber incidents of a criminal  nature by exploiting synergies and avoiding interferences.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  87  4.

This report is an extended and updated version of the 2020 Report on CSIRT-LE Cooperation:  A Study of Roles and Synergies among Selected EU Member States/EFTA Countries published  in January 2021 (ENISA, 2021a) and referred to as “2020 Report on CSIRT-LE cooperation”,  and follows a number of previous reports published by the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity including Tools and Methodologies to Support Cooperation between CSIRTs and  Law Enforcement (ENISA, 2017), Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law  Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects, Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law  Enforcement: Interaction with the Judiciary (ENISA, 2017a), An Overview on Enhancing  Technical Cooperation between CSIRTs and LE (ENISA, 2019a) and Roadmap of the  Cooperation between CSIRTs and LE (ENISA, 2019b).  This report addressed the legal and organisational framework, roles and duties of CSIRTs,  LEAs and the Judiciary, their required competences, as well as synergies and potential  interferences in their activities related to their responses to cyber incidents and fight against  cybercrime, respectively. This report presents a detailed and updated analysis focusing on  sixteen EU/EEA Member States namely Belgium, Czechia (2), Estonia, Finland, France,  Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, and  Sweden (3).  The data for this report were collected via desk research and interviews with subject-matter  experts using the methodology developed and presented in the 2020 ENISA Report on CSIRT- LE cooperation. The data collected showed, among other things, that:  • The communities make efforts to avoid interferences and attempt to create effective  partnerships and take advantage of their synergies to support each other in the fight  against cybercrime; however, some interferences might occur during incident handling  and cybercrime investigations.  • The main challenge experienced by the experts interviewed in cooperating with the  other communities seems to remain the difficulty to sometimes “speak the same  languages”, especially between the CSIRTs (technical) and Judiciary (legal)  communities.  • There are examples of joint training activities, mainly involving two communities (CSIRTs  and LEAs or LEAs and the Judiciary, especially prosecutors) and, more rarely, involving  all three communities, in particular in the form of joint exercises. Such activities help  enhance overall the knowledge and competences required to respond to cybercrime.  • While there has been no significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the  cooperation and interaction between the three communities and their ability to function,  in the long run the lack of networking opportunities fostered by face-to-face meetings  might have an impact on the relationship between the three communities, which is  mainly based on trust and personal contacts.  (2) Czechia has been the short-form name for the Czech Republic since 2016.  (3 ) While Czechia, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Romania and Sweden were already analysed in the  2020 ENISA Report on CSIRT-LE Cooperation (ENISA, 2021a), the current report presents an analysis also focused on the  additional Member States: Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Slovenia and Spain.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  8  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1.  BACKGROUND OF THE REPORT  This report follows up previous work in the area of computer security incident response teams  (CSIRTs) and Law enforcement (LE) cooperation. With the view of enhancing the response to  cyberattacks and supporting the fight against cybercrime, this report aims to continue to  facilitate cooperation between the CSIRT and the LE communities and the extensions that this  collaboration may have to other communities, especially the Judiciary.  This report is an extended and updated version of the 2020 Report on CSIRT-LE Cooperation:  A study of roles and synergies among selected EU Member States/EFTA countries (ENISA,  2021a) published in January 2021.The parts on countries already covered in the 2020 report  (Czechia, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Romania and Sweden) are  reproduced in this report, with some minor changes.  An overview and timeline of the previous work carried out by the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) in the area of CSIRT and LE cooperation is presented in the figure  below (4).  Figure 1: Overview and timeline of previous ENISA work on CSIRT–LE cooperation  This current report (as well as the 2020 report) and the ENISA training material on CSIRT-LE  cooperation (5) are a set of deliverables complementing each other as follows:  • The present report analyses roles, duties, competences, synergies and potential  interferences across the three communities (CSIRTs, LE and Judiciary) in sixteen  additional MSs.  (4) All reports and training materials are available on the ENISA website under publications  (www.enisa.europa.eu/publications) and training resources (www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity- specialists/online-training-material).  (5) The ENISA training material on CSIRT-LE cooperation is available on the ENISA website under:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material/legal-cooperation  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications http://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material http://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material/legal-cooperation  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  9  • The training material helps a trainer explain these concepts, e.g. through scenarios  and contains exercises for trainees based on these scenarios.  1.2.  REPORT OBJECTIVES  The main objective of this report is to present a detailed analysis of the roles and duties of  CSIRTs and LEAs and required competences, showing synergies and potential  interferences in their activities related to their responses to incidents of a criminal nature and  their fight against cybercrime. By facilitating the cooperation between the CSIRT and the LE  communities and the interaction with the Judiciary, this work has the final aim to contribute to  better respond to cybercrime, which, as reaffirmed at the Octopus Conference on Cybercrime  organised by the Council of Europe in November 2021, affects significantly the individuals and  ‘often represents a serious interference with the rights and lives of victims’ (Council of Europe,  n.d.g).  1.3.  REPORT SCOPE  The report focuses on the cooperation of national and governmental (n/g) CSIRTs (6) with LEAs,  although most of the analysis is largely applicable to CSIRTs in general (i.e. other than n/g  CSIRTs). Military CSIRTs are mentioned too but only if they play a specific role in CSIRT-LE  cooperation in case of cybercrime (e.g. if they act as national CSIRTs).  No specific sector is targeted in this report and the results are applicable to the different levels  of cooperation between the three communities in response to incidents of a criminal nature and  in the fight against cybercrime in all sectors (from finance to energy and from transport to  health).  Following the methodology presented in the 2020 Report on CSIRT-LE Cooperation: A study of  roles and synergies among selected EU Member States/EFTA countries (ENISA, 2021a)(7), an  analysis has been conducted and presented in Chapter 2 below.  The analysis presented in this current report covers sixteen EU/EEA countries. Eight countries  were already analysed and presented in the 2020 report: Czechia, France, Germany,  Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Romania and Sweden. The additional countries analysed in the  current report are Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Slovenia and Spain.  The general geographical scoping of the report is limited to sixteen EU/EFTA countries. This  selection of countries was based on the following criteria:  • geographical balance;  • balance of different political systems;  • balance of different legal systems;  • balance in terms of size (area and population) of the countries;  • balance in terms of maturity of the n/g CSIRTs;  • balance in terms of maturity of the CSIRT–LE cooperation.  This report does not seek to provide an exhaustive analysis; rather, it focuses on a small  number of topics affecting cooperation – in particular roles and duties, synergies and possible  overlaps and interferences, required competences – as might be of interest in cross-border  investigations.  (6) ‘National/government (n/g) CSIRTs’ refers to teams ‘that serve a country’s government by helping to protect its critical  information infrastructure. N/g CSIRTs play a key role in coordinating incident management with the relevant  stakeholders at national level. They also bear responsibility for cooperation with other countries’ national and  governmental teams (ENISA, n.d.d)]” (ENISA, 2019c, p. 9).  (7) See in particular its Chapter on “Proposed methodology”, p.16ff.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  10  In the future, this report is likely to be followed up with an extended version covering additional  countries.  1.4.  TARGET AUDIENCE  The intended target audience of this report is:  • CSIRTs, in particular n/g CSIRTs;  • LE (8);  • Judiciary (in this report this refers both to prosecutors (9) and to judges (10));  • Individuals and organisations with an interest in cybersecurity.  Policymakers and lawmakers may also benefit from particular aspects of the analysis presented  in this report as they prepare policies and legislation to enhance cooperation between  operational communities in responding to cyberattacks and fighting cybercrime, including  CSIRTs, LEAs and the Judiciary, in the Member States and in jurisdictions interested in  cooperating with the EU in their transition to and affirmation of the rule of law.  1.5. DATA COLLECTION METHODS  The methodology used to collect data for this report is fully outlined in Chapter 3 “Proposed  methodology” (p.16ff) of the 2020 Report on CSIRT-LE cooperation (ENISA, 2021a).  Qualitative research (11) was conducted for this report. A combination of research methods was  used to collect data for analysing CSIRT, LE and Judiciary cooperation, roles and duties,  required competences, synergies and potential interferences in the selected Member  State/EFTA countries, in particular:  • desk research;  • subject matter expert interviews;  • Segregation of Duties (SoD) matrix.  A summary of the desk research per country is included in Annex A of this report. A list of  courses and training programmes for LE, Judiciary and CSIRTs (not exhaustive and not  containing national training initiatives) is provided in Annex B of this report.  In addition to the desk research, the country profile analysis was based on interviews with  CSIRTs, LE and some Judiciary representatives, which included also the filling in of the SoD  matrix. Contributions from the interviewees are acknowledged in the report. However, the  following points should be noted:  • Some interviewees requested not to be named in the report. In order to ensure  consistency, the names of all the other interviewees have been omitted;  • Interviewees provided their contributions based on their knowledge and expertise and  were mainly not acting as representatives of their country;  • Concerning Italy, due to an important ongoing reform and the creation of a new  National Cybersecurity Agency, it was challenging to collect data via interviews with  the CSIRTs and with the LE, at this specific point in time. Therefore, the analysis for  (8) Similarly, to previous ENISA reports, law enforcement (LE), law enforcement agencies (LEAs), police and police  agencies are used synonymously; see, for instance, (ENISA, 2018).  (9) On the status and role of prosecutors, see (UNODC, 2014).  (10) On judges and principles to ensure their competence, independence and impartiality, see the European Charter on  the Statute for Judges (Council of Europe, 1998).  (11) Qualitative research is focused on explaining the reasons for people’s behaviour and understanding their opinions  and options while quantitative research aims to quantify attitudes, opinions or other defined variables to generalise  results from a population (Bryman & Bell, 2011). Interviewing is the most common format used for data collection in  qualitative research while the questionnaire is the research instrument that is used most widely for both quantitative  and qualitative approaches.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  11  Italy has been conducted based on one interview only and on the data collected via  desk research;  • Due to time constraint, few interviewees, provided data by filling the questionnaire in  writing, instead of via a video/phone interview. Few others preferred to fill the SoD  matrix and send it separately via email instead of filling it in during the interview.  The cut-off date for data collection was 3rd August 2021; however, some additional input  received between August and October 2021 was also integrated in this report.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  12  2. COUNTRY FOCUS  This chapter presents the analysis of the data collected by using the methodology outlined in  the 2020 Report on CSIRT-LE cooperation published in January 2021 (ENISA, 2021a).  The analysis addressed the following MSs/EEA countries:  • Belgium;  • Czechia;  • Estonia;  • Finland;  • France;  • Ireland;  • Italy;  • Germany;  • Luxembourg;  • Norway;  • Poland;  • Portugal;  • Romania;  • Slovenia;  • Spain;  • Sweden.  For each country, an analysis of the roles and duties of CSIRTs, LE and the Judiciary is  provided, first. It follows a description of synergies and potential interferences. Finally, some  examples of existing training programmes are provided.  In each country section, a subsection is dedicated to the ‘roles and duties’ of competent  authorities and departments that perform duties related to preventing and fighting cybercrime.  The tables of competent authorities and departments provided are not exhaustive but rather aim  to present the reader with a quick overview. Additional information on the authorities and  departments and their roles and duties can be found in the subsections that follow these tables.  It should be noted that each country has its own organisations in terms of CSIRTs, including  national and governmental CSIRTs (as well as other CSIRTs), and also LE and judiciary  authorities.  The parts on countries already covered in the 2020 report (Czechia, France, Germany,  Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Romania and Sweden) are reproduced in this report, with some  minor changes.  2.1.  BELGIUM  Belgium is a ‘federal constitutional monarchy in which the king is the head of state and the  prime minister is the head of government in a multi-party system. Decision-making powers are  not centralised, but divided between 3 levels of government: the federal government, 3  language-based communities (Flemish, French and German-speaking) and 3 regions (Flanders,  Brussels Capital and Wallonia). Legally they all are equal, but have powers and responsibilities  for different fields’ (European Union, n.d.a).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  13  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Belgium is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Belgium legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Belgium published its National Cyber Security Strategy 2.0 2021-2025 in May 2021 (CCB,  2021) and legislation that transposes the EU NIS Directive (Law No 2019011507) in 2019  (CCB, 2019).  Belgium ratified the Budapest Convention in 2012.  2.1.1.  Roles and duties  In Belgium, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related  to preventing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  Centre for Cyber Security Belgium Centre pour la Cybersécurité Belgique  CCB  - Federal Computer Emergency  Response Team  Computer Emergency Response Team  Fédérale CERT.be  Police Police / Politie  - Federal Computer Crime Unit  Federal Computer Crime Unit FCCU  - Regional Computer Crime Units  Regional Computer Crime Units RCCU  - Local Computer Crime Units Local Computer Crime Units LCCU  Federal Public Service for the Economy  Service Public Fédéral Economie  Public Prosecution Services Ministère public  2.1.1.1. National cybersecurity agency  Created in 2014, the Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium is the central authority for  cybersecurity in Belgium, under the authority of the Prime Minister. It is in charge of the Belgian  national cybersecurity policy and of the management of CERT.be, the national CSIRT  (CERT.be, n.d).  The CCB’s main tasks are inter alia:  • ‘Monitoring, coordinating and supervising the implementation of Belgian policy on  the subject; […]  • Ensuring coordination between the relevant government departments and  governments, as well as the public authorities and the private or scientific sectors;  • Formulating proposals aimed at adapting the regulatory framework in the field of  cyber security;  • Ensuring crisis management in case of cyber incidents in cooperation with the  government's Coordination and Crisis Centre;  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  14  • Preparing, disseminating and supervising the implementation of standards,  guidelines and security standards for the various information systems of the  governments and public institutions; […]’ (CCB, n.d.).  The Belgian NCSS states that the CCB, ‘in collaboration with CERT.be, in its quality of national  CSIRT, is in charge of detecting and analysing cybersecurity problems and vulnerabilities and of  informing the users, with the support of Internet services providers’ (CCB, 2021).  ‘All entities may report [to CCB], on a voluntary basis, incidents that have a significant impact on  the continuity of the services they provide. This voluntary notification does not have the effect of  imposing obligations on the notifying entity that it would not have been subject to if it had not  made the notification. When processing a notification, the CCB may nevertheless give priority to  mandatory notifications imposed by the NIS Act over voluntary notifications’ (CCB, n.d. a).  By law, in the course of a cybercrime investigation, the CCB can be appointed as a judicial  expert. The CCB then provides technical expertise to the Police and both the police and the  CCB can share all the necessary information. Guidelines on how to appoint the CCB as an  expert during criminal investigations is being set up by the Public Prosecution Services. Criteria  are mentioned in the guidelines to determine in which situations the CCB can be appointed as  an expert, for example the level of complexity or the severity of the impact of the incident.  However, one of the experts interviewed explained that the CCB has no obligation and can  refuse to be appointed as an expert. Moreover, according to one of the interviewees, the CCB  has in reality rarely been appointed as an expert.  As highlighted by one of the interviewees, the Belgian criminal procedure system is a written- evidence based system: written statements are read by the court during a trial, but witnesses  are not called to court in person. The Belgian CSIRT can be called as a witness, but testifies  only via written statements.  The Cyber Emergency Plan (CCB, n.d. c) describes who can report an incident and how the  relevant stakeholders coordinate in the event of an incident, depending on the level of severity  of the incident:  • Level 1: there is one attack, usually not too complex, with only one victim involved;  • Level 2: the incident is not necessarily complex but has an impact at the national level,  with multiple victims;  • Level 3: the incident is a complex attack that leads to a very severe national crisis.  In case of very severe national crisis (complex cyberattack, with major impact on the Belgian  citizens), reaching the level 3 of the Cyber Emergency Plan, the CCB acts as the coordinator of  all the involved actors (the CCB, the Crisis Centre, intelligence agencies, the FCCU, the federal  prosecutor).  2.1.1.2. CSIRTs  Belgium’s national CSIRT, CERT.be, was established in 2009. It is the operational service of  the CCB. Its task is to detect, observe and analyse online security problems and to inform target  groups accordingly. It also publishes news on current cyberthreats, as well as various reports  and guidelines on the matter.  CERT.be delivers services to operators of essential services (OES) and critical infrastructures,  government services, public administrations, businesses and general public (CERT.be, n.d).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  15  As a government service, according to article 29 of the Belgian Code of Criminal Procedure, the  CSIRT should notify the prosecutions services of any crime it has knowledge of. Yet, an  interviewee reported that there might be exception due to the sometimes uncertain nature of the  information related to cyber incidents. Moreover, as there are a lot of many minor cyber  incidents, not all of them are systematically reported. However, when a national cyber incident  occurs, the CSIRT must immediately notify the Federal Prosecutor’s Office.  CERT.be is a member of the CSIRTs Network.  2.1.1.3. LE  The Federal Computer Crime Unit (FCCU), attached to the directorate for the fight against  serious and organised crime (DJSOC) of the Federal Police, is responsible for investigations  connected to cyberattacks and other cyber offences.  At the federal level, the FCCU handles cases related to critical infrastructures and Operators of  Essential Services (OES). If the case has a more local impact, it is more likely to be handled by  the Regional Computer Crime Units (RCCU) (see below). One of the interviewees explained  that by law the FCCU has to deal with cases related to critical infrastructures, however the  distribution of other cases between FCCU and RCCU is decided on a case-by-case basis in  coordination with the Federal Prosecutor’s Office.  The Regional Computer Crime Units (RCCU) ‘investigate cyber attacks and provide technical  and legal support in non-specific crime investigations. RCCU staffing numbers are set by  regional directors of the federal judicial police and vary’ considerably (Council of the European  Union, 2017g, p. 32).  Local Computer Crime Units (LCCUs) have been created by some Local Police zones (12).  The Federal Public Service for the Economy has a team of ‘investigators assigned to  prosecutions related to economic offences committed via the Internet’ (Council of the European  Union, 2017g, p. 32).  The Police response within the Cyber Emergency Plan of the CCB is provided by the Quick  Reaction Force (QRF), made of FCCU and RCCU staff. According to the interviewees, the QRF  has been put into action a few times, for example during the cyberattack on the Tournai hospital  (January 2021) (RTBF, 2021). Although the case was mostly handled at the regional level, the  QRF was tasked to gather evidence during the first week following the attack. The QRF was  involved in a few other cases but only as advisor, and was not deployed.  Finally, Belgium is part of the Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol,  n.d.c).  2.1.1.4. Judiciary  The Public Prosecution Service is composed of public prosecutors, who ‘prosecute offenders  in court, lead criminal inquiries, pursue perpetrators and call for the court to sentence suspects’  (Council of the European Union, 2017g, p. 29).  One of the interviewees reported that each of the fourteen prosecutor’s office has at least one  cybercrime prosecutor, however also dealing with cases related to other types of crime. At the  federal level, the Federal Prosecutor’s Services has a dedicated cyber unit consisting in three  prosecutors specialised in cybercrime, but also dealing with cases related to other types of  crime. No prosecutor is exclusively dealing with cybercrime cases.  In 2008, a decision was taken by the College of Principal Public Prosecutors to have a minimum  of one judge specialised in cybercrime within the public prosecutor’s office, the principal public  (12) See for instance the LCCU created by the Politiezone Regio Tielt (Belgian Police, n.d.).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  16  prosecutor’s office and the Federal Prosecutor’s office. Cybercrime judges are expected to  undertake specialist cybercrime training. Moreover, ‘the College of Principal Public Prosecutors  has created a cybercrime experts’ network [emphasis added] with representatives of the  federal, principal and first-instance public prosecutor’s offices, the federal police (FCCU), the  CCD and, by invitation, examining judges, to increase the relevant expertise of the Public  Prosecution Service [and] facilitate communications’ (Council of the European Union, 2017g, p.  30).  Belgium cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.1.2. Synergies and potential interferences  The experts interviewed assessed the cooperation among CSIRT, LE and the Judiciary as  overall very good. Complementary synergies are existing and fostered by good communication  between the three communities. The information flow between the CSIRT, the FCCU and the  Judiciary is very efficient and enhanced by a trusting relation. An informal chat group is existing  between the three communities, which allows each of them to be immediately aware in case of  a cyber incident, each community is aware immediately.  The prosecutor leading the investigation must appoint the CSIRT as an expert to allow for full  cooperation and information sharing with the Police. According to one of the interviewees, this  mechanism can be used for either ‘regular’ cases or in the framework of the Cyber Emergency  Plan, but tends to be used more for the latter.  Regarding the Cyber Emergency Plan, the NCSS foresees that it ‘continues to be  operationalised. Through optimal cooperation between the CCB’s national Computer  Emergency Response Team (CERT.be), the Integrated Police Services and the National Crisis  Centre (NCCN), incidents are dealt with quickly and effectively and legal investigations are  immediately integrated’ (CCB, 2021).  One of the experts interviewed underlined that in general ‘the CSIRT assists the FCCU in terms  of analytical capability when they are appointed as experts in a cybercrime case’.  One specific  synergy identified during the interviews is the technical complementarity between the CSIRT  and the LE. For example, the CSIRT gathers indicators of compromise (IoC), which can be very  useful for the Police’s investigation.  Another strong synergy, as specified by one of the interviewees, is that the FCCU can identify  who is behind IP addresses, upon request from the Public Prosecutor, whereas the CSIRT  cannot legally do it. This led to the development of a workflow around C2 services (control &  command used for malware/ransomware): CERT.be had a list of active C2 services in Belgium,  so they knew the IP addresses from which the threats emanated, but could not identify who they  belong to. In coordination with the Public Prosecutor, the FCCU set up a workflow where they  could identify who is behind the IP addresses which were in possession of the CSIRT.  Moreover, every three months, all the relevant actors (the CCB, CERT.be, the Federal  Prosecutor, Military Intelligence, the FCCU and the Crisis Centre) meet to discuss recent cases.  No major interferences and/or overlaps were experienced by the experts interviewed. The good  communication between the three communities allows them to find a solution to potential  differences of interest.  It was however underlined that there may sometimes be ‘duplication of analysis if the CSIRT  and the police have access to the same evidence and start analysing them at the same time’.  Moreover, the loss of digital evidence might sometimes be the result of the prevention of further  damage following a cyber incident. One interviewee stated that the ‘decision [to potentially  delete evidence to mitigate damage] should be balanced, taking into consideration all aspects’  and specified that ‘in the majority of cases, priority is given to the prevention of further damage’.  OPTIMAL  COOPERATION  TO DEAL WITH  INCIDENTS  QUICKLY AND  EFFECTIVELY  ‘Through optimal  cooperation between  the CCB’s national  Computer  Emergency  Response Team  (CERT.be), the  Integrated Police  Services and the  National Crisis  Centre (NCCN),  incidents are dealt  with quickly and  effectively and legal  investigations are  immediately  integrated’ (CCB,  2021).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  17  According to another interviewee, as the situation starts to calm down after a period of close  cooperation (e.g. at the height of a crisis), it can sometimes take longer for the Police to obtain  evidence or reports from the CSIRT as the incident is no longer the CSIRT’s main focus.  Finally, as it emerged from one of the interviews, from the victim’s point of view, ‘it can  sometimes be unclear who is in charge and who they should provide the evidence to, as they  are sometimes asked to provide evidence twice, by both the CSIRT and the police’.  Despite good cooperation, challenges exist. As emerged from the data collected via interviews,  ‘Mutual understanding […] is sometimes lacking, more specifically [on] what the other  community can and cannot do. More specifically, the CSIRT can sometimes encounter  difficulties in understanding the legal process’ and framework, and the prosecutors may have  difficulties in understanding the technical aspects. However, to ease this challenge: CSIRT  representatives and prosecutors participate in common courses, such as the SANS courses,  offered by the CCB to federal actors (LE, Judiciary). One of the interviewees explained that  these courses are very beneficial as they give prosecutors ‘a very good understanding of most  of the technical aspects’ of cybercrime cases, which also allows them ‘to take appropriate legal  measures’.  One recommendation made by one of the interviewees to address the challenges the three  communities could have in understanding each other was to set up common guidelines for  cooperation between the CSIRT, the LE and the Judiciary.  2.1.3. Examples of training  The CCB provides technical training, but also training on the role and duties of the CCB. There  are also joint training opportunities between the prosecutors and the CCB staff, so the latter can  learn more about the legal aspects of cybercrime. Moreover, the CCB offers opportunities for  the Judiciary to participate in the SANS courses (according to one of the experts interviewed,  some nine prosecutors have participated and completed the course to date).  ‘Through the Federal Public Service Policy and Support, the Centre for Cyber Security Belgium  (CCB) provides a specialised range of cybersecurity training courses. This involves thorough  basic training as well as more specialised training in a specific field for federal public officials’  (CCB, n.d. b).  The FCCU has participated in several tabletop exercises with the CSIRT, the Judiciary and  military intelligence. According to one interviewee, a large tabletop exercise took place a few  years ago to test what would happen if a major cyberattack occurred during elections.  In addition, in 2019, the FCCU made a substantial contribution to European training projects on  the dark web, organised under the aegis of the European Police College (CEPOL). Two  sessions were organised, in which about sixty LEA representatives from different European  countries took part. That same year, after an interlude of a few years, the FCCU organised a  training course for the Computer Crime Unit functional certificate. Since then, around sixty  people have taken the basic module (Federal Police, 2019).  For the Judiciary, the Belgian Institute for Judicial Training has set up a three-level cybercrime  training for new prosecutors, to which CSIRT, FCCU and RCCUs representatives are invited on  a regular basis as speakers:  1. Basic cybercrime training, for all judicial trainees;  2. Advanced training, for judges and prosecutors specialising in cybercrime;  3. Specialised courses, on topics like virtual currencies, specific investigation methods in a  virtual environment, international cooperation, etc.  Moreover, one expert underlined that the Judiciary and LE representatives are encouraged to  meet regularly within ‘regional cybercrime task forces’ to share experiences and enhance  cooperation. Cybercrime policy guidelines are being elaborated: they will include a minimum  training on cybercrime for prosecutors, as well as the obligation to participate in these  ‘cybercrime task forces’ to share knowledge and best practices.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  18  2.2. CZECHIA  Czechia is a ‘parliamentary republic with a head of government, the prime minister – and a head  of state, the president. The country is divided into 14 regions, including the capital, Prague’  (European Union, n.d.b).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Czechia is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Czech legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  In 2014 Czechia adopted its NCSS for 2015–2020 (NBÚ, 2015) (ENISA, n.d.e). Czechia  adopted late 2020 a new National Cybersecurity Strategy for 2021 – 2025 (NÚKIB, 2020a). To  date, the new Action Plan for the NCSS is not available, however expected for late 2021.  Cybersecurity has been regulated by the Cyber Security Act since 2014 (NCKB, 2014). The  Cyber Security Act regulates the rights and obligations of persons, as well as the powers and  competences of public authorities, in the field of cybersecurity. It also implements relevant EU  provisions (transposing, for example, the NIS Directive (European Parliament and Council,  2016)) and regulates the security requirements for electronic communications networks and  information systems.  In addition, a document called \"Concept for the development of the National office for Cyber and  Information Security\" was published in 2020 by the NÚKIB. It presents a long-term vision of the  NÚKIB development, as well as a capacity development plan until 2027, including capacity  building of the governmental CERT and regular training of the NÚKIB staff (NÚKIB, 2020).  Czechia ratified the Budapest Convention in 2013.  2.2.1.  Roles and duties  In Czechia, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related  to preventing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  National Cyber and Information Security  Agency (NCISA)  Národní úřad pro kybernetickou a informační  bezpečnost  NÚKIB  National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) Národní centrum kybernetické bezpečnosti  NCKB  GovCert.CZ: Government CERT of the  Czech Republic GovCERT.CZ: Vládní CERT České republiky GovCERT.CZ  National CSIRT of the Czech Republic Národní CSIRT České republiky CSIRT.CZ  Police of the Czech Republic – National  Centre Against Organized Crime – Unit of  Special Activities  Národní centrála proti organizovanému zločinu  – Útvar zvláštních činností  NCOZ – ÚZČ  Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Offices and  Judges Nejvyšší státní zastupitelství České republiky  2.2.1.1. National cyber security agency  The National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NCISA) is responsible for the  implementation of the NCSS in Czechia. It is ‘the central administrative body for cyber security,  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  19  including the protection of classified information in the field of information and communication  systems and cryptographic protection’ (NÚKIB, n.d.). It can also act as an ‘expert’ on  cybersecurity issues for LE and provide technical help in criminal investigations. NCISA  ‘operate[s] the government security team, the so-called Government CERT of the Czech  Republic (GovCERT.CZ)’ (NÚKIB, n.d. a). It also engages in dialogue with the other EU  Member States. NCISA cooperates with other national and foreign CSIRTs, supports education  and research and development in the field of cybersecurity, performs security audits and  exercises, and engages in international cooperation and policy work. It also offers legal and  policy support in the field of cybersecurity to other governmental bodies and their CSIRTs.  2.2.1.2. CSIRTs  In Czechia, there are officially two nationwide CSIRT teams recognized by the Cyber Security  Act: the governmental CERT (GovCERT.CZ) and a national CSIRT (CSIRT.CZ).  GovCERT.CZ is a public entity operated by the executive section of NCISA. GovCERT.CZ’s  ‘goal is to help [the critical information infrastructure and the state bodies] to effectively face  security challenges, react on the incidents, coordinate actions to solve them and effectively  prevent them’ (NÚKIB, n.d.). Its ‘constituency are public sector institutions and critical  information infrastructure of the Czech Republic’ (NCBK, 2015, p. 8). Operators of these  infrastructures are required by law to report cybersecurity incidents to NCISA. GovCERT.CZ is  therefore responsible for the evaluation of, and coordination of the response to, severe incidents  and the sharing of relevant information about incidents or threats with relevant authorities,  operators of relevant infrastructures and the public. GovCERT.CZ/NCISA may require regulated  entities to implement reactive or preventive measures in reaction to specific cybersecurity  incidents and threats.  CSIRT.CZ is a private entity operated by the Czech domain registry CZ.NIC on the basis of a  public contract arranged with NCISA. CSIRT.CZ fulfils the role of a national CSIRT, as defined  in the Cyber Security Act. It collects mandatory reports of cybersecurity incidents from operators  of important networks and digital services, coordinates the response to them and shares data  and information with GovCERT.CZ.  There are three main reasons why there are two nationwide CSIRTs in Czechia. The first  reason is because of the principle of the minimisation of state intervention – it is not necessary  for the state to strictly regulate all operators of information infrastructures; therefore,  GovCERT.CZ deals only with the most important infrastructures in terms of national security  and provides other infrastructures with the opportunity to cooperate through the national CSIRT.  The second reason is that private infrastructure operators are more willing to cooperate with  another private entity than with the state; therefore, a greater intensity and scope of cooperation  between the infrastructure operators and the private national CSIRT is expected. The third  reason is that a public institution can do only what the law expressly allows, whereas the private  national CSIRT has more room for manoeuvre in coordinating and organising the response to  cybersecurity incidents, as it can act praeter legem and can do anything that the law does not  explicitly prohibit it from doing (Government of the Czech Republic, 2020).  2.2.1.3. LE  The National Centre against Organized Crime (Národní centrála proti organizovanému  zločinu – NCOZ) was established in 2016 by merging the Organized Crime Detection Unit  (Útvar pro odhalování organizovaného zločinu – ÚOOZ) and the Corruption and Financial Crime  Detection Unit (Útvar pro odhalování korupce a finanční criminality – ÚOKFK). It currently plays  a key role in the fight against cybercrime in Czechia. As a central body, it specialises in the fight  against organised and large-scale cybercrime and cybercrime against critical and important  information infrastructures. NCOZ also plays a coordinating role and a role in the preparation of  standard and recommended procedures for cybercrime investigations.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  20  The Unit of Special Activities (Útvar zvláštních činností – ÚZČ) of the Police of the Czech  Republic intercepts and records telecommunication traffic, conducts surveillance of persons and  objects, and collects digital evidence and carries out other specialised actions aimed at securing  such evidence.  At the regional level there are information crime units at each of the regional criminal Police  directorates. These units include specialists and have technical equipment for investigating  cybercrime and securing electronic evidence. They conduct investigations and provide support  and technical equipment in cybercrime investigations to other organisational units.  2.2.1.4. Judiciary  ‘The Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Czech Republic is the competent central  authority in the pre-trial stage of criminal proceedings whereas the Ministry of Justice of Czechia  is the competent central authority for the trial stage of criminal proceedings and when the  execution of sentences is concerned’ (Council of Europe, n.d.b).  A network of prosecutors specialising in cybercrime has been formally established at the  national level (Council of the European Union, 2017).  At the level of the Public Prosecutor’s Office and courts, an informal expert group has been set  up at the Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Office, which focuses on computer crime.  Judges in Czechia are independent in the performance of their duties and there is no  specialisation of judges in criminal chambers. Cases are therefore assigned to judges according  to a random key and it is up to each judge to educate themselves on the issue at hand.  However, because of the increasing number of cybercrime cases, as well as cases in which  familiarisation with the issue of electronic evidence is necessary, there is an increased interest  in this area on the part of the judges. There is also a clear effort on the part of prosecutors and  the Police to provide relevant information on the context of, and to explain the technical details  of, cases, including in cooperation with CSIRTs, academia and other members of the  professional public.  Czechia cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.2.2. Synergies and potential interferences  As in most countries, useful synergies and also at the same time reciprocal potential  interferences in the activities of individual communities can be identified. In general,  representatives of these communities agreed that, if the activities of individual communities are  coordinated, they are significantly more effective. In such cases, individual communities can  support each other and share specific competences, powers, knowledge, information and  equipment.  Over the last few years, many steps have been taken to strengthen the effectiveness of inter- community cooperation. The Cyber Security Act has been adopted, regulating the obligation to  provide information and formulating the powers of NCISA and national and governmental  CSIRTs; a memorandum was concluded between NCISA and the Police; the position of liaison  officer to enable Police and CSIRT coordination was established; and cooperation mechanisms  have been set up and implemented. Such steps have improved the synergies among these  communities. In particular, they enable the immediate and effective bilateral transfer of  information on threats and incidents between LE and CSIRTs, the mutual use of professional  and technical capabilities of individual communities, mutual assistance in actions to fulfil  relevant obligations, and cooperation with other communities. One synergy specifically identified  during the interviews is that CSIRTs share with LE information obtained from a constituency or  cooperating mechanisms that would otherwise be unavailable to LE. However, although these  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  21  synergies are particularly evident between CSIRTs and LE, they are relatively new in the case  of the Judiciary.  There are also some interferences that may occur between the communities. According to the  interviewees the most important potential interference relates to the collection of digital  evidence and stems from the differences between the goals and approaches of the different  communities. Activities of CSIRTs focused on the mitigation of cyber incidents may seriously  hinder collection of the evidence necessary for a criminal investigation, or even destroy it or  render it inadmissible in court. In addition, one of the limitations of cooperation identified during  the interviews is due to the need of CSIRTs to maintain trust within their constituencies.  Although CSIRTs recommend that victims of cybercrime report incidents to and cooperate with  LEAs, they sometimes refuse to do so for different reasons. In such cases CSIRTs are  discouraged from sharing information about relevant incidents with LE because they fear a loss  of trust from their constituency. Another limitation identified is the lack of understanding,  specifically between the experts from CSIRT and Leon one side, and the Judiciary, on the other  side.  During the interviews, the following recommendations were formulated by the interviewees:  • provide more coordination of activities – through training, more precise legal and  procedural regulation and cooperation mechanisms;  • provide transparent information-sharing mechanisms;  • strengthen cooperation with the Judiciary (CSIRT-LE cooperation is mostly  already in place);  • provide better descriptions of individual groups/units, so that everyone knows who  to contact and when;  • implement sustainable and trustworthy cooperation routines for all the institutions  involved;  • involve all of the communities in training; the training should be focused on the  ability to rapidly share information between all communities.  2.2.3. Examples of training  The Action Plan of the Cyber Security Strategy of Czechia (NCKB) considers promoting the  development of Czechia’s Police capabilities with regard to cybercrime. It mainly aims to:  • reinforce the personnel of individual Police cybercrime departments;  • modernise the technological equipment of specialised Police departments;  • develop cooperation with foreign counterparts;  • provide professional education and training to Police specialists, including  language training.  The Conception of the Development of Capabilities of the Police of Czechia to Investigate  Cybercrime was drafted by the Police Presidium of Czechia and adopted by the National  Security Council in October 2015 (Council of the European Union, 2017).  Actions aimed at the prevention and public awareness of cybercrime are carried out by several  authorities within Czechia, such as the National Cyber Security Centre, LEAs, the private sector,  academia and non-governmental organisations.  The National Cybersecurity Competence Centre (NC3) (National Cybersecurity Competence  Centre, n.d.) at Masaryk University, Brno (Masaryk University , n.d.), has developed a special  tool, KYPO (Kybernetický polygon), which is a cyber range platform (KYPO, n.d.), and built a  laboratory that is used to organise cybersecurity exercises. These consist of large-scale  exercises held two to four times a year, with smaller exercises taking place a couple of times a  month, and are offered to public authorities, businesses and education providers. NC3 offers  INTERCOMMUNITY  COOPERATION  Cooperation  mechanisms have  been set up and  implemented  [enabling] immediate  and effective bilateral  transfer of information  on threats and  incidents between LE  and CSIRTs.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  22  training to judicial and Police academies, investigators and public prosecutors. NCISA, in  cooperation with NC3, also organises the annual Cyber Czech exercise using KYPO and its  laboratory (13).  Law enforcement and judicial authorities are provided with professional training on cybercrime.  The aim is to establish standard practices and knowledge for the detection and investigation of  cybercrime, with the main focus being to secure digital traces and evidence. Certain educational  activities on dealing with cybercrime also take place at Secondary Police Schools of the Ministry  of the Interior. Participation in national and international exercises in the field of cybersecurity,  organised by GovCERT.CZ, also serve as professional training.  The Police Academy (The Police Academy of the Czech Republic, n.d.) also takes cybercrime  into account in its lifelong training for officers. These training activities are organised with  CEPOL and many of the courses are the result of the EMPACT initiatives (Europol, n.d.d).  The Judicial Academy (The Judicial Academy, n.d.) organises training activities for LE and  prosecutors on cybercrime and electronic evidence in cooperation with the Police Academy.  Finally, tabletop exercises take place between CSIRTs and LE and help to improve  communication.  2.3.  ESTONIA  Estonia is ‘a parliamentary republic. The head of government, the prime minister, is nominated  by the president and approved by the Parliament. He/she is in charge of the executive power  vested in government. The head of state, the President, is elected by Parliament or electoral  college for 5 years. The Parliament has 101 members, elected every 4 years. The country is  divided into 15 counties and 79 municipalities’ (European Union, n.d.c).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Estonia is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Estonian legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  The Estonian NCSS 2019-2022 is the third national cybersecurity strategy document (Estonian  Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, 2019). It is based on lessons learned during  the two previous strategy periods (2008-2013 and 2014-2017). The new Cybersecurity Act  came into force in 2018 (Riigi Teateja, 2018a). It transposes requirements from the NIS directive  and the GDPR into national legislation.  Estonia ratified the Budapest Convention in 2003.  2.3.1.  Roles and duties  In Estonia, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related to  preventing and fighting cybercrime.  (13) This is the main cybersecurity exercise organised by Czechia – it is focused mainly on technical issues, but also  deals with cooperation, legal and organisational issues. It involves the simulation of cooperation between CSIRTs,  the police, the media, data protection authorities, users, other infrastructure operators, etc. For more information see  https://csirt.muni.cz/projects/cyber-czech.  https://csirt.muni.cz/projects/cyber-czech  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  23  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  Information System Authority  Riigi Infosüseemi Amet RIA  - CERT Estonia CERT Eestis CERT-EE  Criminal Police Kriminaalpolitsei  - Cybercrime Unit Küberkuritegude büroo  Prosecutor’s Office Prokuratuur  2.3.1.1. National cybersecurity agency  Under the responsibility of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, the Estonian  Information Security Authority (RIA) is responsible for developing the national IT systems,  managing and protecting the state Internet network and ensuring national cybersecurity of  Estonia (RIA, n.d.).  RIA operates the Estonian national CSIRT, CERT-EE.  2.3.1.2. CSIRTs  Established in 2006, CERT-EE is a department of the Cyber Security Branch of the Information  System Authority (RIA) and is funded by the state budget (RIA, n.d.a).  CERT-EE’s primary constituents are Estonia’s state institutions and local authorities, in addition  to Operators of Essential Services (OES) and Digital Service Providers (DSP) in the context of  the NIS directive, and critical IT infrastructure. The level of support provided by CERT-EE  depends on the type and severity of the incident or issue, and on the impact on Estonian critical  infrastructure.  ‘CERT-EE deals with security incidents that occur in Estonian networks, start there, or which it  has been notified about by citizens or institutions either in Estonia or abroad’ (RIA, n.d.a).  CERT-EE's role is to:  • Monitor the state of information security in Estonia;  • Prevent security incidents and reduce security risks;  • Provide assistance and advice to institutions victims of cybersecurity incidents. CERT-  EE can also facilitate contact with LEAs.  CERT-EE is the NIS Directive Single Point of Contact. Its role also covers awareness raising for  government and non-government entities, and educating the nation and national IT sector on  cyber threats.  As the Estonian Code of criminal procedure (Riigi Teateja, 2003) allows the involvement of  experts in criminal proceedings, CERT-EE can be appointed as an expert body by the  prosecutor in charge of the case. The CERT-EE T’s representatives can also be called as  witnesses to court as necessary.  CERT-EE is a member of the CSIRTs Network.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  24  2.3.1.3. LE  Within the Criminal Police, cybercrime is tackled by the Cybercrime Unit, which was set up in  2016 (e-GA, 2021).  The Cybercrime Unit is responsible for the investigation of cybercriminal acts. It gathers and  analyses intelligence on criminal offences. It used to be responsible for digital forensics, which  is now the responsibility of a separate unit.  In 2020, the Cybercrime Unit opened the website ‘cyber.politsei’ (Politsei, n.d.) to report  cybercrime to the Police. The website also gives information and tips on how to recognise  phishing e-mails or restore access to personal accounts.  2.3.1.4. Judiciary  ‘The Prosecutor's office [emphasis added] is a government agency within the area of  government of the Ministry of Justice which participates in the planning of surveillance  necessary to combat and detect criminal offences, directs pre-trial criminal procedure and  ensures the legality and efficiency thereof, represents public prosecution in court’ (Riigi Teateja,  2018).  Until some years ago there were no specialised cybercrime courts or prosecutor's offices in  Estonia (Council of the European union, 2017d). One of the experts interviewed specified that  the prosecutor in charge of international cooperation also dealt with cybercrime. Moreover,  District Prosecutors could be assigned to tackle cybercrime cases, while simultaneously working  with other types of crime. The situation changed in 2019 and there is currently one prosecutor  specialised in cybercrime within the Prosecutor General’s Office, who deals exclusively  with cybercrime cases.  Cybercrime connected to State security or of very high priority are prosecuted by the Prosecutor  General’s Office. The four District Prosecutor’s Offices also have smaller units able to deal with  cybercrime, to which the Prosecutor General’s Office can give guidance. In some specific  cases, the Prosecutor General’s Office can take the decision to take over the case.  The cybercrime prosecutor gives guidance to the Police during the investigation and, once the  investigation is completed, decides, based on the evidence collected, whether or not to start  prosecution.  The Prosecutor General’s Office is also responsible for informing the public about the risk of  cybercrime.  Estonia cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.3.2. Synergies and potential interferences  The situation in Estonia is specific as it is a small country in terms of size and population (14).  Representatives from the three communities know each other well and have built a solid  cooperation based on trust. As highlighted by one interviewee, ‘the police and the prosecutor in  charge of cybercrime work as a team’, and there are no overlaps in their roles and duties.  Phone calls are usually organised every day and meetings in person on a weekly basis to  ensure smooth cooperation.  An example of synergy was given by one of the experts interviewed: in a recent case, the  CSIRT went on site to assess the gravity of a cybersecurity compromise and the damage  caused, from the victim’s point of view. This assessment made by the CSIRT helped LE better  understand the attackers’ infrastructure and the victim’s point of view. This combination of  (14) Estonia is a country of 43,339 km2 and 1.3 million inhabitants (European Union, n.d.q)  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  25  CSIRT and LE expertise allowed the two communities to draw a better and more  comprehensive picture of the incident and its consequences.  One interviewee highlighted that there were cases where CSIRT representatives were allowed  by the prosecutor to take part in the hearings of cybercrime perpetrators. This significantly  fostered the CSIRT’s understanding of the cases and ultimately helped them improve the way  the two communities work together.  Despite this, the interviews highlighted that there may be a difference of interests among the  communities: at the beginning of an investigation, the priority of both the Police and the  Prosecutor’s Office is to gather as much evidence as possible, sometimes before the CSIRT  acts, whereas the CSIRT, responsible for (State) cybersecurity, aims to quickly stop the  incident, recover the system and inform the public. The investigative procedures can be slower  and more bureaucratic than the CSIRT’s, which can be a challenge.  However, thanks to very good communication, no conflicting situations were experienced by the  interviewees. In case of a disagreement between LE and the CSIRT, the prosecutor has the  final say.  2.3.3. Examples of training  Joint training opportunities are mostly bilateral and rarely involve all three communities. One of  the interviewees mentioned that joint trainings are not especially necessary as ‘real life is the  best way to train on how to work together’.  The cybercrime prosecutor provides training to LE and other institutions responsible for  cybercrime. The training covers topics like e-evidence or international cooperation. The Police  also provides training to the Prosecutor’s Office, on specific subjects, such as open source  intelligence gathering.  One expert interviewed explained that informal joint events were organised regularly between  the LE and the CSIRT before the COVID-19 pandemic. These events allowed each community  to enhance their understanding of the other’s work.  2.4. FINLAND  Finland is a ‘parliamentary republic with a head of government, the prime minister, and a head  of state, the President. The central government is based in Helsinki and the local governments  in the 311 municipalities (towns and cities)’ (European Union, n.d.p).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Finland is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Finnish legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  The latest Finnish NCSS was published in 2019 (Finnish Security Committee, 2019). It is based  on the general principles of Finland’s 2013 NCSS. The 2019 NCSS foresees the development  of legislation enabling the fight against cybercrime.  The NIS Directive is transposed into Finnish law. The amendments to implement this directive  entered into force in 2018.  Finland ratified the Budapest Convention in 2007.  A STRONG  COOPERATION  BASED ON  TRUST  As Estonia is a small  country,  representatives of  the three  communities know  each other well and  have built a solid  cooperation based  on trust.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  26  2.4.1.  Roles and duties  In Finland, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related to  preventing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  National Cyber Security Centre Kyberturvallisuuskeskuksen NCSC-FI  National Bureau of Investigation Keskusrikospoliisi KRP  - Cybercrime unit Poliisin Kyberrikostorjuntakeskus  National Prosecution Authority  Syyttäjälaitos  2.4.1.1. National cybersecurity agency/CSIRTs  The National Cyber Security Centre of Finland (NCSC-FI) carries out the CERT function  (NCSC-FI, n.d.). It acts as both the national and governmental CSIRT.  The NCSC-FI was established in 2014. It is part of the Finnish Transport and Communications  Agency (Traficom). ‘NSCS-FI’s CSIRT duties include:  • Addressing information security violations and threats against networks,  communications and value-added services;  • Gathering information on such incidents;  • Disseminating information on information security matters’ (Traficom, n.d).  As described in the NCSC-FI’s RFC 2350, the NCSC-FI is ‘the National CSIRT of Finland and  the CSIRT for last-resort in cases where reporter cannot find more direct reporting contact in  Finland. The NCSC-FI also acts as the Finnish governmental CSIRT. Telecommunications  providers have a legal obligation to report major information security incidents, threats to  information security and faults and disturbances to the NCSC-FI’ (Traficom, n.d.a).  The NCSC-FI can be called to court as an expert to testify in a cybercrime case, however,  according to one interviewee, this happens very rarely.  NCSC-FI is a member of the CSIRTs Network.  2.4.1.2. LE  The Cybercrime unit was established in 2015 as part of the National Bureau of Investigation  (NBI). It is responsible for the investigation of the most serious cybercrime, internet and network  intelligence, and maintenance of situational awareness. One of the experts interviewed  explained that he NBI is also in charge of developing ‘new investigation methods and provides  technical, judicial and operational support to local police in cybercrime investigations’.  All police districts can investigate cybercrime, but the Cybercrime unit of the NBI ‘is responsible  for international, organised, technically challenging and larger cybercrime cases’ (Council of  Europe, n.d.c).  Police districts are responsible for the offences which occur in their region. They all have  dedicated digital forensic experts. The ways districts conduct investigations of cybercrime vary  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  27  significantly as only few districts have investigators specialised in cybercrime (Council of  Europe, n.d.c).  2.4.1.3. Judiciary  The National Prosecution Agency ‘is involved at all stages of the processing a criminal matter:  the pre-trial investigation, the consideration of charges and the trial’ (National Prosecution  Authority, n.d.). When the Police open an investigation, they request the naming of a prosecutor  for the pre-trial investigation. In Finland, the prosecutor does not lead the investigation, but  supports the Police during the investigation. Once the investigation is completed, the prosecutor  decides whether or not to prosecute the case. In specific cases where the crime has been  committed abroad but there are victims in Finland, the prosecutor is responsible for requesting a  police investigation.  Within the National Prosecution Authority, ‘the Prosecutor General’s Office acts as the general  administrative unit’ (National Prosecution Authority, n.d.a). There are five prosecution districts:  Southern Finland, Western Finland, Northern Finland, Eastern Finland and Åland (National  Prosecution Authority, n.d.a).  In Finland, a prosecutor can specialise in certain types of crime (specialised district prosecutor),  among which computer crime. Although there is no prosecutors or courts exclusively  responsible of cybercrime cases, ‘a group of prosecutors in local prosecution units prosecute  most of such crimes’ in addition to other tasks (Council of Europe, n.d.c). One expert  interviewed explained that prosecutors ‘began working on cybercrime related cases some  seven or eight years ago’. There are currently five or six prosecutors specialised in cybercrime.  The cases tend to be scattered, and one cybercrime prosecutor does not necessarily know what  the others are doing. There are not many complex cybercrime cases.  Finland cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.4.2. Synergies and potential interferences  The designated prosecutor leads the police investigation. The CSIRT does not usually interact  with the judiciary: the cooperation between the CSIRT and the Judiciary is operated via the  police, which interacts with both.  As highlighted during the interviews, weekly meetings are organised between the CSIRT, the  Cybercrime unit of the NBI, the Police and other relevant organisations, where ‘general  information about ongoing cybercrime cases is shared’. The Cybercrime unit also receives  weekly and monthly reports from the CSIRT. However, detailed information about ongoing  criminal investigations is shared by the LE to the CSIRT only when considered necessary to  prevent a cybercrime or to limit further damages.  One of the interviewees added that ‘weekly and quarterly meetings [are organised] where  information on phenomena and trends are shared and discussed between the CSIRT and the  police’. This was presented as an example of excellent synergy.  Another example of complementarity is the Finnish Police’s Net Tip-Off service (15), which  allows citizens to anonymously report offences, even if not directly a victim. In certain situations,  tip-offs can be forwarded to the CSIRT (for example, if there is not enough to warrant a Police  investigation), which can then act within the scope of its duties (e.g. asking for a website to be  taken down).  In addition, one expert specified that both the CSIRT and LE have highly-skilled personnel,  which, when working together, make ‘an extremely skilled team’. This specifically ‘tailored task  force’ was used in a few cases where ‘they have proven to be very creative and therefore very  useful’. One case was given as an example, where specific forensics solutions were needed. A  (15) https://poliisi.fi/en/net-tip  BILATERAL  SYNERGIES  The synergies are  existing bilaterally,  rarely involve the  three communities.  The LE and the  CSIRT meet  regularly to share  information on  ongoing cases.  Regular trainings are  organised between  the LE and the  Judiciary.  https://poliisi.fi/en/net-tip  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  28  ‘task force’ was set up with staff members from the CSIRT and LE, which found relevant  evidence that quickly brought the criminal investigation on the right track.  The interviewees stated that they did not experience major interferences in the work of the  CSIRT and LE, but mentioned a difference of interests between the two communities. Moreover,  the legal framework allowing the two communities to share information was presented as  sometimes restrictive, as each community would appreciate receiving more information from the  other but is limited by law. One limitation was mentioned during the interviews: the CSIRT ‘lacks  proper specific procedures to preserve the chain of custody to hand e-evidence over to law  enforcement and ensure it is applicable in court’.  Moreover, although prosecutors receive cybercrime training on a regular basis, one of the  interviewees highlighted that more training would be beneficial for all the prosecutors to stay up- to-date with the technical aspects of cyber related criminal offence.  As ‘cybercrime cases can be complex and very technical’, one interviewee underlined that ‘it is  essential that we speak the same language and [that] the communication is clear, leaving no  room for misinterpretations’. The prosecutors and judges should have a good understanding  and awareness of the technical aspects to be prepared to such situation when it occurs.  Cybercrime prosecutors also experience organisational issues, as, according to one  interviewee, they could further coordinate with each other. Additionally, some cases are  sometimes handled by local prosecutors who are not specialised, which can affect the way the  Police investigates.  Finally, according to same data collected during the interviews, judges ‘tend to be reluctant to  work with the police to avoid compromising the objectivity of the courts’. There is no legal  framework for cooperation between judges and prosecutors, or between judges and Police.  2.4.3. Examples of training  The Police University College of Finland organises various courses, conferences and seminars  for police staff. Cybercrime is one of the topics covered by these courses.  The Police University College runs various research, development and innovation (RDI) projects  dedicated to enhancing cybercrime training of police forces. The most recent is \"Cyber  competence 2020\" (2017-2020, funded by the Internal Security Fund of the European Union),  which aimed to develop and increase ‘the provision of cyber training and education at the Police  University College of Finland to enable the launch of a specialist education study module in the  prevention of cybercrime’. The purpose is to ‘improve public authorities’ knowledge of and skills  in the prevention of cybercrime’ (Police University College of Finland, n.d.). Research results in  the cyber field will be used in the preparation of training. The education and training prepared in  the project is targeted at civil servants employed by the key public authorities engaged in the  prevention of cybercrime.  In 2013, the Police University College of Finland held the CEPOL course 15/2013 “Cybercrime  vs. Cyber security”, in which the NCSC-FI participated as an expert (CEPOL, 2013). In 2018,  Finland hosted the CEPOL course 81/2018, in cooperation with EJTN, on \"Forensic science and  evidence - challenge for policing\", of which the target audience was LE and judges/prosecutors  (CEPOL, 2018). One part of the course was focusing specifically on digital evidence.  One of the interviewees highlighted that specialised cybercrime prosecutors are offered training  both nationally and abroad, and are also tasked to train other prosecutors who do not handle  cybercrime cases regularly. These courses ‘are not mandatory but they have been very  welcomed among other prosecutors.  The experts interviewed explained that the Police and the prosecutors regularly participate in  joint trainings. Moreover, the Police has participated in prosecutors' training for several years,  and prosecutors in police training too, where they learn about technical aspects such as  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  29  networks, communications or cryptocurrencies. Joint trainings are seen as beneficial, as they  help ‘harmonise terms, language and understanding of cyber and cybercrime’.  One expert explained that a joint cyber exercise bringing together ‘the core of security in  Finland’ (Police, border controls, Finnish governmental ICT providers) is organised every year.  The NCSC-FI has a supporting role in this training and provides threat intelligence and expertise  as necessary. There are otherwise very few joint trainings between the CSIRT and the LE. The  cooperation is developed by working on common cases rather than training together.  However, it was highlighted during the interviews that there are no joint trainings involving all  three communities, although on expert underlined that this ‘could help in integrating, unifying  practices, understanding phenomena and, last but not least, taxonomy in cyber related issues’.  2.5.  FRANCE  France is ‘a semi-presidential republic with a head of government, the prime minister, appointed  by the president who is the directly elected head of state. France’s territory consists of 18  administrative regions – 13 metropolitan (i.e. European France) and 5 overseas regions’  (European Union, n.d.d).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in France is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant French legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  France adopted its updated NCSS in 2015 (ANSSI, n.d.) (ENISA, n.d.h). ‘An initial cybersecurity  strategy was developed in France in early 2010 and was published in early 2011’ (Prime  Minister of France, 2015, p. 7). In February 2021, the French President announced an  acceleration of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, which should include a strengthening of the  cooperation between the Law Enforcement community and the judiciary (Présidence de la  République française et du Palais del 'Élysée, p. statement at 3’7”).  France ratified the Budapest Convention in 2006.  2.5.1.

National cyber security agency  The National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (Agence nationale de la sécurité  des systèmes d’information – ANSSI) is responsible for implementing the NCSS in France. ‘The  role of ANSSI is to foster a coordinated, ambitious, pro-active response to cybersecurity issues  in France, to drive raising-awareness actions, as well as to spread French vision and expertise,  and European values, abroad’ (ANSSI, n.d. a).  2.5.1.2. CSIRTs  France has an officially recognised national CSIRT, CERT-FR (French Government CERT,  Centre gouvernemental de veille, d’alerte et de réponse aux attaques informatiques).  CERT-FR is part of ANSSI. ‘Its mission is to coordinate and investigate IT security incident  response for the French government, critical national infrastructure operators and operators of  essential services as defined by the French law.  CERT-FR’s missions cover prevention, detection, response and recovery by:  -  Helping to prevent security incidents by setting up necessary protection measures;  -  Detecting vulnerabilities on networks and systems;  -  Managing incident response, with the support of trusted partners if necessary;  -  Organizing trusted networks of CSIRT’ (ANSSI, 2018).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  31  As a national CSIRT it is the preferred international contact point for any cyber-related incident  affecting France. It operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  CERT-FR is a member of well-known networks of CSIRTs such as the CSIRTs Network, the  FIRST and it participates in the TF-CSIRT activities. CERT-FR also creates a French initiative to  structure the national incident response ecosystem called InterCERT-FR. As part of ANSSI,  CERT-FR also work closely with the CyCLONe’s officers.  CSIRT of the Judicial Police (CSIRT Police Judiciaire – CSIRT-PJ) is the CSIRT of the Central  Directorate of the Judicial Police, operating under the Cybercrime Centre (CSIRT-PJ, n.d.).  CSIRT-PJ aims to provide LE with CSIRT-like services: incident response, threat intelligence,  and malware analysis tooling. It is a member of TF-CSIRT (listed) and belongs to the French  CSIRT community called InterCERT France (CERT-FR, n.d.).  2.5.1.3. LE  The National Police (Police nationale) has the principal mission of fighting against any form of  criminality and delinquency including cybercrime.  One of the directorates of the National Police is the Central Directorate of the Judicial Police  (Direction centrale de la police judiciaire – DCPJ), which performs investigative tasks and  supports the prosecution service in cybercrime cases. Within the DCPJ, a sub-directorate for  ICT-related offences has been established for the fight against cybercrime (Sous-direction de  lutte contre la cybercriminalité – SDLC), which includes the Central Office for Combating  Information and Communication Technology Crime (Office Central de lutte contre la Criminalité  liée aux Technologies de l’iInformation et de la Communication – OCLCTIC) (16), a cyber- intelligence unit. The Anticipation and Analysis Division (D2A) is the technical support of the  OCLCTIC, with forensics and reverse capacities. The CSIRT-PJ is also embedded within the  OCLCTIC. The SDLC operates sixteen digital investigation laboratories, which can support  police services during digital investigations (French Senate, 2020).  The National Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie nationale) is a branch of the French Armed Forces  that is placed, as far as its civilian role goes, under the jurisdiction of the Home Office.  Within the Directorate-General of the National Gendarmerie (Générale de la Gendarmerie  Nationale – DGGN) there are the Intelligence Division (Direction du renseignement - DR) that  produces analyses regarding cybercriminals trends, the Institute for criminal research (Institut  de recherche criminelle de la Gendarmerie nationale - IRCGN) that has research labs not only  cyber and that provides technical support for reverse engineering, the Research Sections  (Sections de Recherche  - SR)  that can have specific cyber capacities and conduct dedicated  investigation if incidents happen on their territory.  The Central Criminal Intelligence Service of the National Gendarmerie (Service central de  renseignement criminel de la Gendarmerie nationale – SCRCGN) is responsible for providing  information and a precise understanding of organised and mass crime, to guide actions in the  fight against crime in the pre-judicial and judicial phases. In parallel, within the SCRCGN, the  Centre for the Fight against Digital Crimes (Centre de lutte contre les criminalités numériques –  C3N) aims to conduct or coordinate investigations of national scope relating to cybercrime, and  to carry out permanent surveillance of the internet, to detect and collect evidence of any  offences that may be committed there.  Under the structure of the Paris Police Prefecture (Préfecture de police), the Cybercrime Unit  (Brigade de lutte contre la cybercriminalité – BL2C) is assigned with cybercrime investigation  (16) The SLDC responds to the need to develop a global policy to combat cybercrime. It defines the strategies to be  implemented in the operational, training and prevention areas for the general public and the financial sector.  Strategic coordination of SDLC activities is handled by the OCLCTIC.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  32  tasks, in the capacity of judicial Police (CSIRT-PJ, n.d.). However, the BL2C is not responsible  for investigating cyberincidents impacting operators of essential services.  The Directorate-General for Internal Security (Direction générale de la sécurité intérieure –  DGSI), among other duties, has jurisdiction over investigations into cyberattacks with a national  security component. More precisely, the DGSI has exclusive judicial competence to carry out  cybercrime investigations related to attacks against critical infrastructure, national institutional  networks and operators of essential services (Ministère de l'Interieur, 2019) or when any  national fundamental interest is threatened (if related to terrorism, for example).  Since 2009, the French National Directorate for Customs Intelligence and Investigations  (Direction nationale du renseignement et des enquêtes douanières - DNRED) has its own  internal structure to fight cybercrime (called \"cyberdouanes\" or \"cellule Cyberdouane\") under the  scope of customs activities (such as collection and exploitation of data on illegal activities using  Internet) (French Senate, 2020).  Finally, France is part of the Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol,  n.d.c).  2.5.1.4. Judiciary  The French judicial system consists of ordinary courts, which include the criminal courts, and  administrative courts. The Court of Cassation (Cour de Cassation) is the supreme court in the  French judicial system of ordinary courts. The public prosecutor is the authority exercising  prosecution tasks, referring cases to the ‘investigative judge’ (juge d’instruction) and overseeing  the criminal investigation process and the judicial Police (European Union, n.d.g) (Ministère de  la Justice, 2012).  Within the public prosecutor’s offices, ‘an internal organisation has been set up to include a  “specialist judge” (magistrat référent) for cybercrime, who can provide technical support to  colleagues involved in cybercrime cases’ (Council of the European Union, 2015).  The Prosecutor of Paris now has national jurisdiction for cybercrime cases. As was highlighted  during one of the interviews, the prosecutor can evoke any case on national territory. This  approach provides better management of expertise as judges are specialised and handle a  great number of cases. The Prosecutor of Paris has a cell of three magistrates who specialise in  cybercrime.  In early 2020, a structural reorganisation of the Paris Prosecutor’s Office led to the renaming of  the Cybercrime unit (from F1 to J3), which is under the responsibility of the Paris’ circuit courts  (Cour d’assises). J3 can investigate complex cybercrime cases at the national level (such as  cases involving operators of essential services, ministries, etc.) (French Senate, 2020).  One of the interviewees reported that the Mission against Cybercrime was established in 2015  within the French Ministry of Justice. This mission has a more strategic role. The following  information emerged in this interview: ‘The tasks undertaken are not at an operational level but  directly at the ministry level, to analyse the phenomenon, represent the ministry and provide  official guidelines to handle relevant cases. An example of its work is to issue official guidelines  for Prosecutors to treat and prosecute some cases, such as a document to centralize judicial  treatment of ransomware. Public policy on the fight against cybercrime is elaborated at the level  of this Mission to support the judiciary.’  France cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  33  2.5.2. Synergies and potential interferences  As emerged from the interviews ‘ANSSI/CERT-FR and FR law enforcement perimeters and  mandates are complementary. As part of the national authority on cybersecurity, ANSSI/CERT- FR has the expertise on many cyber-related topics.’ ANSSI/CERT-FR helps both LE and the  judiciary ‘by sharing […] expertise in cybersecurity and […] knowledge on threats’. As was  stated during one of the interviews, ‘There are different directions [of interaction] between  CSIRTs and LE but also the judiciary from the administrative and the operational side. ANSSI  […], according to French law, […is] a public agency [and] has the obligation to inform the  competent authorities in the event of a suspicious criminal case’. Therefore, ANSSI informs the  Prosecutor Office when it becomes aware of a crime. On the other hand, the prosecutors can  also ask for ‘help from ANSSI (e.g. on particular infrastructure data and on modus operandi), but  this is still quite rare. There are [indeed] rather few cases […where] the judiciary has initiated a  contact with the CSIRTs to handle a case.’  Usually, ANSSI is informed of an attack on its constituency (critical infrastructure operators)  directly or the victim files a complaint to LE. ANSSI teams collect evidence in a legally sound  manner and begin remediation. LE then receives and processes the evidence and conducts its  analysis (on network logs, for example). The objective of LE is different from that of ANSSI:  ANSSI is looking for every details of intrusion while LE is looking for identification information.  Thus, ANSSI is able to suggest efficient remediation actions to the victim. In addition, as the  interviewees noted, ‘a liaison officer has been appointed between the ANSSI/CERT-FR and the  Ministry of [the] Interior and a dedicated process has been set up to share information on  incidents that are reported to ANSSI and are relevant for [French] LE entities’.  Nevertheless, according to the interviewees, restrictions on information sharing may occur, such  as ‘when an investigation is launched on a […] case [that is under judicial examination]’. In such  cases, ‘ANSSI/CERT-FR has to follow strict rules on information sharing with its other partners  in order to respect the confidentiality of investigations’. Eventually, ANSSI may request  authorisation from the judiciary for information sharing with other members of the CNW for  prevention purposes; a known C2 IP can help other CSIRTs protect their constituency. As  emerged from the interviews, the information-sharing process with international partners could  therefore be delayed in some cases. As ‘threats are international but the law enforcement  administration is national’, the main challenge identified is to address these delays.  Furthermore, as one of the interviewees highlighted, another challenge that may arise is to have  the victim ‘file a legal complaint, in order to allow LE to take over before [launching the]  remediation actions that could potentially alter the evidence’.  To better understand each other’s work, some public prosecutor’s offices have regular formal  meetings with specialised police investigation services. In addition, such meetings help to clarify  which investigative tasks can be requested of local Police to avoid overloading the specialised  services. Indeed, the communities are committed to a ‘continuous improvement of the close  relations’ that they have established.  A new legal measure (Article 706-105-1 – Code of Criminal Procedure) came into force in July  2021, opening the possibility of further cooperation and communication between the Paris  Public Prosecutor and non-judicial services (Code of Criminal Procedure, 2021). Concretely,  this measure enables the Paris Public Prosecutor, on his/her own initiative or when requested to  do so, to communicate or share judicial information of any nature to relevant state services even  if non-judicial. These services could be n/g CSIRTs. This can be done when necessary for the  state’s duties related to the security and defense of information systems. More precisely, this  measure is available when the investigation falls under the scope of Article 706-72 which  encompasses any offences against automated information processing systems (Code of  Criminal Procedure, 2021a).  EXAMPLE OF  SYNERGY –  THE CSIRT-PJ  The CSIRT Police  Judiciaire is part of  French LE. It  supports  investigations into  cybercrime. As full  member of the  CSIRT community, it  is a privileged actor  in terms of  cooperation and  information  exchange.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  34  In addition, under the framework of the French cyber defence strategy entitled “La Revue  stratégique de cyberdéfense”, a public–private initiative was launched in 2017 to raise  awareness of the risks of cyberattacks to society and to support the victims of such attacks. The  initiative is handled by the Public Interest Group for Action against Malicious Cyber Activities (Le  Groupement d’Intérêt Public Action contre la Cybermalveillance (GIP ACYMA). The state actors  involved are ANSSI, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economy  and Finance and the Secretary of State in charge of the digital sector. Civil society is also  represented in this Public Interest Group through consumer associations or victim support  entities, as well as trade and labour unions. This public–private initiative also handles the online  cybersecurity platform Cybermalveillance.gouv.fr, which was put in place to guide individuals,  small businesses and local authorities in taking preventive steps against cyberattacks and  addressing malicious events once they occur (Cybermalveillance.gouv.fr, 2019).  Furthermore, InterCERT France is a group gathering all organisations with Incident response  Team (IRT) activities on French soil. InterCERT France’s objective is to strengthen the  stakeholders’ capacity to detect and deal with security incidents. This initiative is driven by  several working groups, including members from law enforcement or judiciary entities, which  enhances the cooperation between CSIRT and LE (CERT-FR, n.d.).  Finally, ANSSI recently announced a funding and incubation framework to establish regional  CSIRTs in France. These CSIRTs will work very closely with law enforcement, which should  create a strong territorial network (ANSSI, n.d. b).  2.5.3. Examples of training  ANSSI offers free cybersecurity training to public organisations, among them LEAs, covering a  wide variety of topics and expertise levels. A lot of the training addresses basic security for end  users, as well as system administrators. It also deals with a wide range of advanced topics such  as security audits, network security, security certificate management and implementation of  cybersecurity certification. Finally, it provides training on very specialised topics such as radio  security against TEMPEST attacks.  As discussed during the interviews, the communities could benefit from joint training, as this  would ‘be useful to help strengthen the relationship between the CERT-FR/ANSSI and the LE  [and] judiciary [communities]’. Moreover, the communities could benefit from learning more  about each other’s counterparts in the ‘international cooperation process, [the] mechanisms and  [the] main players [involved]’ to overcome the difficulties that occur in identifying competent  actors and the actions to be expected.  ‘Trainees at police, gendarmerie and judicial academies […] receive basic training […] on  cybercrime’. These courses are often complemented ‘by conferences or scientific and technical  police workshops (Council of the European Union, 2015).  The OCLCTIC of the National Police organises on an annual basis a training course for French  judges and investigators entitled ‘Approach to cybercrime’, focusing on legal aspects related to  cybercrime and the special investigation techniques. It also organises a ‘first responder’ training  course aimed at Police officers who have to carry out basic cybercrime-related investigative  procedures (Council of the European Union, 2015).  The BL2C, part of the Paris Police Prefecture, participates in private sector training and  provides two approved training courses to the judiciary and customs officers on digital police  investigations.  The Information Systems Security Training Centre (CFSSI) is the main point of contact for  ANSSI for the training of various agencies. It is also involved in the definition and  implementation of the training policy.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  35  CECyF, also called F-CCENTRE, is the French Expert Centre against Cybercrime. CECyF  started in the context of the European project 2Centre (Cybercrime Centres of Excellence  Network for Training Research and Education). CECyF provides support to LE researchers from  both academia and the private sector and educational institutions to create projects that  contribute to training, education and research on cybercrime (CECyF, n.d.).  Finally, the French National School for the Judiciary (Ecole nationale de la magistrature – ENM)  provides multidisciplinary training to French and foreign judges, police officers, gendarmerie and  customs officers on recent legislative developments, as well as specific aspects of digital  investigations and the judicial handling of cybercrime.  2.6.  GERMANY  Germany is ‘a federal, parliamentary republic, with a head of government, the chancellor, and a  head of state, the president, whose primary responsibilities are representative. The country  comprises of sixteen federal States (Länder), which each have their own constitution and are  largely autonomous regarding their internal organisation’ (European Union, n.d.f). Power is  distributed between the federal and the state governments. Considering the state structure in  the country, preventing and responding to cybercrime require close cooperation at the federal  and Länder levels.  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Germany is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant German legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Germany adopted its NCSS initially in 2011 (BMI, 2011); this was updated in 2016 (ENISA,  n.d.f), alongside the Digital Strategy 2025, which sets out legal measures and instruments to  ensure the country’s digital transformation (BMWi, 2016).  In May 2021, Germany endorsed an IT Security Act 2.0, extending reporting obligations and  standards to be applied to critical infrastructures and reinforcing the BSI’s mandate to set  standards for Federal authorities and to monitor their compliance to afore-mentioned standards.  Germany ratified the Budapest Convention in 2009.  2.6.1. Roles and duties  In Germany, the following authorities and departments in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in English Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name  in the original language  (if applicable)  Federal Office for Information Security  Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der  Informationstechnik BSI  - CERT-Bund (part of BSI) CERT-Bund CERT-Bund  National Cyber Response Centre  Nationale Cyber-Abwehrzentrum Cyber-AZ  Central Office for IT - Federal ministry of the  Interior  Zentrale Stelle für Informationstechnik im  Sicherheitsbereich ZITiS  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  36  Federal Criminal Police Office Bundeskriminalamt BKA  - Division CC – Cybercrime Abteilung ‘Cyber-crime’  CC  Federal Police Bundespolizei BPOL  Criminal Police Offices of the Federal States  (Länder) Landeskriminalämter LKAs  The Federal Public Prosecutor General and the  Federal Court of Justice  Der Generalbundesanwalt beim  Bundesgerichtshof and  Bundesgerichtshof  GBA and BGH  Public Prosecutor’s Offices and Courts of the  federal states (Länder)  Die Staatsanwaltschaften der Länder and  Landgerichte Individual per federal state  2.6.1.1. National cyber security agency  The Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der  Informationstechnik – BSI) is the federal cybersecurity authority that ‘shapes information  security in digitization through prevention, detection and reaction for government, business and  society’ (BSI, n.d.). Its ‘goal […] is to promote IT security in Germany. The BSI is first and  foremost the central IT security service provider for the federal government in Germany’ (BSI,  n.d.). CERT-Bund is part of the BSI. The mandate and competences of the BSI are provided by  the Act on the Federal Office for Information Security of 2009, last amended on 2017 (BSI,  2017).  The National Cyber Response Centre (Nationale Cyber-Abwehrzentrum – Cyber-AZ) has  been set up to ‘optimize operational cooperation between all state authorities and improve the  coordination of protection and response measures’. Different governmental agencies are part of  this centre (BSI, BKA, BW-KdoCIR, BBK, BPOL, BfV, MAD and BND). ‘Cooperation in the  National Cyber Response Centre […] strictly observe[s] the statutory tasks and powers of all  authorities involved on the basis of cooperation agreements.’  2.6.1.2. CSIRTs  As mentioned, CERT-Bund is part of the BSI. CERT-Bund is the national CSIRT and ‘acts as  the central point of contact regarding IT-security incidents concerning the German government.  In addition it provides services to critical infrastructure, industry and SME [small and medium- sized enterprises] as well as citizens. Germany’s national IT Situation Centre and the national  Cyber Response Centre are supported by CERT-Bund’ (BSI, n.d. a). CERT-Bund is therefore  responsible for a large constituency and handling IT security incidents related to government  institutions, federal authorities, critical infrastructures and organisations.  The services that CERT-Bund offers are:  • ‘24-hour on-call duty in cooperation with the IT Situation Centre;  • analysis of incoming incident reports;  • creation of recommendations derived from incidents;  • support during IT security incidents;  • operation of a warning and information service;  • active alerting of the Federal Administration in case of imminent danger’ (CERT-Bund,  n.d.).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  37  CERT-BPOL (17) is part of the Federal Police (Bundespolizei). ‘After an attack in 2017, the  CERT-BPOL was founded as the cyber attack analysis and defense center and has been  reinforced continually ever since. The team comprises IT security staff from the Federal Police.  The team consists of IT experts from the Federal Police supported by experts from industry and  science. In order to detect and investigate incidents in the German Federal Police infrastructure,  intrusion prevention systems are operated and infrastructure vulnerabilities are identified by  CERT-BPOL. Liaison officers from CERT-BPOL represent the Federal Police Headquarters at  the […] Cyber-AZ’ (Bundespolizei, 2017).  Following the cyberattack against the Bundestag in 2015, Mobile Incident Response Teams  (MIRTs) were established within the BSI (ENISA, 2017b). The MIRT provides on-site support to  the federal administration and operators of critical infrastructures in the event of an  cybersecurity incident and supports incident response. In particularly serious cases, the BSI can  also provide on-site support with the CERT-Bund, then the MIRT operates as the mobile arm of  the CERT-Bund. After an inital assessment of the situation and of the consequences, the MIRT  carries out technical analyses and advises the organisation on how to deal with the incident  (BSI, 2019).  2.6.1.3. LE  As of 1 April 2020, the German Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt - BKA,  n.d.) includes a separate division dealing with cybercrime, named Division CC – Cybercrime  (Abteilung ‘Cyber-crime’). This division emerged from the Cybercrime and Information and  Communication Crime (ICT) group of the Serious and Organised Crime (SO) Department.  The main tasks of the Division CC – Cybercrime are to investigate cybercriminals and provide  support to other departments, analyse information, protect federal institutions and critical  infrastructures against cyberattacks and provide training to non-specialist employees of the  BKA, as well as provide advice on relevant legal provisions (BKA-CC, n.d.).  The BKA is in communication with prosecutors and judges. The BSI has appointed a CSIRT-LE  liaison officer to the BKA.  The German Federal Police is a (primarily) uniformed federal Police force (Bundespolizei, n.d.).  It is subordinate to the Federal Ministry of the Interior (Bundesminister des Innern, für Bau und  Heimat (BMI), n.d.).  LE authority is also exercised at the state level: the criminal police offices of the Länder  (Landeskriminalämter – LKAs) are independent LEAs in all sixteen states (Länder) and are  subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior. The State Police are known as the Landespolizei.  They are the main points of contact for cybercrime for most of the Länder. The ‘16 federal states  (Länder) [have] the authority to maintain their own police forces within their territory, along with  the right to pass legislation and exercise police authority’ (BMI, n.d.).  Established in April 2017, the Central Office for IT of the Federal ministry of the Interior  (ZITiS), although not a LEA, takes on a central role in researching and developing cyber-related  solutions. It is tasked with digital forensics, telecommunication surveillance, crypto analysis, big  data analysis and fight against crimes, counter espionage, R&D of methods and the  development of tools and strategies for security agencies (ZITiS, n.d.).  Finally, Germany is part of the Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol,  n.d.c).  (17) CERT-BPOL is listed in the ENISA inventory: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-  inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map#team=CERT-BPOL  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map#team=CERT-BPOL https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map#team=CERT-BPOL  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  38  2.6.1.4. Judiciary  Following the federal structure of Germany, ‘the court system is also structured federally.  Jurisdiction is exercised by federal courts and by the courts of the sixteen federal states  (Länder). The main workload of the administration of justice lies with the Länder’ (European  Union, n.d.o).  The BGH (Federal Court of Justice) is at the head of the local, regional and higher regional  courts and functions as a court of appeal for both civil and criminal cases. In general its  interpretations of the law are adopted by all regional courts and therefore do have far-reaching  effects on German jurisdiction in general.  ‘The prosecution offices are set up at every regional court’ and ‘are competent to investigate all  kinds of criminal offences except of offences against the state and other offences falling within  the competence of the Federal Public Prosecution Office’. […] ‘On the federal level there is only  one prosecution office, the Federal Public Prosecution Office which has its seat in Karlsruhe. In  the area of investigation and prosecution of crimes, the Federal Public Prosecution Office is  competent to investigate and prosecute crimes against the state and terrorist crimes as well as  other cases, if they involve serious crime that goes beyond individual Länder borders’ (EJN,  n.d.a).  Certain State Prosecutor’s Offices, such as the one in North Rhine-Westphalia, have a central  cybercrime unit dealing ‘with significant cybercrime proceedings’ (Council of the European  Union, 2017a, p. 28).  ‘There are no courts with specific jurisdiction in most of the Länder. In North Rhine-Westphalia,  however, Cologne regional court has a criminal division with special jurisdiction on account of  the Central Cybercrime Unit and Contact Point located at Cologne Public Prosecution office’  (Council of the European Union, 2017a, p. 28). Indeed, as was also highlighted during one of  the interviews conducted, ‘Certain major courts have created special chambers with judges  specifically trained in cybercrime cases (example of Chamber in the High Regional Court of  Cologne).’ For more information on this point see (Landgericht Köln, pp. 90, section 242,  subsections c) and d) ).  Germany cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.6.2. Synergies and potential interferences  As emerged from both the desk research and the interviews, there are several synergies  between the communities, and the Cyber-AZ plays an important role in bringing the  communities together and facilitating their synergies. For instance, as one of the interviewees  explained, the different agencies that are part of this centre (BSI, BKA, BW-KdoCIR, BBK,  BPOL, BfV, MAD and BND) have ‘a daily interaction and coordination on handling and treating  cases’. In addition, the agencies involved collaborate in ‘producing situation reports to cover the  different aspects of an incident, from the perspective and within the limits of each agency’s  [competence]’.  As emerged from the interviews, ‘there is a daily flow of exchange of information [between  CSIRTs and LE] for ongoing investigations and in the framework of analysing projects and  indicating prevention measures.’ For instance, the BSI may ‘recover data and information from  suspected systems’, which could also be used to support LE investigations and ‘be presented in  Court as testimonies by BSI experts’.  As one of the interviewees explained, the current legal framework does not anticipate having  CSIRT personnel permanently assigned to prosecution authorities. Instead, according to the  German Code of Criminal Proceedings, the role that CSIRTs may play is either that of a witness  or that of an expert. The CSIRT community can help prosecution authorities when there is a  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  39  need for a qualified technical expert. Indeed, ‘Even if the CSIRTs contacted do not have the  specific qualified technical experts within their team, they can still support the prosecution  authorities as they have many links in the technical community.’ Moreover, CSIRTs can provide  support to prosecution authorities by reaching out to civil organisations and non-governmental  organisations, as they are in a better position to perform this task.  As one of the interviewees highlighted, ‘The major field of interference during an investigation  [between the different communities] is how to deal with the incident. The prosecution service  aims at gathering proper judicial evidence, while the CSIRTs aim at dealing with the incident  and fixing the issue. From the prosecutor’s perspective, gathering evidence takes much longer  time than the CSIRTs would want. In any major case the usual discussion is what can be done  to gather evidence and close the collection process as soon as possible in order to proceed with  the CSIRT activity of unlocking the system.’  2.6.3. Examples of training  The BKA has developed various national training programmes on cybercrime, including in the  field of information and communication technology (ICT) forensics. The BKA is also responsible  for training experts in the Federation and the Länder. As part of this training, it is possible to  specialise in specific operating systems, networks/internet, mobile forensics and cryptology. The  BKA also organises an internal basic training course on cybercrime once a year (Council of the  European Union, 2017a).  Courses on cybercrime are offered at all levels, from basic to advanced/specialised, for all  police officers and court experts in Germany.  The German Judicial Academy (Deutsche Richterakademie) also offers further training on  criminal law and the internet on an annual basis and organises conferences and training on  criminal law, forensics, criminal proceedings and investigative measures for judges and public  prosecutors who are involved in combating internet crime (German Judicial Academy, n.d.).  The Brandenburg Judicial Academy (Justizakademie des Landes Brandenburg) organises  regular training sessions for senior judiciary who handle cybercrime cases (Brandenburg  Judicial Academy, n.d.). In addition, at a local level, training is organised (e.g. by the Joint  Judicial Examination Office of the Länder of Berlin and Brandenburg) on combating cybercrime,  including topics such as preservation of computer evidence, data network investigations,  including a cross-border dimension, the challenges presented by big data and data protection- related issues.  At the Länder level, various training initiatives are offered for LE officers and prosecutors, such  as in North Rhine-Westphalia, which organises ‘a joint training programme for specialists from  the Land police force and public prosecutors’. However, practices such as working meetings  and exchange of information are more common between the Police and the public prosecutor’s  offices on different aspects of combating cybercrime (Council of the European Union, 2017a).  As emerged from the interviews, joint training takes place between the CSIRTs and LE, and, in  particular, the Quick Reaction Force (QRF), with judiciary representatives also invited to  participate in this training as observers.  As an interviewee explained, ‘In a joint exercise/practical training on critical infrastructures,  which was held with the support of a private company, a representative from the prosecution  office was invited to actively participate and the prosecutor was then on call during the real-life  scenario.’ As another interviewee underlined, ‘The judges are usually not involved in such joint  trainings, also due to [their] obligation to remain neutral/impartial (e.g. there could be a conflict if  a training is organised by a private entity or an exercise hosted in a company’s premises).’  AN EXAMPLE  OF  FACILITATING  SYNERGIES  The Nationales  Cyber- Abwehrzentrum  (National Cyber  Response Centre)  plays an important  role in bringing the  communities  together and  facilitating their  synergies.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  40  In addition, it should be noted that, as stated by one of the interviewees, the ‘Prosecution team  has the responsibility for providing State justice academy trainings to LE officials. Regarding the  CSIRT community, prosecutors actively engage in seminars and training sessions also involving  the BSI. Through these, they are trying to share the information by inviting CSIRT experts in  such events or participating respectively in trainings of the CSIRT community.’  However, what emerged from the interviews is that CSIRTs and LE work closely together on a  daily basis and that they ‘have managed to learn from each other and understand each entity’s  role and actions’. Since CSIRTs and the judiciary – because of their mandates and the legal  framework – do not have many opportunities to work so closely together, the judiciary could  ‘benefit greatly’ if the CSIRT community could provide training for prosecutor and judges to  further improve their technical skills.  2.7.  IRELAND  Ireland is ‘a parliamentary republic consisting of 26 counties. The head of government, the  prime minister [(Taoiseach]), is appointed by the President after nomination by the Lower House  (Dail) and exercises executive power. The head of state, the President, mostly has ceremonial  powers. The Parliament has 2 chambers (an Upper and Lower House)’ (European Union, n.d.r).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Ireland is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Irish legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  The current National Cyber Security Strategy was published in 2019 and covers the period  2019-2024. In terms of cybercrime, the strategy foresees supporting ‘international cooperation  to combat cybercrime and promote formal and informal cooperation in cyberspace, including by  engaging in sustainable capacity building in third countries’ (Department of Justice and Equality,  2020).  Ireland signed the Budapest Convention in 2002 and it is working towards its ratification  (Department of Justice and Equality, 2020, p. 4).  Ireland adopted the legislation transposing the NIS directive (Statutory Instrument No. 360 of  2018) in 2018 (NCSC, n.d.b).  2.7.1.  Roles and duties  In Ireland, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related to  preventing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  National Cyber Security Centre National Cyber Security Centre NCSC  - CSIRT-IE CSIRT-IE CSIRT-IE  National Police An Garda Siochana  Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau  Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau GNCCB  Director of Public Prosecutions Director of Public Prosecutions DPP  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  41  2.7.1.1. National cybersecurity agency  The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) of Ireland is the primary State cybersecurity  authority (NCSC, n.d.b). It primarily focuses on securing government networks and securing  critical national infrastructure. The Irish national and governmental CSIRT (CSIRT-IE) is part of  the NCSC.  Since 2017, the NCSC ‘has developed an extensive threat intelligence database that is used to  assist [government] Agencies and Departments in protecting their networks’ against high-end  threats actors/cybercriminals (Government of Ireland, 2019).  The constituent base of the NCSC is around one hundred thirty members. This base includes  government departments and agencies, and key entities across the financial sector, critical  national infrastructure providers and other operators of essential services (OES). NCSC’s  constituency, which includes An Garda Siochana, the national Police, receive (email and text)  alerts and advisory services as necessary.  In case of cybercrime, the NCSC provides incident response and technical analysis (it has  specific expertise in infrastructure tracking and malware analysis).  The experts interviewed explained that there are secondment opportunities between the Garda  National Cyber Crime Bureau and the NCSC.  2.7.1.2. CSIRTs  Established in 2011, CSIRT-IE is a body within the NCSC which provides assistance to the  NCSC’s constituents in responding to cybersecurity incidents at national level (NCSC, n.d.a).  CSIRT-IE's responsibilities include:  • ‘Monitoring incidents at national level;  • Providing early warning, alerts, announcements and dissemination of information to  relevant stakeholders about risks and incidents;  • Responding to incidents;  • Providing dynamic risk and incident analysis and situational awareness’ (NCSC, n.d.a).  In 2017, CSIRT-IE set up an integrated incident response and analytics platform. Today,  CSIRT-IE has a more ‘proactive position’, thanks to ‘the deployment and use of MISPs  (Malware Information Sharing Platforms) to share threat intelligence directly with Critical  National Infrastructure Providers, and the evolution and use of a series of tools to identify, parse  and analyse open source intelligence (OSINT). CSIRT-IE ‘has also developed, tested and  deployed the ‘Sensor’ platform, now operational on the infrastructure of a number of  Government Departments, to detect and warn of certain types of threat’ (Government of Ireland,  2019).  According to one interviewee, the CSIRT could be called to court to testify in a cybercrime case,  as it is possible to summon anyone as a witness.  CSIRT-IE is a member of the CSIRTs Network.  2.7.1.3. LE  Investigation of crime is the exclusive jurisdiction of An Garda Siochana (national Police),  however the police can receive advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions, which is an  independent entity.  The Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau (GNCCB) was established as the Cyber Crime  Investigation Unit of An Garda Siochana in 1991, and re-established as the Garda National  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  42  Cyber Crime Bureau in 2017. It is ‘tasked with the forensic examination of computer media  seized during the course of any criminal investigation. […] The unit also conducts investigations  into cyber dependent crime which are significant or complex in nature such as network  intrusions, data interference and attacks on websites belonging to government departments,  institutions and corporate entities’ (GNCCB, n.d.). One interviewee underlined that since there  are elements of digital forensics in the majority of investigations, it represents the largest part of  the GNCCB’s activities.  Two pilot regional cyber units were set up in 2017 (Council of the European Union, 2017e).  As  explained during the interviewees, there are currently four of these “satellite hubs” established  throughout the country. Two more are planned to be set up in the near future. For the moment,  they have a small number of staff, therefore the capacity to handle only a limited number of  operations.  As mentioned above, there are secondment opportunities between the GNCCB and the NCSC.  2.7.1.4. Judiciary  Under Ireland’s common law system, the Director of the Public Prosecutions (DPP) has no  investigative functions and no power to direct An Garda Siochana in their investigations (DPP,  n.d.) (Department of Justice and Equality, 2020). Once the investigation is complete, the DPP  considers the file and directs the prosecution.  However, the DPP can advise An Garda Siochana during the investigation as well as provide  guidance in case of complex prosecutions, while remaining independent. There are no  investigation judges in Ireland.  There is no court, prosecution office or judge exclusively specialised in cybercrime (Council of  the European Union, 2017e), however some prosecutors are specialised in cybercrime matters,  although they also deal with other types of crime.  Ireland cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.7.2. Synergies and potential interferences  Synergies exist as the CSIRT, LE and the judiciary have complementary roles and duties. In  case of a cybercrime, LE is in charge of the investigation, while the CSIRT is in charge of  incident response and technical analysis. It provides specific expertise in infrastructure tracking  and malware analysis. The Judiciary is responsible for the prosecution and trial.  The experts interviewed highlighted that a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is currently  being developed between the CSIRT and LE to provide a framework of cooperation.  As explained during the interviews, LE is in discussion with the Director of Public Prosecutions  (DPP) to set up a training programme on cybercrime to share knowledge on the subject and  understanding of each other’s work. The same initiative has been proposed to judges.  One interviewee however underlined that the roles of each community and the processes could  be better defined, as ‘there is not enough legal definition to accurately articulate [these] roles’.  As highlighted during the interviews, the three communities sometimes have different priorities,  especially the CSIRT and LE. The CSIRT’s priority is to protect victims, while LE’s is to identify  and find the criminal. This can lead to interferences in their work.  Understanding technical language can be challenging for the Judiciary. In 2011, during the  investigation of the hacking of an Irish political party’s website by Anonymous, the DPP asked  the Cybercrime Bureau to add a glossary of cyber terms at the back of each report and  statement. This allows the DPP to better understand technical terms while working on the case.  A MOSTLY  BILATERAL  COOPERATION  Synergies are mostly  bilateral (CSIRT-LE  and LE-judiciary).  The three  communities actively  work at overcoming  challenges that could  potentially impact  their cooperation,  especially thanks to  trainings and  exercises.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  43  2.7.3. Examples of training  The ECTEG (European Cybercrime Training and Education Group) and the Irish UCD Centre  for Cybersecurity and Cybercrime Investigation (UCD-CCI) have developed a Digital First  Responders course which was provided to over two hundred police detectives in 2020. The  training was delivered by the GNCCB and the UCD-CCI. The course covered the following  topics: Online Investigation Techniques, Site Search Intelligence, Digital Forensic Challenges  Encryption, Digital Forensic Challenges Virtual Machines, Internet Security (VPN), Search and  Seizure Guidelines, How to deal with a live computer at search scene, Live data forensics using  “First”, Post Search Analysis, Live Data Forensic (First Tool) Practical, Final Assessment  (practical examination) (UCD-CCI, 2020).  Along with other European LEAs, An Garda Siochana contributes to the development of  CEPOL's \"First responders e-learning package\" (E-First), focusing on essential IT forensics and  IT crime knowledge. The aim is to provide a sound common reference for all LEA first  responders (non-specialised field police officers), as well as digital forensic courses to more  expert attendees (ECTEG, 2021).  In Ireland, judges and prosecutors attend national and international training events in the area  of cybercrime on an ad hoc basis. One interviewee underlined that a joint training between the  DPP and An Garda Siochana was organised a few years ago and that it was very useful. The  DPP is currently setting up more trainings with law enforcement.  Some trainings and exercises are organised between the CSIRT and LE, but according to an  interviewee the idea of having additional ones should be considered. Interviewees were  unaware of trainings organised between the CSIRT and the Judiciary.  2.8.  ITALY  Italy is ‘a parliamentary republic with a head of government - the prime minister - appointed by  the President, and a head of state - the President. The Parliament is composed of 2 houses: the  Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic. The country is subdivided into 20 regions.  5 of these have a special autonomous status, enabling them to pass legislation on some local  matters’ (European Union, n.d.h).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Italy is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Italian legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  A major national cybersecurity reform is currently ongoing in Italy, which includes the  establishment in June 2021 of the National Cybersecurity Agency (see below).  The latest Italian Cybersecurity Action Plan was published in 2017 (Presidency of the Council of  Ministers, 2017). It foresees the improvement of incident and cybercrime integrated response  capabilities, as well as new legislative initiatives to create technical intervention teams to quickly  support central administrations, operators of essential services and critical infrastructures in  case of major cyber events.  In Italy, the NIS Directive was implemented by Legislative Decree no. 65/2018 (Official Journal  of the Italian Republic, 2018).  Italy ratified the Budapest Convention in 2008.  2.8.1.  Roles and duties  In Italy, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related to  preventing and fighting cybercrime.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  44  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  National Cybersecurity Agency Agenzia per la cybersicurezza nazionale  - Cybersecurity Unit (to be set up) Nucleo per la cybersicurezza  - Computer Emergency Response  Team Italy CSIRT Italia CSIRT Italia  State Police  Polizia di Stato  - Post and Communications Police Polizia Postale e delle Comunicazioni  Financial Police  Guardia di Finanza  Carabinieri Corps  Arma dei Carabinieri  - National Anti-crime Computer Centre  for the Protection of Critical  Infrastructure  Centro Nazionale Anticrimine Informatico per  la Protezione delle Infrastrutture Critiche CNAIPIC  Public Prosecutor’s Office Procura della Repubblica  2.8.1.1. National cybersecurity agency  A major reform of national cybersecurity is currently ongoing in Italy. The legislative decree on  the establishment of the National Cybersecurity Agency was approved by the Italian Council  of Ministers on June 10th, 2021(18). It states that the new National Cybersecurity Agency will be  under the responsibility of the president of the Council of Ministers and the Delegate Authority  for the Security of the Republic (Autorità delegata per la sicurezza della Repubblica). The  legislative decree was converted into a law on August 4th, 2021 (19), which entered into force on  August 5th, 2021 (Official Journal of the Italian Republic, 2021).  According to the decree, the Agency will, among other matters, be in charge of:  • Exercising the functions of national authority in the field of cybersecurity, to protect  national interests from cyberthreats and ensure the resilience of services and essential  functions of the State;  • Developing national capabilities for preventing, monitoring, detecting and mitigating,  and coping with cybersecurity incidents and cyberattacks, also thanks to CSIRT Italia;  • Contributing to the enhancement of the security of Information and communications  technology (ICT) systems of subjects included in the national cybersecurity perimeter,  public administrations, operators of essential services and digital service providers;  • Exercising the functions of single national interlocutor for public and private entities in  the field of security measures in the areas that fall under the scope of national  cybersecurity, and network and information systems security (NIS Directive);  • Representing Italy in the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre  (Senato della Repubblica, 2021).  18) Disposizioni urgenti in materia di cybersicurezza, definizione dell’architettura nazionale di cybersicurezza e istituzione  dell’Agenzia per la cybersicurezza nazionale (D.L. 82/2021 – A.C. 3161)  (19) https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2021/08/04/21G00122/sg  https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2021/08/04/21G00122/sg  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  45  A Cybersecurity Unit (Nucleo per la cybersicurezza) will be set up within the Agency and will  closely cooperate with CSIRT Italia. CSIRT Italia will communicate to this Cybersecurity Unit  any cases of breach or attempt to breach security, or loss of integrity which pose threats to the  proper functioning of the networks and services. The Cybersecurity Unit can also receive such  alerts from other CSIRTs established in Italy.  CSIRT Italia will also send incident notifications to the Cybersecurity Unit.  2.8.1.2. CSIRTs  CSIRT Italia was set up in 2019 under the responsibility of the Presidency of the Council of  Ministers. The legislative decree of June 10th, 2021 on the creation of the National  Cybersecurity Agency, will see CSIRT Italia become part of this Agency.  By the above-mentioned decree, CSIRT Italia will become the national and governmental  CSIRT as it will exercise the functions of the national and governmental CSIRT (Senato della  Repubblica, 2021). Before the adoption of the legislative decree on the establishment of the  National Cybersecurity Agency, the role of national CSIRT was undertaken by a department of  the Ministry for Economic Development, and the role of governmental CSIRT by CERT-PA  (within the Agency for digital Italy-AGID).  CSIRT Italia’s tasks are:  • Monitoring of incidents at the national level;  • Issuing early warnings, alerts, announcements and disclosure of information to  interested parties regarding risks and incidents;  • Intervention in case of an incident;  • Risk and incident analysis;  • Participation in the CSIRTs network.  The decree foresees that operators of essential services (OES) must notify CSIRT Italia  immediately in case of an incident having a significant impact on the continuity of the services  provided. CSIRT Italia must immediately forward the notifications to the Cybersecurity Unit of  the Agency and to the Post and Communications Police (Senato della Repubblica, 2021).  The decree underlines that incident notifications fall within the duties of CSIRT Italia and is part  of the reporting obligations established by Article 331 of the Criminal Procedure Code, on the  reporting by public officials and persons in charge of a public service (Senato della Repubblica,  2021).  CSIRT Italia is a member of the CSIRTs Network.  2.8.1.3. LE  By law (Interministerial Decree of 19 January 1999), the Post and Communications Police is  the ‘central body of the Ministry of the Interior responsible for the security of telecommunications  services’ in Italy (Polizia di Stato, n.d.). It is responsible for:  • Ensuring, at a general level, the integrity and functionality of the computer network,  including the protection of critical infrastructures, the prevention of, and fight against,  computer attacks on domestic strategic structures, and the security and regularity of  telecommunications services;  • The fight against online Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM);  • Intelligence activity for the prevention of, and fight against, the use and forgery of  means of payment (Post and Communications Police, n.d.).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  46  The Central Service of the Post and Communications Police is based in Rome and coordinates  twenty regional units and eighty local units. The local units are operational: they handle cases  and emergencies which arise from complaints made by citizens through the hotline of the Post  and Communications Police.  Within the Post and Communications Police, the Cybercrime Analysis Unit (Unità d'analisi del  crimine informatico - UACI) is in charge of studying and analysing cybercrime phenomena in  collaboration with major Italian universities.  Although ‘specialised investigative tasks are assigned by law to the Post and Communications  Police, [which is part of the State Police (Polizia di Stato, n.d.a)], other police forces […] [in  particular], Arma dei Carabinieri [ (Arma dei Carabinieri, n.d.)] and Guardia di Finanza [  (Guardia di Finanza, n.d.))] may as a rule conduct investigations into cybercrime’ (Council of  Europe, n.d.d).  The National Anti-crime Computer Centre for the Protection of Critical Infrastructure  (CNAIPIC) belongs to the Post and Communications Police. It is in charge of the prevention and  repression of cybercrime actions targeting critical infrastructures (Post and Communications  Police, n.d.a).  The CNAIPIC has an Operations Room, available 24/7, which acts as the single point of contact  for critical infrastructures and any other actors engaged in the protection of critical  infrastructures, including international actors.  Finally, Italy is part of Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol, n.d.c).  2.8.1.4. Judiciary  Under Law 48/2008 and the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Public Prosecutor’s Office,  ‘attached to the Court of the main city of a Court of Appeal District […] holds jurisdiction to  conduct the investigations into cybercrime’ (Council of Europe, n.d.d). There are prosecutors  specialised in cybercrime, but there are no specialised judges (Council of Europe, n.d.d).  Specifically in Milan, according to the Milan Prosecutor’s Office’s website, cybercrime was  tackled by the High Tech Crime unit of the Counter-terrorism Department from 2012 to 2018,  but currently falls under the competence of the Fraud and Consumer Protection Department,  made up of 7 prosecutors. The Public Prosecutor’s Office in Milan has also established a  cybercrime victim support bureau (Milan Prosecutor's Office, 2013) (Milan Prosecutor's Office,  2015) (Milan Prosecutor's Office, 2018).  Cybercrime prosecutors are in charge of supervising the investigation and leading the  prosecution of criminal offences. They cooperate with the Post and Telecommunications Police,  whose role is to investigate cybercrime. Other police forces can also investigate cybercrime  cases and cooperate with prosecutors, such as the Carabinieri and the Guardia di Finanza.  Italy cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.8.2. Synergies and potential interferences  In June 2021, the National Cybersecurity Agency was created by legislative decree and this  might change the way the three communities cooperate.  As also highlighted during the data collection via the interview, synergies are possible when  trust is established and each community ‘is aware of the other’s competences [and]  understands the other’s difficulties’. While no specific interferences with the CSIRT community  were experienced, it was highlighted that however some difficulties may arise in the cooperation  between the communities because their interests are sometimes different.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  47  A key challenge mentioned during the interview was the need for more cybercrime training of  the Judiciary: the Judiciary does receive training on cybercrime investigations, but not on a  regular basis, especially as cybercrime raises fundamentally new issues and challenges.  2.8.3. Examples of training  The Interagency Law Enforcement Academy of Advanced Studies (Scuola di Perfezionamento  per le Forze di Polizia) provides advanced training courses for police forces on \"Instruments to  prevent and counter cybercrime. Protection of National Critical Infrastructures\" and  \"International cooperation in the fight against terrorism, against cybercrime and in the field of  digital investigations\" (Interagency Law Enforcement Academy of Advanced Studies, 2020). In  addition, the programme of the second level crime analysis course includes one module on  open source analysis, covering topics such as: open source intelligence (OSINT), research  through the network, social networking and processing, deepweb and darkweb (Interagency  Law Enforcement Academy of Advanced Studies, 2020).  Along with other European LEAs, the Post and Communications Police contributes to the  development of CEPOL's \"First responders e-learning package\" (E-First), focusing on essential  IT forensics and IT crime knowledge. The aim is to provide a common sound reference for all  LEA first responders (non-specialised field police officers) as well as digital forensic courses to  more expert attendees (ECTEG, 2021).  The Public Prosecutor’s Office in Milan provides training courses. The teaching method,  developed by LE investigators, combines lectures, labs and workshops. The course is based on  the MOOC system as well as technical and didactic tutoring service, created specifically for all  the investigators of the Milan Court of Appeal District (Milan Prosecutor's Office, n.d.).  The expert interviewed was not aware of any joint training opportunities on cybersecurity  aspects. However, both LE and the Judiciary participate in training on digital forensics.  2.9.  LUXEMBOURG  Luxembourg ‘is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy (Grand Duchy) with a head of  government, the prime minister, and a head of state, the Grand Duke. The country is divided  into 4 […] regions, 12 […] cantons and 105 communes’ (European Union, n.d.i).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Luxembourg is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Luxembourg legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Luxembourg adopted its NCSS in 2018 for the period 2018–2020 (ENISA, n.d.g). The fourth  version is planned to be published in 2021(20). In parallel, in February 2021, the ministry of  Foreign and European Affaires’ Directorate of Defence published the first Cyber Defence  Strategy, which covers a 10-years period.  Luxembourg ratified the Budapest Convention in 2004.  2.9.1. Roles and duties  In Luxembourg, the following authorities and departments, in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.  (20) Not available at the cut-off date of the data collection. The cut-off date for data collection was 3rd August 2021;  however, some additional input received between August and October 2021 was also integrated in this report  RECENT  CREATION OF  THE NATIONAL  CYBERSECURI TY AGENCY  The creation of the  National  Cybersecurity  Agency in June 2021  might impact the way  the CSIRT, LE and  judiciary  communities  cooperate to fight  cybercrime.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  48  Name of the  authority/department in English  Name of the authority/department  in the original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  National Agency for the Security of  Information Systems  Agence nationale de la sécurité des  systèmes d’information ANSSI  CERT.LU  CERT.LU CERT.LU  Computer emergency response  team of the Government of the  Grand Duchy of Luxembourg  Équipe Gouvernementale de  Réponse aux Urgences  Informatiques  GOVCERT.LU  Computer Incident Response  Center Luxembourg  Computer Incident Response Center  Luxembourg CIRCL  National CERT Luxembourg National CERT Luxembourg NCERT.LU  Grand-Ducal Police Police Grand-Ducale  High Commission for National  Protection  Haut-Commissariat à la Protection  Nationale HCPN  Public Prosecution and Judges  Ministère de la Justice  2.9.1.1. National cyber security agency  The National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (Agence nationale de la  sécurité des systèmes d’information – ANSSI) is part of the High Commission for National  Protection (Haut-Commisariat à la Protection nationale – HCPN) and is responsible for  establishing information security policies and guidelines on non-classified information within the  Luxembourg state bodies (ministries, state departments and administrations). ANSSI assists  these bodies with risk analysis in the domain of information security, in order to help build up a  culture of risk-based governance within the Luxembourg state, as required by the general  information security policy. Furthermore, ANSSI is in charge of promoting information security  awareness and may advise the Luxembourg state’s training institute on training programmes in  the domain of information security.  2.9.1.2. CSIRTs  National CERT Luxembourg (NCERT.LU), the CERT of the Government of the Grand Duchy of  Luxembourg (Équipe gouvernementale de réponse aux urgences informatiques –  GOVCERT.LU) and the Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg (CIRCL) are the  main actors responsible for the detection of and response to incidents.  NCERT.LU, run by GOVCERT.LU, is the national CSIRT (GOVCERT.LU, n.d.b). NCERT.LU  gathers and disseminates information about security incidents that affect information and  communication systems in Luxembourg. It also serves as interlocutor for natural and legal  persons, entities and bodies, both national and international. Once it has received information,  NCERT.LU must convey it to the CERTs in charge of the affected victim’s sector or, if no  sectorial CERT exists, directly to the victim. NCERT.LU also advises about the specific points of  contact according to the targeted sector.  CERT.LU, run by SECURITYMADEIN.LU, is the Cyber Emergency Response Community  Luxembourg (CERT.LU, n.d.). It is an initiative to enhance collaboration between public and  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  49  private CERTs in Luxembourg. The objective is to create a community of all of the major actors  for sharing expertise.  GOVCERT.LU, the governmental CSIRT, ‘is the single point of contact dedicated to the  treatment of all computer related incidents jeopardising the information systems of the  government and defined critical infrastructure operators, whether they are public or private’  (GOVCERT.LU, n.d.). The services provided by GOVCERT.LU include incident handling,  coordination and resolution, and also proactive services such as notification of malware and  vulnerabilities, as well as compromised (infected) systems, among others. ‘The Constituency of  GOVCERT.LU “includes and is limited to:  • The ministries, administrations and public services of the Government of Luxembourg  including military organisations, and  • critical infrastructure operators’ (GOVCERT.LU, n.d.a)  CIRCL ‘is a government-driven initiative designed to gather, review, report and respond to  computer security threats and incidents’ (CIRCL.LU, n.d.). ‘CIRCL is the CERT for the private  sector, communes and non-governmental entities for the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg’  (CIRCL.LU, n.d. b).  CIRCL provides incident response capacities and remediation to national ICT users. It also  takes a coordinator’s role during incidents involving multiple actors, both national and  international. It is also charged with collecting information about incidents to enhance future  responses. CIRCL also handles vulnerability management and disclosure and incident  response training (CIRCL, 2020).  CIRCL has created a large number of tools applicable to forensics, incident responses, network  analysis, dark web monitoring and threat intelligence. The most successful of these tools is  MISP (Open Source Threat Intelligence Platform & Open Standards For Threat Information  Sharing), which is a threat intelligence database with very large information-sharing capabilities.  It is used by more than 6000 entities worldwide and is becoming a de facto standard in the  CSIRT community.  CIRCL already has a strong LE cooperation culture through frequent informal exchanges and  training programmes, such as the Horizon 2020 ENFORCE project and the NEOLEA initiative  (CIRCL.LU, n.d. a).  The HCPN is a coordinating mechanism for responding to serious cyberattacks (HCPN, n.d.). It  also includes a Cybernetic Risk Evaluation Cell (Cellule d’Evaluation du Risque Cybernétique)  known as CERC (The Luxembourg Government, 2018).  2.9.1.3. LE  The Grand-Ducal Police (Police Grand-Ducale, n.d.) is the primary LEA in Luxembourg.  The Directorate of the Judicial Police Service (SPJ) ‘is responsible, inter alia, for the  Coordination of judicial activities at the national and international level. It is also responsible for  defining and managing, in collaboration with the judicial authorities, judicial investigations.’  Within the SPJ the Department of Property Crime has a section on cybercrime (OSCE, n.d.a).  The SPJ is composed of two units:  • Cybercrime Unit. This unit deals with pure cybercrime mainly against ICT systems. It  handles felonies such as data theft, modification and erasure, as well as cyberbullying  and property scam. It is the international point of contact for Europol, Interpol and 24/7  networks.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  50  • High Tech Analysis Unit. This unit provides forensic support to other police units. It  handles lawful evidence collection, interception management and maintenance for  audio/video special equipment.  To prevent and combat cybercrime, LE in Luxembourg cooperates with the following authorities:  • Principal Public Prosecutor’s Office (mutual legal assistance);  • Public Prosecutor (investigation and prosecution)/Parquet général;  • Office of the Examining Magistrate (preparatory enquiries and enforcement action);  • Financial Intelligence Unit (financial crime using new technologies);  • criminal courts.  2.9.1.4. Judiciary  The judicial system of Luxembourg is ‘divided into a judicial branch’, including the criminal  courts, ‘and an administrative branch’ (European Union, n.d.e).  Some magistrates from the Public Prosecutor’s Office and a magistrate at the level of the  Financial Intelligence Unit are responsible, among other duties, for cybercrime cases.  Luxembourg also cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.9.2. Synergies and potential interferences  The different communities in Luxembourg have a strong tradition of cooperation and  collaboration. The CSIRT/LE and Judiciary cybercrime working group brings together national  authorities (Public Prosecutor’s Office, LE and CSIRTs) to exchange information regularly, for  instance on their interactions with service providers.  The Police rely on mutual legal assistance instruments and the direct exchange of information  with Europol and Interpol, but also on the voluntary sharing of information by communication  service providers.  An interesting case of synergies was mentioned during the interviews. This was a case ‘where  the LE performed a significant data interception, that CSIRTs were not allowed to do but  onwards CSIRTs supported in analysing this data package. Similarly, [synergies are achieved]  in cases of seizing of equipment performed by the LE, later on, analysed with the support of  CSIRTs.’  An example of synergies in developing training was also provided during the interviews, in the  context of the ENFORCE project (CIRCL.LU, n.d. a) during the training, CSIRT technologies  were shown and feedback from the LE received and improvements in tools.  CSIRTs (such as CIRCL) can provide technical pre-investigation and investigation support  before LE intervention. They also support requests from the Judiciary and other LEAs for  technical assistance.  Information sharing is carried out automatically using MISP, using sharing groups to implement  information sharing rules. Specific information regarding financial fraud is shared with the  Judiciary.  Main synergies occur through cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs. LEAs have legal tools to  enable data acquisition by seizing and intercepting servers. Other synergies can be handled  during training (see below). There is a memorandum of understanding between CSIRTs and  LE.  TRADITION OF  ACHIEVING  SYNERGIES  The different  communities in  Luxembourg have a  strong tradition of  cooperation and  collaboration.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  51  Potential interferences can occur when LEAs and CSIRTs come into conflicts. LEAs may disturb  CSIRT monitoring operations when seizing a piece of infrastructure studied by CSIRTs.  Outside the EU, the use of Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) can cause extensive delays  and impede cooperation.  Another challenge is the discrepancy in data-handling capacities. CSIRTs generate a lot of  data, for example in the field of child abuse. Since LEAs works on a case-by-case model, they  cannot handle large numbers of data without predefined agreements.  The final challenge is to improve evidence handling by MISP: large data sets need to be  handled in such a way as to preserve the chain of custody.  One way to improve synergies would be to share information in real time. This is legally  challenging but would be more profitable for all entities.  2.9.3. Examples of training  ‘Law enforcement officers are trained at the Police school of the Grand-Ducal Police. […]. In  addition, the Police school is responsible for managing the continuing education of the  personnel of the Grand-Ducal Police’ At the Police School, cybercrime is covered during basic  training and professional development for police officers and investigators (OSCE, n.d.a).  To increase opportunities to provide specialised training to IT forensic experts and investigators  working on cybercrime cases, the SPJ arranges training in coordination with neighbouring  police agencies. It is also common practice for personnel attending external training to pass on  their knowledge to others by organising internal training sessions.  Luxembourg ‘does not have a specific institution or school for the training of its judges and  prosecutors, [therefore,] the Ministry of Justice has reached an agreement with the French  Ecole Nationale de la Magistrature and the German Judicial Academy’ (Deutschen  Richterakademie) (EJTN, n.d.).  In addition, the New Technologies Section of the SPJ provides training for judges, especially on  new tools and methods used by cybercriminals (darknet, bitcoin, etc.).  In the interviews, further examples of training were discussed. For example, when customers  share their issues and needs in the field of cybercrime, this helps CSIRTs understand the  requirements of cybercrime investigations. Further, the Prosecutor’s Office also provides  training related to the four ways of filing a complaint for a CSIRT’s constituency.  As emerged from the interviews, ‘There is a set of training that is already provided by CSIRTs to  LE, i.e. for OSINT [open-source intelligence], cryptographic keys ([…] published under the  ENFORCE project) and forensic tools, including forensics acquisition. There are cases of  prosecutors and judges that joint such trainings, as they had a demonstrated interest in the field’  LE and CSIRTs also participate in training exercises provided by the ENFORCE Project. The  ENFORCE project is a ‘European project co-funded by the European Commission in the  framework of the Internal Security Fund – Police. […]. The ENFORCE project aims at designing,  setting-up, and disseminating a cybercrime training curriculum at the European level. This  curriculum will be validated during a training exercise allowing different European public (e.g.  law enforcement agencies and CSIRTs) and private actors fighting cybercrime to train together  using state-of-the-art training technology’. CEIS, the coordinator of the ENFORCE Project, also  co-organizes a cybercrime training with the Luxembourgian CIRCL and the French National  Police” (CEIS, n.d.). This training material specifically addresses aspects of cooperation.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  52  According to the data collected during the interviews, CSIRTs have received training from the  Customs Authority. This was in the form of a workshop, where the Customs Authority shared  concerns related to cybercrime and was able to discuss how CSIRTs can help (e.g. when  seizing equipment at the borders and how this should be handled before being submitted for  analysis  2.10. NORWAY  Norway is a constitutional monarchy and a member country of EFTA and a signatory to the  European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement (EFTA, n.d.a), (EFTA, n.d.).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Norway is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Norwegian legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Norway adopted a new NCSS in 2019; this is the fourth edition of the NCSS, with the first  strategy published in 2003 (ENISA, n.d.i) (Norwegian Ministeries, n.d.).  Norway ratified the Budapest Convention in 2006.  2.10.1. Roles and duties  In Norway, the following authorities and departments, in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.

National cyber security agency  The Ministry of Justice and Public Security is primarily the responsible authority for network and  information security in Norway. The Norwegian National Security Authority (Nasjonal  sikkerhetsmyndighet – NSM) is the national organisation focusing on cybersecurity in the  country. Under the NSM, organisations run different functions related to cybersecurity and  cybercrime, such as the Norwegian CERT (NorCERT) and the Norwegian National Cyber  Security Centre (Nasjonalt cybersikkerhetssenter – NCSC) (NSM, n.d.).  In addition, the NSM established partnerships with other entities such as the Norwegian Centre  for Information Security (NorSiS), an independent organisation (established in 2002 as a project  and founded in 2010 by governmental request, who collect and disseminate cybersecurity  knowledge among Norwegian companies, local government and individuals. Among its  activities, NorSIS coordinates, on behalf of the Ministry of Justice, the National Security Month,  the pan-European exercise to protect EU infrastructure against coordinated cyber attacks.  2.10.1.2. CSIRTs  Norway has an officially recognised national and governmental CSIRT (NSM, n.d.). The NSM is  responsible for NorCERT, which handles severe cyberattacks against critical infrastructures and  information.  The main activities of NorCERT are ‘response to cyber threats in [… the NorCERT] technical  threat operation centre 24/7; operate and organise a national sensor network on the internet to  detect data breaches in critical infrastructure across sectors; reverse engineering, forensics,  network analysis and counterintelligence’ (NCSC, n.d.).  In addition, Norway has different sectorial CSIRTs, such as:  • HelseCERT, which supports the Norwegian healthcare sector (HelseCERT, n.d.)  • UNINETT CERT, of the UNINETT ‘ICT infrastructure company in Norway’ (UNINETT,  n.d.) (UNINETT , n.d a).  • UiO-CERT, the University of Oslo’s CSIRT (UiO-CERT, n.d.).  2.10.1.3. LE  The Norwegian Police Security Service (Politiets sikkerhetstjeneste – PST) is the national  security service of Norway. The activities of the PST are assigned by the Police Act and it  reports directly to the Ministry of Justice and Public Security.  The main aim of the National Criminal Investigation Service (Den nasjonale enhet for  bekjempelse av organisert og annen alvorlig kriminalitet – Kripos) is to prevent and combat  serious organised crime. Its main functions are criminal investigations, forensic investigations,  gathering criminal intelligence and undertaking international police cooperation (Politiet, n.d.).  The National Cybercrime Centre (NC3), set up in January 2019, falls under Kripos. The main  activities of NC3 fall under the following areas: cybercrime investigations, digital forensics,  internet investigations and internet crimes against children (Politiet, n.d. a). The NC3 provides  assistance to the police district, conducts its own cybercrime investigations while developing  national Police’s cyber expertise. It aims to become \"the national centre of expertise and  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  54  knowledge in terms of technology-related policing, with about 150 employees\" (Politiet, n.d. a)  by the end of 2022. The NC3 is structured around 6 sections (incoming request, online police  presence, Internet crimes against children, cybercrime, digital forensics, investigative support)  and 3 underlying units (Intelligence, technique development, digital support). Within Kripos there  is also a high-tech crime division that acts as a 24/7 point of contact.  The National Police Directorate is the highest police authority in Norway and ‘falls under the  Ministry of Justice and Public Security’. The National Police Directorate supports police bodies  and special units and provides expertise (Politiet, n.d.c).  As emerged from one of the interviews conducted, in relation to cybercrime, the role of the  national Police in Norway, in particular Kripos, is prevention and investigation and intelligence  gathering. For LEAs in Norway, fighting cybercrime is no different from fighting other crimes.  Prosecutors are integrated into LEAs, sharing the same offices with LE personnel; hence, there  is a seamless exchange of information and close cooperation between the two. On the legal  framework side a specific Police Act allows Police to share information with the national CERT  to prevent criminal activities.  Finally, Norway is part of the Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol,  n.d.c).  2.10.1.4. Judiciary  The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority (Påtalemyndigheten) is the competent authority for legal  prosecutions in Norway. It handles investigations and prosecutions of criminal cases.  The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority is divided into the following levels:  • the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP);  • the Regional Public Prosecution Offices (PPO);  • the Prosecuting Authority in the Police (Higher Prosecuting Authority, n.d.)  The National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime  (Den sentrale enhet for etterforsking og påtale av økonomisk kriminalitet og miljøkriminalitet –  Økokrim) provides services as a police unit but also as a prosecution authority with specific  expertise in computer crime and fraud (Økokrim, n.d.).  In Norwegian judicial system, the supreme court ‘is the highest court in Norway […] and has an  authority in all areas of the law’ (Domstol, n.d.). Judicial cooperation in criminal matters with EU  Member States is based on the principles of mutual recognition and direct contact between the  judicial authorities.  Norway also cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.10.2. Synergies and potential interferences  As mentioned above, Økokrim, because of its dual nature as a police unit and a prosecution  authority, cooperates with a number of other authorities, such as surveillance authorities, the  business sector, in combating economic and environmental crime.  In addition, the Joint Cyber Coordination Centre (Felles cyberkoordineringssenter – FCKS) is a  key collaborative hub that consists of representatives from the NSM, the Norwegian Intelligence  Service, the PST and Kripos. The FCKS is also coordinated by the NSM (FCKS, n.d.).  ESTABLISHED  SYNERGIES  Through the Joint  Cyber Coordination  Centre, prosecutors  hold monthly  meetings with the  legal officers of the  CERT communities.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  55  NC3 cooperates closely with public and private security entities in Norway and abroad,  especially regarding the exchange of information (Politiet, n.d.b). Cooperation mechanisms  have also been established between LE and NorCERT.  The interviews showed that a lot of synergies are established in tactical operations and at  strategic levels. There are cases of LEAs and national CERTs attending crime scenes together  and conducting investigations together, to complement each other’s capabilities. For instance, if  information is discovered by LE that is deemed important for a national CERT, this information  is passed on to the CERT. Joint reports are prepared and submitted to the government in the  field of cybercrime, including on risks. Another example is LEAs and CERTs discussing and  analysing the issues together. Through the Joint Cyber Coordination Centre, prosecutors hold  monthly meetings with the legal officers of the CERT communities.  However, as emerged in the interviews, there are also potential interferences. In one example, in  the early stages of cooperation the national CERT found a command and control (CC) server  abroad and passed the information to the hosting country. The hosting country could have  decided to shut down the server, which may have been problematic for the LEA and its operational  plan.  2.10.3. Examples of training  The Norwegian Police University College (Politihøgskolen – (NPUC) ‘is the central educational  institution for the police service in Norway. Basic training for police officers is a three-year  university college education aimed at providing a broad practical and theoretical foundation’.  The college provides education in areas such as ‘policing, crime investigation and prevention,  and prosecution and administrative responsibilities’ (OSCE, n.d.b.).  The college also provides training in areas such as:  • international civil crisis management;  • Schengen Border and Immigration Service;  • Nordic Baltic Police Academy (NPUC, n.d.) (OSCE, n.d.b.).  The NPUC is also a member of the European Cybercrime Training and Education Group  (ECTEG) (ECTEG, n.d. a).  The Norwegian Center for Cyber and Information Security (CCIS) develops cybersecurity  competences for Norwegian agencies, companies and academia, for example by organising a  Security Hackathon and workshops. It is supported by the Ministry of Justice and Public  Security and members of its board of directors come from authorities such as the NSM, the  Police Directorate and the NPUC, among others (CCIS, n.d.).  From the data collected in the interviews, it emerged that the different communities (CSIRTs, LE  and Judiciary) participate in shared exercises with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO), as well as other national exercises held by private partners. LEAs also participate in  such training activities along with the private sector, mostly in the telecoms field.  NC3 organises training for LEAs as well as prosecutors.  2.11. POLAND  Poland is ‘a parliamentary republic with a head of government - the prime minister - and a head  of state - the president. The government structure is centred on the council of ministers. The  country is divided into 16 provinces, largely based on the country’s historic regions.  Administrative authority at provincial level is shared between a government-appointed governor,  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  56  an elected regional assembly and an executive elected by the regional assembly’ (European  Union, n.d.s).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Poland is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Polish legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  The current NCSS is the Cybersecurity strategy of the Republic of Poland for 2019-2024  (NASK, 2019). The Strategy highlights the necessity of cross-border cooperation of LEAs and  CSIRTs and that, as time is a critical factor in procedural actions and operational investigations,  efficient and reliable information-sharing channels between LEAs of different countries are  required.  The NIS Directive was fully implemented in Poland on 21 November 2018, when the Regulation  on serious incidents thresholds applicable to operators of essential services (Dz.U. 2018 poz.  2180) was published. The implementation of the directive began when Poland adopted the Act  on the National Cybersecurity System (Dz.U.2018.1560) on 5 July 2018 (Polish Parliament,  2018).  In 2015, the National Security Bureau (BBN) published the Polish Cybersecurity Doctrine  (National Security Bureau, 2015).  Poland ratified the Budapest Convention in 2015.  2.11.1. Roles and duties  In Poland, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related to  preventing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  Internal Security Agency  Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego  - Governmental Computer Security  Incident Response Team  Zespół Reagowania na Incydenty  Bezpieczeństwa Komputerowego CSIRT-GOV  CSIRT NASK CSIRT NASK CSIRT NASK  - CERT Poland CERT Polska CERT Polska  National Police Headquarters Komenda Główna Policji  - Cybercrime Bureau Biuro do Walki z Cyberprzestępczością  Central Forensic Laboratory of the Police Centralne Laboratorium Kryminalistycznego  Policji CLKP  General Public Prosecutor's Office Prokuratura Krajowa  2.11.1.1. National cybersecurity agency  Poland does not have a dedicated cybersecurity agency. Two entities deal with cybersecurity at  governmental and national levels.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  57  The Internal Security Agency (Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego) ‘is a government  institution which protects the internal security of the Republic of Poland and its citizens’ (Internal  Security Agency, n.d.). It tackles crimes such as ‘terrorism, espionage, breach of State secrets,  […] crimes connected with production of and trade in goods, technologies and services of  strategic importance for the State’s security, illegal production and possession of and trade in  arms’, etc. (Internal Security Agency, n.d.). The Internal Security Agency operates CSIRT-GOV,  the Polish governmental CSIRT.  The NASK is a national research institute (see below) under the supervision of the Chancellery  of the Polish Prime Minister. It operates the Polish national CSIRT.  2.11.1.2. CSIRTs  The Act on the national security system, which implements the NIS Directive into the Polish  legal system, appoints three institutions to serve as response teams (NASK, n.d.):  • The Internal Security Agency, via CSIRT-GOV;  • The NASK (Research and Academic Computer Network - Naukowa i Akademicka  Sieć Komputerowa), via CSIRT NASK;  • The Ministry of National Defence, via CSIRT-MON (which is not described here as  from the data collected did not emerged that it plays a role in the cooperation between  CSIRTs and LE in fighting cybercrime).  The Polish national CSIRT, CSIRT NASK, operates in accordance with the Act on the national  security system. It is responsible for handling incidents from the public and private sectors, local  governments and other entities which are not part of the central government or of a critical  infrastructure (NASK, n.d.). CSIRT NASK can be called to court as an expert witness for  cybercrime cases. According to one of the interviewees, CSIRT NASK is often appointed as an  expert witness by judges. Its testimonies are provided in the form of written reports. By law, it  could be called to court physically, however in practice, this is very rare.  Additionally, as NASK is a national research institute, it conducts research and develops  capabilities and tools for efficient monitoring and handling of security incidents. For example,  CSIRT NASK maintains the “Warning List” (CERT.PL, 2020), a service which provides a  frequently updated list of dangerous/malicious domains. Many Internet service providers,  including telecom operators, use this tool so the Internet users receive a warning message  when trying to access a domain used for phishing or malware distribution. CSIRT NASK also  maintains and develops MWDB (CERT.PL), a Malware Analysis Platform, Database and  Community, to which cybersecurity professionals can request access.  CSIRT NASK can also provide advice to LE, such as on the data which might be useful for an  investigation and the actions which should be taken or procedures which should be followed to  gather more information.  CERT Poland operates within CSIRT NASK. It was established in 1996 as the first Polish  CERT. Active 24/7, it coordinates responses to incidents occurring in the Polish civilian  cyberspace reported by OES, digital service providers, local authorities and individuals. It also  monitors online threats and carries out expert and forensic computer analyses, using its  analytical and R&D facilities to identify malware and vulnerabilities, assessing and measuring  the scale of threats and mitigating them (CERT Polska, n.d.) (Trusted Introducer, n.d.).  CERT Poland is a member of the CSIRTs Network.  A team called “Dyżurnet.pl” also operates within CSIRT NASK. The Dyżurnet.pl team is a point  of contact which ‘responds to anonymous reports received from Internet users about potentially  illegal material, mainly related to sexual abuse of children’ (NASK, n.d.a).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  58  CSIRT-GOV is under the responsibility of the Head of the Internal Security Agency. It acts as  the governmental CSIRT responsible for coordinating the process of responding to computer  incidents occurring in the area indicated in Art. 26 (7) of the Act of 5 July 2018 on the national  cybersecurity system (public administration bodies and critical infrastructures) (Polish  government, 2019) (CSIRT-GOV, n.d.).  2.11.1.3. LE  Established in 2016, the Cybercrime Bureau of the National Police Headquarters (Policja,  n.d.):  • Supervises, coordinates and supports activities aiming to combat cybercrime  conducted by the National Police Headquarters in cooperation with the Central Police  Investigation Bureau;  • Coordinates the activities of the Police in preventing and fighting cyberthreats;  • Cooperates with the Office for International Police Cooperation;  • Conducts and supports R&D projects on new solutions to fight cybercrime.  The Cybercrime Bureau is composed of the following departments:  • Intelligence Department;  • Operations Department;  • Forensics Department.  Investigations are conducted by the Operations Department of the Cybercrime Bureau.  The Cybercrime Bureau supervises cybercrime units in the field. There is a regional cybercrime  unit in each voivodeships (regions) of Poland.  The Central Forensic Laboratory of the Police is responsible for the development and the  supervision of forensic activities within the Polish Police (Central Forensic Laboratory of the  Police, n.d.). Its tasks include the examination of computer hardware and digital services:  • Identification of computer hardware and peripheral devices;  • Determination of the application of computer devices, their performance and memory  size;  • Analysis of data saved on digital devices;  • Data recovery from digital devices.  Finally, Poland is part of Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol, n.d.c).  2.11.1.4. Judiciary  Criminal investigations and prosecutions are carried out under the responsibility of prosecutors.  The Public Prosecutor's Office consists of the Prosecutor General, the National Prosecutor  and deputy Prosecutors General (Public Prosecutor's Office, n.d.). There are also regional  Public Prosecutor's Offices.  Within the Prosecutor General's Office, ‘several prosecutors have been designated to provide  coordination and support’ in cases involving cyberattacks/incidents (Council of the European  Union, 2017f). There is a division for cybercrime (Cybercrime, IT and Analysis department)  within the General Prosecutor's Office and cybercrime departments in the regional Offices.  Poland cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  59  2.11.2. Synergies and potential interferences  The cooperation between the three communities was assessed overall by the interviewees as  good, especially as the three communities have different roles and duties.  As highlighted during the interviews, CSIRT NASK cooperates daily with LE. It was mentioned  during the interviews that the CSIRT’s hotline is often used by LE in the course of an  investigation, which is ‘extremely useful, as many police units (especially in smaller  municipalities) might not have a dedicated cybercrime unit’. In such cases, the CSIRT ‘can  provide advice on the data that might be useful for an investigation, on the actions that should  be taken or procedures that should be followed to gather more information, etc.’. However, LE  must submit a formal request to the CSIRT to receive specific information related to a  cybercrime case.  One example of a successful synergy between the national CSIRT, the LE and the Judiciary is  the case involving the Vortex ransomware, used for several attacks across Poland. The  cooperation between the national CSIRT, the Cybercrime Bureau of the National Police  Headquarters and the Warsaw Prosecutor’s Office led to the arrest of a criminal who used this  ransomware. They also managed to secure the encryption keys and CSIRT NASK could  develop and publish a decryption tool for this type of ransomware (CERT Polska, 2018).  One of the experts interviewed underlined that LE and the Judiciary could benefit from more  training regarding new technologies and technical aspects of cybercrime, as not all police  departments have units specifically dedicated to fighting cybercrime, and judges and  prosecutors could improve their understanding of the specificities of cyberspace.  It was also mentioned during the interviews that ‘cybercrime-fighting entities would greatly  benefit from a central system that would be a single source of knowledge (including IoCs)  regarding cybercrime incidents being investigated’. This could be especially useful to identify the  victims of a widespread attack and to make it one single case. Currently, it is difficult for local  police departments to link one complaint or one notification of a suspected crime to a wider  campaign. They often ask the national CSIRT to share information on a specific incident, which  allows the CSIRT to identify other potential victims.  2.11.3. Examples of training  NASK organised and led a series of training for police officers as part of a dedicated  programme. Training covered fighting cybercrime and children’s safety in the cyberspace.  CSIRT NASK also provides training and workshops to police officers and prosecutors on  cybercrime related topics, such as the darkweb, cryptocurrencies, and OSINT. However, CSIRT  NASK does not provide training to judges.  Additionally, the Cybercrime Bureau of the National Police Headquarters organises trainings for  the prosecutors to enhance their knowledge in cybercrime matters.  The experts interviewed were not aware of a training initiative involving the three communities.  2.12. PORTUGAL  Portugal is ‘a semi-presidential republic with a head of government, the prime minister, and a  head of state, the president, who has power to appoint the prime minister and other government  members. The country is administratively divided into 308 municipalities, subdivided into 3 092  civil parishes’ (European Union, n.d.k).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Portugal is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Portuguese legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  AN EXAMPLE  OF TRAINING  TO FOSTER  SYNERGIES  CSIRT NASK  provides training and  workshops to police  officers and  prosecutors on  cybercrime related  topics, such as the  darkweb,  cryptocurrencies,  and OSINT.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  60  Portugal adopted its first NCSS in 2015. In 2019, the Portuguese government issued the NCSS  for 2019–2023 (ENISA, n.d.j).  Portugal ratified the Budapest Convention in 2010.  2.12.1. Roles and duties  In Portugal, the following authorities and departments, in particular21, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department  in English  Name of the authority/department in  the original language  Abbreviation/short  name in the original  language (if  applicable)  CERT.PT CERT.PT CERT.PT  Portuguese National  Cybersecurity Centre  Centro Nacional de Cibersegurança  CNCS  National Communications Agency Autoridade Nacional de  Comunicações ANACOM (22)  Judicial Police  Polícia Judiciária PJ  Public Security Police  Polícia de Segurança Pública  PSP  National Unit to Combat  Cybercrime and Technological  Crime  Unidade Nacional de Combate ao  Cibercrime e à Criminalidade  Tecnológica  UNC3T  Internal Intelligence Service Serviço de Informações de Segurança SIS  Prosecutor General’s Office Procurador-Geral da República PGR  Public Prosecution Service Ministério Público MP  Central Department of Criminal  Investigation and Prosecution  Departamento Central de Investigação  e Ação Penal DCIAP  Judicial system  2.12.1.1. National cybersecurity agency  The Portuguese National Cybersecurity Centre (Centro Nacional de Cibersegurança –  CNCS) (CNCS, n.d.) monitors and coordinates the implementation of the NCSS and is the  single point of contact. Its main focus is informing and raising the awareness of not only public  entities and critical infrastructures but also the business sector and civil society.  2.12.1.2. CSIRTs  Portugal has an officially recognised national CSIRT, CERT.PT (CNCS, n.d.a). CERT.PT ‘is a  service integrated in the Portuguese National Cybersecurity Centre that coordinates the  (21) The authorities and departments presented here are the main authorities/departments responsible for preventing,  analysing and fighting cyber incidents/cybercrime. Other authorities/departments not presented here might play a role on an  ad hoc basis.  (22) For a description of the role of ANACOM see below Section 2.12.2.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  61  response to incidents involving State entities, operators of Critical infrastructures, operators of  essential services, digital service providers and, in general, the national cyberspace, including  any device belonging to a network or address block attributed to an operator of electronic  communications, institution, collective or singular person based, or physically located, in  Portuguese territory’ (CNCS, n.d.a) (CNCS, n.d.e). Its mission is to enhance national capacity in  cybersecurity by creating new CSIRTs and developing the capacities of existing ones. CERT.PT  is a member of the National CSIRT Network and a national representative in the CSIRTs  Network.  2.12.1.3. LE  The Judicial Police (Polícia Judiciária, n.d.) investigates violent crime, organised crime and  financial crime. It is ‘a higher criminal police force falling under the Ministry of Justice. Its  mission is to assist judicial and prosecuting authorities with investigations and to develop and  foster preventive, detection and investigative actions, falling within its remit or entrusted with by  the competent judicial and prosecuting authorities. […]. Polícia Judiciária is also responsible for  ensuring the operation of the Europol National Unit and the Interpol National Central Bureau,  within the framework established by national legislation” (Europol, n.d.b).  With the aim to fight against cybercrime, the Judicial Police established in February 2017 the  National Unit to Combat Cybercrime and Technological Crime (Unidade Nacional de Combate  ao Cibercrime e à Criminalidade Tecnológica), also known as UNCT3. A specialised team  within the UNCT3 supports criminal investigations with technical and legal aspects (Polícia  Judiciária, n.d.a). The Judicial Police also relies on its Central Investigation Section for IT and  Telecommunications.  The Public Security Police (Polícia de Segurança Pública – PSP) is responsible for maintaining  security and public order and investigating non-organised crimes and violent crimes (PSP, n.d.).  The Internal Intelligence Service (Serviço de Informações de Segurança – SIS, (SIS, n.d.)  produces security intelligence to assist political decision-makers in fighting cybercrime, among  other crimes. To accomplish its mission, the SIS is supported by all of the security and LEAs  and public authorities in general.  According to the data collected in the interviews, the organisation in Portugal in charge of  cybercrime is Judicial Police, the police force that deals with anti-corruption, counter-terrorism,  drug prevention and serious cybercrime.  2.12.1.4. Judiciary  The Portuguese judicial system ‘has two separate sets of courts, the civil courts and the  administrative courts. Provision is also made for other courts, such as the Constitutional Court.  In the civil sphere, the ordinary courts with civil and criminal jurisdiction are the judicial courts’  (European Union, n.d.j).  The Public Prosecution Service (Ministério Público – PPS) (PPS, n.d.) is the Portuguese  prosecution authority. Within the PPS, the Prosecutor General’s Office (Procurador-Geral da  República – PGO) (PGO, n.d.) acts as the central authority for international judicial cooperation  in criminal matters. In addition, within the PPS, the Central Department of Criminal Investigation  and Prosecution (Departamento Central de Investigação e Ação Penal – DCIAP) (DCIAP, n.d.)  is a body entrusted with the coordination of the investigation of organised crime, as well as  crime prevention, while the Cybercrime Office of the Public Prosecution Service is in charge of  coordinating internally with the Public Prosecution Service, to provide specific training and to  establish communication with internet service providers to facilitate collaboration during criminal  investigations.  Portugal cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  62  2.12.2. Synergies and potential interferences  ‘The National Cybersecurity Centre is the operational coordinator and the Portuguese national  authority specialised in cybersecurity working in this field with State entities, operators of Critical  Infrastructures, operators of essential services and digital service providers, ensuring that the  cyberspace is used as an area of freedom, security and justice, for the protection of all the  sectors of society that materialize national sovereignty and the Democratic State under the rule  of law’ (CNCS, n.d.b) (CNCS, n.d.f).  ANACOM (National Communications Authority, Autoridade Nacional de Comunicações) is the  regulator, supervisor and representative of the communications sector in Portugal. The authority  is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Electronic Communications Law (ANACOM,  n.d.). In terms of criminal investigations, there is close cooperation between ANACOM, the  Judicial Police and the Prosecutor General’s Office on combating cybercrime and obtaining  digital evidence (ANACOM, n.d a).  As highlighted by one of the interviewees, ‘Nothing prevents the cooperation between CSIRTs,  LE and […judiciary]. However, there are no particular laws in place’. ‘CSIRTs officers have the  obligation to report malicious/suspicious events to the prosecution service’, which derives from  the general rule stating that all ‘public institutions have the obligation to cooperate with the LE  and the prosecution service during criminal investigations’.  CERT-PT ‘coordinates the response to incidents involving State entities, operators of essential  services, operators of national critical infrastructures and digital service providers. In addition,  the National Unit to Combat Cybercrime and Technological Crime (UNC3T) collaborates and  directly supports the actions of prevention, detection and mitigation developed by national  entities (Polícia Judiciária, n.d.a). Finally, the Internal Intelligence Service (SIS, n.d.)  collaborates closely with LEAs and public authorities, as well as providing support when this is  requested.  As emerged from the interviews, one example of synergy is the sharing of methodologies: both  CSIRTs and LEAs run regular laboratories and/or joint exercises and share methodologies.  Another example is the sharing of information: LEAs frequently share indicators of compromise  or indicators of threat with the other G4 members through the communication channel to verify  the information. There are also synergies across the different communities with regard to  training: the Police provide lectures to the school of magistrates and criminal police schools, as  well as annual lectures to magistrates and the academic community.  Since the transposition of the NIS Directive, a new national law (Cybersecurity law) mentioned  the needs of cooperation between the Portuguese CERT (the Portuguese national CERT is  within the Cyber Centre) and other national CSIRTs. In addition, there is a clause in the law  stating that the CNCS and the national criminal Police should cooperate. This group involves  four entities (known as G4):  • 1) the CNCS  • 2) the Judicial Police  • 3) the Cyber defence and  • 4) the intelligence services.  The G4 group collaborates with cyber diplomacy, a body within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  which is also tasked with supporting national services with information exchange in the EU  space.  However, magistrates are not part of the G4 group because they have their own powers and  can act directly/ask LE and the CNCS for services and information. They are therefore not  SYNERGIES IN  MULTIPLE  LEVELS  Examples of  synergies include  sharing of  methodologies,  sharing of  information and  training activities.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  63  explicitly mentioned in the legal act. Members of the G4 group have regular meetings and  occasionally, if needed, undertake joint operations.  Nevertheless, addressing cybersecurity means dealing with the global security of cyberspace  and sometimes there is an overlap between the CNCS and the Police. For example, if a CSIRT  decides to bring down (‘takedown procedure’) a botnet without consulting a LEA that may be in  the process of investigating it, this can cause disruptions. The G4 group was created to try and  avoid conflicts and overlapping activities, and weekly meetings increase the levels of  communication between the parties.  2.12.3. Examples of training  The CNCS ensures that suitable training activities are provided to the CSIRT community,  including but not limited to training sessions for CSIRT operators and coordination of national  cybersecurity exercises and participation to international cybersecurity exercises. In addition,  the CNCS supports the establishment of new CSIRTs, defines the required capabilities and  circulates best practices for the handling of cybersecurity incidents (CNCS, n.d.c.).  In terms of LE training, the PSP offers both training/teaching courses at a basic level and  specialised courses. The courses are taught by the Higher Institute of Police Sciences and  Internal Security (Instituto Superior de Ciências Policiais e Segurança Interna – ISCPSI)  (ISCPSI, n.d.) and the Police Training School (Escola Prática de Polícia). The Police Training  School provides training in criminal investigations. In addition, UNC3T is responsible for  ensuring collaboration and direct participation in initial and ongoing training on cybercrime for  staff involved in criminal investigations and in supporting the Judicial Police.  The recent project \"Homeland Security Fund\" (Fundo para a Segurança Interna) of the Judicial  Police aims to develop its internal capacity, in particular its know-how regarding the collection of  cybercrime evidence (Policia judiciaria, 2018). Launched in April 2020 and expected to be  finalised by the end of 2021, the project includes the certification of experts within the Judicial  Police, the creation of an internal trainer pool, the conduct of trainings as well as the  decentralisation of the training infrastructure.  In addition, the Portuguese Judicial Police is a co-founding member of ECTEG (European  Cybercrime Training & Education Group) and participate actively to its activities, such as the e- First project in 2019 held on its facilities. The project targets as final product the delivery of a  self-training platform available 24/7 specialised on cybersecurity and cybercrime.  The Centre for Judiciary Studies (Centro de Estudos Judiciários – CEJ) (CEJ, n.d.) provides  training for the Judiciary on cybercrime and digital evidence, as well as on cyber components of  the penal code and criminal investigations, aiming to provide to all judges and prosecutors a  minimum level of knowledge and information on cybercrime. As reported during one of the  interviews, the ‘judiciary community has established initiatives that usually try to involve experts  from the other communities in their training activities (provided for prosecutors, judges,  sometimes lawyers and LE). This is a common practice as they have observed the benefits of  such an exchange.’ This will also help ‘to ensure that Judiciary experts provide guidance to  CSIRTs’.  The interviews revealed that CSIRTs and LE carry out joint exercises; however, in 2020 any  planned training was not held because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Judiciary (prosecutors  and judges) do not currently participate in such activities. The interviewees noted that CSIRTs  and LE want to find a common approach. Once this is accomplished, they will expand the  training to the Judiciary community as well.  From the data collected in the interviews, it emerged that LE personnel participate in civil  postgraduate programmes (legal or engineering programmes). Efforts are also being made to  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  64  provide more engineering courses to legal actors and more legal knowledge to engineers and  set up links with the academic community. This is something that LE supports heavily through  liaising with professors and students to inspire collaborations. LE participates in lectures e.g. on  cybercrime law, digital forensics and ethics.  As indicated in the interviews, the CNCS delivers such training online along with awareness  courses for the public. LEAs receive training provided by the school of magistrates and criminal  police schools, with the CNCS also providing annual lectures to magistrates.  2.13. ROMANIA  Romania is ‘a semi-presidential republic with a head of government – the prime minster – and a  head of state – the president. The country is divided into 41 counties and the municipality of  Bucharest’ (European Union, n.d.l).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Romania is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Romania legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Romania adopted its NCSS in 2013 (ENISA, n.d.k) and legislation that transposes the EU NIS  Directive (Law No 362/2018) in 2018 (CERT RO, 2020).  Romania ratified the Budapest Convention in 2004.  2.13.1. Roles and duties  In Romania the following authorities and departments, in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department  in English  Name of the authority/department in  the original language  Abbreviation in the  original language (if  applicable)  Romanian National Computer  Security Incident Response Team  Centrul Național de Răspuns la  Incidente de Securitate Cibernetică CERT-RO  Cyber Security Incident Response  Center  Centrul de Răspuns la Incidente de  Securitate Cibernetică CERT-MIL  Operational Response Centre for  Security Incidents  Centrul Operațional de Răspuns la  Incidente de Securitate  CORIS-STS  National Cyberint Center  Centrul Național Cyberint  General Inspectorate of Romanian  Police  Inspectoratul General al Poliţiei  Române IGPR  Directorate for Investigating  Organised Crime and Terrorism  Direcția de Investigare a Infracțiunilor  de Criminalitate Organizată și  Terorism  DIICOT  Judicial system  2.13.1.1. National cyber security agency  The implementation of the NCSS in Romania is coordinated by the Chancellery of the Prime  Minister.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  65  In Romania, there are multiple cybersecurity authorities. Currently, the Romanian National  Computer Security Incident Response Team (Centrul Național de Răspuns la Incidente de  Securitate Cibernetică – CERT-RO) (CERT-RO, n.d.) no longer operates under the Ministry of  Communication and Information Society (MCSI), but is coordinated by the Chancellery of the  Prime Minister (Portal Legislativ, n.d.). According to the law transposing the NIS Directive (Law  No 362/2018), CERT-RO is the national competent authority for network and information  systems and has an operational role (CERT RO, 2020).  2.13.1.2. CSIRTs  Romania has an officially recognised national CSIRT: CERT-RO ‘is the National CERT of  Romania, established as an independent structure for research, development and expertise in  the field of cyber-security. It is a specialized organization responsible for preventing, analysing,  identifying and reacting to cyber incidents. CERT-RO is the national contact point for similar  structures. CERT-RO is responsible for elaborating and distributing public politics for prevention  and counteracting the incidents that occur within national cyber infrastructures’ (CERT-RO, n.d.  a).  CORIS-STS (Operational Response Centre for Security Incidents, Centrul Operațional de  Răspuns la Incidente de Securitate) is the Romanian governmental CSIRT and is part of the  Romanian Special Telecommunications Service (STS). This CERT ‘is designated to prevent  and respond to security incidents related to information and communications systems of the  Special Telecommunications Service and its clients’ (CORIS-STS, n.d.). The beneficiaries of the  CORSI-STS are public high-level authorities, such as the Parliament, the Presidency, the  overnment, defence related entities, central and local administration and judicial related entities.  CERT-MIL (Cyber Security Incident Response Center, Centrul de Răspuns la Incidente de  Securitate Cibernetică) (CERT-MIL, n.d.) is the Romanian Military CSIRT, under the Ministry of  Defence CSIRT, and is responsible for the management of cybersecurity incidents in the  relevant cyber infrastructures, ensuring their detection, investigation and response in  accordance with the regulations and procedures in force under the Ministry of National Defence.  It was established in 2007 within the Ministry of National Defence and since 2020 has been the  responsibility of the Cyber Defence Command.  The National Cyberint Centre (Centrul Național Cyberint) is the cyber intelligence centre of the  Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI). Its main focus is on counter-espionage, economic  security, transnational threats and the protection of classified information. The SRI focuses on  cyberattacks, including those that originate in other states, and cybercrime groups, which may  also be associated with terrorist organisations or extremists (hacktivists) (SRI, n.d.).  2.13.1.3. LE  The Central Cybercrime Unit within the Romanian Police (Politia Romana, n.d.) is the primary  LEA dealing with cybercrime, with local capacities as well. More specifically it deals with:  • online fraud and fraud committed with electronic payment instruments;  • digital forensics;  • online child abuse;  • computer-related crimes (crimes against/through computer systems; unauthorised  computer/data access or data transfer).  It is a specialised unit (Politia Romana, n.d.a), with general territorial competence, that is  involved in combating and coordinating the fight against organised crime, including cybercrime,  at the national level. The activities carried out by the Directorate for Combating Organized  Crime include:  • Operational activity  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  66  • Control, support and guidance decisive in obtaining results at territorial level  • Information and decision support  • International representation/training (Politia Romana, n.d.a).  The challenges facing this specialised unit in 2020 are phishing campaigns/mobile malware  distribution related to COVID-19, ransomware attacks on health facilities/hospitals, attacks  against critical infrastructure holding personal data on COVID-19 patients, online fraud and SIM  SWAP scams (Council of Europe, 2020c).  Finally, Romania is part of the Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol,  n.d.c).  2.13.1.4. Judiciary  The supreme court in Romania is the High Court of Cassation and Justice. The judicial  authorities are divided by the regional and specialised jurisdiction (European e-Justice Portal,  n.d.)  Within the Prosecutor’s Office, which is under the responsibility of the High Court of Cassation  and Justice, the Service for Preventing and Combating Cyber-Crime is specifically dedicated to  fighting cybercrime and is made of two different units: the Office for Countering Cybercrime and  the Office for Countering Crimes Committed with Credit Cards and other Electronic Payment  Instruments. The service for Prevention and Combatting Cybercrime conducts investigation in  case of cybercrime and acts as the permanent point of contact for the network created under  the Budapest Convention.  In Romania, the issuing and execution of the request for international judicial cooperation in  criminal matters is under the competence of the courts and prosecution offices (EJN, n.d.a).  The Ministry of Justice, the Prosecutor’s Office of the High Court of Cassation and Justice and  the Ministry of Internal Affairs have responsibility for international judicial cooperation in criminal  matters (EJN, n.d.).  Romania cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.13.2. Synergies and potential interferences  ‘National cyber security system is the general framework of cooperation which brings together  public authorities and institutions with responsibilities and capabilities in the field in order to  ensure coordination of actions at national level for cyberspace security, including through  cooperation with academia and business, professional associations and organizations NGOs’  (CERT-RO, n.d.b).  Romania has developed official programmes for cybersecurity interagency cooperation and  information sharing, with CERT-RO playing a major role. CERT-RO has ‘signed a Memorandum  of Understanding (MoU) and Protocols with public institutions in the cybersecurity field’ (ITU,  n.d.).  The Romanian CSIRT, LE and Judiciary are cooperating on cybercrime cases under the  national legal framework, which is expected to be updated to provide further support for this  kind of cooperation, for example to stipulate in the criminal procedure code that CERT-RO could  be called to provide expertise to the Prosecutor’s Office and in court.  One example of this cooperation is the Romanian CSIRT, LE and Judiciary working together to  fight banking/financial malware (botnets) affecting Romanian citizens and financial institutions.  SYNERGIES IN  FIGHTING  CYBER  THREATS  The Romanian  CSIRT, LE and  Judiciary cooperate  in fighting cyber  threats affecting the  national IT  infrastructure,  citizens and  organisations.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  67  In terms of synergies, CERT-RO and the Romanian Police are working together to continuously  adapt the framework for information exchange and cooperation. One important aspect of this is  the tools needed to support the cooperation framework, and here CERT-RO has made  important steps recently by implementing a National Cybersecurity Services Platform (NCSP)  that can be used by all stakeholders: LEAs, CSIRTs, internet service providers, public and  private partners, and other authorities.  Another common objective is to assure that technical training is provided for those who work in  the areas of cybersecurity and cybercrime. CERT-RO also has a leading role here by organising  regular technical workshops and seminars for all relevant stakeholders.  Possible interferences have been reduced drastically as a result of recent developments in  implementation of an optimal cooperation framework between the CSIRT, Police and Judiciary.  Some interferences may still occur in cybercrime investigations, mainly because of the different  focuses that these communities have, i.e. incident mitigation (CSIRTs) compared with evidence  preservation and criminal prosecution (LE and Judiciary).  2.13.3. Examples of training  Since 2017, a national cyber exercise called CyDEX has been organised by the SRI through its  National Cyberint Center, in cooperation with the national CSIRT (CERT-RO), the Ministry of  Defence, the Military Technical Academy, the STS, the Protection and Guard Service and  organisations form different private sectors. The latest exercise included participants from more  than 90 organisations in the public and private sector, including CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary.  Training for LE at a foundational level and at advanced levels is provided by the Police  Academy and the Police Officers School in Romania.  The training of judges and public prosecutors is the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice.  Since 2004, the Ministry of Justice, through its website, has made available guides and useful  information on judicial cooperation, such as handbooks and manuals, for Romanian judges and  prosecutors (Romanian Ministry of Justice, n.d.).  In addition, the Romanian Centre of Excellence for Cybercrime Investigation (CYBEREX-RO)  offers training to those organisations working to combat cybercrime in Romania, such as CERT- RO, the General Inspectorate of Romanian Police (Inspectoratul General al Poliţiei Române –  IGPR) – Fraud Investigations Directorate (GIRP-FID, n.d.), the Prosecutor’s Office attached to  the High Court of Cassation and Justice (POHCCJ, n.d.), the National Institute for Magistracy  (NIM, n.d.), the Police Academy and others (European Commission, n.d.).Currently, there are  no examples of joint training between the three communities.  2.14. SLOVENIA  Slovenia is ‘a parliamentary democratic republic with a head of government, the prime minister,  and a head of state, the president, who is directly elected. The government holds executive and  administrative authority. The prime minister and ministers are elected by the Parliament.  Slovenia has no regions, but is subdivided into 212 municipalities’ (European Union, n.d.m).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Slovenia is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Slovenian legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  The Slovenian Cyber Security Strategy was published in 2016 (Slovenian government, 2016). It  foresees the enhancement of the capacity of the Police and the Judiciary to fight cybercrime,  with a focus on digital forensics. This includes appropriate training of all LEAs operating in this  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  68  field. The Strategy also underlines that knowledge in cybercrime is necessary for the ‘successful  prosecution of classic types of crime’, which increasingly use the Internet. Objective 5 of the  National Cybersecurity Strategy on the fight against cybercrime ‘foresees actions on regular  training on cybersecurity for law enforcement participating in the development of cyber  capacities for public security and in combating cybercrime’ (Slovenian government, 2016)  (Council of Europe, n.d.a).  The Slovenian National Assembly adopted the Act on Information Security in 2018, which  implements the NIS Directive into the Slovenian legal system (PISRS, 2018).  Slovenia ratified the Budapest Convention in 2004.  2.14.1. Roles and duties  In Slovenia, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related  to preventing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  Information Security Administration Uprava Republike Slovenije za informacijsko  varnost URSIV  SI-CERT SI-CERT SI-CERT  SIGOV-CERT SIGOV-CERT SIGOV-CERT  Criminal Police Directorate Uprava kriminalistične policije  - Computer Investigation Centre Center za računalniško preiskovanje  State Prosecutor’s Office Vrhovno državno tožilstvo Republike Slovenije  2.14.1.1. National cybersecurity agency  The Information Security Administration (URSIV) is the competent national body for  information security. It is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Administration. It was  established in 2020 after the vote of the Information Security Act (2018) (Slovenian  governement, 2021).  The URSIV is the central coordinating body at the strategic level of the national information  security system and the single point of contact of the state for international cooperation in this  field and with the European network of CSIRTs. The URSIV keeps the government and the  National Security Council (SNAV) of the state informed in case of increased threat which could  lead to a critical incident or cyberattack (Slovenian governement, 2021).  2.14.1.2. CSIRTs  SI-CERT is the Slovenian national CSIRT, while SIGOV-CERT is the governmental one.  Established in 1995, SI-CERT is the national CSIRT of Slovenia as defined in the Act on  Information Security (Art. 28) (PISRS, 2018). SI-CERT is part of ARNES (Academic and  Research Network of Slovenia) within the Sector of National Internet Infrastructure (SI-CERT,  n.d) (SI-CERT, n.d.a). It is the ‘main contact point for reporting network security incidents  involving systems and networks located in Slovenia’ (Council of Europe, n.d.a).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  69  SI-CERT performs risk and incident handling in accordance with Article 28 of the Information  Security Act (PISRS, 2018), which defines following responsibilities:  • Offer of support, help and cooperation in case of incident;  • Sharing of data about risks and vulnerabilities with the affected systems’  administrators, and issues warnings;  • Cooperation with CSIRT groups and security operation centres in Slovenia and CSIRT  groups in other EU Member States;  • Raising the awareness of users in the area of cybersecurity;  • Cooperation with the competent national authority and offer of information upon  request.  SI-CERT is a member of the CSIRTs Network.  SIGOV-CERT is the Slovenian governmental CERT of Slovenia. It is a young structure, created  in 2019. Its constituency includes all networks, information systems and users of those systems  managed by the Ministry of Public Administration of Slovenia. However, the Ministry of the  Interior, the Ministry of Defence and the Slovenian Intelligence and Security Agency are  responsible for ensuring the security of their networks and information systems (Slovenian  government, 2021).  2.14.1.3. Judiciary  The State prosecution services of Slovenia are composed of:  • The State Prosecutor General’s Office, which supervises and coordinates the work  of eleven District State Prosecutors’ Offices (State Prosecutor’s Office, n.d.);  • The Specialised State Prosecutor’s Office, which deals with the most complex  criminal offences (State Prosecuror's Office, n.d.a).  State prosecutors operate at four levels:  • Supreme state prosecutors;  • Higher state prosecutors;  • District state prosecutors;  • Local state prosecutors.  State prosecutors perform their tasks in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Act (Policija,  2007). They can exercise their authority to give guidance and obligatory instructions to the  Police during the investigation. The cooperation between the Slovenian Police and the  prosecutors is ruled by the ‘Decree on the cooperation of the State Prosecutorial Service, the  Police and other competent State bodies and institutions in the detection and prosecution of  perpetrators of criminal offences and the operation of specialised and joint investigation teams’  (Official Journal of the Slovenian Republic, 2010).  State Prosecutors usually do not directly contact entities other than the Police, which means  that direct contact/communication with CSIRTs is relatively rare.  ‘There are no separate departments for prosecution of cybercrime [within the State prosecution  services], but some state prosecutors are specialised’ in this area (Council of Europe, n.d.a).  If a case is related to both cybercrime and criminal organisations, it can fall under the  competence of the Specialised State Prosecutor’s Office, otherwise any of eleven District State  Prosecutor Offices can be competent.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  70  Slovenia cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.14.2. Synergies and potential interferences  According to the data collected via the interviews, synergies exist between the three  communities, based on their specific roles and duties.  The CSIRT community can provide technical expertise to LE and the Judiciary, specifically on  how the systems and networks work and on malware analysis, while LE provides investigative  skills and knowledge in digital forensics. The Judiciary can provide legal support to the CSIRT  about relevant provisions related to criminal offences and procedures.  Interviewees did not identify major interferences in the roles and duties of the three  communities, however they highlighted that the communities have different interests and ‘speak  different languages’, which can be challenging. An example was given by one of the experts  interviewed, who experienced a situation where the CSIRT’s interest was to inform its  constituency of an incident, while the Police’s interest was not to reveal the incident while  investigating. In such cases however, LE and the CSIRT community usually coordinate to find  the best way to act.  Another challenge highlighted during the interviews is the difficulty the communities may have in  understanding each other. On the one hand for example, prosecutors and judges may  encounter difficulty in understanding the technical details of a criminal offence in a cybercrime  related case; on the other hand, a CSIRT representative may ‘find difficult to understand what a  prosecutor or judge needs from a legal point of view, and how the technical data/information  could be used during criminal proceedings’. During the interviews it was suggested that this  challenge could be addressed by organising joint seminars so the three communities could  exchange knowledge and experience.  2.14.3. Examples of training  SI-CERT and LE representatives participate in the annual workshop organised by ENISA and  Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). One interviewee explained that input provided  during one of these workshops by European counterparts on how they cooperate was very  beneficial: since then, the SI-CERT and the Slovenian Computer Investigation Centre try to  organise informal workshops every three months to enhance their cooperation. Due to the  pandemic, these workshops are currently organised online.  Additionally, once a year, the Computer Investigation Centre organises a joint meeting, to which  the CSIRT community is invited.  During these joint events, the two communities exchange best practices and lessons learned.  They present relevant cases and discuss them.  The experts interviewed were not aware of joint events or trainings involving the three  communities, although such initiatives would, according to them, be very beneficial.  2.15. SPAIN  Spain is ‘a parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy with a head of government,  the prime minister, and a head of state, the Monarch. A council of ministers is the executive  branch and is presided over by the prime minister. Spain is a unitary state, composed of 17  autonomous communities and two autonomous cities with varying degrees of autonomy’  (European Union, n.d.n).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Spain is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  JOINT EVENTS  TO FOSTER  COOPERATION  Participation in  yearly ENISA and  EC3 workshops  inspired SI-CERT to  organise more joint  workshops with  Slovenian LE to  enhance their  cooperation.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  71  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Spanish legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  The NCSS published in 2019 follows the 2017 NCSS and 2013 NCSS (CCN-CERT, 2019). It  sets out a number of measures to ‘reinforce capabilities or investigation and prosecution of  cybercrime, to guarantee citizens security and protect rights and freedoms in cyberspace’ (Line  of actions 3) (CCN-CERT, 2019).  The NIS Directive has been implemented in 2018 by the Royal Decree 12/2018 (Spanish  Official Journal, 2018).  Spain ratified the Budapest Convention in 2010.  2.15.1. Roles and duties  In Spain, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related to  preventing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  National Cryptology Center Centro Criptologico Nacional  - CSIRT of the National Cryptology  Center  Capacidad de Respuesta a Incidentes de  Seguridad de la Información del Centro  Criptológico Nacional  CCN-CERT  National Cybersecurity Insitute Instituto Nacional de Ciberseguridad INCIBE  - National Cybersecurity Insitute- CERT Instituto Nacional de Ciberseguridad-CERT INCIBE-CERT  Office for Cyber Coordination Oficina de Coordinación Cibernética OCC  National Police Policia Nacional  - Technological Investigation Unit  Unidad de Investigación Tecnológica  UIT  o Central Brigade for  Technological Research Brigada Central de Investigación Tecnológica BCIT  Guardia Civil Guardia Civil  - Group of Telematic Crime - Central  Operational Unit  Grupo de Delitos Telemáticos - Unidad Central  Operativa  GDT  General Prosecutor’s Office Fiscal General del Estado  2.15.1.1. National cybersecurity agency  Set up in 2002, the National Cryptology Centre (CCN) belongs to the National Intelligence  Centre (CNI). Its role is to guarantee ICT security in public administration entities and security  for systems which process, store or send out classified information (CCN, n.d.) (Council of the  European Union, 2016). The CCN operates the CCN-CERT, the Spanish governmental CSIRT  (CCN, n.d.).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  72  If a cybercrime is detected during an intelligence investigation, the CNI contacts the Spanish  LEAs to take actions. For cases falling under the scope of the NIS Directive, the Spanish Royal  Decree 43/2021 (Spanish Official Journal, 2021a), which specifies how the CSIRTs, competent  authorities and LEA should act in case of a major cyber incident, establishes that the CNI has to  implement a common national platform for incident notifications: when a victim reports such a  cyber incident to a CSIRT, it is reported on this national platform, accessible by the competent  authorities and LEAs, where the latter can share information on the incident. The CNI does not  usually communicate with the Judiciary. The LE acts as an intermediary.  Moreover, the CNI provides resources and training to the Spanish public sector on cybercrime  related matters.  The Spanish National Cybersecurity Institute (INCIBE) was established in 2014. It provides  cybersecurity services to businesses and professionals, and to the general public. Its role is also  to raise awareness on risks and to promote mechanisms for the prevention of and reaction to  cybersecurity incidents (INCIBE, n.d.) (Council of the European Union, 2016).  2.15.1.2. CSIRTs  In Spain the CCN-CERT is the governmental CSIRT, while INCIBE-CERT the national one.  The CCN-CERT belongs to the CCN. It was established in 2006. Its role is to handle cyber  incidents affecting its constituency (classified systems and systems belonging to public  administrations, companies and organisations of strategic interest).  When a incident related to cybercrime arises, CCN-CERT recommends to the victim(s) to report  the crime to the LE and provides technical supports. It also disseminates to its constituency,  including LEAs, new indicators of compromise (IOCs) obtained during the course of the  investigation. If required by a judge, CCN-CERT can provide technical reports to the Police  and/or support further technical investigations, especially in digital forensics (e.g. of mobile  devices).  In cases of a major cyber incidents, the CCN-CERT acts as a national coordinator of the  regional CSIRTs23. As regional CSIRTs are closer to victims, the CCN-CERT can decide to let  them handle the incident, except in cases of cyberespionage, where only the CCN-CERT can  be in charge and interact with victims.  CCN-CERT regularly and directly interacts with the National Police and Guardia Civil  cybercrime units. One of the experts interviewed explained that CCN-CERT has Intrusion  Detection Sensors (IDS) deployed in about 300 public organisations in Spain (central  government, regional governments, etc.).  Private entities, including OES and digital services operators, belong to INCIBE-CERT’s  constituency.  INCIBE-CERT can give technical support to Law enforcement and the Judiciary, but always in  coordination with the Office of Cyber Coordination (OCC). The OCC can request any relevant  information on the incidents from the CSIRTs. Criteria are established to determine which  incidents must be communicated to the OCC depending on their impact (high/very high/critical).  INCIBE-CERT can be requested by the National Police and the Guardia Civil (which have  cybercrime units) to provide technical support, the OCC must be informed of such requests.  23 There are several regional CSIRTs in Spain, such as AndaluciaCERT, Catalonia-CERT, and CSIRT.gal.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  73  One of the experts interviewed mentioned that digital ‘forensics tasks are usually run by private  companies. […] However, LE can ask INCIBE-CERT for its opinion on the forensics reports’.  INCIBE-CERT can be asked also by the Judiciary to provide technical reports, however this is  rare. As emerged from the interviewed, it has happened that INCIBE was called upon to testify  in court, but in general only written reports are communicated to the judges.  2.15.1.3. LE  The National Police and the Guardia Civil have their own cybercrime units. Some regional and  local police forces also have cybercrime units (Council of Europe, n.d.e). It is the role of LE to  communicate incidents to the Prosecutor’s Office.  The Spanish national Police has a Technological Investigation Unit (UIT). The UIT was  created in 2012 within the General Directorate of the Police. It is responsible for investigating  and prosecuting cybercrime at national level and acts as the ‘E-Crime Prevention and  Response Center’ of the Police (Policia, n.d.). The UIT is made up of two brigades:  • The Central Brigade for Technological Research (BCIT);  • The Central Cybersecurity Brigade.  The BCIT is in charge of investigating all forms of crime related to computer activities  (cyberattacks, threats or insults on the Internet, child sexual abuse, and frauds).  The Group of Telematic Crime (GDT) of the Central Operational Unit of the Guardia Civil was  created in 1996 to investigate crimes committed on the Internet. Its competence now covers  cybercrime, defined as criminal behaviours carried out through and against information systems.  Technological Research Teams (Equipos de Investigación Tecnológica - EDITE) were created  in each Spanish province to support the GDT's work.  Within CNPIC (National Critical Infrastructure Protection and Cybersecurity Centre), the Office  for Cyber Coordination (OCC) was first created as the Cybernetic Coordination Unit about ten  years ago, and renamed into OCC in 2020. On the one hand, OCC is responsible for the  technical coordination with the n/g CSIRTs (INCIBE-CERT and CCN-CERT), on the other hand,  it acts as the point of contact (PoC) with the Law enforcement cybercrime units of Spanish LEAs  (Council of Europe, n.d.e).  Regional police forces interact with the OCC through the Intelligence Center for Counter- Terrorism and Organised Crime (CITCO) of the Spanish Ministry of the Interior. Furthermore, in  March 2021 the Home Office approved the Strategic Plan Against Cybercrime, which reflects  different cooperation tools between national LEAs and regional police forces coordinated by  OCC (Ministry of Home Affairs, 2021).  Finally, Spain is part of Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol, n.d.c).  2.15.1.4. Judiciary  The General Prosecutor’s Office has a cybercrime unit and a network of specialised  prosecutors. The General Prosecutor’s Office delimited what is to be understood as cybercrime  in its Instruction 2/2011 of 11 October 2011 ‘Concerning Specialised High Prosecutors on  Computer-related Crimes and the Sections for computer-related crimes of the Prosecutor’s  offices’ (General Prosecutor's Office, 2011).  The cybercrime unit is coordinated by a prosecutor supported by two deputy prosecutors. In  each region, a Provincial Prosecutor´s Office is responsible for the respective provincial unit.  Every specialised unit has the number of prosecutors considered necessary depending on the  volume of relevant cases.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  74  Spain cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.15.2. Synergies and potential interferences  Existing synergies are mostly bilateral: between CSIRT and LE, and between LE and the  Judiciary. CSIRTs do not usually interact with the Judiciary. The cooperation was assessed by  the interviewees as good, overall.  As part of the implementation of the NIS Directive, the OCC has been designated as the  National Competent Authority for the OES for the private sector (European Commission, n.d.c)  (Spanish Official Journal, 2021a) (Spanish Official Journal, 2018a). In addition, as part of the  implementation of the 2013 Directive on Attacks against Information Systems, OCC has been  designated as the operational national PoC. Therefore, the OCC receives all incident reports  from OES. Its staff analyses the information received and sends it to the relevant LE units. The  OCC also does cyber intelligence.  According to the Royal decree 43/2021 (Spanish Official Journal, 2021a), the reference CSIRTs  (CCN-CERT and INCIBE-CERT) must report incidents presenting characteristics of a crime to  the OCC. Criteria are established to determine which incidents must be communicated to the  OCC depending on their impact (high/very high/critical impact). CCN and INCIBE share ticketing  tools (one each, although a common tool is planned to be implemented within two years) to  report incidents. The OCC analyses all information received from the CSIRTs and completes a  report, and updates it with any new elements received. It can request any relevant information  on the incidents from the CSIRTs. The OCC coordinates with LE and shares the report with  them via encrypted email.  CSIRTs provide technical expertise to LE, whereas LE and the Judiciary are in charge of  investigating and prosecuting crimes. As highlighted during the interviews, cooperation has  proven to be necessary in several situations requiring quick action, such as taking down  domains, sending request to preserve evidence in other countries, and seizing servers. One  example of synergy was the successful cooperation between LE and the CCN-CERT during the  incident at the Spanish National Employment Office in March 2021.  One interviewee explained that in 2020, a new working group on cybersecurity was established  at the national level as a technical group dedicated to the implementation of cybersecurity  measures, in which the Judiciary, at both regional and national levels, is involved.  Although no major interferences were experienced by the interviewees, some challenges due to  a difference of interests between the communities were identified. For example, when an  incident occurs, LE needs to preserve the system(s) impacted to conduct investigations,  whereas the CSIRT wants to act quickly to solve the incident, which it cannot do while the  Police is working. In such cases, LE and the CSIRT usually agree that LE make a copy of the  server to preserve evidence. This allows the CSIRT to start solving the incident with less delay.  Challenges related to the lack of technical skills in LE units and the lack of knowledge of legal  procedures in the CSIRTs were also highlighted during the interviews. According to one of the  experts interviewed, more training opportunities for the CSIRTs to have better knowledge of the  legal procedures related to the fight against cybercrime would be useful. On the other hand,  training of judiciary representatives would also be useful to improve their understanding of the  CSIRTs’ scope of work. To address these challenges, INCIBE’s legal department reviews the  requests received from judges before sending them to the technical department, so they are  better understood, and the other way around.  The following recommendations were formulated during one interview to address potential  challenges in the cooperation between the three communities:  • To broaden the legal scope allowing the three communities to exchange information;  • To set up common formal procedures to exchange information and send requests;  EXISTING  SYNERGIES  The existing  synergies, ensuring  good cooperation,  could benefit from  more joint trainings  and better  knowledge of each  other tasks.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  75  • To set up more IT and cybersecurity training for LE/Judiciary;  • To improve the LE/Judiciary’s knowledge of the CSIRTs’ functions and tasks.  2.15.3. Examples of training  One of the experts interviewed highlighted that the OCC recently received a budget for technical  training: in September 2021, it will organise a technical training for OCC and LE units, which will  focus on certified ethical hackers and OSINT techniques.  Furthermore, the OCC and INCIBE have an agreement for the CyberEx exercise (INCIBE,  2021), conducted with OES’ technical team. CyberEx focuses on cyber incident handling.  As the governmental CSIRT, CCN-CERT is responsible for training civil servants and  cybersecurity experts in Spain. Every year, it organises about twenty courses on technical  issues (e.g. IDS, digital forensics courses, and collection of e-evidence). LE representatives  participate in these courses. CCN-CERT also provides specific courses to the National Police  and the Guardia Civil in the Police Academy and Guardia Civil Academy. Although CCN-CERT  provides training to LE, it does not participate in joint trainings with them.  CCN-CERT also has a very large portfolio of cybersecurity tools, norms and publications  available for the public sector, including LE and the Judiciary.  Finally, CCN-CERT organises workshops on cybersecurity related matters within the group  CSIRT.es, which gathers CERTs from private and public sector, as well as LEAs.  INCIBE-CERT provides technical training to LE and the Judiciary:  • The Cybersecurity Summer BootCamp (INCIBE, n.d.a), organised annually since 2016  by INCIBE and the Organization of American States (OAS). It provides both strategic  and practical trainings. The Cybersecurity Summer bootcamp goes from basic to  medium level. It gives LE and the Judiciary (prosecutors and judges) knowledge and  reference on topics like malware analysis, and OSINT. CCN-CERT representatives  and private companies’ representatives are usually invited as speakers. The  Cybersecurity Summer bootcamp is assessed as very useful for the Judiciary to  enhance their technical knowledge. As LE have a better understanding of the technical  aspects, they come to the Cybersecurity Summer bootcamp to enhance specific skills,  such as malware analysis;  • A \"Basic Cybersecurity for Security Forces and Bodies\" MOOC, designed for LE: it is a  basic course presenting the tasks of the police forces in fighting cybercrime:  prevention, awareness and protection of citizens against cybercrime (INCIBE, n.d.c).  According to one of the interviewees, about 1,780 participants already attended this  MOOC;  • An \"Advanced Cybersecurity for Security Forces and Bodies\" MOOC, designed for LE:  an advanced course which covers advanced and specific topics such as malware,  open source intelligence and the deep web (INCIBE, n.d.c). According to one of the  interviewees, about 1,820 students were enrolled.  In addition, the Spanish Police Studies Institute (Instituto de estudios de la Policía) has  developed a Master’s in cybercrime, aimed at chief inspectors, inspectors or sergeants who are  the heads of groups or units tackling cybercrime. The first edition was initiated in October 2016.  Finally, the Spanish National Police School (Escuela Nacional de Policía) and ECTEG created  the C1b3rWall Academy in 2018, which led to the Congress on Digital Security and  Cyberintelligence, organised in 2019 at the headquarters of the National Police School  (ECTEG, 2020). The C1b3rWall Academy currently offers online training dedicated to LEAs on  topics such as cryptography, security and infrastructures, digital forensic analysis, legal hacking,  blue team, red team, and cryptocurrencies (ECTEG, 2020).  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  76  2.16. SWEDEN  Sweden is ‘a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy with a head of government  – the prime minister – and a head of state – the monarch. Sweden is a unitary state, divided into  20 counties and 290 municipalities’ (European Union, n.d.t).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Sweden is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Swedish legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Sweden adopted its NCSS in 2017, followed by a comprehensive cyber security action plan for  the period 2019–2022 (ENISA, n.d.l) (Swedish Government, n.d.) (Comprehensive cyber  security action plan 2019–2022, 2019).  Sweden ratified the Budapest Convention in 2021.  2.16.1.

National cyber security agency  The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (Myndigheten för samhällsskydd och beredskaps –  MSB) is the responsible authority for network and information security in Sweden (MSB, n.d.).  The cybersecurity action plan of Sweden contains measures that the MSB will undertake, along  with the authorities mentioned above in Section 2.16.1.  (24)The authorities and departments presented here are the main authorities/departments responsible for preventing,  analysing and fighting cybercrime. Other authorities/departments not presented here might play a role on an ad hoc basis.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  77  The National Centre for Security in Control Systems for Critical Infrastructure is in charge of  raising awareness and disseminating knowledge and experience of cybersecurity. Established  in 2008, it works in collaboration with the MSB.  2.16.1.2. CSIRTs  CERT-SE is the officially recognised national and governmental CSIRT (CERT-SE, 2015). The  MSB is the authority that operates the national CSIRT.  CERT-SE also collaborates with the military CERT of Sweden, Försvarsmakten FM-CERT (FM- CERT, n.d.) (Council of the European Union, 2017b).  PM-CERT, the Swedish Police CERT is responsible for protecting the Police's IT infrastructure  and network.  SUNet-CERT is the Swedish University Network CERT. It supports academic and educational  institutions as well as other organisations connected to the SUNET network (SUNet-CERT,  n.d.).  2.16.1.3. LE  The Swedish Police Authority (Polismyndigheten) (Polisen, n.d.) falls under the Ministry of  Justice. The LEAs listed below undertake cybercrime investigation tasks, among other types of  criminal investigations, and are overseen by the Swedish Police Authority:  • the Swedish Cybercrime Centre (SC3);  • the National Fraud Centre;  • the National Forensic Centre (Nationellt forensiskt centrum – NFC);  • the National Operations Department (Nationella operativa avdelningen – NOA), which  includes a Cybercrime unit.  The SC3 was established ‘to investigate all forms of cybercrime. [SC3] is responsible for  detecting, preventing and averting serious cybercrime’. The SC3 shares information on threats,  as well as technical methods to combat cybercrime, with partner agencies (Council of the  European Union, 2017b); see also (Polisen, n.d. a).  The main tasks of the NFC are to conduct forensic investigations and analyses for the judicial  authorities (NFC). The National Fraud Centre has a coordinating and supportive role. The  centre supports investigators regionally and locally and shares best practices. It collaborates  with the NFC and the SC3 (Council of the European Union, 2017b) (Polisen, n.d. a).  The NOA has a leading role in operational activities. The International Affairs Division within the  NOA acts as the National Unit of Europol and is the national point of contact for international  police cooperation (Polisen, n.d. a).  Finally, Sweden is part of the Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol,  n.d.c).  2.16.1.4. Judiciary  The Swedish Prosecution Authority (Åklagarmyndigheten) and the Swedish Economic  Crime Authority (Ekobrottsmyndigheten) are the national authorities that carry out public  prosecution tasks (Council of the European Union, 2017b) (Åklagarmyndigheten, n.d.)  (Ekobrottsmyndigheten, n.d.).  The Swedish Prosecution Authority comprises the following offices:  • the National Anti-Corruption Unit, which deals with corruption;  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  78  • the National Unit for Environment and Working Environment Cases, which deals with  the environmental crimes;  • the National Security Unit, which deals with security-related cases;  • the National Unit against Organised Crime, which deals with organised cross-border  crime.  Cybercrime and criminal investigations fall under the responsibility of the general prosecution  service. In addition, the Swedish Prosecution Authority has developed a network of prosecutors  who deal with cybercrime in the different regions of the country (Council of the European Union,  2017b).  The Swedish judicial system has ‘two parallel types of courts: Ordinary courts, which deal with  criminal and civil cases, and general administrative courts, which deal with cases relating to  public administration’ (European Union, n.d.l.).  ‘Cybercrime acts are dealt with by the general courts […] in the same manner as other criminal  acts’ (Council of the European Union, 2017b). The Swedish National Courts Administration  (Domstolsverket) (Swedish National Courts Administration, n.d.) is the coordinating organisation  for the Swedish courts.  Sweden also cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  2.16.2. Synergies and potential interferences  ‘The SC3 and the Civil Contingencies Agency are developing cooperation mechanisms at  operational as well as at strategic level’ (Council of the European Union, 2017b).  Cooperation mechanisms have also been established between LE and the CERT-SE. In  addition, collaboration between the private sector and financial institutions and LE has been  established, mainly based on information sharing.  As indicated in the interviews, there is a frequent exchange of information between the CSIRT  and LE communities as part of monthly meetings established to support their cooperation. In  addition, there is ‘spontaneous communication on a daily basis’ under the principle that ‘it is  better to share than not to share’. The cooperation mechanisms established between the two  communities have allowed them to complement each other when performing different tasks.  This is particularly the case in interactions with the victims of an incident/cybercrime. ‘In some  cases the LE provide CSIRTs with information’ so that they can notify ‘their community and […]  the victims. Examples are cases of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks and  ransomware’. The CSIRT community ‘has a responsibility to advise the victims of an  incident/cybercrime but cannot report the incident on behalf of the victim. CSIRTs do not have a  mandate that would allow them to reach out to the victims to obtain information. [On their side,  however,] LE are able to contact the victim and ensure their cooperation during an investigation  process.’ It was also stressed that the CSIRT community relies on the trust relationships  established with other CSIRT teams and organisations to ensure a flow of information and  smooth collaboration. On the other hand, ‘the LE community has a strong legal framework that  allows them to enforce their role and access information’.  As emerged from the interviews, ‘The national CSIRT [also] provides their technical expertise’ in  cases where they are ‘called as expert witnesses in court proceedings. An example was a fraud  case where CSIRT provided technical support in analysing evidence.’  Based on the feedback provided by the interviewees, ‘interferences have been noted due to the  different tasks that the CSIRT and LE community have. But through mutual efforts [and trust],  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  79  they have developed an understanding and have managed to benefit from each other’s skills.’  For instance, CSIRTs have been able to ‘support LE in evidence preservation if requested’.  Concerning the interaction between LE and the Judiciary, LEAs share with prosecutors  information connected to investigations. LEAs ‘share information with the judges only for court  proceedings. Intervention by a judge during an investigation is rare (mainly limited to cases  where decision needs to be made about restricting fundamental freedoms).’  2.16.3. Examples of training  The Swedish National Police Academy (Polishögskolan) provides training for police officers  (Polishögskolan, n.d.). The academy organises basic training for police officers in collaboration  with higher education institutes such as Växjö University and Umeå University. It also  coordinates participation in international courses such as those organised by CEPOL and the  Association of European Police Colleges (AEPC) (OSCE, n.d.).  The SC3 also organises training for LE and coordinates the exchange of expertise through its  website. It also participates in the ‘first responders e-learning’ package on IT forensics and IT  crime knowledge, in cooperation with ECTEG and supported by Europol, CEPOL, the United  Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Council of Europe (ECTEG, n.d.)  (Polisen, n.d. a).  The SC3 organises some training also for the prosecutors.  The Training Centre of the Swedish Prosecution Authority provides a specialised course on  cybercrime ‘in the mandatory initial training and in the further training for prosecutors’. In  addition, training in different areas is provided, such as on international legal assistance and on  the legal systems of other countries. The Prosecution Authority also shares through its website  a platform for prosecutors to exchange information and knowledge (Council of the European  Union, 2017b).  The Swedish Judicial Training Academy organises training programmes for the Judiciary.  Although specialised training on cybercrime is not offered, ‘the Academy organises annual  criminal law seminars on relevant topics’ (Council of the European Union, 2017b) (The Swedish  Judicial Training Academy , n.d.).  2.17. FINAL REMARKS  2.17.1. Overview of skills and competences  The technical complexity and the cross-border nature of cybercrime has challenged the  competences (including skills, knowledge, attributes and behaviours (IAEA, n.d.) (UN, n.d.)  (OECD, 2014) of CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary, driving the three communities to refine their  expertise and establish cooperation mechanisms. Interviews with country experts affirmed that  interferences can occur during incident handling and cybercrime investigations, but that the  communities make efforts to avoid such interferences, create effective partnerships and take  advantage of their synergies.  The CSIRT community holds the technical expertise that is required to detect and mitigate  cybersecurity incidents and restore cyber-secure environments. The LE and judiciary experts  interviewed highlighted that the technical competences of the CSIRT community are also  particularly valuable when it comes to assisting with evidence collection, preservation and  presentation before a court of law. In addition, several interviewees confirmed that the  information flow between CSIRTs and LE has been fundamental in ensuring operational and  strategic awareness of cyberthreats.  A CULTURE OF  SYNERGY  Established  cooperation and  spontaneous  communication  under the principle  that ‘it is better to  share than not to  share’.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  80  Although each Member State has its own specific operational and legal framework for shaping  the response to cybercrime, it emerged from the interviews that the LE community has an  institutional role and carries out the following tasks: determining whether a cybersecurity  incident has a criminal nature, conducting the investigation of cybercrime cases and reaching  out to the victims of such cases to advise them and ensure their collaboration. To perform these  tasks, the LE community applies its knowledge and expertise in digital forensics and criminal  investigations. Provided they have a legal mandate and the technical expertise, LEAs can  aggregate pertinent information on cybercrime cases using their own evidence collection  methods, directly from victims, but also through their LE counterparts in other countries and the  CSIRT community. In the evidence collection framework, the LE community bears the  responsibility for preserving the chain of custody and following the necessary procedures to  bring criminals to justice.  The LE investigative activities are closely monitored by the Judiciary and, in particular, by public  prosecution authorities. Depending on the judicial system of each Member State, a prosecutor  or an investigative judge is responsible for leading the cybercrime investigation process and has  the authority to issue warrants and instructions to support evidence collection activities. The  judiciary community (prosecutors or judges) assesses the admissibility of the evidence  collected, examines the witnesses and pronounces the verdict, determining the criminal and civil  liability of cybercrime perpetrators. In addition to their legal competences, given the technical  nature of cybercrime, the Judiciary needs to understand the technical matters to the extent  required to be able to judge whether a suspect has committed a crime and the relevant  circumstances to determine the sentence and they may require the support of the CSIRT  community, who provides technical reports and whose delegates may be invited as expert  witnesses before the courts.  The interviewees provided examples of training activities involving more than one community,  sometimes in the form of workshops or joint exercises. These joint training initiatives help  enhance the competences required to respond to cybercrime. As one of the interviewees  mentioned, joint trainings help the three communities to ‘harmonise terms, language and  understanding […] of cyber and cybercrime’. The three communities can then reach a ‘better  understanding [of] the role and how the other communities work’, they become more aware of  the skills and strengths of the other communities and can enhance their competences by  learning from each other. This also ‘helps them better understand their own role in the broader  picture’. For instance, the CSIRT community can learn more about investigative techniques and  ‘data acquisition, so that the data acquired by […CSIRTs] could more easily serve as evidence  in criminal and other types of proceedings’, and can acquire legal knowledge, for example ‘how  to identify if an incident is a crime, and what role LE has on that’. The LE community can obtain  a better insight into the different ways that the CSIRT community shares information, as well as  the tools used, and further knowledge on analysing data logs and performing incident analysis  in specific areas. The judiciary community can benefit by gaining more awareness of  cyberthreats and developing, in general, a better understanding of the technical aspects of  cybercrime. This is especially important as the interviews showed that each community tends to  lack a precise understanding of the others’ tasks. In fact, in most countries, interviewees of the  different communities provided different answers in some entries of the SoD matrix.  Moreover, because of the cross-border nature of cybercrime, all three communities need to  know about the different EU and international legal frameworks (notably the Convention on  Cybercrime (Council of Europe, 2003)). They also need to be familiar with existing architecture  including:  • The Blueprint for a Coordinated Response to Large Scale Cybersecurity Incidents and  Crises (‘the Blueprint’) (European Commission, 2017), the CSIRTs network and the  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  81  European Cyber Crises Liaison Organisation (‘EU CyCLONe’) network (25)), as well as  the European Cybercrime Centre (‘EC3’) and the Joint Cybercrime Taskforce (‘J- CAT’) at the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (‘Europol’),  the EU Law Enforcement Emergency Response Protocol (‘EU LE ERP’) and the 24/7  Points of Contact Network under the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (26)  (European Commission, 2021, p. Recital (5));  • The NIS Cooperation Group, the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre (‘EU INTCEN’),  the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox (Council of the European Union, 2017h) and cyber  defence-related projects launched under the Permanent Structured Cooperation  (PESCO) (27) (European Commission, 2021, p. Recital (5));  • ENISA that, as foreseen in the Cybersecurity Act (Article 7 par. 1), supports  ‘operational cooperation among Member States, Union institutions, bodies, offices and  agencies, and between stakeholders’ (European Parliament and Council of the  European Union, 2019) (European Commission, 2021, p. Recital (5));  • Integrated Political Crisis Response (‘IPCR’) arrangements via which the EU is able to  ‘coordinate its political response to major crises’ (European Commission, 2021, p.  Recital (5)).  Finally, the communities need to develop their competences and build organisational and  intercultural skills to liaise effectively with their counterparts from other EU/EEA Member States.  2.17.2. Differences of interests between the communities  Although the majority of interviewees experienced no major interferences in the cooperation  between the three communities, one of the main challenges identified was the difference of  interests between the communities, due to their distinct roles and duties.  For example, at the beginning of an investigation, the priority for both LE and the Judiciary is to  gather as much evidence as possible while keeping the case from the public, and to catch the  perpetrator(s), while the CSIRT’s work is to immediately stop the incident and mitigate damage.  CSIRTs often want to quickly inform their constituency and to announce that the incident or  attack has been stopped.  Furthermore, restoring a system after a cyberattack sometimes means losing precious  evidence, which means that LE must make a copy of the said system prior to the CSIRT’s  intervention. This can take up to a few days as it must be done following legal procedures, and  thus impacting the CSIRT’s response, which does not follow the same timescale as that of the  legal process. However, as underlined by one of the experts interviewed, ‘this is all about  maintaining the balance between handling the incident and investigating it by helping each other  and without interfering with each other’s work’.  Some organisational issues were also highlighted, especially the lack of resources allocated to  the fight against cybercrime, often resulting in a lack of capacity to efficiently deal with every  (25) The ‘EU CyCLONe aims at enabling rapid cyber crisis management coordination in case of a large-scale cross-border  cyber incident or crisis in the EU by providing timely information sharing and situational awareness amongst competent  authorities and is supported by ENISA, which provides the secretariat and tools. EU CyCLONe operates at the “operational  level', which is the intermediate in between technical and strategic/political levels.  The goals of EU CyCLONe are to:  • establish a network to enabling the cooperation of the appointed national agencies and authorities in charge of  cyber crisis management;  • provide the missing link between the EU CSIRTs Network (technical level) and the EU political level.  Due to its importance in the EU cybersecurity landscape, the European Commission proposal for the revised NIS Directive  envisions in Article 14 the formal establishment of the European Cyber Crises Liaison Organisation Network (EU –  CyCLONe)’ (ENISA, 2021m).  (26) A recent study of the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY) highlighted the benefits and  successful examples of international cooperation that stem from the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (Council  of Europe, 2020b).  (27) As stated in the Footnote 7 of the Commission Reccomandation (EU) 2021/1086 on building a Joint Cyber Unit  (European Commission, 2021), ‘In particular, the PESCO projects on ‘cyber rapid response teams and mutual assistance in  cyber security’ coordinated by Lithuania and on ‘cyber and information domain coordination centre’ coordinated by  Germany’.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  82  reported incident (CSIRTs and LE) and sometimes leading to an important lack of knowledge of  cybercrime related matters (Judiciary).  2.17.3. Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cooperation  It is indisputable that ‘The outbreak of COVID-19 has brought an immense change in the way  we conduct our lives. In this increasingly connected world, we can, fortunately, continue our  professional and private lives virtually’ (ENISA, n.d.b). Luckily, cooperation among the CSIRT,  LE, and judiciary communities has also continued during the pandemic crisis, and this is more  crucial than ever because ‘The COVID-19 pandemic renders individuals and society extremely  vulnerable in all respects’ (Council of Europe, 2020a) and ‘Criminals have quickly adapted their  techniques to exploit [the situation and] our fears around the COVID-19 pandemic’ (Europol,  2020).  It emerged in quite an unequivocal manner from the data collected in the interviews that, in all  sixteen countries analysed in this study, overall, the COVID‑19 pandemic has not hindered  cooperation between the CSIRT, LE and judiciary communities; instead, it has generally  become even closer and more frequent as online meetings tend to be less time-consuming than  in-person meetings.  Most of the interviewees highlighted that meetings in person occurred less frequently, although  in some countries ‘Face-to-face meetings continued to take place to discuss sensitive matters’.  Some meetings were postponed and some ‘joint training plans [were] disrupted’; however, more  meetings took place using video/teleconferencing, several events were moved online and  electronic communication, as well as the automatic exchange of information, overall seemed to  have increased: ‘There is more information sharing. The big change is that we moved physical  meetings to virtual ones.’ One of the interviewees stated that ‘Operations [were] still ongoing  despite the pandemic, to avoid interrupting investigations in most of the cases’. Some meetings  and court hearings were suspended and this represented a challenge, although it was  mentioned during an interview that in one of the countries analysed online courts were arranged  and this new practice allowed to drastically diminish the backlog.  In general, ‘the pandemic crisis did not negatively impact the effectiveness of the cooperation’  between the CSIRT, LE and judiciary communities. Most of the interviewees noted that at the  peak of the crisis, the COVID-19 restrictions ‘did not change the communication but rather made  it more present and more frequent – almost a daily interaction and exchange of information was  established. During this period [indeed], joint work and joint approaches were established  covering a broader scope of activities, including joint statements. In other words, COVID made  the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE take place not only on criminal investigations and  incidents but also on raising awareness.’ According to the interviewees, ‘The crisis [actually]  helped the institutions to enhance their distance working capacities, e.g. to organise meetings  through secure videoconference platforms’, and during the pandemic crisis ‘there was more  close cooperation on updates that needed to be provided to the Government’. One of the  interviewees defined the pandemic period as ‘a productive work period in terms of  communication since the exchanges were multiplied between the entities, especially CSIRTs  and LE. Cooperation with other communities was facilitated at the end. They had to adapt to the  electronic means and work more hours but they adapted well in the new situation.’  Interviewees however unanimously underlined that in-person meetings provide more  opportunities to network and develop trust. Concerns were expressed by the interviewees  regarding establishing trust with new members of the communities in a merely virtual  environment. The fact that such meetings cannot take place due to COVID-19 restrictions might  in the long run impact the cooperation among the communities as people get to know each  other less than if they regularly met in person.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  83  3. CONCLUSIONS AND WAYS  FORWARD  3.1.  CONCLUSIONS  This report is an updated and expanded version of the 2020 Report on CSIRT-LE Cooperation:  A Study of Roles and Synergies among Selected EU Member States/EFTA Countries published  in January 2021 (ENISA, 2021a).  Data for this report has been collected via desk research, interviews and compilation of a  Segregation of Duties (SoD) matrix. This report addresses the cooperation between CSIRTs  and LE and their interaction with the Judiciary, by discussing their roles, synergies and  interferences, competences and training initiatives.  The analysis in this report focused on Belgium, Czechia, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,  Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.  Using the analysis of the data collected, the conclusions summarised below were drawn.  • All countries analysed have signed the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on  Cybercrime and almost all of them have ratified it and the Additional Protocol on the  criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer  systems. A Second Additional Protocol to the Cybercrime Convention, on enhanced  co-operation and disclosure of electronic evidence adopted by the Committee of  Ministers of the Council of Europe in November 2021 ‘should be opened for signature  in May 2022’ (Council of Europe, n.d.f). Each country, however, has specific legislation  on cybercrime, which is mandated through many different national laws and different  criminal procedural law that governs investigations and the prosecution of  (cyber)crime.  • All countries analysed have a NCSS, which sets up the general framework for the  coordination and cooperation of all authorities and defines their roles and  responsibilities.  • In terms of incident response, in line with the NIS Directive, all countries analysed have  established national CSIRTs. However, although there are similarities, the way they  are organised and the position they have in the national institutional framework vary  from country to country.  • The way LEAs’ activities related to cybercrime are organised also varies from  country to country: some countries have specialised central cybercrime units, whereas  others have decentralised specialised units or both.  • The structure and organisation of the Judiciary also vary by country: in some  countries there are ‘specialised prosecutors or specialised structures within the  Prosecution Services dealing with cybercrime offences’, while in other countries ‘the  responsibility for dealing with such crimes usually lies “de facto” with specialised public  prosecutors and judges, who have been trained or have experience in the area of  cybercrime’ (Council of the European Union, 2017c).  • Among the three communities – CSIRTs, LE and Judiciary – different approaches and  different levels of cooperation exist. While operational cooperation, especially in  daily interactions and informal communication, seems to be well established,  sometimes it appears that more structured cooperation would be useful in order to  achieve a less fragmented information flow between the three communities. In  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  84  addition, there is a bigger gap in the interaction between CSIRTs and the Judiciary  than in the cooperation established between LE and the Judiciary and between LE and  CSIRTs.  • Normally LEAs are not solely involved in the detection and investigation of  cybercrimes. A key component of their role is the preventive aspects of cybercrime,  and it is here that cooperation with other communities, particularly the CSIRT  community, is very important to support preventive strategies. In particular, the  responsibility of cybercrime prevention is shared with CSIRTs since in most of the  cases they are the first of the three members detecting cyber incidents of criminal  nature within their constituents.  • CSIRTs and LEAs need to cooperate to decrease the risk of evidence being  compromised or destroyed.  • CSIRTs and LE may also cooperate during the analysis of evidence.  • CSIRTs play an important role in informing (potential) victims of cybercrime and in  providing them with information on how to report a crime to the Police and how to  enhance protection against future cybercrimes.  • CSIRTs may be called as witnesses in court, although this is not practised in all the  countries analysed. Moreover, when it happens, CSIRTs often provide written reports  and are rarely physically called to court.  • Several competences are required for incident handling and cybercrime investigation;  while each community has developed its own set of skills and knowledge, each could  benefit from the competences of the other communities.  • Some initiatives are in place to facilitate trainings within each community. Most of the  joint trainings involve two of the communities (e.g. CSIRTs and LE, or LE and the  Judiciary); however, there is a need for further initiatives and for trainings and  exercises that involve the three communities together.  • Secondment opportunities between the CSIRTs and the LE are rare. The reason  why varies depending on the country (e.g. lack of resources, organisational aspects,  and/or level of maturity of the CSIRTs).  • The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way CSIRTs, LE and the Judiciary  work together and interact. The greatest impact has been on training and workshop  events, as well as face-to-face meetings, which were cancelled in the early stages of  the pandemic and later delivered online. As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued,  the use of online tools to facilitate meetings and events has become in some instance  the norm and the communities adapted to the new way of working. Establishing trust  with new members of the communities in a merely virtual environment can be  challenging, but alternating virtual and physical meetings and/or organise hybrid  meetings (meetings with some participants in person and some participating remotely),  when possible, might help. Overall, there does not appear to have been a significant  impact of the pandemic on the ability of the three communities to cooperate. In some  instances, the level of vigilance and interaction among the communities has  actually increased, with even daily interaction taking place, to ensure that each  community is kept up to date.  COVID-19  The pandemic crisis  has changed the way  that CSIRTs, LE and  the judiciary work and  interact together. In  some instances, it has  actually meant  increased interactions  among the  communities.  Establishing trust with  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  85  3.2.  WAYS FORWARD  3.2.1. Possible extension of the analysis to additional countries  This report could be further expanded to cover all the remaining EEU/EEA Member States28.  With some adaptation of the methodology presented in the 2020 ENISA Report on CSIRT-LE  cooperation (ENISA, 2021a) the analysis could be extended also to additional countries other  than EU/EEA Member States.  3.2.2. Use the results to develop additional training material  In its continuous effort to provide training material for the CSIRT community, including on  cooperation with the LE community and other operational communities (ENISA, n.d.), ENISA  with the support of Europol’s EC3 has developed a handbook and a toolset which has been  published in January 2021 (ENISA, 2021). Such material has been piloted through two training  sessions (in August and October 2021) and further improved by ENISA in 2021 based on the  feedback received. In these pilot sessions representatives from Member States (from CSIRTs,  LE and Judiciary) and some European Union Institutions, Bodies and Agencies (EUIBAs)  discussed, also based on scenarios, topics related to the cooperation across the three  communities and learned more about these communities, including their needs and potential  synergies they could exploit.  Additional training material could be developed in the future based on the results of an analysis  extended to the remaining EU/EEA Member States29, and possibly also other countries, e.g.  Western Balkans 30.  3.2.3. Use the results to develop a catalogue of competences across  authorities in EU Member States and EFTA countries  A catalogue of the competences required during incident handling and cybercrime  investigations, with an indication of the authorities in each EU/EEA Member State that could  offer such competences, would help CSIRTs, LE and the Judiciary become more aware of the  skills and strengths of other communities in their country, and also across the EU and EEA  area. This would allow authorities to learn from each other’s initiatives and also facilitate the  provision of expertise where required for incident handling and/or criminal investigation. Such a  catalogue of competences could be developed using information collected using this  methodology (slightly adapting the questionnaire and the SoD matrix, if necessary, to further  focus on competences).  3.2.4. Use the results to develop decision support systems  The results of an extended analysis could help complete the picture and serve as a basis for the  development of decision support systems that a CSIRT, LE or Judiciary authorities could easily  consult to obtain information on which authorities play a role in the response to cyber incidents  of criminal nature These support systems can aid in decision-making and in taking actions in  cases where the evidence is located in several countries.  3.2.5. Develop common platforms to share information between LE and  CSIRT communities  Developing a common information sharing platform at national level could facilitate information  exchange between the three communities during the investigation of a cyber related criminal  28 The EU/EEA Member States not covered in this report are: Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Greece, Iceland,  Hungary, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Malta, Netherlands, and Slovakia.  29 See previous footnote.  30 For more information on Western Balkans, see for instance (European Commission, n.d. b)  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  86  offence. This could also help harmonise information sharing processes and as a consequence  limit the potential delays to the police investigation and the CSIRT intervention.  3.2.6. Organise joint training and exercises for the three communities  Wherever possible initiatives involving all three communities should take place at national and  cross-countries level. Examples of these initiatives are the two pilot training sessions organised  by ENISA in 2021 and described above.  Joint training would help the communities better understand each other’s capabilities, needs  and boundaries, to enable them to better respond in practice to cyber incidents of a criminal  nature by exploiting synergies and avoiding interferences.  2021 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  March 2022  87  4.

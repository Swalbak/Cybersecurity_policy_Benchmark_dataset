EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  The importance of a sound governance model for the implementation of the National  Cybersecurity Strategies (NCSSs) has been highlighted in numerous testimonies of the Member  States as well as included in the NIS and NIS2 Directive. However, each country deploys its  own governance model with a different level of maturity.  ENISA, taking on its mandate to support and promote the development, deployment and  implementation of the NCSS and accompanying governance models, produced this study on  \"Building Effective Governance Frameworks for The Implementation of National Cybersecurity  Strategies\". It analyses existing governance models to share a set of good practices when  developing a governance model and putting in place the different governance elements.  The proposed governance model consists of four layers with 10 sub-categories, and provides a  total of 28 good practices:  • Political governance  o Political processes;  o Roles and responsibilities; and  o Legal measures.  • Strategic governance  o Strategy itself and its implementation; and  o Risk identification and mitigation.  • Technical governance  o International standards and technical guidelines; and  o Use of technology, tools and certification schemes.  • Operational governance  o Awareness raising;  o Incident response; and  o Information sharing.  The good practices have been defined based on data collected through desk research and  interviews with experts and relevant stakeholders from the Member States. The data collected  has been analysed to identify trends, and effective instances across the different elements of  governance. While the interviews had a European focus with 19 interviews with stakeholders  from 18 EU Member States, the geographical scope of the desk research includes a global  outreach.  Finally, this report provides insights on KPIs and general indicators to monitor and evaluate the  status of implementation of the NCSS and its governance model.

INTRODUCTION  With the publication of the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive1 in July 2016 and  issuing of the draft agreement of the NIS2 in June 2022, the EU Member States have been  required to adopt a National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS). The NCSS should put forward  strategic principles, and guidelines, objectives and priorities to improve and maintain a higher  level of security in the context of network and information systems.  In this relation, and as stated by the EU Cybersecurity Act2, ENISA shall not only support the  Member States in developing national strategies but shall also promote the effective  deployment of those strategies and support the set-up of a governance model ensuring the  sustainability of the NCSS.  As part of its mandate, ENISA publishes a study focusing on the good practices around the set- up and deployment of a governance framework to support the implementation of the NCSS in  the EU. The objective of this study is to systematically review existing governance models  relevant to the deployment of a NCSS and to identify and select the most relevant instances,  lessons learned, and good practices from the EU Member States.  This study aims to collect insights on the definition of processes, roles, and responsibilities, the  subsequent deployment of monitoring measures, and to identify the main challenges and good  practices that the EU Member States put in place to ensure an effective governance framework  for the implementation of NCSSs.  3.1 METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH  The methodological approach used to gather the best practices of governance frameworks  relies on four main steps:  1. Desk Research: The first step involved conducting an extensive literature review to  collect good practices and trends on governance models. The desk research has been  focused on good practices adopted in the EU Member States, while insights collected  from around the world complement the analysis. A systematic literature review  approach has been deployed to review all documents coherently and to  methodologically assess the insights of each source in terms of relevance, usefulness,  and applicability.  2. Collection of experts and stakeholders’ points of view: In this context, 19  stakeholders from 18 EU Member States have been interviewed to gain first-hand  insights on the status of governance models across the EU Member States, and to  identify good practices, as well as challenges, needs and lessons learned. The national  stakeholders have all been part of the national authority or government body in charge  of the cybersecurity strategy.  3. Analysis of stocktaking input: The data collected through desk research and  interviews were subsequently analysed to identify good practices in the design of a  governance framework.  1 European Parliament and Council, (2016).

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  10  4. COMMON ELEMENTS OF  GOVERNANCE MODELS  This section defines a common understanding of the concepts of governance, cyber  governance, and governance models. Moreover, it highlights the main results and insights from  the literature review conducted on the topic of governance models of NCSS. By doing so it  outlines the main elements of different levels of governance and builds the framework for  analysis leveraged on in chapter 5.  4.1 DEFINITION OF GOVERNANCE, CYBER GOVERNANCE AND  GOVERNANCE MODELS  The desk research on governance models included 49 sources, reaching from academic and  scientific articles, over reports, to guides on how to develop governance models as well as  governance models themselves. The main focus of the geographical scope has been the EU,  nevertheless, inputs from other countries (e.g., USA) have been considered to ensure a wide  array of results and to also take into account the developments in other parts of the world.  4.1.1 Governance  The term governance is used in a plethora of different topics and different contexts. Following  the vast amount of available literature on the topic of governance, there is not one, all- encompassing definition that would hold across its different areas of application. Rather,  multiple but complementary, partly overlapping definitions exist to describe and detail what  ‘governance’ entails.  Stemming from the original meaning of ‘governing’ in the context of individual rule it is and has  been used throughout time often about institutional structures. The concept originally describes  actions and processes to lead, structure, and enable institutions and organisations to exist,  function, and persist. Only recently, governance has been related to international institutions  and gained popularity. It has started to be used by international organisations such as the  European Union, World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Organisation for  Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) more frequently. Further, it has been stated  that since the concept has gained more popularity, governance became one of the most  controversially discussed topics when it comes to democracy theory and democratisation.3  Governance is predominantly seen as:  • a process to coordinate a network of stakeholders with independent positions,  opposing and conflicting opinions and interests;  • a mechanism to steer and control society, and results from the interaction of political,  economic and social actors;  • a complex system including different stakeholders from the public administration, the  private sector and non-governmental organizations, influenced by interactions thereof;  and  3 Savas  S. & Karatas, S.

Governance includes stakeholders from the  private sector, public administration as well as civil society and spans over different  topics such as economic, social and political priorities.  4.1.2 Cyber governance  The domains of cyber, cybersecurity and cyber threats experienced increasing importance, and  cyber governance became a popular topic. While the field of cyber or ‘cyberspace’ describes  the environment consisting of the global information systems and their connecting network,  cybersecurity entails the prevention of damage and the protection against attacks on, among  others, computers, information and communication systems as well as processes, data, hard-  and software.5 Threats in the cyberspace arise from attacks on the processed information or the  systems themselves. Cybersecurity is also part of the cyberspace and aims at securing the  confidentiality, integrity, accessibility, availability and privacy of the information processed,  stored and used.6 Given the interconnections in the cyberspace, cybersecurity cannot be  assessed, analysed or described without taking into account other aspects of cyberspace as  well.  The functioning of the cyberspace depends on various stakeholders, processes and elements  within cyber governance. International organisations started to find solutions for challenges  related to cyber governance, for example developing and signing the ‘Cyber Crime  Convention’'.7 In addition, international standardisation has been adopted, i.e., ISO/IEC  38500:2015 providing guiding principles8 for governing bodies’ members on “effective, efficient  and acceptable use of IT in their organizations”.9  Definitions of cyber governance are emerging and describe it as the  “Operation of decision-making processes” which increase and ensure “participation,  transparency, and accountability in taking measures related to cyberspace together  with the mechanism of international agreements, strategies, laws, measures,  regulations, and standards that interlock in the best way”.10  This definition will be used for the remainder of this study.  4.1.3 Governance Models  Similar to the definition of governance, a single definition of the governance model is not agreed  upon in the literature. Different types, descriptions and definitions have been developed  covering different levels of granularity. This section aims to provide an overview of the current  state of the art of developing governance models. To this end, structured desk research has  4 Savas  S. & Karatas, S.

In the literature, two main patterns of defining governance models are predominant, one  focusing on the different layers of governance and one targeting the stakeholders and  objectives of the model. An advantage of the latter is that overarching and transversal activities  can be integrated, analysed and evaluated. However, this might come at the expense of the  accuracy of the definition of the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders involved and their  accountability. The Government Cyber Security Strategy of the British Government employs this  path in defining its governance model and focuses on the overall objectives of the  implementation of the cybersecurity strategy.11  Defining a governance model based on its different layers might increase the overall complexity  of the framework, however, this option yields several benefits, including a more thorough  description of its components (e.g., stakeholders, objectives, etc.). In addition, it is possible to  provide a clear allocation of responsibilities and describe more detailed channels of  communication, information exchange and collaboration. The different levels of governance  include the political aspect, definition of processes, roles and responsibilities, operationalisation  of actions and their technical implementation. The Global Cybersecurity Index divides  governance models into legal, technical, organisational, capacity development and cooperative  measures.12 Similarly, cybersecurity governance in some US States focuses on the following  areas of governance, as identified by the Department of Homeland Security: Strategy and  planning, budget and acquisition, risk identification and mitigation, incident response,  information sharing, workforce and education.13  This report will follow the majority of sources analysed and will define governance models along  different levels or layers. This allows the provision of a more granular assessment of  governance models. The elements of the framework such as objectives, stakeholders and  actions can be described per level, providing a holistic approach to their definition.  While governance can be divided into a variety of levels, most sources assessed governance  along similar layers. Based on the conducted desk research four main levels of governance  have been identified as predominant, thus, these were selected to build the governance  framework of this report:  a) Political governance;  b) Strategic governance;  c) Operational governance; and  d) Technical governance.  The next section will provide an overview of the main elements driving each of the four levels of  governance.  4.2 THE STATE OF ART OF GOVERNANCE MODEL FOR NCS  In general, political governance is the most thoroughly covered level of governance in literature.  Specifically, the set-up of processes and the allocation of responsibilities to ensure a successful  governance framework are the most prominent elements.14 In addition, elements concerning  incident response in the context of operational governance have been pointed out by several  11 UK Cabinet Office, Government Cyber Security Strategy: 2022 to 2030, policy paper published by the UK Government,  2022, available https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-cyber-security-strategy-2022-to-2030.  12 ITU, Global Cybersecurity Index, ITU Publications, 2021, available at https://www.itu.int/pub/D-STR-GCI.01-2021.  13  Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, Cybersecurity Governance Publications, CISA Publications, 2017,  available https://www.cisa.gov/publication/cybersecurity-governance-publications.  14 Among others: ITU, Global Cybersecurity Index, ITU Publications, 2021, available at https://www.itu.int/pub/D-STR- GCI.01-2021; Savas  S. & Karatas, S.

In addition to the main elements governing the different levels of governance, the literature  emphasises the importance of monitoring mechanisms across all levels. Their establishment  along with the ones of key performance indicators (KPIs) or other measures for coherent  evaluation is important for the successful implementation of NCSSs. Chapter 6 covers the  monitoring of governance models in detail.  The remainder of this chapter will highlight the findings and point out the identified trends from  the desk research across the four levels of governance: political, strategic, operational and  technical. This provides the framework for the analysis carried out under chapter 5, which  focuses on the inputs shared by the Member States.  4.2.1 Political governance  Political governance provides a framework of defined processes and relationships as well as  legal guidelines. It establishes the formal angle of governance and is often seen as governance  itself, as it is tightly related to the execution of political actions and entails governing, leading  and overseeing processes and actions implemented. The main objective of the political layer is  the establishment of processes, roles and responsibilities to ensure the implementation of the  NCSSs and their related policies. In turn, official processes, clearly defined roles and proper  legal measures foster the creation of accountability, ensure transparency and facilitate the  acceptance of the NCSSs among all the relevant stakeholders.  Political bodies, such as dedicated cybersecurity agencies or departments within different  ministries are leading the political level. Hence, oftentimes, decision-makers are included in  some of the processes to ensure accountability and political acceptance. Other actors actively  participating in building and executing political governance are academia, consultancies and  other expert bodies, which provide topical expertise and support to political actors in setting up,  organising and executing political governance. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) play an  important role in the enforcement and accountability of political governance, as they help build  bridges between the private and the public sector, ensuring the implementation of actions  responding to industry needs.16  Common elements of political governance can be clustered into three main groups, as defined  in Figure 1, namely: i) Political processes, ii) Roles and responsibilities, and iii) Legal measures.  15 Among others: Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, Cybersecurity Governance Publications, CISA Publications,  2017, available https://www.cisa.gov/publication/cybersecurity-governance-publications; ITU, Global Cybersecurity Index,  ITU Publications, 2021, available at https://www.itu.int/pub/D-STR-GCI.01-2021; Cybersecurity foundation, The NCS Guide  2021, 2021, available https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/; ENISA, NCSS Good Practice Guide, ENISA Publications, 2016,  available https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ncss-good-practice-guide.  16  ENISA, Public Private Partnerships (PPP) – Cooperative models, ENISA publications, 2018, available  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/public-private-partnerships-ppp-cooperative-models.  https://www.cisa.gov/publication/cybersecurity-governance-publications https://www.itu.int/pub/D-STR-GCI.01-2021 https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ncss-good-practice-guide https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/public-private-partnerships-ppp-cooperative-models  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  14  Figure 1: Main elements of political governance  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  In general, political governance seems to be the most advanced of all four levels of governance,  in fact, measures to define political processes, roles and responsibilities seem to be most  actively discussed and analysed by the literature. Legal measures are not equally assessed,  however, their importance is vital as they set the basis for the country’s legal framework and the  obligations of the different stakeholders.  Political Processes  Among the elements of political processes, particular emphasis is put on initiating cooperative  and collaborative approaches and ensuring joint dialogues. In this context, the inclusion and  active participation of various stakeholder groups across different levels has been stressed17,  together with the creation and active integration of PPPs in the political processes given their  contribution in actively shaping the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of NCSSs.18  Additionally, the importance of inter-sectoral cooperation has been highlighted due to the  possibility of creating synergies and ensuring commitment to the implementation of actions  among stakeholders.19  In addition, cooperation and collaboration across the different governmental institutions are  essential to guarantee a coherent approach towards the implementation of the NCSSs. Intra- governmental coordination and cooperation are considered core functions and prerequisites for  functioning governance mechanisms, such as the application of standards, regulations and  market incentives. Hence, cooperation between government institutions is ultimately important  17 Savas  S. & Karatas, S.

It  has been stated that, given the international character of the cyberspace, a complete solution  for cyber governance cannot be based on national understanding alone, but needs to be  embedded and coordinated in the international arena.21 Further, international cooperation,  collaboration and exchange on the set-up of a governance model will benefit all parties through  the development and improvement of cyber governance. In this regard, the development of an  international common language for cyber defence is considered an immediate necessity to  enable international exchange among experts.22  Definition of roles and responsibilities  After the political processes, the definition of roles and responsibilities is the most covered  aspect in literature. All stakeholders must have clearly allocated roles, and responsibilities to  ensure the successful implementation of the strategy and achieving its objectives.23 In this  relation, it has been mentioned that personnel and financial resources should be clearly defined  and allocated. The clear allocation of responsibilities is important to ensure accountability of the  responsible actors, while the clear allocation of roles is important to set up an effective and  efficient governance system and avoid overlapping of mandates.  A common trend emerging from desk research is the setting-up of a lead authority or body.  While different options can be deployed to do so, a central body or actor taking the main  coordinating responsibilities and roles seems beneficial and is important to allocate actions and  monitor the progress of implementation.24 There are three commonly applied options: building  an entirely new body dedicated to the implementation of the NCSS; expanding the mandate and  the responsibilities of an already existing central body; or extending the responsibilities of  several decentralized political entities, such as ministries. In addition, working groups on  different topics might be established to enable engagement across bodies and entities  involved.25 They facilitate and develop formalized cooperation mechanisms to enable  international collaboration.26 Finally, the establishment of an advisory council built by academic  and industry experts to be consulted by responsible government officials has been pointed out  as particularly beneficial.27  Another option refers to the partial or full outsourcing of the cybersecurity services to PPPs by  establishing them as stand-alone organisations. This is particularly helpful if the government  misses the expertise or capacity to react to the identified needs for action. The PPPs provide  20  Sutherland, E.

The organisation, structure and legal basis of PPPs differentiate from  country to country, however, a common factor pointed out by several sources is the relevance of  including governmental and private sector representatives (e.g., SMEs) in the PPP decision- making process.29  Legal measures  Regarding legal measures for governance models, it has been stressed that the establishment  of a legal framework or a legal governance system is important to provide guidance and  support. Additionally, the existence of legal measures provides legally binding mandates and  ensures enforcement, accountability and transparency during the implementation process.30 On  implementing legal measures, it has been specified that they should be built in a far-sighted  approach to be able to accompany future changes brought by digitalisation.31  To support the cooperative and collaborative approach, legal measures should be inclusive and  have general validity, to ensure that all institutions, organisations and related stakeholders are  committed to the NCSS, its governance model and the implementing actions. Legal measures  also help giving policies and actions for the implementation of a governance model a binding  character and are hence essential tools of a complete governance model.32  In line with the importance of setting up international cooperation and collaboration, the legal  framework should reflect this by international guidelines and cooperation on the definition of  legal measures internationally. Lastly, it is emphasised that human rights should be tightly  connected to and taken into account in all processes of setting-up a cybersecurity governance  model, but specifically related to the legal framework. Of particular importance is ensuring trust,  transparency, and equity through the legal framework.33  4.2.2 Strategic governance  Strategic governance describes the level of governance directly linked to the NCSS. It is  important to tightly connect the processes of designing the strategy and designing its  governance model to ensure continuity and coherence. Strategic governance targets linking and  coordinating the processes of drafting the strategy and building the governance model from the  outset. Additionally, strategic elements of identifying and mitigating risks necessitate strong  cooperation and collaboration between actors involved in both, the governance model, as well  as the strategy development.  The main stakeholders involved in the strategic governance level are political actors drafting the  strategy. Often, working level government officials are main actors here, while higher level  government officials are involved for validation, acceptance, accountability and enforcement  purposes. Political actors are often supported by working groups, consulting bodies and other  28  Marsh & McLennan, MMC Cyber Handbook 2021 – Cyber Resilience Perspectives: Clarity in the midst of Crisis,  MarshMcLennan Publications, 2021, available https://www.marshmclennan.com/insights/publications/2020/october/mmc- cyber-handbook-2021-.html.  29  ENISA, Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) – Cooperative models, ENISA publications, 2018, available  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/public-private-partnerships-ppp-cooperative-models..  30 Cybersecurity foundation, The NCS Guide 2021, 2021, available https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/.  31 Savas  S. & Karatas, S.

Overall, three clusters have been identified in which the main elements of strategic governance  can be grouped, namely elements concerning: i) the strategy itself, ii) the implementation of the  governance model, iii) strategic aspects of risk identification and mitigation. Figure 2 illustrates  them.  Figure 2: Main elements of strategic governance  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  Elements concerning the strategy itself and the implementation of a governance model  Firstly, the literature on strategic governance emphasises that already at the set-up stage of the  strategy, the development of a governance framework should be taken into account and  included in the strategy. Drafting the strategy and at the same time already including possible  operational, political and legal measures, which should be put in place for the strategy’s  implementation, is argued to be beneficial, as processes and timelines are streamlined.34  Secondly, after the strategy has been drafted, the implementation should be guided by an  implementation plan to point out specific actions and ensure the support of the strategy across  the different governmental and civil society levels.35  Thirdly, thorough planning and a clear indication of the overall planned priorities, the foreseen  budget and resources is important to integrate the implementation of cybersecurity in the  general national planning and governance approaches. It is important to align priorities of the  34 Cybersecurity foundation, The NCS Guide 2021, 2021, available https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/.  35 Cybersecurity foundation, The NCS Guide 2021, 2021, available https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/; ITU, Global Cybersecurity  Index, ITU Publications, 2021, available at https://www.itu.int/pub/D-STR-GCI.01-2021; Marsh & McLennan, MMC Cyber  Handbook 2021 – Cyber Resilience Perspectives: Clarity in the midst of Crisis, Marsh McLennan Publications, 2021, available  https://www.marshmclennan.com/insights/publications/2020/october/mmc-cyber-handbook-2021-.html.  https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/ https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/ https://www.itu.int/pub/D-STR-GCI.01-2021 https://www.marshmclennan.com/insights/publications/2020/october/mmc-cyber-handbook-2021-.html  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  18  cybersecurity strategy with other governmental priorities on national level. This fosters  commitment and support from different bodies, and actors across the government.36  Risk identification and mitigation  Regarding the strategic elements of risk identification and mitigation, it has been stressed that a  coherent approach across all government entities and critical infrastructure operators should be  aimed for. Having a sound approach for risk identification and mitigation, which is coherent  across the different actors, facilitates exchange and information-sharing and fosters  cooperation.37 In fact, the creation of specific agencies providing services of risk identification  and mitigation has been pointed out, as centralizing these aspects facilitates exchanges.  However, challenges related to accountability, transparency and the protection of human rights.  This should be taken into account and mitigated from an early stage of the strategy.38  4.2.3 Operational governance  Operational governance entails the level of governance focusing on elements related with the  translation of NCSSs into actions to improve cybersecurity within the country. The objective of  the operational governance level is to increase cybersecurity across all sectors of a nation’s  society, economy, and government. The main group of stakeholders, actively involved in the  set-up and execution of this governance layer includes specialised bodies such as Computer  Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and Computer Emergency Response Teams  (CERTs), government officials and consulting and training bodies. Nevertheless, it is important  to mention that the complete society and population is connected to this level of governance.  Effectively improving cybersecurity can only be successful if the general public of a country is  included and capacity and community-building efforts are undertaken across society.  As pointed out, some aspects falling under the operational governance level are well covered in  literature on governance models. This applies particularly to aspects in the context of incident  response and capacity-building.39 During the desk research, three main clusters governing  operational governance have been identified: i) awareness-raising campaigns, outreach  campaigns and trainings to foster capacity-building, ii) incident response, iii) information sharing  and channels Figure 3 illustrates them:  36 Cybersecurity foundation, The NCS Guide 2021, 2021, available https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/; Marsh & McLennan, MMC  Cyber Handbook 2021 – Cyber Resilience Perspectives: Clarity in the midst of Crisis, Marsh McLennan Publications, 2021,  available https://www.marshmclennan.com/insights/publications/2020/october/mmc-cyber-handbook-2021-.html.  37 Cybersecurity foundation, The NCS Guide 2021, 2021, available https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/.  38  Sutherland, E.

Awareness raising campaigns, outreach campaigns and trainings to foster capacity-building  Awareness raising and outreach campaigns accompanying the implementation of NCSSs foster  the acceptance and uptake of cybersecurity measures. It is of utmost importance to train  stakeholders, which are involved either directly with the set-up or implementation of the strategy  or involved in combating cybercrime.40 Nevertheless, there is a strong trend incentivising the  creation of initiatives to raise awareness within the general population. Through explaining  “why”, “how” to use certain standards, tools and technologies, or “what” to do and “why” to do  so, would increase the safety of the general population.  In this sense, it has been repeatedly stated that not only stakeholders and actors directly  working with the NCSSs should be targeted by education campaigns and trainings, but that  instead the whole population, starting from a young age, should be integrated in these activities  to close the ‘cyber skill gap’.41  This would be important to ensure success of the NCSS, as  huge cyber risks emerge from untrained persons, which are not aware of risks or how to protect  against cyber threats effectively. A more holistic approach should be taken in order to build a  cybersecurity culture and enhance capacity- and community-building across the population. In  this way, by shifting away from pure information-sharing and problem-related approaches,  cybersecurity could yield efficiency and performance gains for the private sector and the  national economy.42  Incident response mechanisms  Operational governance is also driven by formalised mechanisms for incident response.  Literature suggests the creation of CSIRTs and CERTs to provide support in case of  cybersecurity incidents. Specialised teams dedicated to cybersecurity mechanisms should be  40 Cybersecurity foundation, The NCS Guide 2021, 2021, available https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/.  41 Savas  S. & Karatas, S.

CSIRT and CERT bodies should hence take proactive as well as reactive  functions and measures to not only support during incidents, but to also prevent incidents from  happening and support countries in learning from experience to build resilience against  cyberthreats.44  Information sharing  Setting-up formal information-sharing programmes as well as defining possible informal  information-sharing programmes through an operational framework would foster effective and  consistent coordination.45 Trusted relationships are highly important, more specifically, the  development of informal networks would be highly beneficial as information-sharing based on  personal interests is most authentic.46 However, trusted relationships need time to develop and  hence, the involvement of different stakeholders and close cooperation from the start seem to  be important.47 Additionally, according to research, shaping information-sharing processes  should be supported by CERTs and CSIRTs.48  For a successful incident response, it is highly important in this context to firstly define clearly  what a cybersecurity incident constitutes, and how processes, roles and responsibilities are  allocated and performed during an incident.  4.2.4 Technical governance  The technical level of governance relates to the inclusion of technology and technical elements  accompanying the implementation of the strategy. Its objective is to link the implementation of  the strategy to technical and technological developments happening in parallel. This is  particularly important in the cyberspace, a fast-evolving field, in which new threats and  challenges arise at the same time of new technological possibilities and solutions. The main  stakeholders involved in this level are technology experts from industry and academia,  supporting political actors in choosing and applying technological tools as well as technical  standardisation bodies on a national and international scale.  Currently, the elements of technical governance are covered least in the literature and seem to  not yet been heavily focussed on. Although some trends have been identified, due to the low  coverage of technical aspects across literature, these trends might not be representative, given  the fast technical advancements and developments. Two main clusters of elements governing  technical governance have been identified during the desk research: i) definition of standards  and specification, and ii) use of technology, tools and certification schemes to foster  cybersecurity. They are illustrated in Figure 4.  43 Cybersecurity foundation, The NCS Guide 2021, 2021, available https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/.  44 ITU, Global Cybersecurity Index, ITU Publications, 2021, available at https://www.itu.int/pub/D-STR-GCI.01-2021.  45 Cybersecurity foundation, The NCS Guide 2021, 2021, available https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/  46  Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, Cybersecurity Governance Publications, CISA Publications, 2017,  available https://www.cisa.gov/publication/cybersecurity-governance-publications.  47  Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, Cybersecurity Governance Publications, CISA Publications, 2017,  available https://www.cisa.gov/publication/cybersecurity-governance-publications.  48 Savas  S. & Karatas, S.

Standardisation  The use and definition of standards has been emphasised in order to build a technical  governance framework for cybersecurity. Particularly important in this relation would be the use  of international and global standards to not only provide technical guidelines but to base  cybersecurity governance on existing and globally established technical standards.49  Use of technology, tools and certification schemes  The technical layer also includes the undertaking of appropriate and proportionate technical and  organisational measures to manage risks. To this end the NIS2 directive emphasises the  importance of certification schemes and stresses the importance for the Member States to  require essential and important entities to certify certain ICT products, ICT services and ICT  processes under specific European cybersecurity certification schemes.  Moreover, CSA article 58 defines mandatory obligations for the Member States to designate  NCCAs (National Cybersecurity Certification Authorities) or to reuse the existing NCCA of  another Member State, as to supervise certification; this entails the implementation and  assessment of the technical governance activities related to such obligations (which entity has  been designated, to which ministry it belongs, how it is staffed, how it interacts with other  national authorities having a cybersecurity role, etc.).  A second main element emerges from the use of technology and tools to support the set-up of a  governance model and the implementation of the NCSSs. Updating tools and technologies used  in industry, by the government or other communication systems, can support reaching the  NCSS’s objectives. In addition, technology and tools such as mobile devices can not only  support security but can also provide technological guidance and open possibilities to promote  human rights in the sphere of cybersecurity.50 However, if not updated, tools and technology  may pose risks to cybersecurity.  49  NIST, Cybersecurity Framework, NIST Publications, 2018, available, https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/resources;  NIST, Success Stories – Israel National Cyber Directorate v. 1.0, 2020, available  https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/success-stories/israel-national-cyber-directorate-version-20; Savas  S. & Karatas, S.

Figure 5 below showcases the status of  each country of developing updated versions and new editions of their NCSS.  Figure 5: State of Art: NCSSs across the EU Member States  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  All 18 Member States51 interviewed for this report have currently a governance model in place  to support the implementation of the NCSS. Similarly, all Member State representatives stated  that having in place a governance model is highly important when implementing the NCSS.  Figure 5 provides an overview of the EU Member States which have deployed their first NCSS  governance model and highlights in a darker blue those countries which already employed later  editions of the governance model. In general, it can be said that the NCSSs are updated every  three to seven years. The governance model would need to be updated as well, taking into  account recent developments in the cyberspace due to its close relationship with the NCSS.  51 The following Member States have been interviewed during this study: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic,  Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  23  Figure 6: State of Art: Deployment of governance models for NCSS across the EU Member  States  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  From Figure 6, it can be noticed that some countries introduced an accompanying governance  model over the years, and that some countries introduced it only after the first NCSS was  already deployed. While this shows that the Member States used to have different approaches  to implementing their NCSSs, it also indicates growing agreement of the importance of setting- up a governance model. It is interesting to notice that maturity of the governance model does  not necessarily depend on or correlate with the number of further editions of the NCSS.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  24  5. SETTING UP A  GOVERNANCE MODEL  Following the identification of the different levels of a governance model, this section will focus  on the analysis of the different elements of each layer and will highlight the good practices  shared by the Member States’ representatives during the conducted interviews.  Before diving into the different governance models, it is important to have an overview of the  political systems of the EU Member States to understand whether this factor influences the  selection of a specific governance model. Figure 7 illustrates the model of government and self- governance of the Member States. Regarding the government model, out of a total of 27  Member States, 21 countries have a parliamentary political system52, one has a presidential  political system53 and five have a semi-presidential political system54. While, with regard to the  self-governance model, out of a total of 27 Member States, 18 of them have unitary self- governance55, three of them have federal one56, two a devolved self-governance57 and four of  them have a federate one58.  To analyse the relation between a country’s government model, self-governance structure and  the type of governance model of the NCSS currently deployed, the different governance models  highlighted during the interviews have been mapped against desk research on government and  self-governance types. It has been noted that there is no correlation between the type of  government, self-governance, and the governance model of the NCSS. In fact, there are  several additional factors that influence its definition. For instance, the size of a country, its level  of maturity in the cyber domain, and the level of cooperation with the private sector, just to  name a few. This finding led to the conclusion that it is not possible to have a unique  governance model to be used as a reference. Therefore, in this chapter, for each element of the  different levels of governance, good practices rather than a governance model will be shared.  52 A parliamentary political system is a democratic form of government in which the party (or a coalition of parties) with the  greatest representation in the parliament (legislature) forms the government, its leader becoming prime minister or chancellor.  53 A presidential political system is a form of government in which a head of government, typically with the title of president,  leads an executive branch that is separate from the legislative branch in systems that use separation of powers.  54 A semi-presidential political system is a system of government in which a president exists alongside a prime minister and  a cabinet, with the latter two responding to the legislature of the state.  55 A unitary state is a system of political organization in which most or all the governing power resides in a centralized  government.  56 A federal self-governance is characterized by a union of partially self-governing provinces, states, or other regions under  a central federal government (federalism).  57 A devolved self-governance is a statutory delegation of powers from the central government of a sovereign state to govern  at a subnational level, such as a regional or local level. It is a form of administrative decentralization.  58 A federated state is a territorial and constitutional community forming part of a federation. Such states differ from fully  sovereign states, in that they do not have full sovereign powers, as the sovereign powers have been divided between the  federated states and the central or federal government.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  25  Figure 7: Member States' political system of governance  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  In the preliminary phase of the interviews, the Member States shared the key elements  influencing the national approach to the governance model of their NCSS, as well as the main  challenges faced during its deployment. The key challenges have been assessed and grouped  to provide an overview of the main challenges, experienced by several of the Member States.  Table 1 presents the key challenges while Table 2 provides an overview of the related lessons  learnt. It can be noticed that the most underlined difficulties are related to the definition of roles  and responsibilities, the lack of coordination and cooperation as well as the challenge in  reaching a common agreement between the different stakeholders.  Table 1: Key challenges when deploying the governance model  Key Challenges  1 Definition of roles and responsibilities  Given the number of stakeholders involved, a lack of understanding of the different roles in  the overall picture and duplication of efforts may happen.  2 Lack of coordination and cooperation  Given the complex structure of some National Cybersecurity systems, the existence of  several security authorities including regional competent authorities, coordination, and  cooperation between the different actors is a challenge.  3 Reach a common agreement on the strategy  Given the number of stakeholders involved, reaching an agreement on both, the main goals  of the strategy and its phrasing, seems to be difficult.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  26  Key Challenges  4 Information sharing  Given the number of different stakeholders involved in the implementation of the strategy,  and therefore, included in the governance model, there were some difficulties in sharing  information among the different actors.  Considering the constantly changing field of cybersecurity, the flow of information is  sometimes too slow, especially in terms of regulation and organisation.  5 Definition of the overall strategy’s budget  Considering the decentralized governmental approach of some countries, significant delays  may occur in receiving the budget or in obtaining a dedicated budget.  6 Achieve a higher level of national cyber security and resilience  Given the increasing cyber risks and the global geopolitical situation, some Member States  are struggling to cope with the new cyber challenges.  7 Timeline of the development and implementation of the NCSS  In fact, it would be more beneficial to develop and approve the implementation plan and to  define the governance model, at the same time as the NCSS.  8 Lack of enthusiasm  Given that for some stakeholders the cybersecurity strategy is an extra workload while they  are already engaged in numerous other activities, a lack of enthusiasm and motivation could  be noticed, which indirectly hinders the good performance and implementation of the  strategy.

Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  5.1 POLITICAL GOVERNANCE  The political governance level has been proven to build a highly important part of the  governance model. All Member States’ representatives indicated that political governance is  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  28  currently part of their governance model. It aims to clearly define political processes, identify  and assign roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders, and put in place legal measures  to support the deployment of the strategy.  Overall, three clusters of elements of political governance have been identified during the desk  research. These have been further detailed and validated through stakeholder consultation.  Figure 8 shows the percentage of stakeholders, interviewed in the process of this study,  validating the element of political governance.  Figure 8: Percentage of interviewed stakeholders confirming elements of political governance  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  5.1.1 Political processes  Focus on cooperative and collaborative approaches at international, inter-sectoral and regional  levels  An important element of the political governance is the inclusion of cooperative and  collaborative approaches at international, inter-sectoral and regional levels. All the stakeholders  interviewed confirmed that this element is already part the currently deployed governance  model in their country.  The EU Member States follow different approaches to defining cooperative and collaborative  aspects of political processes. Some Member States define those in the NCSS itself, while  others detail them in the accompanying governance model or the legal framework.  At the national level, strategies focus more on the collaboration between governmental entities  and across sectors.  GOOD  PRACTICE  An international  commitment and  collaboration with  international  organisations and  other countries is  mentioned as a key  objective of the  strategy.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  29  At the international level, most Member States cooperate to varying degrees with European  institutions such as ENISA, Europol, etc. However, some Member States are interested in  further developing this collaboration to also promote human rights, fundamental freedoms and  democratic values in the cyber domain to ensure that it remains a global, open, stable and  secure space, in which international law and shared principles are respected.  Main Observations  Providing political support: political authorities must take the cyber security topic  seriously, get involved and support the development and implementation of its NCSS and  governance models together with the other stakeholders. Governments should balance  between facilitating and stimulating ownership and creating responsibilities for other  stakeholders.  Ensure adequate coordination and cooperation among relevant players: a specific  action plan for each of the relevant agencies should be developed, to define activities to  be conducted about the strategic goals of the strategy.  Build trust between the different stakeholders: the most inclusive approach possible  should be followed to collect inputs from the different parties involved. The level of  participation in the decision-making process may vary according to the political setup of  the country.  Follow participatory approaches by putting in place platforms of exchange where  public sector entities, such as the government, its bodies and agencies are collaborating  with NGOs, and stakeholders from the private sector but also from the scientific community  and academia. This will facilitate cooperation across different actors from different domains  to collect relevant insights.  Focus on participatory approaches, including various stakeholder groups  It is important to include other stakeholders such as academia, consultancies and other expert  bodies, PPPs and representatives of critical infrastructures in the deploying of the NCSS.  Participatory approaches have been identified as an important element of political governance  and have been validated as such by most of the stakeholders interviewed. 89% of the  interviewed Member States confirmed that this element is part of the currently employed  governance model.  Main Observations  Involve all the stakeholders in the process of developing an NCSS and a governance  model: Every institution, private company, and individual can positively contribute to the  development of cyber security. Thus, at least the following stakeholders should be involved  in the process:  • Government bodies and agencies;  • Private actors such as SMEs or private industry such as internet providers or  telecom operations;  • Critical infrastructure operators;  • Law enforcement agencies;  • Scientific community; and  • Academia.  Hence, it is crucial to have an open dialogue through bilateral and multilateral discussions  with all the relevant actors.  GOOD  PRACTICE  In order to avoid  duplications of efforts  and overlapping  mandates of the  different agencies, a  flexible decision - making process that  allows for  amendments should  be put in place to  provide for an agile  process open to  developments in the  ecosystem.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  30  Define a clear allocation of roles and responsibilities in the governance model: The  definition of roles and responsibilities starts with the political decision on the level of  representation for the different stakeholders, continues with the definition of allocation of  roles and responsibilities and is finalised by the creation of a monitoring plan for each  initiative to track the implementation of the actions. A clear allocation is fundamental to  avoid the creation of overlaps of mandates among agencies and the creation of a  mechanism that holds the different stakeholders accountable.  Set up of a collaboration platform: following the creation of a concrete action plan to  implement the objectives of the strategy, the set up a collaborative platform is a powerful  tool to monitor the level of implementation of the NCSS and to engage the different  stakeholders regularly. Additionally, the platform can bring together the public and private  sectors and foster the exchange of information.  Collaboration with PPPs  PPPs play an important role in the enforcement and accountability of political governance, they  help support the inclusive approach in setting up the strategy and its governance model. This  has been validated by most of the stakeholders interviewed: 13 of the 19 Member States’  representatives interviewed confirmed that PPPs are currently employed in their actual  governance model. For the 5 other Member States, PPPs are not explicitly mentioned in the  strategy or governance model, but this it is highly encouraged by the country’s authorities.  Depending on the sector, the Member States adopt a hybrid approach. In some instances, the  collaboration is outsourced to independent PPPs, while in others, it takes place between  government entities and PPPs.  The collaboration with the PPPs takes place between the government (different ministries) and  the national bodies responsible for cybersecurity. Depending on the domain being discussed  and the stakeholders involved, meetings are organised on a recurrent basis and can vary from a  weekly to a monthly basis. The nature of the collaborative approach may change according to  the topic being addressed.  Main Observations  Support from the highest political level in the creation of PPPs: Interviews with  Member State representatives highlighted the importance of public sector support and  willingness to collaborate with the private sector due to the higher reactivity of the private  one to the ever-changing cyber ecosystem.  5.1.2 Roles and responsibilities  Creation of specialised government authorities, bodies and agencies to ensure governance of  cybersecurity  The establishment of specialised government bodies to ensure the governance of cybersecurity  has been identified as an important element of political governance. This has been validated by  all the interviewed stakeholders, all of them have in place specialised government authorities,  bodies, and agencies to ensure governance of cybersecurity.  The aim of the creation of a specialized body or agency in the cyber domain is to supervise,  coordinate and monitor the deployment of the NCSS, and to ensure the coordination of the  alignment of all the relevant stakeholders.  GOOD  PRACTICE  In the reporting phase  for the implementation  of the different  initiatives of the NCSS,  it is important to set up  a framework that  supports collaboration  among stakeholders  rather than  competition. A good  practice is to impose a  simultaneal  submission of the  regular reports from  the different  stakeholders.  GOOD  PRACTICE  Deploy a web platform  leveraged to collect,  assess and evaluate  the inputs entered by  the private and public  stakeholders and  provide updates on the  state of play of the  strategy.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  31  Depending on the country, the central body or agency responsible for cybersecurity can have  different type of mandates and varying roles on the implementation of the NCSS. If in some  countries as Estonia the cybersecurity centre is the main body overseeing the activities related  to cybersecurity and sharing information with state authorities and private companies, in some  other instances such as Denmark, the centre plays more a supportive rather than a governing  role.  For those Member States that do not have a dedicated cybersecurity centre in place, an  alternative committee is generally set up with the role of political coordination among parties.  Main Observations  Mandate a single body to ensure the coordination and the implementation of the  overall strategy: this will allow to allocate specific roles, responsibilities, actions and follow  the progress of the implementation.  Creation of roles and allocation of responsibilities related to national and international  cooperation on cybersecurity  The definition of roles responsibilities related to international cooperation on cybersecurity has  been identified as quite an important element of the political governance. This has been  validated by almost all the interviewed stakeholders, in fact, 84% of them has defined in their  governance model clear roles, responsibilities and task in case of incident.  Main Observations  Define in a very precise way roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders:  In the strategy, there should a dedicated section defining the roles and responsibilities,  on the national as well as international level to avoid duplication of work and better monitor  the implementation of the strategy.  Define the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders in the same  document: it will allow to have an overview of the objectives, the tasks, and the  stakeholders in charge of implementing them. Thus, it will help to better monitor the  implementation of the strategy.  Creation of PPPs  Although not all the Member States interviewed (63%) currently have strong PPPs in place, it  can be noticed that this aspect is very important and is increasingly encouraged by the different  authorities.  Main Observations  Create PPPs: the creation of PPPs is a powerful tool supporting the development and  deployment of the governance model. It permeates the strategy to strengthen the cyber  resilience of the country and society. As cyberspace is composed of ICT products and  services mainly produced or provided by private entities, the strategy should take into  consideration close cooperation and continuous public-private consultation.  GOOD  PRACTICES  International cooperation  can be fostered through:  • Creation of a  coordination group  to liaise for the  participation in the  different  international  exchanges;  • Definition of  working groups to  interact with  international  organisations;  • Development of  specific procedures  for the allocation of  responsibilities and  roles related to  international  cooperation.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  32  5.1.3  Legal measures  Establishment of a legal governance/legal framework linked to specific legal measures  The establishment of a legal governance/legal framework linked to specific legal measures has  been identified as quite an important element of the political governance. 58% of the  interviewed Member States have already in place a legal framework linked to specific legal  measures.  In Europe, there is a common legal ground defined by legal acts as the NIS Directive, however,  it is entrusted to each country the definition of a proper legal framework that supports the  implementation of the strategy and the correct allocation of roles and responsibilities, as well as  resources. Based on the interviews conducted, the definition of a legal framework is a sign of  the maturity of the country, and it fosters the allocation of budget to the implantation of the  NCSS, as well as the clear definition of mandates for the involved bodies. All these elements  provide more stability and empower the governance model related to the NCSS.  Main Observations  The governance framework is supported by and defined by the legal framework: the  legal framework is composed of newly introduced legal measures as well as already  existing legal measures whose scope has been enlarged to achieve the NCSS’s  objectives as well.  International cooperation about legal measures  International cooperation about legal measures has been identified as quite an important  element of political governance, as confirmed by 68% of the interviewed Member States.  First of all, it can be noticed that as members of the European Union, the interviewees are  involved in different European and international initiatives on cybersecurity. The same applies to  NATO member countries. For cooperation with non-European countries, MoUs (Memorandum  of Understanding) are generally used.  Regional coalitions such as Greece, Cyprus and Israel can also be seen joining forces to  enhance cooperation in the cyber security field.  Overall, an important part of the Member States strategies relates to the aspect that the actions  should be mirroring general trends and activities on the EU-level in order to ensure the  alignment with the EU trends.  Emphasis on human rights in legal measures/legal framework:  The emphasis on human rights in the digital sphere is not often covered by national legislation,  except for very specific cases as GDPR. Similarly, this aspect is not often included in the  Member States NCSSs. Nonetheless, many initiatives are taking place at European level (e.g.,  signing of the Berlin Declaration) given its recognised importance.  Main Observations  Develop a section focused on the human rights in the NCSS and its governance  model with explicit actions, responsibilities and roles.  GOOD  PRACTICE  Put in place a set of  guidelines, certification  schemes and sectorial  policies addressed to public  entities and private  operators.  • the support for the  development of  European and  international  cybersecurity  certification schemes  and standards;  • the promotion of the  inclusion of  cybersecurity requisites  in ICT procurement  activities of Public  Administrations.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  33  5.2 STRATEGIC GOVERNANCE  Aiming at coordinating the processes of drafting the NCSS and setting up the accompanying  governance model, strategic governance has been proven to build a highly important part of the  governance model. All representatives indicated that strategic governance is currently part of  the governance model employed in their country.  Overall, three clusters of elements of strategic governance have been identified during the desk  research as pointed out in chapter 4. These have been further detailed on and validated through  stakeholder consultation. Figure 9 here below indicates the percentage of interviewed  stakeholders confirming the existence of the identified elements of strategic governance in their  country’s NCSS.  a) Elements concerning the NCSS itself  • Foreseeing institutional support to implement the NCSS at the time of drafting  the strategy;  b) Elements related to the planning of the implementation of the governance model and  the strategy  • Pre-defining a governance model to implement the NCSS, at the same time  as drafting the NCSS;  • Planning and allocation of budget and resources and integrating cybersecurity  into the overall allocation thereof;  c) Elements of the strategic aspects of risk identification and mitigation.  • Risk identification and mitigation supported by created agencies;  • Coherent approach for risk identification and mitigation across government  entities and other critical infrastructure operators;  • Mechanisms to ensure accountability, transparency, and human rights during  risk identification and mitigation.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  34  Figure 9: Percentage of interviewed stakeholders confirming elements of strategic governance  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  As mentioned in chapter 4, the elements of strategic governance can be divided into two main  groups, elements which should be taken into account from the beginning when developing the  NCSS and elements that focus on the strategic aspects of risk identification and mitigation.  5.2.1 Elements concerning the NCSS itself  Foreseeing institutional support to implement the NCSS  The support of governmental entities or other public sector actors in implementing the NCSS  has been identified as an important element of the strategic governance layer to ensure  accountability of the strategy as well as support of a wider audience, triggered by wide political  and institutional support across government entities. As presented in Figure 9 this has been  validated by all stakeholders interviewed: all Member States’ representatives interviewed  confirmed that this element is part of the currently employed governance model.  The support of different governmental actors from the outset of developing the strategy is highly  important to reach consensus and to define a coherent governance model accepted throughout  all levels, ministries and sectors of government. While the governance model could be broken  down, as the strategy, vertically and horizontally and be focussed on by different governmental  actors, the overall NCSS should be agreed upon across the whole government and all involved  institutions.  5.2.2 Elements related to the planning of the governance model and  strategy’s implementation  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  35  Pre-defining a governance model to implement the NCSS  This element of strategic governance aims to put the processes of drafting the NCSS and  defining the governance model for the strategy’s implementation in parallel. It has been proven  most beneficial to adjust the timelines of both, the drafting of the strategy, and the planning of  the governance model or accompanying action plan to be run at the same time. By doing so, no  time is lost due to time lags between the drafting of the strategy and developing corresponding  actions for its implementation.  All stakeholders interviewed mentioned that this element is entailed in the current governance  model deployed. Additionally, it has been mentioned that while aligning the timelines was not  always ensured, it will be ensured for future strategies as well, as it has proven to be more  efficient for the implementation of the NCSS and to reach its objectives.  Planning of allocation of budget and resources and integration of cybersecurity into the overall  allocation thereof  The allocation of budget and resources to implement the NCSS is highly important, similarly is  the planning of the allocation from an early stage of the development of the NCSS and its  governance model. Thorough planning of the foreseen budget and resources is important to  integrate the implementation of the NCSS specifically and cybersecurity in general into the  overall national budget planning. Additionally, it is important to define general national priorities  and to place the priorities of the NCSS within these to ensure alignment across all national  priorities, budget and resource allocation and to properly integrate the NCSS and the  governance model into the overall policy framework.  A majority (79%) of the interviewed stakeholders stated that the allocation of resources and  budget is taken into account in the context of the NCSS and the accompanying governance  model. However, it has been pointed out that while this planning is taken into account, it is  rarely outlined in detail and most often performed separately from the definition of the NCSS  and the development of the governance model. To some extent, this is driven by the political  model employed by the states, i.e., the budget is mainly dealt with on the state level in  federalism, and not on a national level; alternatively, budget allocation is done per ministry and  hence, in a decentralised approach, if several ministries are accountable for different parts of  the implementation of the NCSS. It has been stated that specifying a dedicated budget for the  NCSS is recommended rather than allocating money to an overarching authority.  Main Observations  Developing the budget from bottom to top: Assign coordinators to each action, create  an implementation plan per action and estimate the number of resources and budget  needed to reach the defined objective. Afterwards, all budget estimates are aggregated  and an overall estimate for the implementation of the NCSS is drafted, which is then  included in the budget of the authority in charge as well as in the national budget.  Paragraph on financials in NCSS: The strategy itself includes a paragraph that  identifying the country’s investments in cybersecurity and defines an overall budget for  the implementation of the NCSS and its objectives. The budget is divided per  stakeholder/ministry in charge, rather than per objective.  5.2.3 Elements of the strategic aspects of risk identification and  mitigation  GOOD  PRACTICE  Including detailed  explanations of the  foreseen  implementation of the  NCSS and  references to the  strategy itself in the  action plan/ set-up of  the governance  model, while  referencing the action  plan/governance  model in the NCSS.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  36  Risk identification and mitigation supported by created agencies  Setting up a strategy for risk identification and mitigation is highly important in order to be  prepared for cyber threats and attacks, to identify and mitigate them. Desk research has shown  that a common practice is to create specialised agencies to support the implementation and  operationalisation of this element of governance. A small majority (58%) of the interviewed  stakeholders mentioned that this element is part of the currently deployed governance model of  their country.  The creation of specific agencies providing services of risk identification and mitigation has  been pointed out, as centralizing these aspects facilitates exchanges. It has been indicated that  there seems to be a general lack of risk management if no dedicated agency is in place, but  every critical infrastructure operator is responsible for risk identification and mitigation in their  domain and this might create gaps or overlapping measures. Nevertheless, not creating  dedicated authorities does not necessarily imply a lower level of efficiency in risk identification  and mitigation, e.g., the national cybersecurity responsible agency could also be appointed the  responsibility and lead the national activities.  Main Observations  Thorough risk identification across different levels: Agencies for identifying and  mitigating risks are created at national level, these deal with the central government and  critical entities. In addition, specific entities are created across the main sectors to cover  risk identification and mitigation from a more domain specific angle, e.g., health,  economic affairs, or climate. Lastly, leveraging on existing security and intelligence  agencies, whose responsibilities have been extended to also cover cybersecurity  aspects, could be a third option to build bodies responsible for risk identification. These  three options could be used complementary or as stand-alone.  Early on identification of risks and implementation of risk assessment: Discussions  to identify risks should take place during the process of drafting the NCSS already. The  process includes stakeholders from the competent authorities, agencies and private  sector as well as additional experts. The discussions should support on identifying  potential risks, assessing the risks and developing measures to address these. The  developed measures can be included in the NCSS or an accompanying action plan,  highlighting responsible actors, identifying actions, and objectives.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  37  Coherent approach for risk identification and mitigation across government entities and other  critical infrastructure operators  Applying a coherent approach for risk identification and mitigation across the involved  government entities and other involved critical infrastructure operators has been identified as  important element of the strategic governance level. It facilitates exchange and information  sharing in case needed and foster cooperation between the involved entities. The majority  (74%) of country representatives interviewed, confirmed this and pointed out that although a  coherent approach is difficult to implement, it is most often a clear goal of the NCSS.  While creating dedicated agencies for risk identification and mitigation facilitates the process, it  includes the risk of separating processes and actors and each body leveraging its own  approach.  Hence, this might hamper collaboration, cooperation and communication, which are  essentials for risk mitigation. Therefore, adopting a common and coherent approach is crucial.  Main Observations  Following a common methodology for risk identification: A document defining a  common methodology for identifying risks should be developed early during the process  of drafting the NCSS or when developing the governance model. Not differentiating  between public and private actors, the document provides a solid methodological baseline  for taking up a common approach for risk identification and mitigation across all involved  actors.  Following a common framework in case of incidents: Some countries set-up a  dedicated framework, which should be followed in case of incidents. The framework  includes step-by-step processes for different actors in case of specific incidents or risks  identified. The framework includes measures to be taken and also outlines dedicated  comprehensive requirements which need to be undertaken in case of risk identification.  This facilitates the uptake of a common approach across different actors.  GOOD  PRACTICE  Daily  communication:  CERT bodies which  are the main bodies  responsible for the  risk identification and  mitigation  communication on  daily basis. In  addition, working  groups exchange  opinions on an ad- hoc basis on specific  issues, through  defined  communication  channels.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  38  Mechanisms to ensure accountability, transparency, and human rights during risk identification  and mitigation  During risk identification and mitigation, accountability is a particularly important element to  ensure that the objectives of a strategy will be achieved. Responsibilities are allocated and  people need to be accountable for the actions to be taken in order to reach the objectives set  out by the strategy. Setting-up mechanisms to ensure accountability of all actors involved is  hence an important element of strategic governance to already ensure accountability from the  set-out. Similarly, transparency is an important aspect during risk identification and mitigation,  which needs to be ensured throughout all processes as to increase respect and acceptance by  all players but also by the society as a whole. Developing mechanisms to ensure transparency  has also been proven to be an important element of strategic governance. Last but not least,  ensuring human rights in the digital sphere is particularly important in the context of  cybersecurity and mechanisms need to be planned, developed and deployed to ensure human  rights in general, and personal data protection in particular, while improving cybersecurity.  Discussing, developing and deploying these mechanisms for the NCSSs from an early point has  been proven as important and the interviewed stakeholders confirmed this finding, as more than  two-thirds (67%) of the interviewees stated that these mechanisms are at least partially in place  in their country’s governance model.  Main Observations  Definition of accountability and transparency rules: Rules and mechanisms to ensure  accountability are clearly laid down in official documents, i.e., in the NCSS itself, its  implementation/ action plan, and accompanying legal documents. Clearly defining the  rules and mechanisms of accountability and transparency in the documents helps to  ensure these aspects throughout the implementation.  Legislation ensuring human rights: Legislation on human rights is available in all  Member States, nevertheless, additions and updates of existing and additional legal  measures have been put in place to ensure human rights in the context of cybersecurity,  in some Member States.  GOOD  PRACTICE  Every institution in  charge of  implementing actions,  policies, and projects  under the NCSS is  responsible to ensure  accountability and  transparency. The  government of  Lithuania then  assesses from a  strategic level how  the agencies and  institutions perform  the actions according  to pre-defined  measures on  accountability and  transparency.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  39  5.3 OPERATIONAL GOVERNANCE  Operational governance aims at operationalising the policies set out in the strategy to translate  these into actions and improve cybersecurity across all layers of society. Specific elements of  operational governance refer to:  a) Elements about awareness-raising campaigns, outreach campaigns and training to  foster capacity-building;  • Awareness raising, knowledge and capacity building (e.g., training, education,  community building, etc.) within the complete workforce/population;  • Awareness raising, knowledge and capacity building (e.g., training, education,  community building, etc.) within the cybersecurity-relevant workforce;  b) Elements about incident response;  • Incident response mechanisms and support of CSIRTs and CERTs;  c) Elements about information-sharing processes and channels;  • Informal and formal processes of information sharing during incident  response;  All these elements have been validated by the stakeholders interviewed. 95% of the interviewed  stakeholders confirmed that operational governance builds a part of their country’s governance  model. Similarly, all identified elements have been validated by a majority of the interviewed  stakeholders, as deployed in Figure 10.  Figure 10: Percentage of interviewed stakeholders confirming elements of operational  governance  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  40  5.3.1 Elements about awareness raising campaigns, outreach campaigns  and trainings to foster capacity-building  Awareness-raising, knowledge and capacity building (e.g., training, education, community  building, etc.) within the complete workforce/population  Raising awareness for cybersecurity across the whole workforce and/or the complete population  is the main aim of many of the NCSSs of the Member States. It has been confirmed that a huge  risk emerges from a population being unaware of cyber risks and being untrained on how to  cope with these or how to safely behave in the cyberspace. Hence, training and education as  well as awareness campaigns seem essential to increase the general level of knowledge and  the general population’s capacity about cybersecurity.  As depicted in Figure 10, 89% of the consulted countries pointed out that awareness-raising  campaigns as well as educational campaigns targeting the overall population are already in  place to increase the capacity of the general population and to increase their awareness of  cyber risks. Nevertheless, while the importance of increasing awareness has been pointed out,  it has also been stated that awareness raising comes with challenges and is a difficult topic to  cover thoroughly.  Main Observations  Tailored awareness raising and training campaigns: Tailoring awareness raising and  training campaigns to different stakeholder groups is important in order to account for the  different needs and capabilities of the groups. Possible groups reflect businesses and  other private sector entities, IT staff, cybersecurity specific staff, academia, and civilians.  Awareness raising, knowledge and capacity building (e.g., training, education, community  building, etc.) within the cybersecurity relevant workforce.  It has been proven beneficial, to particularly raise awareness and knowledge on cyber, cyber  threats and risks and cybersecurity among the people of the workforce which is most involved  with and closely related to cybersecurity. Generally, the cybersecurity relevant workforce, most  often has awareness of and skills in cybersecurity. However, cybersecurity being part of the  quickly developing cyberspace necessitates constant training and education to keep up with  changes, developments and new challenges. Additionally, it has been pointed out that there is a  scarcity of skilled workforce in the cybersecurity domain, which implies that the workforce needs  to be enlarged through policies aiming on training and education in the field of cybersecurity.  Similar to raising awareness and improving skills of the whole population, 89% of the consulted  countries mentioned that this element constitutes an important part of their governance model.  Awareness raising and training campaigns are covered to different extents by the countries’  governance models. Some countries simply point out the importance and the objective to  increase these aspects, while other countries are already more advanced, developing this  element and provide concrete mechanisms, measures and actions in their governance model.  GOOD  PRACTICE  MITA (Malta  Information  Technology Agency)  was mandated with  the role of a national  coordination centre  for training and  awareness-raising.  Currently, MITA is  collaborating with the  University of Malta  and other  stakeholders for the  creation of masters  specialised in  cybersecurity for  example.  GOOD  PRACTICE  In 2018, Malta  launched the  nationwide  cybersecurity  awareness and  education campaign.  It targets different  actors, from the  private and public  sectors,  professionals, teens,  the elderly, children,  educators,  vulnerable groups,  public, etc.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  41  5.3.2 Elements of the incident response  Incident response mechanisms and support of CSIRTs and CERTs  Formalised processes for incident response are a main element defined in the operational  governance level. Established CSIRT and CERT bodies provide support in case of  cybersecurity incidents and provide a centralised contact point at national level to coordinate  and enable quick and systematic reactions to incidents. As specialised teams dedicated to  developing and deploy mechanisms for cybersecurity in general and incident response in  particular, CSIRT and CERT bodies build an incremental part of the operational governance in  specific and the implementation and achievement of the NCSSs’ objectives in general. While  CSIRTs and CERTs provide support during incident response times, they can also play a  proactive role preventing incidents from happening and supporting governments in building  resilience against cyber threats.  89% of the interviewed countries confirmed the importance of CSIRT and CERT bodies for  incident response (Figure 10). Further, they mentioned that incident response mechanisms are  part of their country’s governance model with CSIRTs and CERTs playing an important role in  supporting and leading these mechanisms.  GOOD  PRACTICE  Platform to submit,  share and react to  incidents: There are  mechanisms for  sharing technical  information and for  pushing e.g., early  warnings, news, etc.  Recently, an online  platform has been  set-up, where it is  possible to receive  compliance and risk  information from  critical information  infrastructures.  Additionally,  incidents can be  submitted on the  platform. These are  synced with national  CSIRT processes. If  there is an incident  notification, an  immediate technical  response can be  triggered.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  42  5.3.3 Elements of the information sharing processes  Informal and formal processes of information sharing during incident response  Establishing processes of information sharing is highly important to ensure coordinated  reactions during incident response times. Formal pre-defined and transparent processes as well  as informal ones should be developed and deployed. While formal processes of information  sharing often provide for and enhance accountability, informal ones might be more effective and  efficient.  As shown in Figure 10, 89% of the consulted countries confirmed that informal and formal  processes of information sharing are important and constitute an element of the operational  governance level of their country’s governance model.  Main Observations  Centralise information sharing. Activities to centralise and intensify information-sharing  have been undertaken by several Member States.  Taxonomy of best practices to ensure coherent processes of information sharing.  Spain developed a taxonomy based on existing best practices and is deploying it across  organisations to ensure a coherent approach towards information-sharing.  5.4 TECHNICAL GOVERNANCE  The technical governance level has been proven to build a highly important part of the  governance model due to its role in the identification and implementation of standards at a  national or international level, and definition of technical mechanisms. All representatives  indicated that technical governance is currently part of the governance model employed in their  country. Specific elements of technical governance refer to:  • Technical governance for cybersecurity based on international standards and  technical guidelines; and  • Implemented/defined use of tools and technology.  GOOD  PRACTICES  In Malta, a project has  been started to create a  specific team for  information sharing called  the “cyber threat  intelligence team”. The  goal is to collect cyber  threat intelligence from  partners and share  information.  In the Netherlands, a  survey has been started  to examine the  possibilities and  modalities (legal,  financial, etc.) to develop  a public-private  cooperation platform to  strengthen situational  awareness and the timely  sharing of cyber threat  information and  advisories. The goal is to  offer more information  and a swifter perspective  for action with relevant  organisations. When  doing so, attention is also  paid to cybersecurity  requirements and the  level of maturity of the  recipients of relevant  information. This survey  is a follow-up of the  existing cyber intel/info  cell, a public cooperation  platform of operational  public organisations  (NCSC, Police,  Intelligence and Security  Services and Public  Prosecutor), where  information on cyber  threats and cyber  incidents is brought  together and is jointly  assessed by those  organisations.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  43  Figure 11: Percentage of interviewed stakeholders confirming elements of technical  governance  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  5.4.1 Technological standardisation  Technical governance for cybersecurity based on international standards and technical guidelines  The technical governance for cybersecurity based on international standards and technical  guidelines has been identified as an important element of the technical governance. 74% of the  interviewed Member States take this into account in their strategies (Figure 11).  While this aspect is not addressed in all NCSS or is not very detailed, according to interviews  with Member State representatives, this aspect is considered important.  The use of technical standards is mentioned in the strategy; however, it is not specified which  technical standards should be used.  Main Observations  Include in the NCSS and its governance model a section focused on the international  standards and technical guidelines: this will ensure to be aligned with the other Member  States. When developing this section, specify which technical standards should be used,  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  44  and define clear roles and responsibilities. To simplify the update of standards, the  standards could be described in a document accompanying the NCSS and the governance  model. A key enabler is the existence of a body that supervises the compliance of  regulated entities with the European and international requirements.  5.4.2 Use of technology, tools and certification schemes  Implemented/defined use of tools, technology and certification schemes  The importance of the use of cybersecurity certification schemes as a tool to manage risk is  highlighted by European agencies and will be enforced under the NIS2 directive. European  cybersecurity certification schemes should apply to the majority of ICT products and services,  and in particular, to all the services or activities provided by essential entities. The competent  authorities should be empowered to apply sanctions consisting of the suspension of a  certification or authorisation concerning part or all the services provided by an essential entity.  Member States should establish a strategy to produce certificates for ICT solutions, either  based on existing national schemes or next to come EU schemes, ensuring an ecosystem that  can deliver certified solutions or participate to the certification of solutions through public or  private conformity assessment bodies. Finally, their procurement policy or any implementation  of national and/or EU laws should be based through the use of certified solutions.  The use of tools and technologies was highlighted as an important element in implementing  NCSSs, although this point is not developed in the strategies of some countries. Nine out of the  18 interviewed Member States take this into account in their strategies, and 53% of all  interviewed stakeholders validated this element of technical governance, as shown in Figure 11.  The representatives of the Member States interviewed stressed the importance of not only  focusing on available standards but also taking into account improvements in technical security,  based on the use of modern approaches to cybersecurity for the detection and handling of  incidents. Threats and incidents are ever-evolving and hence, the instruments of cybersecurity  to combat them need to quickly adapt.  Main Observations  Put in place in the NCSS action plan a group of tasks focused on using tools and  technologies in respect to human rights, particularly to GDPR.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  45  6. MONITORING A  GOVERNANCE MODEL  Monitoring the governance model is an important factor to ensure the successful deployment of  the governance model as well as for the successful implementation of the NCSS. Aiming to  assess the effective implementation, monitoring mechanisms are hence highly important for the  deployment of a governance model. Additionally, the use of an assessment framework can  strengthen the accountability of the responsible stakeholders, foster progress in the deployment  phase and provide insights for areas of improvements.  Monitoring mechanisms can take different forms and levels of detail and granularity. For  instance, a traffic light system could be employed to indicate whether the progress of  implementation is on track (green), behind schedule (yellow) or at risk (red). Traffic light  systems provide broader and more qualitative information on the progress. A more granular  approach of establishing monitoring mechanisms includes the development of Key Performance  Indicators (KPIs). KPIs are measurable values, in the context of governance models, they  provide quantifiable information on the progress of the implementation of actions, policies, and  rules. KPIs could be of both quantitative as well as qualitative nature.  Another monitoring instrument used to evaluate the progress of the implementation of the  governance model is reporting. This implies that accountable and responsible persons report on  the progress of their specific actions to a higher-level authority. Reporting provides a more  general overview of the progress and information are normally not quantifiable.  It has to be mentioned that other forms of monitoring could be deployed that are completer and  more fit for purpose. However, the interviews highlighted that the Member States prefer light  assessment methodologies. The remainder of this section will provide an overview of the  deployment of monitoring mechanisms for evaluating the progress of the implementation of the  governance models accompanying the NCSSs across the EU Member States.  6.1 MONITORING MECHANISMS OF GOVERNANCE MODELS DEPLOYED  ACROSS THE MEMBER STATES  Figure 12 here below provides an overview of the adoption of monitoring mechanisms for the  governance model across the interviewed countries. 17 out of the 18 consulted countries have  some sort of monitoring mechanism in place, the majority (56%) already developed quantitative,  and/or qualitative Key Performance Indicators. 17 % of the interviewed countries indicated that  a traffic light system or another monitoring mechanism is in place to monitor and evaluate the  progress of implementing the governance model and the NCSS. 5% of the interviewed  countries mentioned that the evaluation of the progress of the implementation is based on  reporting, provided by the accountable or responsible persons, per action or objective.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  46  Figure 12: Deployment of monitoring mechanisms across the interviewed EU Member States  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  Figure 13 provides a more granular view of the implementation of monitoring mechanisms per  governance level. It emerges from the stakeholder consultation that the majority of countries  has monitoring mechanisms in place for the strategic and operational governance levels. 58%  of the interviewed countries have a partially or completely deployed monitoring mechanism to  evaluate the progress of implementing the NCSS from a strategic governance point of view.  53% employed monitoring mechanisms on the operational governance level, while progress on  deploying the technical level of governance is systematically monitored in 47% of the countries.  The same percentage of countries deployed monitoring mechanisms for the political  governance level.  Figure 13: Monitoring mechanisms in place per level of governance  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  Generally, most countries monitor the progress by focusing on objectives or actions without  creating a comprehensive assessment framework that could provide an overall index of  progress.  56%  17%  5%  17%  5% KPIs  Traffic light system  Reporting  Other  not in place  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  Strategic governance  Political governance Operational governance  Technical governance  In place Partially in place Not in place No answer  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  47  Good practices in the context of establishing monitoring mechanisms have been identified from  the interviews with the Member States’ representatives. These are detailed here below.  Good Practice – Extended set of KPIs to also monitor the state of cybersecurity across the population  In Spain not only a set of KPIs has been established to monitor the progress of the implementation of the  governance model, but a specific national observatory for cyber has been put in place. The observatory’s main  function is to monitor the KPIs and to publish reports on the KPIs deployed to measure the progress of the  implementation.  In addition, the KPIs developed by Spain do not only cover the implementation of the governance model and  the NCSS, but also aim at the wider objective of ensuring service and cybersecurity in the country. Therefore,  additional KPIs have been introduced, which focus on the behaviour of citizens during incidents.  Many of the KPIs are publicly available to also provide the population with the possibility to inform themselves  about the current status of the country, the goals and the progress. Furthermore, more sensitive KPIs, focusing  on more policy-specific aspects have been established. These however are not publicly available to ensure  security.  In Italy, it is foreseen develop specific measures and KPIs within the first twelve months after the adoption of  the NCSS. The KPIs deployed will not only aim on measuring the progress of the implementation of the  governance model and the NCSS, but some KPIs will aim at a more granular and more encompassing system  to also measure:  • Cybersecurity maturity;  • Involvement of specific categories of persons (women, young, unemployed and jobseekers) in the  cybersecurity training;  • Involvement of specific categories of persons (women, young, unemployed and jobseekers) in the  cybersecurity industry;  • Cybersecurity investments;  o Investments in and initiatives on cybersecurity research and development;  • Number of national companies insured by cybersecurity incidents.  Good Practice – Platform to enable the exchange of progress  In Austria, the new NCSS is not only set up to follow a whole-of-nation/whole-of-society approach but also to  allow to react to changing challenges and opportunities in the cyberspace. Accompanying the NCSS, a web  platform has been developed to collect and monitor objectives, and actions and to measure progress  dynamically. By using the PPPP-Model also non-governmental stakeholders are allowed to add to the platform  facilitating information sharing and exchange.  It provides insights into the progress of the implementation of the NCSS and its governance model. KPIs are  developed to monitor the progress of reaching the strategic objectives and to implement the related measures.  For every action, policy or measure of the governance model and the NCSS, a scorecard is created, each  scorecard provides insights into the progress of the specific objective, action or measure. The monitoring on the  scorecards is based on key project management principles in order to ensure granular and detailed monitoring  of the progress.  Twice a year a report based on the data on the platform is created and published on the website of the Austrian  Federal Chancellery thus giving the public insights into the state of play of Austrian Cybersecurity.  6.2 POTENTIAL RE-USE OF EXISTING KPIS  KPIs related to cybersecurity have been developed by different organisations already. The  uptake of these indicators is encouraged, while some adjustment could be beneficial. Here  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  48  below a short explanation of three sets of KPIs related to cybersecurity is provided. The longlists  of the KPIs deployed by the three sets are provided in the Annex of this report.  6.2.1 NCAF KPIs  The national capabilities self-assessment framework (NCAF), developed by ENISA, aims at  measuring the level of maturity of the different NCSSs. The framework specifically should  empower the Member States in  • Conducting the evaluation of their national cybersecurity capabilities.  • Enhancing awareness of the country’s maturity level;  • Identifying areas for improvement; and  • Building cybersecurity capabilities.  The framework provides an assessment of the NCSSs on 17 objectives, grouped into four main  clusters across five levels of maturity. The four main clusters of objectives are the following:  1. Cybersecurity governance and standards;  2. Capacity-building and awareness;  3. Legal and regulatory; and  4. Cooperation.  Among the different elements assessed to identify the level of maturity, there are some that  refer to the governance model of an NCSS and can be extracted and reused to evaluate the  governance model of a country. The specific indicators are listed in Annex B.1 of this report.  6.2.2 EU Cybersecurity Index  ENISA is working since 2021 on the development of an EU Cybersecurity Index, a tool to help  Member States making informed decisions by providing insights on the cybersecurity maturity  and posture of the Union and MS policies, capabilities and operations. With a view to the tasks  included in the latest NIS 2 Directive Proposal text59, the EU Cybersecurity Index project of  ENISA is expected to evolve in the direction of a biennial report on the state of cybersecurity in  the Union. For this aim, a set of indicators is being defined which will provide a better  understanding on which areas the EU will need to focus on to improve the overall Union  cybersecurity.  The development of the EU Cybersecurity Index is still work in progress and under consultation  and piloting with the Member States’ National Authorities. Currently, the focus and indicators of  the index will provide a better understanding on which areas the EU will need to focus on to  improve the overall Union cybersecurity. As soon as the NIS2 Directive has been finalised, work  will commence to evolve from the EU Cybersecurity Index project of ENISA to the new  requirements defined in the NIS 2 Directive and in particular Art. 15.  The main objectives of EU’s Cybersecurity Index include:  • assessing the current level of maturity of cybersecurity and relevant cyber capabilities;  • identifying opportunities for collaborative and local cybersecurity enhancements; and  • identifying areas of network and information system security weaknesses which may  provide a risk to the Union and its MS as well as its citizens, governmental structures,  CI/CII and digital services, and small, medium, and large enterprises.  59 Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on measures for a high  common level of cybersecurity across the Union, repealing Directive (EU) 2016/1148  https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0823&from=EN__;!!NEMsmePo_HYI!dxiTggex2rwwyYUT5khfjGIJyBUo3f1TPzlY8Cwd2iUasbSnlYbHH8bQMK_nilBMm5GcJAr8EFLnz_52ZSuYEoEDjrGzo37JUgo$ https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0823&from=EN__;!!NEMsmePo_HYI!dxiTggex2rwwyYUT5khfjGIJyBUo3f1TPzlY8Cwd2iUasbSnlYbHH8bQMK_nilBMm5GcJAr8EFLnz_52ZSuYEoEDjrGzo37JUgo$  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  49  For the time being the EU Cybersecurity Index consists of 5860 composite indicators in four  areas:  • Policy;  • Operations;  • Capacity; and  • Market/industry  The indicators are not yet publicly available but will be in due time.  6.2.3 ITU Global Cybersecurity Index indicators  The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the UN agency dedicated to ICTs and  launched the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) to measure the commitment to cybersecurity of  the countries around the globe. Aiming to assist the countries to identify possible areas of  improvement related to cybersecurity, the GCI’s main objective is to measure:  • The type, level, and evolution over time of cybersecurity commitment within countries  and relative to other countries;  • The progress in cybersecurity commitment of countries from a global perspective;  • The progress in cybersecurity commitment from a regional perspective; and  • The cybersecurity commitment divide (i.e., the difference between countries in terms of  their level of engagement in cybersecurity initiatives).  The 2020 GCI consists of 82 questions feeding into 20 indicators, which are mapped across five  main pillars. The main pillars of the GCI are:  1. Legal measures;  2. Technical measures;  3. Organizational measures;  4. Capacity development measures; and  5. Cooperation measures.  All indicators are listed in Annex B.2 of this report. Under pillar 3, the organizational measures,  the main indicator refers to the development, implementation and deployment of a national  cybersecurity strategy. The specific questions feeding into this indicator are also listed in Annex  B.2 of this report.  6.2.4 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM)  Developed by the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre61, the goal of the Cybersecurity  Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) is to increase the scale and effectiveness of  cybersecurity capacity-building. A first version of the model was deployed in 2014 and a revised  version has been made available in 2016 and a new one in 2021.  The CMM assesses cybersecurity capacity across five key dimensions, which – according to the  model – represent the clusters of cybersecurity. The five dimensions are:  1. Developing cybersecurity policy and strategy;  2. Encouraging responsible cybersecurity culture within society;  3. Building cybersecurity knowledge and capabilities;  4. Creating effective legal and regulatory frameworks; and  60 Subject to review. The number of indicators might change based on consultations with cybersecurity experts coming from  national authorities, EU Agencies, and the industry.  61 The Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre is part of the Oxford Martin School within the University of Oxford.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  50  5. Controlling risks through standards and technologies.  The CMM is based on five maturity levels to evaluate a nation’s level of capacity and to  measure progress in relation to specific factors and/or aspects of cybersecurity capacity: Start- up; Formative; Established; Strategic; and Dynamic.62  The detail of each factor of the different dimensions are listed in Annex B.3 of this report.  62 ENISA, National Capabilities Assessment Framework, 2020 ; Available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national-capabilities-assessment-framework.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national-capabilities-assessment-framework  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  51  7. CONCLUSION  Aimed at developing a good practice example of effective governance models for NCSSs,  different governance frameworks across the EU and beyond have been analysed. Based on  desk research of more than 49 sources, and 19 interviews with representatives of the EU  Member States, the analysis of the Governance Framework for NCSS from March to July 2022  resulted in some conclusions that can be regarded as takeaways for the Member States.  Identified through desk research, four main levels of governance frameworks have been  identified as predominant. Specifically, these levels are:  1. Political governance;  2. Strategic governance;  3. Operational governance; and  4. Technical governance.  This study’s research indicated that no evident correlation between the type of government,  self-governance, and the governance model of the NCSS deployed exists. Rather, several  additional factors such as the size of a country, its level of maturity in the cyber domain, and the  level of cooperation with the private sector, influence the definition of a governance model. This  finding led to the conclusion that it is not possible to have a unique governance model to be  used as a reference. Therefore, good practices rather than a single best practice governance  model have been identified for each layer. The four main levels of a governance framework  have been further defined and sub-areas have been detailed through intensified desk research  and interviews. These encompass all elements of good practice governance models.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  52  Figure 14: Good Practices of governance model elements  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  In addition to the main elements governing the different levels of governance, the establishment  of monitoring mechanisms, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and other measures to  coherently monitor and evaluate progress, have been identified as important. KPIs and  monitoring measures facilitate the finetuning of the strategy’s actions and the successful  implementation of the NCSSs and the related governance model.  With regard to KPIs, this study provides a list of KPIs already developed by different  organisations, which could be adapted to the situation in different Member States.

Processes for strategy  development have been initiated.An  outline/draft national cybersecurity  strategy has been  articulated.Consultation processes  have been agreed for key stakeholder  groups, including private sector, civil  society and international partners.  A national cybersecurity strategy has  been published.An assessment of  country-specific national cybersecurity  risk has been conducted.The strategy  reflects the needs and roles of relevant  stakeholders across government  (national and sub-national), business  and civil society.An implementation  programme is in place which covers  the scope of the strategy.Mechanisms  are in place to enable strategy ‘owners’  to monitor achievement of outcomes,  address implementation issues and  maintain strategy alignment.  Strategy review and renewal  processes are in place.Emerging  cybersecurity risks are regularly  assessed and used to update the  strategy and implementation  plan.The impact of the strategy on  risk and harm reduction  isunderstood and is used to inform  funding and priority decisions.  The national cybersecurity strategy  and implementation plan are both  proactively reviewed to take account of  broader strategic developments within  the country (political, economic, social,  technical, legal and environmental).The  country is an acknowledged authority  within the international community and  is supportingthe development of  national and global cybersecurity  strategies.Cybersecurity considerations  are embedded within other relevant  national-level strategies and  implementation programmes.  Content  Various national policies and  strategies may exist that refer to  cybersecurity, but these are not  comprehensive and there is little  evidence that these reflect specific  national priorities and circumstances.  Content exists that reflects country- specific priorities and  circumstances.Links exist between  the strategy (or draft strategy) and  priorities such as national  security,digital strategy and economic  development, but these are generally  ad hoc and lack detail.The strategy  (or draft strategy) defines the key  outcomes against which success can  be evaluated.  The content of the national  cybersecurity strategy is based on a  comprehensive risk assessment that  includes explicit links to wider national  level economic and political policies  and strategies.The content includes  actions to raise public and  businessawareness, mitigate  cybercrime, establish incident response  capability, promote public-private  partnership and protect critical  infrastructure and the wider  economy.Consideration has been  given to how the national cybersecurity  strategy might incorporate or support  wider online policy objectives such as:  child protection; the promotion of  Human Rights; the promotion of  Equality, Diversity and Inclusion; and  managing disinformation.  The content takes account of the  impact on cybersecurity risk of  emerging technologies and their  use within critical infrastructure, the  wider economy and society.The  outcomes defined in the strategy  are specific and measurable.  Metrics have been defined which  enable stakeholders to evaluate  theeffectiveness of the strategy in  reducing harm.Consideration has  been given to how the beneficial  outcomes of the strategy can be  sustained beyond the strategy’s  lifetime, including how the  maintenance of new capabilities  will be financed.  The content takes account of the  impact of broader developments on  cybersecurity risk (political, economic,  social, technical, legal and  environmental).The content of the  national cybersecurity strategy  promotes and encourages bilateral and  multilateral co-operation between  countries to ensurea secure, resilient  and trusted cyberspace.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  88  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Implementation  and Review  No overarching national  cybersecurityimplementation  programme has been developed.  A co-ordinated cybersecurity  implementation programme is being  developed with relevant stakeholders  involved, including the private sector  and civil society.Actions within the  programme have been assigned to  specific ‘owners’ but the availability of  adequate resources has not yet been  confirmed.Mechanisms to review  processes are limited or ad hoc.  A detailed implementation plan has  been published including actions,  responsible entities and resource  budgets. The implementation plan  involves relevant stakeholders across  government and other sectors.A co- ordinating body has been assigned.  The body has sufficient authority to  ensure that action ‘owners’ are held to  account.The resources required to  deliver the actions of the programme  have been identified and are in place.  Budget shortfalls are identified and  escalated to the relevant  authority.Programme review processes  and metrics are in place that allow  progress to be measured and risks,  issues and dependencies to be  escalated to the relevant authority.  These processes are adequately  funded.  Outcome-oriented metrics are  being used to monitor the impact  that the programme is having on  risk reduction (and other relevant  strategy goals).There is evidence  of these metrics being used to  refine action plans.Metrics (both  progress and outcome-oriented  metrics) are drawn from a wide  variety of governmental, non- governmental and international  sources.There is independent  oversight and/or assurance of the  programme.  Mechanisms are in place to make  more far-reachingchanges to the  programme in the event of significant  changes in circumstance (political,  economic, social, technical, legal and  environmental).The programme  contributes to the global development  of outcome-oriented metrics and their  application.  International  Engagement  There is limited awareness of the  principal international debates relating  to cybersecurity policy (suchas  cybersecurity norms, mutual legal  assistance, Internet Governance, data  sovereignty, data protection).The  country may benefit from regional/  international operational collaboration  networks but does not actively  engage.  The country is aware of the  existence of international discussions  on cybersecurity policy and related  issues.The country may, on occasion,  participate in regional or international  discussions on matters related to  cybersecurity issues, but does not  generally play an active role.The  country may participate in relevant  operationalcollaboration and policy  bodies (such as FIRST, regional  CERT bodies, the IGF, or the UN  GGE), but takes mainly a passive  role.  An assessment has been made of how  the international debates on  cybersecurity policy and related issues  affect the country’s interests and  international standing. Specific  engagement objectives have been  defined accordingly. Multiple  stakeholders have been involved in this  process.The country is actively  participating in relevant international  bodies and forums, either directly or  through relevant representative  bodies.Their voices are being heard and  are having an impact.The country  actively contributes to regional/  international operational collaboration  and policy bodies.  The country is actively building  international communitiesof interest  around specific cybersecurity policy  goals and promoting their  adoption.The country makes a  major contribution to regional/  international operational bodies  and is actively involved in building  capacity in third-party countries.  The country is a leading actor in  building consensus, fostering inclusivity  and shaping the international debates  on key cybersecurity policy issues.The  country is focused on the future, seeing  emerging issues (around new  technology or new types of threat), and  is initiating new international debates  around the key issues.The country is  actively involved in creating new  regional/ international collaboration  mechanisms.

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  89  B.3.2 Factor - D 1.2: Incident Response and Crisis Management  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Identification  and  Categorisation  of Incidents  No process for identifying and  categorising national-level  incidents exists.  Some organisations and sectors have  internal mechanisms for identifying and  categorising incidents within their  purview.A process for identifying  national-level incidents is under  development.There is no central registry  in place but ad-hoc arrangements exist  for dealing with the most significant  events.  Most major organisations have internal  mechanisms for identifying and  categorising incidents.A central registry of  national- level cybersecurity incidents  exists and a process for timely escalation  of incidents, from the organisational to the  national level, is in place.Individual national  incidents are categorised according to  severity and resources are allocated  accordingly.  Insights arising from national level  incidents are routinely analysed in order  to establish lessons and inform broader  cybersecurity policy and strategy.  The criteria for categorising  incidents are sufficiently flexible to  cater for rapidly emerging  changes in the underlying  technological or threat  environment.The country is  contributing to international best  practice in incident identification  and categorisation.  Organisation  No organisation for national- level cyber incident response  exists.A few organisations may  have internal cybersecurity  response mechanisms in place  but co- ordination is minimal.  A national CERT might exist but lacks  sufficient resources and skills.Processes  for managing incidents are still in  development.Some organisations from  public and private sectors have internal  cybersecurity response mechanisms in  place but co- ordination with the national  CERT is ad hoc.The role of sub-national  bodies is unclear.Bilateral co-operation  with international partners is limited or ad  hoc.  A national body for incident response  has been established. It has the resources,  skills, documented processes and legal  authorities required to address the range of  cyber incidentscenarios that the country is  likely to face (including out-of-hours  capability, if appropriate).Relationships and  protocols are in place to enable incident  management co-ordinationbetween the  national body and other elements of the  public and private sectors.The role of sub- national bodies in incident response is  clear and mechanisms are in place  toenable co-ordination between the  national and sub-national levels.There is  regular sharing of threat and vulnerability  information, and operational good practices  between the national body and a wide  range of public and private sector  organisations, as well as international  partners.  The national body undertakes a wide  range of engagement activities such as  conveningcommunities of interest,  running cross-sector exercises and  promoting best cybersecurity  practices.The national body innovates  to provide a range of additional services  that improve the country’s ability to  prevent, detect, respond and recover  from threats.The national body is widely  recognised as an authoritative voice on  cybersecurity within the country.The  effectiveness of the national body in  reducing cyber risk and harm is  regularly evaluatedand benchmarked  against international good practice.  The government’s overall  operational response is adaptive  to changes in the underlying  technical and threat  environment.The country is  contributing to international best  practice on how to organise  operational responses to  cybersecurity threats.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  90  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Integration of  Cybersecurity  into National  Crisis  Management  No framework exists for  national- level crisis  management.Cybersecurity has  not been considered as a  potential national-level crisis  scenario.Emergency  communication capabilities are  limited.  A national crisis management  framework is in development and a  specific organisation has been allocated  responsibility for leading national-level  crisis response.Cybersecurity has been  recognised as relevant to national crisis  management, both as a factor in its own  right and as an element of other crisis  scenarios.An exercise programme is in  development and includes cybersecurity- based scenarios.Emergency  communication capabilities are in place  but may not be well integrated or lack  resilience to cyber disruption.  Cybersecurity is fully integrated into the  national crisis management framework and  the organisation responsible for crisis  management is equipped to deal with a  range of cybersecurity- related  scenarios.The role of a cyber incident  management authority within the crisis  management process is well defined and  established, and escalation thresholds are  fully understood.National crisis  management scenarios with cybersecurity  components are regularly  exercised.Emergency communication  systems are regularly tested for cyber  resilience against a range of cybersecurity- related scenarios.  Lessons learnt from cyber crisis  exercises are used to inform both  national crisis management policy and  the national cybersecurity strategy and  implementation plan.International crisis  planning and exercising with partners  exists and routinely includes  cybersecurity as an element.The  resilience of emergency  communications has been stress-  tested against a wide range of potential  scenarios.  The country is contributing to  the debate on the integration of  cyber into national  andinternational crisis  management.Emergency  communications capabilities are  capable of operating beyond the  country’s border in order to  support third- party countries and  global crisis responses.

B.3.3 Factor - D 1.3: Critical Infrastructure (CI) Protection  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Identification  There may be some  appreciation of what  constitutes a CI asset,  but no formal  categorisation of CI  assets has been  produced.  A list of general CI assets,  sectors and operators has  been created.  The list of CI assets has been formalised and  incorporates a range of appropriate public and private  sector organisations.Specific operators have been  identified and are aware of their status.The list is kept  up to date to reflect changes in the country’s  circumstances.Cross-border dependencies have been  identified.  The list of CI assets is adaptive to strategic  shifts in the underlying technical, social and  economic environment.Interdependencies  between sectors are managed.Cross-border  dependencies are managed.  There is flexibility in the process  for identifying CI assets to cater for  rapidly emerging changes in the  underlying technological or threat  environment.The country is  actively involved in the  identification and prioritisation of  global CI assets.Cross-sector and  cross-border dependencies are  mitigated.  Regulatory  Requirements  There are no existing  regulatory requirements  specific to the  cybersecurity of CI.  The need for baseline  standards to govern CI  assets isacknowledged but  these are not explicitly  mandated in  regulation.Sector regulators  do not routinely assess CI  operators for compliance.  CI operators are mandated by regulation to meet  appropriate cybersecurity standards (either in the form  of specific cyber regulation or as part of broader  regulatory requirements).Mandatory breach reporting  and vulnerability disclosure requirements are in place.  Formal processes are in place to evaluate CI operator  compliance with regulatory standards and incident and  vulnerability disclosure.  Novel approaches to regulatory supervision are  being developed to improve CI cybersecurity  while also facilitating effective and efficient CI  service delivery.The country is promoting best  practice regulatory approaches at an international  level.  Regulatory frameworks are  sufficiently flexible to cater for  rapidly emerging changes in the  underlying technological or threat  environment.The country is  actively involved in establishing  regulatory approaches to assuring  global CI.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  91  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Operational  Practice  A few CI operators  may be implementing  goodcybersecurity  practices, but this is  inconsistent.  Many CI operators are  implementing good  cybersecurity practice.There  is some self-assessment  against recognised industry  standards.Some informal  arrangements exist for  collaboration across and  within sectors.  CI operators are consistently implementing  recognised industry standards and the effectivenessof  their cybersecurity controls are regularly  assessed.Mechanisms are in place for operators to  share threat and vulnerability information, best  practices and lessons learned from incidents and near  misses.CI operators participate fully in national  incident response and crisis management planning  and exercising. Mechanisms are in place for public  authorities to provide information and other practical  support to CI operators, both pre- and post- incident.  There is extensive collaboration among CI  operators and with public authorities to develop  strategies that enhance collective  cybersecurity.The resilience of the critical  infrastructure ecosystem as a whole has been  assessedagainst a range of scenarios, and  measures are in place to address systemic risks  to the economy and society.  The country and its CI operators  are contributing to the international  debate on global critical  infrastructure resilience.Experts  from the regulators and CI  operators are recognised  internationally for their contribution  to addressing global infrastructure  protection challenges.

B.3.4 Factor - D 1.4: Cybersecurity in Defence and National Security  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Defence Force  Cybersecurity  Strategy  The potential impact  of cybersecurity on  national security and  defence may have  been considered but  has not been formally  articulated.  The potential impact of  cybersecurity on national security  and defence has been assessed and  a strategy for addressing these risks  is under development.This analysis  includes risks to the ability of the  country’s military and other national  security assets to operate in a  contested cyber environment.  A strategy for cybersecurity for national security  and defence has been formally adopted (stand-alone  or as part of a wider document).The strategy is  supported by appropriate legal authorities and  relevant operational doctrine and rules of  engagement. These are consistent with international  humanitarian law.The dependence of national  security and military entities on the cybersecurity of  other parts of the critical national infrastructure is  understood and is addressedin the defence  cybersecurity strategy.Cybersecurity considerations  inform other elements of national security and  defence strategy, where relevant.  Defence strategy includes appropriate  considerations of deterrence.The country’s  defence and national security establishment  (alongside other stakeholders) is actively  engaged in the global debate on  international humanitarian law and norms of  behaviour as they relateto conflict in  cyberspace. Declaratory strategy and  published doctrine may be part of this.  Strategy and doctrine are not  static but are adaptive tochanging  capabilities and to the geo-political  and technical threat  environment.The strategy is  designed to promote stability in  cyberspace. This includes  measures to predict and influence  the strategies and actions and  reactions of potential allies and  adversaries.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  92  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Defence Force  Cybersecurity  Capability  Specialist  cybersecurity  capability within the  national security  establishment is  limited.  Specialist cybersecurity capability  requirements are understood, and  relevant organisational structures  have been defined.Initial steps have  been taken to establish these.  Capabilities and organisational structures are in  place and have been tested. Resourcing is provided  through the national military estimate or equivalent  process.Operational doctrine and rules of  engagement are fully embedded in training.Specialist  intelligence resources are being applied to provide  support and are appropriately resourced.Mechanisms  to facilitate collaboration with allies are in place and  have been tested.  Relevant deterrence and  defence/resilience capabilities are in place,  forming part of the country’s defence  cybersecurity strategy.Cybersecurity is  embedded in wider operational and  command training within the country’s  military forces.  Defence cybersecurity  capabilities are able to support  multilateral responses to shared  national security challenges.  Civil Defence  Co-ordination  Collaboration on  cybersecurity between  civil and defence  entities is limited.  Informal collaboration on  cybersecurity between civil and  defence entities may exist but has  not been formalised.Defence entities  have not been formally resourced to  undertake this work.  Collaboration on cybersecurity between civil and  defence entities exists and has been  formalised.Respective roles have been defined within  the country’s crisis management procedures.The  resources required within the defence and national  security community, to support civil and CI  authorities, have been formally assessed and  assigned.Formal mechanisms are in place to  determine military/ national security cybersecurity  dependencies on civil and CI infrastructure. The  ability of civiland CI infrastructure operators to provide  these services has been assured.  Civil defence collaboration on  cybersecurity is built into the strategic  planning of both sectors and designed to  address a range of future crisis  scenarios.Mechanisms are in place that  enable defence and the national security  community to draw on the skills and  capabilities of the broader economy and  society. (For example, via a formal cyber  reserve force)  The country is leading the  international debate on best  practice in cross-governmental,  civil-defence cybersecurity  collaboration.

Executive  Awareness  Raising  Awareness raising on  cybersecurity issues for  executives is limited or non-  existent.Executives are not  yet aware of their  responsibilities  toshareholders, clients,  customers, and employees in  relation to cybersecurity.  Executives are made aware of general  cybersecurity issues, but not how these issues  and threats might affect their  organisations.Executives of particular sectors,  such as finance andtelecommunications, have  been made aware of cybersecurity risks in  general, and howthe organisation deals with  cybersecurity issues, but not of strategic  implications.  Awareness raising of executives in the  public, private, academic and civil society  sectors address cybersecurity risks in  general, some of the primary methods of  attack, and how the organisation deals with  cyber issues (usually abdicated to the  CIO).Select executive members are made  aware of how cybersecurity risks affect the  strategic decision making of the organisation,  particularly those in the financial and  telecommunications sectors.Awareness- raising efforts of cybersecurity crisis  management at the executive level is still  reactive in focus.  Executive awareness-raising efforts in  nearly all sectors include the identificationof  strategic assets, specific measures in place  to protect them, and the mechanism by  which they are protected.Executives are  able to alter strategic decision making and  allocate specific funding and people to the  various elements of cyber risk, contingent  on their company’s prevailing  situation.Executives are made aware of  what contingency plans arein place to  address various cyber-based attacks and  their aftermath.Executive awareness  courses in cybersecurity are mandatory for  nearly all sectors.  Cybersecurity risks are considered as  an agenda item at every executive  meeting, and funding and attention is  reallocated to address those  risks.Executives at regional and  international level are regarded as a  source of good practice in responsible  and accountable corporate cybersecurity  governance.

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  105  B.3.16 Factor - D 4.3: Legal and Regulatory Capability and Capacity  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Law  Enforcement  Law enforcement officers/  agencies do not have sufficient  capacity to prevent and combat  cybercrime and do not receive  specialised training on cybercrime  investigations.  Traditional investigative  measures are applied to cybercrime  investigations, but digital  investigation capacity is limited.Law  enforcement officers may receive  training on cybercrime and digital  evidence, but it is ad hoc.  A comprehensive institutional capacity with  sufficient human, procedural and technological  resources to investigate cybercrime cases has been  established.Digital chain of custody and evidence  integrity is established, including formal processes,  roles and responsibilities.Standards for the training  of law enforcement officers on cybercrime and  digital evidence exist and are implemented.The  respective roles of national and state/local law  enforcement agencies are understood and state- /local-level forces are equipped to undertake their  role.  Quantified risk assessments are used to allocate  resources to operational cybercrime units (at  national and state/local levels).Trends and  statistics on cybercrime, law enforcement  interventions and their impact on harm reduction  are collected, analysed and used to inform strategy  and long-term resource allocation decision.Law  enforcement strategies include crime prevention  measures alongside enforcement measures.  Intelligence is used to support proactive  investigation.Law enforcement agencies have the  capabilities to maintainthe integrity of data to meet  international evidential standards in cross-border  investigation.  The country is actively  involved in the development of  collaborative platforms between  national law enforcement  authorities.The law enforcement  agencies within the country are  at the forefront of developing  new capabilities and  approaches for the prevention  and disruption of cybercrime  and promoting their use  internationally.  Prosecution  Prosecutors do not receive  adequate training and resources  to review electronic evidence or  prosecute  cybercrime.Consultation may  have begun to consider this  capacity in the prosecutor  community.  A limited number of prosecutors  have the capacity to conduct  cybercrime cases and to handle  electronic evidence, but this  capacity is largely ad hoc and is not  institutionalised.If prosecutors  receive training on cybercrime and  digital evidence, it is ad hoc.  A comprehensive institutional capacity, including  sufficient human and technological resources, to  prosecute cybercrime cases and cases involving  electronic evidence is established.A specialist cadre  of cybercrime prosecutors may have been  established.  Institutional structures are in place, with a clear  distribution of tasks and obligations within the  prosecution services at all levels of the state.A  mechanism exists that enables the exchange of  informationand good practices between  prosecutors and judges to ensure efficient and  effective prosecution of cybercrime cases.  There is national capacity to  prosecute complex domestic  and cross-border cybercrime  cases.  Courts  There is no process to equip  judges so they can preside over  cybercrime cases or cases  involving electronic  evidence.Consultation may have  begun to consider this capacity in  the judicial community.  A limited number of judges have  the capacity to preside over a  cybercrime case, but this capacity  is largely ad hoc.If judges receive  training on cybercrime and digital  evidence, it is ad hoc.  Sufficient human and technological resources are  available to ensure effective and efficient legal  proceedings regarding cybercrime cases and cases  involving electronic evidence.Judges receive  specialised training about cybercrime and electronic  evidence.States/local courts are equipped to deal  with cybercrime cases, appropriate to their  level.Relevant courts are equipped to process civil  litigation relating to cybersecurity liability.  The institutional capacity of the court system to  conduct cybercrime cases is frequently reviewed  and revised based on an assessment of  effectiveness.  The country is actively  involved in developing and  promoting best practices in the  conduct of cybercrime cases.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  106  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Regulatory  Bodies  Sector-specific regulators have  limited understanding of the  potential impact of cyber on their  regulated entities.There is no  cross-sector regulatory body to  supervise specific cybersecurity  requirements.  Sector-specific regulators have  started to establish their  cybersecurity roles.A requirement  for the establishment of cross- sector regulatory bodies to oversee  compliance with specific  cybersecurity regulations may have  been considered.Relevant  stakeholders have been consulted  in this process.  Sector-specific regulators (e.g.: finance, energy,  transport) are equipped with the capability and  resources required to oversee compliance with  cybersecurity requirements within their  sector.Where cross-sector regulatory bodies have  been established to oversee cybersecurity, they  have the necessary capability and resources to  undertake their role.  The impact of regulatory actions on  organisations’ cybersecurity practices are regularly  assessed and used to inform supervisory activity  and regulation development.Regulatory bodies  regularly assess emerging technologies and their  potential impact on the cybersecurity of regulated  entities.Regulatory interventions and investigations  are informed by, and prioritised on the basis of,  national assessments of cyber risk.  Regulatory bodies are  actively involved in the  development and promotion of  regulatory best practice  internationally.

B.3.17 Factor - D 4.4: Formal and Informal Co-operation Frameworks to Combat Cybercrime  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Law  Enforcement Co- operation with  Private Sector  Co-operation between domestic  public and private sectors on  cybercrime is limited.Specifically,  co-operation between Internet  service and other technology  providers and law enforcement has  not been established.  Exchange of information on cybercrime  between domestic public and private  sectors is ad hoc and  unregulated.Specifically, ad-hoc co- operation between Internet service and  other technology providers and law  enforcement exists but is not always  effective.  Information is regularly exchanged between  domestic public and private sectors and is supported  by appropriate legislation.Effective co-operation  mechanisms between Internet service and other  technology providers and law enforcement have  been established aspart of these broader public–  private sector collaboration arrangements.  The effectiveness of public and private  co-operation is regularly assessed and  used to enhance collaborative  processes.Collaboration frameworks are  regularly adapted to takeaccount of new  technologies and emerging forms of  cybercrime.  The country is actively  contributing to the  promotion of public– private partnership and  the development of  international public– private partnership  platforms.  Co-operation  withForeign Law  Enforcement  Counterparts  There are minimal or no forms of  international co-operation to  prevent and combat cybercrime.  Formal mechanisms of international law  enforcement co-operation may exist, but  their application to cybercrime is ad hoc or  only possible in some cases.Law  enforcement is not formally integrated into  regional and international cybercrime  networks.  Formal mechanisms of international law  enforcement co-operation have been established to  facilitate the detection, investigation, and  prosecution of cybercrime.Mutual legal assistance,  extradition agreements and mechanisms have been  established and are applied to cybercrime  cases.Domestic law enforcement agencies are  integrated with regional and international networks,  such as Interpol or 24/7 networks.  Law enforcement agencies work jointly  with foreign counterparts, potentially  through joint task forces, resulting in  successful cross-border cybercrime  investigations and prosecutions.  The country actively  contributes to the  promotion and  development of  international co-operation  mechanisms.  Government-  Criminal Justice  Sector  Collaboration  There is minimal interaction  between government and criminal  justice actors.  Exchange of information between  government and criminal justice actors is  limited and ad hoc.  Formal relationships between government and  criminal justice actors have been established,  resulting in the regular exchange of information on  cybercrime issues.  The relationship between government  actors, prosecutors, judges and law  enforcement agencies is regularly  assessed and used to enhance their  effectiveness.  The country actively  contributes to the  international promotion of  efficient and timely  exchange of information  between government and  criminal justice actors.

B.3.18 Factor - D 5.1: Adherence to Standards  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  ICT Security  Standards  Either no standards or good  practices have been identified  for use in securing data,  technology or infrastructure, by  the public and private  sectors.Or initial identification  of some appropriate standards  and good practices has been  made by the public and private  sectors, and possibly some ad- hoc implementation, but no  concerted endeavour to  implement or change existing  practice in a measurable way.  Information risk management  standards have been identified for use  and there have been some initial signs of  promotion and take-up within public and  private sectors.There is some evidence of  measurable implementation and use of  international standards and good  practices.  A nationally-agreed baseline of  cybersecurity-related standards and good  practices have been identified and  implemented widely across public and  private sectors.An entity within government  exists to assess the use of standards across  public and private sectors.Government  schemes exist to promote continued  enhancements, and metrics are being  applied to monitor compliance.Consideration  is being given as to how standards and best  practices can be used to address risk within  supply chains within the CI, by both  government and CI.  Government and organisations promote  use of standards and best practices  according to assessment of national risks  and budgetary choices.The choice of  standards and best practices and their  implementation is continuously  revised.Emerging cybersecurity risks are  regularly assessed and used to re-  evaluate the need for additional ICT  security standards.There is evidence of  debate between government and other  stakeholders as to how national and  organisational resource decisions should  align and drive implementation of  standards.Evidence of contribution to  international standards’ bodies exists and  contributes to thought leadership and  sharing of experience by organisations.  The country is actively involved in the  development and promotion of defined  standards internationally.Implementation of  standards and non-compliance decisions are  made in response to changing threat  environments and resource drivers across  sectors and CI, through collaborative risk  management.Evidence exists of debate  within all sectors on compliance to standards  and best practices, based on continuous  needs assessments.  Standards  in  Procurement  No standards or best  practices have been identified  foruse in guiding procurement  processes by the public and  private sectors. If they are  recognised, implementationis  ad hoc and un-co-ordinated.  Cybersecurity standards and best  practices guiding procurement  processes(including risk management,  lifecycle management, software and  hardware assurance, outsourcing, and  use of cloud services) have been  identified for use.Evidence of promotion  and implementation ofcybersecurity  standards and best practices in defining  procurement practices exists within public  and private sectors.  Cybersecurity standards and best  practices in guidingprocurement processes  (including risk management, lifecycle  management, software and hardware  assurance, outsourcing, and use of cloud  services) are being adhered to widely within  public and private sectors.Implementation  and compliance of standards in procurement  practices within the public and private  sectors is evidenced through measurement  and assessments of process effectiveness.  Organisations have the ability to monitor  and change use of standards and best  practices in procurement processes,  support deviations and non-compliance  decisions as the need arises through risk- based decision- making.Emerging  cybersecurity risks are regularly assessed  and used tore-evaluate the need for  additional standards in  procurement.Critical aspects of  procurement and supply, such as total  lifecycle cost, quality, inter- operability,maintenance, support and other  value- adding activities, are continuously  improved, and procurement process  improvements are made in the context of  wider resource planning.Organisations are  able to benchmark the skills of their  procurement professionals against the  competencies outlined in procurement  standards and identify any skills and  capability gaps.  The country is actively involved in the  development and promotion of these  standards internationally.Implementation of  standards in procurement processes and  non- compliance decisions are made in  response to changing threat environments.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  108  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Standards  for Provision  of Products  and Services  Either no standards or best  practices have beenidentified  for use in securing the products  and services (in particular,  software, hardware, managed  servicesand cloud services)  developed or offered by  providers in the country.Or  there is some identification, but  only limited evidence of take- up.  Core activities and methodologies for  secure development and lifecycle  management for software, hardware and  provision of managed services and cloud  services are being identified and  discussed within professional  communities.Government promotes  relevant standards in software  development, hardware quality  assurance, provision of managed  services and cloud security but there isno  evidence of widespread adoption of these  standards yet.  There is evidence of widespread  implementation of standardsin the software  development processes, hardware quality  assurance, provision of managed services  and cloud servicesby public and private  sector organisations.Government has an  established programme for promoting and  monitoring standard adoption in software  development, hardware quality assurance  and cloud security, for public and  commercial systems.Evidence that high  integrity systems and software development  techniques are present within the  educational and training offerings in the  country.  Security considerations are incorporated  in all stages of the development of  software, hardware and provision of  managed services and cloud  services.Core development activities,  including configuration and documentation  management, security development and  lifecycle planning have been adopted into  the practices of product and service  providersProjects on software  development, hardware quality assurance,  managed service and cloud security  continuously assess the value of  standards and reduce or enhance levels of  compliance according to risk-based  decisions.  The country is actively involved in the  development and promotion of these  standards internationally.Implementation of  these standards and non-compliance  decisions are made in response to changing  threat environments.

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  109  B.3.19 Factor - D 5.2: Security Controls  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Technological  Security ontrols  There is minimal or no  understanding or  deployment of the  technological security  controls available in  themarketplace, by users  and public and private  sectors.Internet service and  other technology providers  may not offer any upstream  controls to their customers.  Technological security controls are  deployed by users and public and private  sectors, but possibly not consistently across  all sectors.The deployment of up-to-date  technological security controls is promoted  in an ad-hocmanner and all sectors are  being incentivised to make use of  them.Internet service and other technology  providers may be offering security services  as part of their services but possibly in an  ad-hoc manner.Internet service and other  technology providers recognise a need to  establish internal policies for the deployment  of technical security controls, to manage  identified risks in the products and services  they are offering.  Up-to-date technological security  controls, including patching and backups,  are deployed in all sectors.Physical  security controls are used to prevent  unauthorised personnel from entering  computing facilities in all sectors.Internet  service and other technology providers  establish internal policies for the  deployment of technical security controls,  to manage identified risks in the products  and services they are offering.The  technological cybersecurity control set  reflects internationally-established  cybersecurity frameworks, standards and  good practice.  Widespread adoption of technological security  controls leads to effective upstream protection of  users and public and private sectors.All sectors  have the capacity to continuously assess the  security controls deployed, for their  effectiveness and suitability according to their  changing needs.The understanding of the  technological security controls being deployed  extends to their impact on  organisationaloperations and budget  allocation.The public and private sectors have  the capacity to critically assess and upgrade  cybersecurity controls according to their  appropriateness and suitability for use, and  considering emerging risks.There is widespread  adoption of multi-factor authentication for online  services and privileged accounts. Certificate  Authorities are available and digital certificates  are widely used.Internet service and other  technology providers have the ability to prevent  access to non-trusted sites or webaddresses in  accordance with the requirements of the  appropriate regulator.  The application of advanced  technological controls within the  country is a leading influence  internationally.Implementation of  advanced technological security  controls are made in response to  changing threat environments.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  110  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Cryptographic  Controls  Cryptographic techniques  (e.g.: encryption and digital  signatures) for protection of  data at rest and data in  transit may be a concern but  are not yet deployed within  the government or private  sector, or by the general  public.  Cryptographic controls for protecting data  at rest and in transit are recognised and  deployed ad hoc by multiplestakeholders  and within various sectors.Tools, such as  TLS, are deployedad hoc by service  providers to secure all communications  between servers and users.  Cryptographic techniques are available  for all sectors and users for the  protection of data at rest or in  transit.There is a broad understanding of  secure communication services, such as  encrypted or signed email.The  cryptographic controls deployed meet  international standards and guidelines for  each sector and are kept up to  date.Tools, such as TLS are routinely  deployed by service providers to secure  all communications between servers and  users.  The public and private sectors critically  assess the deployment of cryptographic  controls, according to their objectives and  priorities.The public and private sectors adapt  encryption and cryptographic control policies  based on the evolution oftechnological  advancement and changing threat  environment.The public and private sectors  have developed encryption and cryptographic  control policies based on the  previousassessment, and regularly review the  policies for effectiveness.The country has  considered implementing digital-identity  management.The country has considered  whether it requires a national PKI.  The country is contributing to the  international debate around best  practice on cryptographic  controls.Implementation of  cryptographic controls are made in  response to changing threat  environments.

B.3.20 Factor – D 5.3 Software Quality  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Software  Quality and  Assurance  Quality and performance of  software used in the country is a  concern, but functional  requirements are not yet fully  monitored.A catalogue of  assured software platforms and  applications within the public and  private sectors does not  exist.Policies and processes  regarding updates and  maintenance (including patch  management) of software  applications have not yet been  formulated.  Software quality and functional requirements  in public and private sectors are recognised and  identified, but not necessarily in a strategic  manner.A catalogue for assured software  platforms and applications within the public and  private sectors is in development.Policies and  processes on software updates  andmaintenance (including patch management)  are now in development.Evidence of software  quality deficiencies is being gathered and  assessed regarding its impact on usability and  performance.  Software quality and functional  requirements in public and private sectors are  recognised and established.Reliable software  applications that adhere to international  standards and good practices are being used  widely in the public and private  sectors.Policies on and processes for  software updates andmaintenance (including  patch management) are established in all  sectors.Software applications are  characterised as to their reliability, usability  and performance in adherence to  international standards and good practices.  Quality of software used in public and  private sectors is monitored and  assessed.Policies and processes on  software updates andmaintenance  (including patch management) are being  improved, based on risk assessments and  the critical nature of services in all  sectors.Benefits to businesses from  additional investment in ensuring software  quality and maintenance are measured and  assessed.Software defects are  manageable in a timely manner and  service continuity is ensured.  Software applications of high- level  performance, reliability and usability  are available, with service continuity  processes fully  automated.Requirements of software  quality are being systematically  reviewed, updated, and adapted to  the changing cybersecurity  environment.

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  111  B.3.21 Factor - D 5.4: Communications and Internet Infrastructure Resilience  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Internet  Infrastructure  Reliability  Affordable and reliable Internet  services and infrastructure in the country  may not have been established; if they  have been, adoption rates of those  services are a concern.There is little or  no national oversight of network  infrastructure.If networks and systems  are outsourced, the reliability of third- party providers may not have been  considered.Network redundancy  measures may be considered, but not in  a systematic, comprehensive fashion.  Limited Internet services and  infrastructure are available, but with low  levels of adoption and issues of  unreliability.The ability of Internet  infrastructure in public and private sectors  to withstand incidents with minimum  disruption has been discussed by multiple  stakeholders but may not have been fully  addressed.Support for securing Internet  infrastructure may rely on regional  assistance.  Reliable Internet services are widely  available and used.Internet services are  trusted widely for conductinge-commerce and  electronic business transactions; appropriate  authentication processes are  established.Technology deployed and  processes used for managing Internet  infrastructure meet international standards  and follow good practices.National  infrastructure is formally managed, with  documented processes, roles and  responsibilities, and limited redundancy.  Regular assessments are  made of technology, of processes  for compliance with international  standards, and of guidelines that  address the national need inthe  face of emerging risks, and  changes are made as  required.There is effective and  controlled acquisition of critical  technologies, and there are  managed strategic planning and  service continuity processes in  place.  Acquisition of infrastructure technologies  is effectively controlled, with flexibility  incorporated according to changing market  dynamics.Costs for infrastructure  technologies are continually assessed and  optimised.Scientific, technical, industrial  and human capabilities are being  systematically maintained, enhanced, and  perpetuated in order to maintain the  country’s independent  resilience.Optimised efficiency is in place  to mediate extended outages of systems.  Monitoring  and Response  No risk assessments are conducted by  Internet infrastructure owners to identify  vulnerable assets and prioritise  protective actions.There is no monitoring  in place to detect that incidents have  occurred.No incident response plans are  in place.  Processes on developing risk  assessments for Internet infrastructure  owners have been initiated.There is ad- hoc monitoring of parts of the  Internetinfrastructure, but it may not be  comprehensive.Incident response plans  are in development in some sectors.  Mechanisms are in place in both public and  private sectors to conduct risk assessments,  monitor and test network resilience, and to  respond to incidents.Incident response plans  are in place in both public and private sectors  and are regularly tested and kept under  review.Appropriate resources are allocated to  hardwareintegration, technology stress  testing, personnel training, monitoring,  response, and drills to test response plans.  Risks related to emerging and  converging technologies are  regularly assessed by Internet  Infrastructure owners.Risks  related to emerging and  converging technologies are  regularly assessed by regulatory  agencies responsible for  electronic communications  networks and this is used to  inform funding and priority  decisions.  National-level assets can act to work  with the international community in the  event of a trans-jurisdictional crisis or  incident.Lessons learnt from international  collaborations are used toevolve  monitoring and response  capabilities.Evidence exists that sovereign  novel monitoring and response capabilities  are being developed in anticipation of  emerging threats.

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  112  B.3.22 Factor - D 5.5: Cybersecurity Marketplace  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Cybersecurity  Technologies  If domestic production of  cybersecurity technologies  exists, it does not follow secure  processes.The country has not  considered the security  implications of using foreign  cybersecurity technologies.  If there is domestic production, the  need for secure processes is  recognised.If there is reliance on foreign  technologies, the security implications  are considered.  If there is domestic production, secure  processes are in place.If there is reliance on  foreign technologies, the security implications  are identified and mitigated in the context of an  international supply chain.  If there is local development of  cybersecurity technology, it abides by  secure codingguidelines, good  practices and adheres to  internationally- accepted  standards.Risk assessments and  market incentives inform the  prioritisation of productdevelopment  and mitigation of identified risks.The  security implications of using foreign  technologies are routinely analysed  and revised based on the assessment  of emerging cybersecurity risks.  Security functions in software and  computer system configurations are  automated in the development and  deployment of technologies.Domestic  cybersecurity products are exported to  other nations and are considered  superior products.The country has  established a body to assure the  security of foreign technologies  (devices and software) and supply  chains, or to certify entities which can  do this.  Cybersecurity  Services and  Expertise  Cybersecurity consultancy  services are not widely on offer  in the country.Few if any service  providers have professional  certification.  There are a growing number of  cybersecurity consultancyservices  available for private and public  organisations.A growing number of  service providers provide detail of the  professional certifications they  possess.There may be limited or no  guidance to assist organisations with the  selection of service providers.  There are widespread cybersecurity consultancy  services available for private and public  organisations.All service providers provide details  of the professional certifications they possess.A  national body accredits service providers, to  assist organisations in selecting service  providers.  Private and public organisations  routinely seek advice from  cybersecurity consultancy services,  including advice about emerging  risks.There is an adequate supply of  cybersecurity professionals in the  country.  The cybersecurity service sector in  the country helps shape the  international market.  Security  Implications of  Outsourcing  No risk assessments are  conducted to determine how to  mitigate the risks of outsourcing  IT to a third party or cloud  services.There is a lack of  understanding of the security  measures that the outsourced  IT service provider applies.  Some organisations and sectors  conduct risk assessments to determine  how to mitigate the risks of outsourcing  IT to a third party or cloud services.At  least some organisations and sectors  understand the security measures that  the outsourced IT service provider  applies.At least some organisations have  developed business continuity and  disaster recovery processes.  Most major organisations from the public and  private sectors conduct risk assessments to  determine how to mitigate the risks of  outsourcing IT to a third party or cloud  services.There is widespread understanding of  the security guarantees provided by the  outsourced IT service providers.Most  organisations have developed and tested  processes to support business continuity and  disaster recovery.  Insights arising from risk  assessments are routinely analysed in  order to establish and promote  cybersecurity best practices to  mitigate the risk of outsourcing  IT.Different risk scenarios with the IT  service provider are explored and  tested, including emerging risks.  The country is contributing to  international best practice on how to  mitigate the risk of outsourcing IT.  Cyber Insurance  The need for a cyber- insurance market may have  been identified, but no products  and servicesare widely  available, either domestically or  from external providers.  The need for a market in cyber-  insurance has been identified through  the assessment of financial risks for the  public and private sectors, and the  appropriateness of availableofferings is  now being discussed.  A market for cyber-insurance is established  and encourages the sharing of threat-  information among participants of the  market.Products suitable for small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) are also on offer.  Cyber-insurance market offers a  variety of covers to mitigate  consequential losses.Cover is  selected by organisations based on  strategic planning needs and identified  risk.The cyber-insurance market is  innovative and adapts to emerging  risks, standards andpractices, while  addressing the full scope of cyber  harm.Insurance premium reductions  are offered for consistent cyber-  secure behaviour.  Cyber-insurance practices in the  country help to shape the international  market.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  113  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Sharing  Vulnerability  Information  There is no informal way of  sharing information among the  stakeholders about the technical  details of  vulnerabilities.Software and  service providers generally lack  the ability to address bug and  vulnerability reports.  Technical details of vulnerabilities are  shared informally with other stakeholders  which can distribute the information more  broadly.Software and service providers  are able to address bug and vulnerability  reports but there may not be formal  protocols for doing so.  There are formal information- sharing  mechanisms or channels in place to share the  technical details of vulnerabilities with other  stakeholders, which can distribute the  information more broadly.A substantial  proportion of vulnerabilities in products and  services are remedied within defined deadlines  after their discovery.  Vulnerability information-sharing  mechanisms are continuously  reviewed and updated basedon the  needs of all affected stakeholders, and  in the light of emerging risks.All  affected products and services are  routinely updated within defined  deadline.Processes are in place to  review and reduce deadlines where  possible.  The country is contributing to the  debate and international best practice  on the sharing of vulnerability  information.  Policies,  Processes and  Legislation for  Responsible  Disclosure of  Security Flaws  The need for a responsible-  disclosure policy in public and  private sector organisations,  and the right to legal protections  for those disclosing security  flaws are not yet acknowledged.  The need for a responsible- disclosure  policy in public and private sector  organisationsis recognised but policies or  processes may not be in place, or may  only be in development.The right to legal  protections for those disclosing security  flaws is recognised but legislation may  not be in place; or may only be in  development.Software and service  providers commit to refraining from  taking legal action against a party  disclosing information responsibly.  A responsible-disclosure policy or framework  is in place in public and private sector  organisations, and includes a disclosure  deadline, scheduled resolution, and the need for  acknowledgement.Organisations have  established processes to receive and  disseminate vulnerability information  responsibly.The right to legal protections for  those disclosing security flaws responsibly is in  place.  Responsible-disclosure policies and  processes are continuously reviewed  and updated based on the needs of all  affected stakeholders and in the light  of emerging risks.An analysis of the  technical details of vulnerabilitiesis  published and advisory information is  disseminated according to individual  roles and responsibilities.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  The importance of a sound governance model for the implementation of the National  Cybersecurity Strategies (NCSSs) has been highlighted in numerous testimonies of the Member  States as well as included in the NIS and NIS2 Directive. However, each country deploys its  own governance model with a different level of maturity.  ENISA, taking on its mandate to support and promote the development, deployment and  implementation of the NCSS and accompanying governance models, produced this study on  \"Building Effective Governance Frameworks for The Implementation of National Cybersecurity  Strategies\". It analyses existing governance models to share a set of good practices when  developing a governance model and putting in place the different governance elements.  The proposed governance model consists of four layers with 10 sub-categories, and provides a  total of 28 good practices:  • Political governance  o Political processes;  o Roles and responsibilities; and  o Legal measures.  • Strategic governance  o Strategy itself and its implementation; and  o Risk identification and mitigation.  • Technical governance  o International standards and technical guidelines; and  o Use of technology, tools and certification schemes.  • Operational governance  o Awareness raising;  o Incident response; and  o Information sharing.  The good practices have been defined based on data collected through desk research and  interviews with experts and relevant stakeholders from the Member States. The data collected  has been analysed to identify trends, and effective instances across the different elements of  governance. While the interviews had a European focus with 19 interviews with stakeholders  from 18 EU Member States, the geographical scope of the desk research includes a global  outreach.  Finally, this report provides insights on KPIs and general indicators to monitor and evaluate the  status of implementation of the NCSS and its governance model.

INTRODUCTION  With the publication of the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive1 in July 2016 and  issuing of the draft agreement of the NIS2 in June 2022, the EU Member States have been  required to adopt a National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS). The NCSS should put forward  strategic principles, and guidelines, objectives and priorities to improve and maintain a higher  level of security in the context of network and information systems.  In this relation, and as stated by the EU Cybersecurity Act2, ENISA shall not only support the  Member States in developing national strategies but shall also promote the effective  deployment of those strategies and support the set-up of a governance model ensuring the  sustainability of the NCSS.  As part of its mandate, ENISA publishes a study focusing on the good practices around the set- up and deployment of a governance framework to support the implementation of the NCSS in  the EU. The objective of this study is to systematically review existing governance models  relevant to the deployment of a NCSS and to identify and select the most relevant instances,  lessons learned, and good practices from the EU Member States.  This study aims to collect insights on the definition of processes, roles, and responsibilities, the  subsequent deployment of monitoring measures, and to identify the main challenges and good  practices that the EU Member States put in place to ensure an effective governance framework  for the implementation of NCSSs.  3.1 METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH  The methodological approach used to gather the best practices of governance frameworks  relies on four main steps:  1. Desk Research: The first step involved conducting an extensive literature review to  collect good practices and trends on governance models. The desk research has been  focused on good practices adopted in the EU Member States, while insights collected  from around the world complement the analysis. A systematic literature review  approach has been deployed to review all documents coherently and to  methodologically assess the insights of each source in terms of relevance, usefulness,  and applicability.  2. Collection of experts and stakeholders’ points of view: In this context, 19  stakeholders from 18 EU Member States have been interviewed to gain first-hand  insights on the status of governance models across the EU Member States, and to  identify good practices, as well as challenges, needs and lessons learned. The national  stakeholders have all been part of the national authority or government body in charge  of the cybersecurity strategy.  3. Analysis of stocktaking input: The data collected through desk research and  interviews were subsequently analysed to identify good practices in the design of a  governance framework.  1 European Parliament and Council, (2016).

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  10  4. COMMON ELEMENTS OF  GOVERNANCE MODELS  This section defines a common understanding of the concepts of governance, cyber  governance, and governance models. Moreover, it highlights the main results and insights from  the literature review conducted on the topic of governance models of NCSS. By doing so it  outlines the main elements of different levels of governance and builds the framework for  analysis leveraged on in chapter 5.  4.1 DEFINITION OF GOVERNANCE, CYBER GOVERNANCE AND  GOVERNANCE MODELS  The desk research on governance models included 49 sources, reaching from academic and  scientific articles, over reports, to guides on how to develop governance models as well as  governance models themselves. The main focus of the geographical scope has been the EU,  nevertheless, inputs from other countries (e.g., USA) have been considered to ensure a wide  array of results and to also take into account the developments in other parts of the world.  4.1.1 Governance  The term governance is used in a plethora of different topics and different contexts. Following  the vast amount of available literature on the topic of governance, there is not one, all- encompassing definition that would hold across its different areas of application. Rather,  multiple but complementary, partly overlapping definitions exist to describe and detail what  ‘governance’ entails.  Stemming from the original meaning of ‘governing’ in the context of individual rule it is and has  been used throughout time often about institutional structures. The concept originally describes  actions and processes to lead, structure, and enable institutions and organisations to exist,  function, and persist. Only recently, governance has been related to international institutions  and gained popularity. It has started to be used by international organisations such as the  European Union, World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Organisation for  Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) more frequently. Further, it has been stated  that since the concept has gained more popularity, governance became one of the most  controversially discussed topics when it comes to democracy theory and democratisation.3  Governance is predominantly seen as:  • a process to coordinate a network of stakeholders with independent positions,  opposing and conflicting opinions and interests;  • a mechanism to steer and control society, and results from the interaction of political,  economic and social actors;  • a complex system including different stakeholders from the public administration, the  private sector and non-governmental organizations, influenced by interactions thereof;  and  3 Savas  S. & Karatas, S.

Governance includes stakeholders from the  private sector, public administration as well as civil society and spans over different  topics such as economic, social and political priorities.  4.1.2 Cyber governance  The domains of cyber, cybersecurity and cyber threats experienced increasing importance, and  cyber governance became a popular topic. While the field of cyber or ‘cyberspace’ describes  the environment consisting of the global information systems and their connecting network,  cybersecurity entails the prevention of damage and the protection against attacks on, among  others, computers, information and communication systems as well as processes, data, hard-  and software.5 Threats in the cyberspace arise from attacks on the processed information or the  systems themselves. Cybersecurity is also part of the cyberspace and aims at securing the  confidentiality, integrity, accessibility, availability and privacy of the information processed,  stored and used.6 Given the interconnections in the cyberspace, cybersecurity cannot be  assessed, analysed or described without taking into account other aspects of cyberspace as  well.  The functioning of the cyberspace depends on various stakeholders, processes and elements  within cyber governance. International organisations started to find solutions for challenges  related to cyber governance, for example developing and signing the ‘Cyber Crime  Convention’'.7 In addition, international standardisation has been adopted, i.e., ISO/IEC  38500:2015 providing guiding principles8 for governing bodies’ members on “effective, efficient  and acceptable use of IT in their organizations”.9  Definitions of cyber governance are emerging and describe it as the  “Operation of decision-making processes” which increase and ensure “participation,  transparency, and accountability in taking measures related to cyberspace together  with the mechanism of international agreements, strategies, laws, measures,  regulations, and standards that interlock in the best way”.10  This definition will be used for the remainder of this study.  4.1.3 Governance Models  Similar to the definition of governance, a single definition of the governance model is not agreed  upon in the literature. Different types, descriptions and definitions have been developed  covering different levels of granularity. This section aims to provide an overview of the current  state of the art of developing governance models. To this end, structured desk research has  4 Savas  S. & Karatas, S.

In the literature, two main patterns of defining governance models are predominant, one  focusing on the different layers of governance and one targeting the stakeholders and  objectives of the model. An advantage of the latter is that overarching and transversal activities  can be integrated, analysed and evaluated. However, this might come at the expense of the  accuracy of the definition of the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders involved and their  accountability. The Government Cyber Security Strategy of the British Government employs this  path in defining its governance model and focuses on the overall objectives of the  implementation of the cybersecurity strategy.11  Defining a governance model based on its different layers might increase the overall complexity  of the framework, however, this option yields several benefits, including a more thorough  description of its components (e.g., stakeholders, objectives, etc.). In addition, it is possible to  provide a clear allocation of responsibilities and describe more detailed channels of  communication, information exchange and collaboration. The different levels of governance  include the political aspect, definition of processes, roles and responsibilities, operationalisation  of actions and their technical implementation. The Global Cybersecurity Index divides  governance models into legal, technical, organisational, capacity development and cooperative  measures.12 Similarly, cybersecurity governance in some US States focuses on the following  areas of governance, as identified by the Department of Homeland Security: Strategy and  planning, budget and acquisition, risk identification and mitigation, incident response,  information sharing, workforce and education.13  This report will follow the majority of sources analysed and will define governance models along  different levels or layers. This allows the provision of a more granular assessment of  governance models. The elements of the framework such as objectives, stakeholders and  actions can be described per level, providing a holistic approach to their definition.  While governance can be divided into a variety of levels, most sources assessed governance  along similar layers. Based on the conducted desk research four main levels of governance  have been identified as predominant, thus, these were selected to build the governance  framework of this report:  a) Political governance;  b) Strategic governance;  c) Operational governance; and  d) Technical governance.  The next section will provide an overview of the main elements driving each of the four levels of  governance.  4.2 THE STATE OF ART OF GOVERNANCE MODEL FOR NCS  In general, political governance is the most thoroughly covered level of governance in literature.  Specifically, the set-up of processes and the allocation of responsibilities to ensure a successful  governance framework are the most prominent elements.14 In addition, elements concerning  incident response in the context of operational governance have been pointed out by several  11 UK Cabinet Office, Government Cyber Security Strategy: 2022 to 2030, policy paper published by the UK Government,  2022, available https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-cyber-security-strategy-2022-to-2030.  12 ITU, Global Cybersecurity Index, ITU Publications, 2021, available at https://www.itu.int/pub/D-STR-GCI.01-2021.  13  Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, Cybersecurity Governance Publications, CISA Publications, 2017,  available https://www.cisa.gov/publication/cybersecurity-governance-publications.  14 Among others: ITU, Global Cybersecurity Index, ITU Publications, 2021, available at https://www.itu.int/pub/D-STR- GCI.01-2021; Savas  S. & Karatas, S.

In addition to the main elements governing the different levels of governance, the literature  emphasises the importance of monitoring mechanisms across all levels. Their establishment  along with the ones of key performance indicators (KPIs) or other measures for coherent  evaluation is important for the successful implementation of NCSSs. Chapter 6 covers the  monitoring of governance models in detail.  The remainder of this chapter will highlight the findings and point out the identified trends from  the desk research across the four levels of governance: political, strategic, operational and  technical. This provides the framework for the analysis carried out under chapter 5, which  focuses on the inputs shared by the Member States.  4.2.1 Political governance  Political governance provides a framework of defined processes and relationships as well as  legal guidelines. It establishes the formal angle of governance and is often seen as governance  itself, as it is tightly related to the execution of political actions and entails governing, leading  and overseeing processes and actions implemented. The main objective of the political layer is  the establishment of processes, roles and responsibilities to ensure the implementation of the  NCSSs and their related policies. In turn, official processes, clearly defined roles and proper  legal measures foster the creation of accountability, ensure transparency and facilitate the  acceptance of the NCSSs among all the relevant stakeholders.  Political bodies, such as dedicated cybersecurity agencies or departments within different  ministries are leading the political level. Hence, oftentimes, decision-makers are included in  some of the processes to ensure accountability and political acceptance. Other actors actively  participating in building and executing political governance are academia, consultancies and  other expert bodies, which provide topical expertise and support to political actors in setting up,  organising and executing political governance. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) play an  important role in the enforcement and accountability of political governance, as they help build  bridges between the private and the public sector, ensuring the implementation of actions  responding to industry needs.16  Common elements of political governance can be clustered into three main groups, as defined  in Figure 1, namely: i) Political processes, ii) Roles and responsibilities, and iii) Legal measures.  15 Among others: Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, Cybersecurity Governance Publications, CISA Publications,  2017, available https://www.cisa.gov/publication/cybersecurity-governance-publications; ITU, Global Cybersecurity Index,  ITU Publications, 2021, available at https://www.itu.int/pub/D-STR-GCI.01-2021; Cybersecurity foundation, The NCS Guide  2021, 2021, available https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/; ENISA, NCSS Good Practice Guide, ENISA Publications, 2016,  available https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ncss-good-practice-guide.  16  ENISA, Public Private Partnerships (PPP) – Cooperative models, ENISA publications, 2018, available  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/public-private-partnerships-ppp-cooperative-models.  https://www.cisa.gov/publication/cybersecurity-governance-publications https://www.itu.int/pub/D-STR-GCI.01-2021 https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ncss-good-practice-guide https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/public-private-partnerships-ppp-cooperative-models  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  14  Figure 1: Main elements of political governance  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  In general, political governance seems to be the most advanced of all four levels of governance,  in fact, measures to define political processes, roles and responsibilities seem to be most  actively discussed and analysed by the literature. Legal measures are not equally assessed,  however, their importance is vital as they set the basis for the country’s legal framework and the  obligations of the different stakeholders.  Political Processes  Among the elements of political processes, particular emphasis is put on initiating cooperative  and collaborative approaches and ensuring joint dialogues. In this context, the inclusion and  active participation of various stakeholder groups across different levels has been stressed17,  together with the creation and active integration of PPPs in the political processes given their  contribution in actively shaping the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of NCSSs.18  Additionally, the importance of inter-sectoral cooperation has been highlighted due to the  possibility of creating synergies and ensuring commitment to the implementation of actions  among stakeholders.19  In addition, cooperation and collaboration across the different governmental institutions are  essential to guarantee a coherent approach towards the implementation of the NCSSs. Intra- governmental coordination and cooperation are considered core functions and prerequisites for  functioning governance mechanisms, such as the application of standards, regulations and  market incentives. Hence, cooperation between government institutions is ultimately important  17 Savas  S. & Karatas, S.

It  has been stated that, given the international character of the cyberspace, a complete solution  for cyber governance cannot be based on national understanding alone, but needs to be  embedded and coordinated in the international arena.21 Further, international cooperation,  collaboration and exchange on the set-up of a governance model will benefit all parties through  the development and improvement of cyber governance. In this regard, the development of an  international common language for cyber defence is considered an immediate necessity to  enable international exchange among experts.22  Definition of roles and responsibilities  After the political processes, the definition of roles and responsibilities is the most covered  aspect in literature. All stakeholders must have clearly allocated roles, and responsibilities to  ensure the successful implementation of the strategy and achieving its objectives.23 In this  relation, it has been mentioned that personnel and financial resources should be clearly defined  and allocated. The clear allocation of responsibilities is important to ensure accountability of the  responsible actors, while the clear allocation of roles is important to set up an effective and  efficient governance system and avoid overlapping of mandates.  A common trend emerging from desk research is the setting-up of a lead authority or body.  While different options can be deployed to do so, a central body or actor taking the main  coordinating responsibilities and roles seems beneficial and is important to allocate actions and  monitor the progress of implementation.24 There are three commonly applied options: building  an entirely new body dedicated to the implementation of the NCSS; expanding the mandate and  the responsibilities of an already existing central body; or extending the responsibilities of  several decentralized political entities, such as ministries. In addition, working groups on  different topics might be established to enable engagement across bodies and entities  involved.25 They facilitate and develop formalized cooperation mechanisms to enable  international collaboration.26 Finally, the establishment of an advisory council built by academic  and industry experts to be consulted by responsible government officials has been pointed out  as particularly beneficial.27  Another option refers to the partial or full outsourcing of the cybersecurity services to PPPs by  establishing them as stand-alone organisations. This is particularly helpful if the government  misses the expertise or capacity to react to the identified needs for action. The PPPs provide  20  Sutherland, E.

The organisation, structure and legal basis of PPPs differentiate from  country to country, however, a common factor pointed out by several sources is the relevance of  including governmental and private sector representatives (e.g., SMEs) in the PPP decision- making process.29  Legal measures  Regarding legal measures for governance models, it has been stressed that the establishment  of a legal framework or a legal governance system is important to provide guidance and  support. Additionally, the existence of legal measures provides legally binding mandates and  ensures enforcement, accountability and transparency during the implementation process.30 On  implementing legal measures, it has been specified that they should be built in a far-sighted  approach to be able to accompany future changes brought by digitalisation.31  To support the cooperative and collaborative approach, legal measures should be inclusive and  have general validity, to ensure that all institutions, organisations and related stakeholders are  committed to the NCSS, its governance model and the implementing actions. Legal measures  also help giving policies and actions for the implementation of a governance model a binding  character and are hence essential tools of a complete governance model.32  In line with the importance of setting up international cooperation and collaboration, the legal  framework should reflect this by international guidelines and cooperation on the definition of  legal measures internationally. Lastly, it is emphasised that human rights should be tightly  connected to and taken into account in all processes of setting-up a cybersecurity governance  model, but specifically related to the legal framework. Of particular importance is ensuring trust,  transparency, and equity through the legal framework.33  4.2.2 Strategic governance  Strategic governance describes the level of governance directly linked to the NCSS. It is  important to tightly connect the processes of designing the strategy and designing its  governance model to ensure continuity and coherence. Strategic governance targets linking and  coordinating the processes of drafting the strategy and building the governance model from the  outset. Additionally, strategic elements of identifying and mitigating risks necessitate strong  cooperation and collaboration between actors involved in both, the governance model, as well  as the strategy development.  The main stakeholders involved in the strategic governance level are political actors drafting the  strategy. Often, working level government officials are main actors here, while higher level  government officials are involved for validation, acceptance, accountability and enforcement  purposes. Political actors are often supported by working groups, consulting bodies and other  28  Marsh & McLennan, MMC Cyber Handbook 2021 – Cyber Resilience Perspectives: Clarity in the midst of Crisis,  MarshMcLennan Publications, 2021, available https://www.marshmclennan.com/insights/publications/2020/october/mmc- cyber-handbook-2021-.html.  29  ENISA, Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) – Cooperative models, ENISA publications, 2018, available  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/public-private-partnerships-ppp-cooperative-models..  30 Cybersecurity foundation, The NCS Guide 2021, 2021, available https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/.  31 Savas  S. & Karatas, S.

Overall, three clusters have been identified in which the main elements of strategic governance  can be grouped, namely elements concerning: i) the strategy itself, ii) the implementation of the  governance model, iii) strategic aspects of risk identification and mitigation. Figure 2 illustrates  them.  Figure 2: Main elements of strategic governance  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  Elements concerning the strategy itself and the implementation of a governance model  Firstly, the literature on strategic governance emphasises that already at the set-up stage of the  strategy, the development of a governance framework should be taken into account and  included in the strategy. Drafting the strategy and at the same time already including possible  operational, political and legal measures, which should be put in place for the strategy’s  implementation, is argued to be beneficial, as processes and timelines are streamlined.34  Secondly, after the strategy has been drafted, the implementation should be guided by an  implementation plan to point out specific actions and ensure the support of the strategy across  the different governmental and civil society levels.35  Thirdly, thorough planning and a clear indication of the overall planned priorities, the foreseen  budget and resources is important to integrate the implementation of cybersecurity in the  general national planning and governance approaches. It is important to align priorities of the  34 Cybersecurity foundation, The NCS Guide 2021, 2021, available https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/.  35 Cybersecurity foundation, The NCS Guide 2021, 2021, available https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/; ITU, Global Cybersecurity  Index, ITU Publications, 2021, available at https://www.itu.int/pub/D-STR-GCI.01-2021; Marsh & McLennan, MMC Cyber  Handbook 2021 – Cyber Resilience Perspectives: Clarity in the midst of Crisis, Marsh McLennan Publications, 2021, available  https://www.marshmclennan.com/insights/publications/2020/october/mmc-cyber-handbook-2021-.html.  https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/ https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/ https://www.itu.int/pub/D-STR-GCI.01-2021 https://www.marshmclennan.com/insights/publications/2020/october/mmc-cyber-handbook-2021-.html  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  18  cybersecurity strategy with other governmental priorities on national level. This fosters  commitment and support from different bodies, and actors across the government.36  Risk identification and mitigation  Regarding the strategic elements of risk identification and mitigation, it has been stressed that a  coherent approach across all government entities and critical infrastructure operators should be  aimed for. Having a sound approach for risk identification and mitigation, which is coherent  across the different actors, facilitates exchange and information-sharing and fosters  cooperation.37 In fact, the creation of specific agencies providing services of risk identification  and mitigation has been pointed out, as centralizing these aspects facilitates exchanges.  However, challenges related to accountability, transparency and the protection of human rights.  This should be taken into account and mitigated from an early stage of the strategy.38  4.2.3 Operational governance  Operational governance entails the level of governance focusing on elements related with the  translation of NCSSs into actions to improve cybersecurity within the country. The objective of  the operational governance level is to increase cybersecurity across all sectors of a nation’s  society, economy, and government. The main group of stakeholders, actively involved in the  set-up and execution of this governance layer includes specialised bodies such as Computer  Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and Computer Emergency Response Teams  (CERTs), government officials and consulting and training bodies. Nevertheless, it is important  to mention that the complete society and population is connected to this level of governance.  Effectively improving cybersecurity can only be successful if the general public of a country is  included and capacity and community-building efforts are undertaken across society.  As pointed out, some aspects falling under the operational governance level are well covered in  literature on governance models. This applies particularly to aspects in the context of incident  response and capacity-building.39 During the desk research, three main clusters governing  operational governance have been identified: i) awareness-raising campaigns, outreach  campaigns and trainings to foster capacity-building, ii) incident response, iii) information sharing  and channels Figure 3 illustrates them:  36 Cybersecurity foundation, The NCS Guide 2021, 2021, available https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/; Marsh & McLennan, MMC  Cyber Handbook 2021 – Cyber Resilience Perspectives: Clarity in the midst of Crisis, Marsh McLennan Publications, 2021,  available https://www.marshmclennan.com/insights/publications/2020/october/mmc-cyber-handbook-2021-.html.  37 Cybersecurity foundation, The NCS Guide 2021, 2021, available https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/.  38  Sutherland, E.

Awareness raising campaigns, outreach campaigns and trainings to foster capacity-building  Awareness raising and outreach campaigns accompanying the implementation of NCSSs foster  the acceptance and uptake of cybersecurity measures. It is of utmost importance to train  stakeholders, which are involved either directly with the set-up or implementation of the strategy  or involved in combating cybercrime.40 Nevertheless, there is a strong trend incentivising the  creation of initiatives to raise awareness within the general population. Through explaining  “why”, “how” to use certain standards, tools and technologies, or “what” to do and “why” to do  so, would increase the safety of the general population.  In this sense, it has been repeatedly stated that not only stakeholders and actors directly  working with the NCSSs should be targeted by education campaigns and trainings, but that  instead the whole population, starting from a young age, should be integrated in these activities  to close the ‘cyber skill gap’.41  This would be important to ensure success of the NCSS, as  huge cyber risks emerge from untrained persons, which are not aware of risks or how to protect  against cyber threats effectively. A more holistic approach should be taken in order to build a  cybersecurity culture and enhance capacity- and community-building across the population. In  this way, by shifting away from pure information-sharing and problem-related approaches,  cybersecurity could yield efficiency and performance gains for the private sector and the  national economy.42  Incident response mechanisms  Operational governance is also driven by formalised mechanisms for incident response.  Literature suggests the creation of CSIRTs and CERTs to provide support in case of  cybersecurity incidents. Specialised teams dedicated to cybersecurity mechanisms should be  40 Cybersecurity foundation, The NCS Guide 2021, 2021, available https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/.  41 Savas  S. & Karatas, S.

CSIRT and CERT bodies should hence take proactive as well as reactive  functions and measures to not only support during incidents, but to also prevent incidents from  happening and support countries in learning from experience to build resilience against  cyberthreats.44  Information sharing  Setting-up formal information-sharing programmes as well as defining possible informal  information-sharing programmes through an operational framework would foster effective and  consistent coordination.45 Trusted relationships are highly important, more specifically, the  development of informal networks would be highly beneficial as information-sharing based on  personal interests is most authentic.46 However, trusted relationships need time to develop and  hence, the involvement of different stakeholders and close cooperation from the start seem to  be important.47 Additionally, according to research, shaping information-sharing processes  should be supported by CERTs and CSIRTs.48  For a successful incident response, it is highly important in this context to firstly define clearly  what a cybersecurity incident constitutes, and how processes, roles and responsibilities are  allocated and performed during an incident.  4.2.4 Technical governance  The technical level of governance relates to the inclusion of technology and technical elements  accompanying the implementation of the strategy. Its objective is to link the implementation of  the strategy to technical and technological developments happening in parallel. This is  particularly important in the cyberspace, a fast-evolving field, in which new threats and  challenges arise at the same time of new technological possibilities and solutions. The main  stakeholders involved in this level are technology experts from industry and academia,  supporting political actors in choosing and applying technological tools as well as technical  standardisation bodies on a national and international scale.  Currently, the elements of technical governance are covered least in the literature and seem to  not yet been heavily focussed on. Although some trends have been identified, due to the low  coverage of technical aspects across literature, these trends might not be representative, given  the fast technical advancements and developments. Two main clusters of elements governing  technical governance have been identified during the desk research: i) definition of standards  and specification, and ii) use of technology, tools and certification schemes to foster  cybersecurity. They are illustrated in Figure 4.  43 Cybersecurity foundation, The NCS Guide 2021, 2021, available https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/.  44 ITU, Global Cybersecurity Index, ITU Publications, 2021, available at https://www.itu.int/pub/D-STR-GCI.01-2021.  45 Cybersecurity foundation, The NCS Guide 2021, 2021, available https://ncsguide.org/the-guide/  46  Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, Cybersecurity Governance Publications, CISA Publications, 2017,  available https://www.cisa.gov/publication/cybersecurity-governance-publications.  47  Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, Cybersecurity Governance Publications, CISA Publications, 2017,  available https://www.cisa.gov/publication/cybersecurity-governance-publications.  48 Savas  S. & Karatas, S.

Standardisation  The use and definition of standards has been emphasised in order to build a technical  governance framework for cybersecurity. Particularly important in this relation would be the use  of international and global standards to not only provide technical guidelines but to base  cybersecurity governance on existing and globally established technical standards.49  Use of technology, tools and certification schemes  The technical layer also includes the undertaking of appropriate and proportionate technical and  organisational measures to manage risks. To this end the NIS2 directive emphasises the  importance of certification schemes and stresses the importance for the Member States to  require essential and important entities to certify certain ICT products, ICT services and ICT  processes under specific European cybersecurity certification schemes.  Moreover, CSA article 58 defines mandatory obligations for the Member States to designate  NCCAs (National Cybersecurity Certification Authorities) or to reuse the existing NCCA of  another Member State, as to supervise certification; this entails the implementation and  assessment of the technical governance activities related to such obligations (which entity has  been designated, to which ministry it belongs, how it is staffed, how it interacts with other  national authorities having a cybersecurity role, etc.).  A second main element emerges from the use of technology and tools to support the set-up of a  governance model and the implementation of the NCSSs. Updating tools and technologies used  in industry, by the government or other communication systems, can support reaching the  NCSS’s objectives. In addition, technology and tools such as mobile devices can not only  support security but can also provide technological guidance and open possibilities to promote  human rights in the sphere of cybersecurity.50 However, if not updated, tools and technology  may pose risks to cybersecurity.  49  NIST, Cybersecurity Framework, NIST Publications, 2018, available, https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/resources;  NIST, Success Stories – Israel National Cyber Directorate v. 1.0, 2020, available  https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/success-stories/israel-national-cyber-directorate-version-20; Savas  S. & Karatas, S.

Figure 5 below showcases the status of  each country of developing updated versions and new editions of their NCSS.  Figure 5: State of Art: NCSSs across the EU Member States  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  All 18 Member States51 interviewed for this report have currently a governance model in place  to support the implementation of the NCSS. Similarly, all Member State representatives stated  that having in place a governance model is highly important when implementing the NCSS.  Figure 5 provides an overview of the EU Member States which have deployed their first NCSS  governance model and highlights in a darker blue those countries which already employed later  editions of the governance model. In general, it can be said that the NCSSs are updated every  three to seven years. The governance model would need to be updated as well, taking into  account recent developments in the cyberspace due to its close relationship with the NCSS.  51 The following Member States have been interviewed during this study: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic,  Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  23  Figure 6: State of Art: Deployment of governance models for NCSS across the EU Member  States  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  From Figure 6, it can be noticed that some countries introduced an accompanying governance  model over the years, and that some countries introduced it only after the first NCSS was  already deployed. While this shows that the Member States used to have different approaches  to implementing their NCSSs, it also indicates growing agreement of the importance of setting- up a governance model. It is interesting to notice that maturity of the governance model does  not necessarily depend on or correlate with the number of further editions of the NCSS.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  24  5. SETTING UP A  GOVERNANCE MODEL  Following the identification of the different levels of a governance model, this section will focus  on the analysis of the different elements of each layer and will highlight the good practices  shared by the Member States’ representatives during the conducted interviews.  Before diving into the different governance models, it is important to have an overview of the  political systems of the EU Member States to understand whether this factor influences the  selection of a specific governance model. Figure 7 illustrates the model of government and self- governance of the Member States. Regarding the government model, out of a total of 27  Member States, 21 countries have a parliamentary political system52, one has a presidential  political system53 and five have a semi-presidential political system54. While, with regard to the  self-governance model, out of a total of 27 Member States, 18 of them have unitary self- governance55, three of them have federal one56, two a devolved self-governance57 and four of  them have a federate one58.  To analyse the relation between a country’s government model, self-governance structure and  the type of governance model of the NCSS currently deployed, the different governance models  highlighted during the interviews have been mapped against desk research on government and  self-governance types. It has been noted that there is no correlation between the type of  government, self-governance, and the governance model of the NCSS. In fact, there are  several additional factors that influence its definition. For instance, the size of a country, its level  of maturity in the cyber domain, and the level of cooperation with the private sector, just to  name a few. This finding led to the conclusion that it is not possible to have a unique  governance model to be used as a reference. Therefore, in this chapter, for each element of the  different levels of governance, good practices rather than a governance model will be shared.  52 A parliamentary political system is a democratic form of government in which the party (or a coalition of parties) with the  greatest representation in the parliament (legislature) forms the government, its leader becoming prime minister or chancellor.  53 A presidential political system is a form of government in which a head of government, typically with the title of president,  leads an executive branch that is separate from the legislative branch in systems that use separation of powers.  54 A semi-presidential political system is a system of government in which a president exists alongside a prime minister and  a cabinet, with the latter two responding to the legislature of the state.  55 A unitary state is a system of political organization in which most or all the governing power resides in a centralized  government.  56 A federal self-governance is characterized by a union of partially self-governing provinces, states, or other regions under  a central federal government (federalism).  57 A devolved self-governance is a statutory delegation of powers from the central government of a sovereign state to govern  at a subnational level, such as a regional or local level. It is a form of administrative decentralization.  58 A federated state is a territorial and constitutional community forming part of a federation. Such states differ from fully  sovereign states, in that they do not have full sovereign powers, as the sovereign powers have been divided between the  federated states and the central or federal government.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  25  Figure 7: Member States' political system of governance  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  In the preliminary phase of the interviews, the Member States shared the key elements  influencing the national approach to the governance model of their NCSS, as well as the main  challenges faced during its deployment. The key challenges have been assessed and grouped  to provide an overview of the main challenges, experienced by several of the Member States.  Table 1 presents the key challenges while Table 2 provides an overview of the related lessons  learnt. It can be noticed that the most underlined difficulties are related to the definition of roles  and responsibilities, the lack of coordination and cooperation as well as the challenge in  reaching a common agreement between the different stakeholders.  Table 1: Key challenges when deploying the governance model  Key Challenges  1 Definition of roles and responsibilities  Given the number of stakeholders involved, a lack of understanding of the different roles in  the overall picture and duplication of efforts may happen.  2 Lack of coordination and cooperation  Given the complex structure of some National Cybersecurity systems, the existence of  several security authorities including regional competent authorities, coordination, and  cooperation between the different actors is a challenge.  3 Reach a common agreement on the strategy  Given the number of stakeholders involved, reaching an agreement on both, the main goals  of the strategy and its phrasing, seems to be difficult.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  26  Key Challenges  4 Information sharing  Given the number of different stakeholders involved in the implementation of the strategy,  and therefore, included in the governance model, there were some difficulties in sharing  information among the different actors.  Considering the constantly changing field of cybersecurity, the flow of information is  sometimes too slow, especially in terms of regulation and organisation.  5 Definition of the overall strategy’s budget  Considering the decentralized governmental approach of some countries, significant delays  may occur in receiving the budget or in obtaining a dedicated budget.  6 Achieve a higher level of national cyber security and resilience  Given the increasing cyber risks and the global geopolitical situation, some Member States  are struggling to cope with the new cyber challenges.  7 Timeline of the development and implementation of the NCSS  In fact, it would be more beneficial to develop and approve the implementation plan and to  define the governance model, at the same time as the NCSS.  8 Lack of enthusiasm  Given that for some stakeholders the cybersecurity strategy is an extra workload while they  are already engaged in numerous other activities, a lack of enthusiasm and motivation could  be noticed, which indirectly hinders the good performance and implementation of the  strategy.

Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  5.1 POLITICAL GOVERNANCE  The political governance level has been proven to build a highly important part of the  governance model. All Member States’ representatives indicated that political governance is  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  28  currently part of their governance model. It aims to clearly define political processes, identify  and assign roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders, and put in place legal measures  to support the deployment of the strategy.  Overall, three clusters of elements of political governance have been identified during the desk  research. These have been further detailed and validated through stakeholder consultation.  Figure 8 shows the percentage of stakeholders, interviewed in the process of this study,  validating the element of political governance.  Figure 8: Percentage of interviewed stakeholders confirming elements of political governance  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  5.1.1 Political processes  Focus on cooperative and collaborative approaches at international, inter-sectoral and regional  levels  An important element of the political governance is the inclusion of cooperative and  collaborative approaches at international, inter-sectoral and regional levels. All the stakeholders  interviewed confirmed that this element is already part the currently deployed governance  model in their country.  The EU Member States follow different approaches to defining cooperative and collaborative  aspects of political processes. Some Member States define those in the NCSS itself, while  others detail them in the accompanying governance model or the legal framework.  At the national level, strategies focus more on the collaboration between governmental entities  and across sectors.  GOOD  PRACTICE  An international  commitment and  collaboration with  international  organisations and  other countries is  mentioned as a key  objective of the  strategy.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  29  At the international level, most Member States cooperate to varying degrees with European  institutions such as ENISA, Europol, etc. However, some Member States are interested in  further developing this collaboration to also promote human rights, fundamental freedoms and  democratic values in the cyber domain to ensure that it remains a global, open, stable and  secure space, in which international law and shared principles are respected.  Main Observations  Providing political support: political authorities must take the cyber security topic  seriously, get involved and support the development and implementation of its NCSS and  governance models together with the other stakeholders. Governments should balance  between facilitating and stimulating ownership and creating responsibilities for other  stakeholders.  Ensure adequate coordination and cooperation among relevant players: a specific  action plan for each of the relevant agencies should be developed, to define activities to  be conducted about the strategic goals of the strategy.  Build trust between the different stakeholders: the most inclusive approach possible  should be followed to collect inputs from the different parties involved. The level of  participation in the decision-making process may vary according to the political setup of  the country.  Follow participatory approaches by putting in place platforms of exchange where  public sector entities, such as the government, its bodies and agencies are collaborating  with NGOs, and stakeholders from the private sector but also from the scientific community  and academia. This will facilitate cooperation across different actors from different domains  to collect relevant insights.  Focus on participatory approaches, including various stakeholder groups  It is important to include other stakeholders such as academia, consultancies and other expert  bodies, PPPs and representatives of critical infrastructures in the deploying of the NCSS.  Participatory approaches have been identified as an important element of political governance  and have been validated as such by most of the stakeholders interviewed. 89% of the  interviewed Member States confirmed that this element is part of the currently employed  governance model.  Main Observations  Involve all the stakeholders in the process of developing an NCSS and a governance  model: Every institution, private company, and individual can positively contribute to the  development of cyber security. Thus, at least the following stakeholders should be involved  in the process:  • Government bodies and agencies;  • Private actors such as SMEs or private industry such as internet providers or  telecom operations;  • Critical infrastructure operators;  • Law enforcement agencies;  • Scientific community; and  • Academia.  Hence, it is crucial to have an open dialogue through bilateral and multilateral discussions  with all the relevant actors.  GOOD  PRACTICE  In order to avoid  duplications of efforts  and overlapping  mandates of the  different agencies, a  flexible decision - making process that  allows for  amendments should  be put in place to  provide for an agile  process open to  developments in the  ecosystem.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  30  Define a clear allocation of roles and responsibilities in the governance model: The  definition of roles and responsibilities starts with the political decision on the level of  representation for the different stakeholders, continues with the definition of allocation of  roles and responsibilities and is finalised by the creation of a monitoring plan for each  initiative to track the implementation of the actions. A clear allocation is fundamental to  avoid the creation of overlaps of mandates among agencies and the creation of a  mechanism that holds the different stakeholders accountable.  Set up of a collaboration platform: following the creation of a concrete action plan to  implement the objectives of the strategy, the set up a collaborative platform is a powerful  tool to monitor the level of implementation of the NCSS and to engage the different  stakeholders regularly. Additionally, the platform can bring together the public and private  sectors and foster the exchange of information.  Collaboration with PPPs  PPPs play an important role in the enforcement and accountability of political governance, they  help support the inclusive approach in setting up the strategy and its governance model. This  has been validated by most of the stakeholders interviewed: 13 of the 19 Member States’  representatives interviewed confirmed that PPPs are currently employed in their actual  governance model. For the 5 other Member States, PPPs are not explicitly mentioned in the  strategy or governance model, but this it is highly encouraged by the country’s authorities.  Depending on the sector, the Member States adopt a hybrid approach. In some instances, the  collaboration is outsourced to independent PPPs, while in others, it takes place between  government entities and PPPs.  The collaboration with the PPPs takes place between the government (different ministries) and  the national bodies responsible for cybersecurity. Depending on the domain being discussed  and the stakeholders involved, meetings are organised on a recurrent basis and can vary from a  weekly to a monthly basis. The nature of the collaborative approach may change according to  the topic being addressed.  Main Observations  Support from the highest political level in the creation of PPPs: Interviews with  Member State representatives highlighted the importance of public sector support and  willingness to collaborate with the private sector due to the higher reactivity of the private  one to the ever-changing cyber ecosystem.  5.1.2 Roles and responsibilities  Creation of specialised government authorities, bodies and agencies to ensure governance of  cybersecurity  The establishment of specialised government bodies to ensure the governance of cybersecurity  has been identified as an important element of political governance. This has been validated by  all the interviewed stakeholders, all of them have in place specialised government authorities,  bodies, and agencies to ensure governance of cybersecurity.  The aim of the creation of a specialized body or agency in the cyber domain is to supervise,  coordinate and monitor the deployment of the NCSS, and to ensure the coordination of the  alignment of all the relevant stakeholders.  GOOD  PRACTICE  In the reporting phase  for the implementation  of the different  initiatives of the NCSS,  it is important to set up  a framework that  supports collaboration  among stakeholders  rather than  competition. A good  practice is to impose a  simultaneal  submission of the  regular reports from  the different  stakeholders.  GOOD  PRACTICE  Deploy a web platform  leveraged to collect,  assess and evaluate  the inputs entered by  the private and public  stakeholders and  provide updates on the  state of play of the  strategy.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  31  Depending on the country, the central body or agency responsible for cybersecurity can have  different type of mandates and varying roles on the implementation of the NCSS. If in some  countries as Estonia the cybersecurity centre is the main body overseeing the activities related  to cybersecurity and sharing information with state authorities and private companies, in some  other instances such as Denmark, the centre plays more a supportive rather than a governing  role.  For those Member States that do not have a dedicated cybersecurity centre in place, an  alternative committee is generally set up with the role of political coordination among parties.  Main Observations  Mandate a single body to ensure the coordination and the implementation of the  overall strategy: this will allow to allocate specific roles, responsibilities, actions and follow  the progress of the implementation.  Creation of roles and allocation of responsibilities related to national and international  cooperation on cybersecurity  The definition of roles responsibilities related to international cooperation on cybersecurity has  been identified as quite an important element of the political governance. This has been  validated by almost all the interviewed stakeholders, in fact, 84% of them has defined in their  governance model clear roles, responsibilities and task in case of incident.  Main Observations  Define in a very precise way roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders:  In the strategy, there should a dedicated section defining the roles and responsibilities,  on the national as well as international level to avoid duplication of work and better monitor  the implementation of the strategy.  Define the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders in the same  document: it will allow to have an overview of the objectives, the tasks, and the  stakeholders in charge of implementing them. Thus, it will help to better monitor the  implementation of the strategy.  Creation of PPPs  Although not all the Member States interviewed (63%) currently have strong PPPs in place, it  can be noticed that this aspect is very important and is increasingly encouraged by the different  authorities.  Main Observations  Create PPPs: the creation of PPPs is a powerful tool supporting the development and  deployment of the governance model. It permeates the strategy to strengthen the cyber  resilience of the country and society. As cyberspace is composed of ICT products and  services mainly produced or provided by private entities, the strategy should take into  consideration close cooperation and continuous public-private consultation.  GOOD  PRACTICES  International cooperation  can be fostered through:  • Creation of a  coordination group  to liaise for the  participation in the  different  international  exchanges;  • Definition of  working groups to  interact with  international  organisations;  • Development of  specific procedures  for the allocation of  responsibilities and  roles related to  international  cooperation.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  32  5.1.3  Legal measures  Establishment of a legal governance/legal framework linked to specific legal measures  The establishment of a legal governance/legal framework linked to specific legal measures has  been identified as quite an important element of the political governance. 58% of the  interviewed Member States have already in place a legal framework linked to specific legal  measures.  In Europe, there is a common legal ground defined by legal acts as the NIS Directive, however,  it is entrusted to each country the definition of a proper legal framework that supports the  implementation of the strategy and the correct allocation of roles and responsibilities, as well as  resources. Based on the interviews conducted, the definition of a legal framework is a sign of  the maturity of the country, and it fosters the allocation of budget to the implantation of the  NCSS, as well as the clear definition of mandates for the involved bodies. All these elements  provide more stability and empower the governance model related to the NCSS.  Main Observations  The governance framework is supported by and defined by the legal framework: the  legal framework is composed of newly introduced legal measures as well as already  existing legal measures whose scope has been enlarged to achieve the NCSS’s  objectives as well.  International cooperation about legal measures  International cooperation about legal measures has been identified as quite an important  element of political governance, as confirmed by 68% of the interviewed Member States.  First of all, it can be noticed that as members of the European Union, the interviewees are  involved in different European and international initiatives on cybersecurity. The same applies to  NATO member countries. For cooperation with non-European countries, MoUs (Memorandum  of Understanding) are generally used.  Regional coalitions such as Greece, Cyprus and Israel can also be seen joining forces to  enhance cooperation in the cyber security field.  Overall, an important part of the Member States strategies relates to the aspect that the actions  should be mirroring general trends and activities on the EU-level in order to ensure the  alignment with the EU trends.  Emphasis on human rights in legal measures/legal framework:  The emphasis on human rights in the digital sphere is not often covered by national legislation,  except for very specific cases as GDPR. Similarly, this aspect is not often included in the  Member States NCSSs. Nonetheless, many initiatives are taking place at European level (e.g.,  signing of the Berlin Declaration) given its recognised importance.  Main Observations  Develop a section focused on the human rights in the NCSS and its governance  model with explicit actions, responsibilities and roles.  GOOD  PRACTICE  Put in place a set of  guidelines, certification  schemes and sectorial  policies addressed to public  entities and private  operators.  • the support for the  development of  European and  international  cybersecurity  certification schemes  and standards;  • the promotion of the  inclusion of  cybersecurity requisites  in ICT procurement  activities of Public  Administrations.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  33  5.2 STRATEGIC GOVERNANCE  Aiming at coordinating the processes of drafting the NCSS and setting up the accompanying  governance model, strategic governance has been proven to build a highly important part of the  governance model. All representatives indicated that strategic governance is currently part of  the governance model employed in their country.  Overall, three clusters of elements of strategic governance have been identified during the desk  research as pointed out in chapter 4. These have been further detailed on and validated through  stakeholder consultation. Figure 9 here below indicates the percentage of interviewed  stakeholders confirming the existence of the identified elements of strategic governance in their  country’s NCSS.  a) Elements concerning the NCSS itself  • Foreseeing institutional support to implement the NCSS at the time of drafting  the strategy;  b) Elements related to the planning of the implementation of the governance model and  the strategy  • Pre-defining a governance model to implement the NCSS, at the same time  as drafting the NCSS;  • Planning and allocation of budget and resources and integrating cybersecurity  into the overall allocation thereof;  c) Elements of the strategic aspects of risk identification and mitigation.  • Risk identification and mitigation supported by created agencies;  • Coherent approach for risk identification and mitigation across government  entities and other critical infrastructure operators;  • Mechanisms to ensure accountability, transparency, and human rights during  risk identification and mitigation.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  34  Figure 9: Percentage of interviewed stakeholders confirming elements of strategic governance  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  As mentioned in chapter 4, the elements of strategic governance can be divided into two main  groups, elements which should be taken into account from the beginning when developing the  NCSS and elements that focus on the strategic aspects of risk identification and mitigation.  5.2.1 Elements concerning the NCSS itself  Foreseeing institutional support to implement the NCSS  The support of governmental entities or other public sector actors in implementing the NCSS  has been identified as an important element of the strategic governance layer to ensure  accountability of the strategy as well as support of a wider audience, triggered by wide political  and institutional support across government entities. As presented in Figure 9 this has been  validated by all stakeholders interviewed: all Member States’ representatives interviewed  confirmed that this element is part of the currently employed governance model.  The support of different governmental actors from the outset of developing the strategy is highly  important to reach consensus and to define a coherent governance model accepted throughout  all levels, ministries and sectors of government. While the governance model could be broken  down, as the strategy, vertically and horizontally and be focussed on by different governmental  actors, the overall NCSS should be agreed upon across the whole government and all involved  institutions.  5.2.2 Elements related to the planning of the governance model and  strategy’s implementation  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  35  Pre-defining a governance model to implement the NCSS  This element of strategic governance aims to put the processes of drafting the NCSS and  defining the governance model for the strategy’s implementation in parallel. It has been proven  most beneficial to adjust the timelines of both, the drafting of the strategy, and the planning of  the governance model or accompanying action plan to be run at the same time. By doing so, no  time is lost due to time lags between the drafting of the strategy and developing corresponding  actions for its implementation.  All stakeholders interviewed mentioned that this element is entailed in the current governance  model deployed. Additionally, it has been mentioned that while aligning the timelines was not  always ensured, it will be ensured for future strategies as well, as it has proven to be more  efficient for the implementation of the NCSS and to reach its objectives.  Planning of allocation of budget and resources and integration of cybersecurity into the overall  allocation thereof  The allocation of budget and resources to implement the NCSS is highly important, similarly is  the planning of the allocation from an early stage of the development of the NCSS and its  governance model. Thorough planning of the foreseen budget and resources is important to  integrate the implementation of the NCSS specifically and cybersecurity in general into the  overall national budget planning. Additionally, it is important to define general national priorities  and to place the priorities of the NCSS within these to ensure alignment across all national  priorities, budget and resource allocation and to properly integrate the NCSS and the  governance model into the overall policy framework.  A majority (79%) of the interviewed stakeholders stated that the allocation of resources and  budget is taken into account in the context of the NCSS and the accompanying governance  model. However, it has been pointed out that while this planning is taken into account, it is  rarely outlined in detail and most often performed separately from the definition of the NCSS  and the development of the governance model. To some extent, this is driven by the political  model employed by the states, i.e., the budget is mainly dealt with on the state level in  federalism, and not on a national level; alternatively, budget allocation is done per ministry and  hence, in a decentralised approach, if several ministries are accountable for different parts of  the implementation of the NCSS. It has been stated that specifying a dedicated budget for the  NCSS is recommended rather than allocating money to an overarching authority.  Main Observations  Developing the budget from bottom to top: Assign coordinators to each action, create  an implementation plan per action and estimate the number of resources and budget  needed to reach the defined objective. Afterwards, all budget estimates are aggregated  and an overall estimate for the implementation of the NCSS is drafted, which is then  included in the budget of the authority in charge as well as in the national budget.  Paragraph on financials in NCSS: The strategy itself includes a paragraph that  identifying the country’s investments in cybersecurity and defines an overall budget for  the implementation of the NCSS and its objectives. The budget is divided per  stakeholder/ministry in charge, rather than per objective.  5.2.3 Elements of the strategic aspects of risk identification and  mitigation  GOOD  PRACTICE  Including detailed  explanations of the  foreseen  implementation of the  NCSS and  references to the  strategy itself in the  action plan/ set-up of  the governance  model, while  referencing the action  plan/governance  model in the NCSS.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  36  Risk identification and mitigation supported by created agencies  Setting up a strategy for risk identification and mitigation is highly important in order to be  prepared for cyber threats and attacks, to identify and mitigate them. Desk research has shown  that a common practice is to create specialised agencies to support the implementation and  operationalisation of this element of governance. A small majority (58%) of the interviewed  stakeholders mentioned that this element is part of the currently deployed governance model of  their country.  The creation of specific agencies providing services of risk identification and mitigation has  been pointed out, as centralizing these aspects facilitates exchanges. It has been indicated that  there seems to be a general lack of risk management if no dedicated agency is in place, but  every critical infrastructure operator is responsible for risk identification and mitigation in their  domain and this might create gaps or overlapping measures. Nevertheless, not creating  dedicated authorities does not necessarily imply a lower level of efficiency in risk identification  and mitigation, e.g., the national cybersecurity responsible agency could also be appointed the  responsibility and lead the national activities.  Main Observations  Thorough risk identification across different levels: Agencies for identifying and  mitigating risks are created at national level, these deal with the central government and  critical entities. In addition, specific entities are created across the main sectors to cover  risk identification and mitigation from a more domain specific angle, e.g., health,  economic affairs, or climate. Lastly, leveraging on existing security and intelligence  agencies, whose responsibilities have been extended to also cover cybersecurity  aspects, could be a third option to build bodies responsible for risk identification. These  three options could be used complementary or as stand-alone.  Early on identification of risks and implementation of risk assessment: Discussions  to identify risks should take place during the process of drafting the NCSS already. The  process includes stakeholders from the competent authorities, agencies and private  sector as well as additional experts. The discussions should support on identifying  potential risks, assessing the risks and developing measures to address these. The  developed measures can be included in the NCSS or an accompanying action plan,  highlighting responsible actors, identifying actions, and objectives.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  37  Coherent approach for risk identification and mitigation across government entities and other  critical infrastructure operators  Applying a coherent approach for risk identification and mitigation across the involved  government entities and other involved critical infrastructure operators has been identified as  important element of the strategic governance level. It facilitates exchange and information  sharing in case needed and foster cooperation between the involved entities. The majority  (74%) of country representatives interviewed, confirmed this and pointed out that although a  coherent approach is difficult to implement, it is most often a clear goal of the NCSS.  While creating dedicated agencies for risk identification and mitigation facilitates the process, it  includes the risk of separating processes and actors and each body leveraging its own  approach.  Hence, this might hamper collaboration, cooperation and communication, which are  essentials for risk mitigation. Therefore, adopting a common and coherent approach is crucial.  Main Observations  Following a common methodology for risk identification: A document defining a  common methodology for identifying risks should be developed early during the process  of drafting the NCSS or when developing the governance model. Not differentiating  between public and private actors, the document provides a solid methodological baseline  for taking up a common approach for risk identification and mitigation across all involved  actors.  Following a common framework in case of incidents: Some countries set-up a  dedicated framework, which should be followed in case of incidents. The framework  includes step-by-step processes for different actors in case of specific incidents or risks  identified. The framework includes measures to be taken and also outlines dedicated  comprehensive requirements which need to be undertaken in case of risk identification.  This facilitates the uptake of a common approach across different actors.  GOOD  PRACTICE  Daily  communication:  CERT bodies which  are the main bodies  responsible for the  risk identification and  mitigation  communication on  daily basis. In  addition, working  groups exchange  opinions on an ad- hoc basis on specific  issues, through  defined  communication  channels.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  38  Mechanisms to ensure accountability, transparency, and human rights during risk identification  and mitigation  During risk identification and mitigation, accountability is a particularly important element to  ensure that the objectives of a strategy will be achieved. Responsibilities are allocated and  people need to be accountable for the actions to be taken in order to reach the objectives set  out by the strategy. Setting-up mechanisms to ensure accountability of all actors involved is  hence an important element of strategic governance to already ensure accountability from the  set-out. Similarly, transparency is an important aspect during risk identification and mitigation,  which needs to be ensured throughout all processes as to increase respect and acceptance by  all players but also by the society as a whole. Developing mechanisms to ensure transparency  has also been proven to be an important element of strategic governance. Last but not least,  ensuring human rights in the digital sphere is particularly important in the context of  cybersecurity and mechanisms need to be planned, developed and deployed to ensure human  rights in general, and personal data protection in particular, while improving cybersecurity.  Discussing, developing and deploying these mechanisms for the NCSSs from an early point has  been proven as important and the interviewed stakeholders confirmed this finding, as more than  two-thirds (67%) of the interviewees stated that these mechanisms are at least partially in place  in their country’s governance model.  Main Observations  Definition of accountability and transparency rules: Rules and mechanisms to ensure  accountability are clearly laid down in official documents, i.e., in the NCSS itself, its  implementation/ action plan, and accompanying legal documents. Clearly defining the  rules and mechanisms of accountability and transparency in the documents helps to  ensure these aspects throughout the implementation.  Legislation ensuring human rights: Legislation on human rights is available in all  Member States, nevertheless, additions and updates of existing and additional legal  measures have been put in place to ensure human rights in the context of cybersecurity,  in some Member States.  GOOD  PRACTICE  Every institution in  charge of  implementing actions,  policies, and projects  under the NCSS is  responsible to ensure  accountability and  transparency. The  government of  Lithuania then  assesses from a  strategic level how  the agencies and  institutions perform  the actions according  to pre-defined  measures on  accountability and  transparency.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  39  5.3 OPERATIONAL GOVERNANCE  Operational governance aims at operationalising the policies set out in the strategy to translate  these into actions and improve cybersecurity across all layers of society. Specific elements of  operational governance refer to:  a) Elements about awareness-raising campaigns, outreach campaigns and training to  foster capacity-building;  • Awareness raising, knowledge and capacity building (e.g., training, education,  community building, etc.) within the complete workforce/population;  • Awareness raising, knowledge and capacity building (e.g., training, education,  community building, etc.) within the cybersecurity-relevant workforce;  b) Elements about incident response;  • Incident response mechanisms and support of CSIRTs and CERTs;  c) Elements about information-sharing processes and channels;  • Informal and formal processes of information sharing during incident  response;  All these elements have been validated by the stakeholders interviewed. 95% of the interviewed  stakeholders confirmed that operational governance builds a part of their country’s governance  model. Similarly, all identified elements have been validated by a majority of the interviewed  stakeholders, as deployed in Figure 10.  Figure 10: Percentage of interviewed stakeholders confirming elements of operational  governance  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  40  5.3.1 Elements about awareness raising campaigns, outreach campaigns  and trainings to foster capacity-building  Awareness-raising, knowledge and capacity building (e.g., training, education, community  building, etc.) within the complete workforce/population  Raising awareness for cybersecurity across the whole workforce and/or the complete population  is the main aim of many of the NCSSs of the Member States. It has been confirmed that a huge  risk emerges from a population being unaware of cyber risks and being untrained on how to  cope with these or how to safely behave in the cyberspace. Hence, training and education as  well as awareness campaigns seem essential to increase the general level of knowledge and  the general population’s capacity about cybersecurity.  As depicted in Figure 10, 89% of the consulted countries pointed out that awareness-raising  campaigns as well as educational campaigns targeting the overall population are already in  place to increase the capacity of the general population and to increase their awareness of  cyber risks. Nevertheless, while the importance of increasing awareness has been pointed out,  it has also been stated that awareness raising comes with challenges and is a difficult topic to  cover thoroughly.  Main Observations  Tailored awareness raising and training campaigns: Tailoring awareness raising and  training campaigns to different stakeholder groups is important in order to account for the  different needs and capabilities of the groups. Possible groups reflect businesses and  other private sector entities, IT staff, cybersecurity specific staff, academia, and civilians.  Awareness raising, knowledge and capacity building (e.g., training, education, community  building, etc.) within the cybersecurity relevant workforce.  It has been proven beneficial, to particularly raise awareness and knowledge on cyber, cyber  threats and risks and cybersecurity among the people of the workforce which is most involved  with and closely related to cybersecurity. Generally, the cybersecurity relevant workforce, most  often has awareness of and skills in cybersecurity. However, cybersecurity being part of the  quickly developing cyberspace necessitates constant training and education to keep up with  changes, developments and new challenges. Additionally, it has been pointed out that there is a  scarcity of skilled workforce in the cybersecurity domain, which implies that the workforce needs  to be enlarged through policies aiming on training and education in the field of cybersecurity.  Similar to raising awareness and improving skills of the whole population, 89% of the consulted  countries mentioned that this element constitutes an important part of their governance model.  Awareness raising and training campaigns are covered to different extents by the countries’  governance models. Some countries simply point out the importance and the objective to  increase these aspects, while other countries are already more advanced, developing this  element and provide concrete mechanisms, measures and actions in their governance model.  GOOD  PRACTICE  MITA (Malta  Information  Technology Agency)  was mandated with  the role of a national  coordination centre  for training and  awareness-raising.  Currently, MITA is  collaborating with the  University of Malta  and other  stakeholders for the  creation of masters  specialised in  cybersecurity for  example.  GOOD  PRACTICE  In 2018, Malta  launched the  nationwide  cybersecurity  awareness and  education campaign.  It targets different  actors, from the  private and public  sectors,  professionals, teens,  the elderly, children,  educators,  vulnerable groups,  public, etc.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  41  5.3.2 Elements of the incident response  Incident response mechanisms and support of CSIRTs and CERTs  Formalised processes for incident response are a main element defined in the operational  governance level. Established CSIRT and CERT bodies provide support in case of  cybersecurity incidents and provide a centralised contact point at national level to coordinate  and enable quick and systematic reactions to incidents. As specialised teams dedicated to  developing and deploy mechanisms for cybersecurity in general and incident response in  particular, CSIRT and CERT bodies build an incremental part of the operational governance in  specific and the implementation and achievement of the NCSSs’ objectives in general. While  CSIRTs and CERTs provide support during incident response times, they can also play a  proactive role preventing incidents from happening and supporting governments in building  resilience against cyber threats.  89% of the interviewed countries confirmed the importance of CSIRT and CERT bodies for  incident response (Figure 10). Further, they mentioned that incident response mechanisms are  part of their country’s governance model with CSIRTs and CERTs playing an important role in  supporting and leading these mechanisms.  GOOD  PRACTICE  Platform to submit,  share and react to  incidents: There are  mechanisms for  sharing technical  information and for  pushing e.g., early  warnings, news, etc.  Recently, an online  platform has been  set-up, where it is  possible to receive  compliance and risk  information from  critical information  infrastructures.  Additionally,  incidents can be  submitted on the  platform. These are  synced with national  CSIRT processes. If  there is an incident  notification, an  immediate technical  response can be  triggered.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  42  5.3.3 Elements of the information sharing processes  Informal and formal processes of information sharing during incident response  Establishing processes of information sharing is highly important to ensure coordinated  reactions during incident response times. Formal pre-defined and transparent processes as well  as informal ones should be developed and deployed. While formal processes of information  sharing often provide for and enhance accountability, informal ones might be more effective and  efficient.  As shown in Figure 10, 89% of the consulted countries confirmed that informal and formal  processes of information sharing are important and constitute an element of the operational  governance level of their country’s governance model.  Main Observations  Centralise information sharing. Activities to centralise and intensify information-sharing  have been undertaken by several Member States.  Taxonomy of best practices to ensure coherent processes of information sharing.  Spain developed a taxonomy based on existing best practices and is deploying it across  organisations to ensure a coherent approach towards information-sharing.  5.4 TECHNICAL GOVERNANCE  The technical governance level has been proven to build a highly important part of the  governance model due to its role in the identification and implementation of standards at a  national or international level, and definition of technical mechanisms. All representatives  indicated that technical governance is currently part of the governance model employed in their  country. Specific elements of technical governance refer to:  • Technical governance for cybersecurity based on international standards and  technical guidelines; and  • Implemented/defined use of tools and technology.  GOOD  PRACTICES  In Malta, a project has  been started to create a  specific team for  information sharing called  the “cyber threat  intelligence team”. The  goal is to collect cyber  threat intelligence from  partners and share  information.  In the Netherlands, a  survey has been started  to examine the  possibilities and  modalities (legal,  financial, etc.) to develop  a public-private  cooperation platform to  strengthen situational  awareness and the timely  sharing of cyber threat  information and  advisories. The goal is to  offer more information  and a swifter perspective  for action with relevant  organisations. When  doing so, attention is also  paid to cybersecurity  requirements and the  level of maturity of the  recipients of relevant  information. This survey  is a follow-up of the  existing cyber intel/info  cell, a public cooperation  platform of operational  public organisations  (NCSC, Police,  Intelligence and Security  Services and Public  Prosecutor), where  information on cyber  threats and cyber  incidents is brought  together and is jointly  assessed by those  organisations.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  43  Figure 11: Percentage of interviewed stakeholders confirming elements of technical  governance  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  5.4.1 Technological standardisation  Technical governance for cybersecurity based on international standards and technical guidelines  The technical governance for cybersecurity based on international standards and technical  guidelines has been identified as an important element of the technical governance. 74% of the  interviewed Member States take this into account in their strategies (Figure 11).  While this aspect is not addressed in all NCSS or is not very detailed, according to interviews  with Member State representatives, this aspect is considered important.  The use of technical standards is mentioned in the strategy; however, it is not specified which  technical standards should be used.  Main Observations  Include in the NCSS and its governance model a section focused on the international  standards and technical guidelines: this will ensure to be aligned with the other Member  States. When developing this section, specify which technical standards should be used,  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  44  and define clear roles and responsibilities. To simplify the update of standards, the  standards could be described in a document accompanying the NCSS and the governance  model. A key enabler is the existence of a body that supervises the compliance of  regulated entities with the European and international requirements.  5.4.2 Use of technology, tools and certification schemes  Implemented/defined use of tools, technology and certification schemes  The importance of the use of cybersecurity certification schemes as a tool to manage risk is  highlighted by European agencies and will be enforced under the NIS2 directive. European  cybersecurity certification schemes should apply to the majority of ICT products and services,  and in particular, to all the services or activities provided by essential entities. The competent  authorities should be empowered to apply sanctions consisting of the suspension of a  certification or authorisation concerning part or all the services provided by an essential entity.  Member States should establish a strategy to produce certificates for ICT solutions, either  based on existing national schemes or next to come EU schemes, ensuring an ecosystem that  can deliver certified solutions or participate to the certification of solutions through public or  private conformity assessment bodies. Finally, their procurement policy or any implementation  of national and/or EU laws should be based through the use of certified solutions.  The use of tools and technologies was highlighted as an important element in implementing  NCSSs, although this point is not developed in the strategies of some countries. Nine out of the  18 interviewed Member States take this into account in their strategies, and 53% of all  interviewed stakeholders validated this element of technical governance, as shown in Figure 11.  The representatives of the Member States interviewed stressed the importance of not only  focusing on available standards but also taking into account improvements in technical security,  based on the use of modern approaches to cybersecurity for the detection and handling of  incidents. Threats and incidents are ever-evolving and hence, the instruments of cybersecurity  to combat them need to quickly adapt.  Main Observations  Put in place in the NCSS action plan a group of tasks focused on using tools and  technologies in respect to human rights, particularly to GDPR.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  45  6. MONITORING A  GOVERNANCE MODEL  Monitoring the governance model is an important factor to ensure the successful deployment of  the governance model as well as for the successful implementation of the NCSS. Aiming to  assess the effective implementation, monitoring mechanisms are hence highly important for the  deployment of a governance model. Additionally, the use of an assessment framework can  strengthen the accountability of the responsible stakeholders, foster progress in the deployment  phase and provide insights for areas of improvements.  Monitoring mechanisms can take different forms and levels of detail and granularity. For  instance, a traffic light system could be employed to indicate whether the progress of  implementation is on track (green), behind schedule (yellow) or at risk (red). Traffic light  systems provide broader and more qualitative information on the progress. A more granular  approach of establishing monitoring mechanisms includes the development of Key Performance  Indicators (KPIs). KPIs are measurable values, in the context of governance models, they  provide quantifiable information on the progress of the implementation of actions, policies, and  rules. KPIs could be of both quantitative as well as qualitative nature.  Another monitoring instrument used to evaluate the progress of the implementation of the  governance model is reporting. This implies that accountable and responsible persons report on  the progress of their specific actions to a higher-level authority. Reporting provides a more  general overview of the progress and information are normally not quantifiable.  It has to be mentioned that other forms of monitoring could be deployed that are completer and  more fit for purpose. However, the interviews highlighted that the Member States prefer light  assessment methodologies. The remainder of this section will provide an overview of the  deployment of monitoring mechanisms for evaluating the progress of the implementation of the  governance models accompanying the NCSSs across the EU Member States.  6.1 MONITORING MECHANISMS OF GOVERNANCE MODELS DEPLOYED  ACROSS THE MEMBER STATES  Figure 12 here below provides an overview of the adoption of monitoring mechanisms for the  governance model across the interviewed countries. 17 out of the 18 consulted countries have  some sort of monitoring mechanism in place, the majority (56%) already developed quantitative,  and/or qualitative Key Performance Indicators. 17 % of the interviewed countries indicated that  a traffic light system or another monitoring mechanism is in place to monitor and evaluate the  progress of implementing the governance model and the NCSS. 5% of the interviewed  countries mentioned that the evaluation of the progress of the implementation is based on  reporting, provided by the accountable or responsible persons, per action or objective.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  46  Figure 12: Deployment of monitoring mechanisms across the interviewed EU Member States  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  Figure 13 provides a more granular view of the implementation of monitoring mechanisms per  governance level. It emerges from the stakeholder consultation that the majority of countries  has monitoring mechanisms in place for the strategic and operational governance levels. 58%  of the interviewed countries have a partially or completely deployed monitoring mechanism to  evaluate the progress of implementing the NCSS from a strategic governance point of view.  53% employed monitoring mechanisms on the operational governance level, while progress on  deploying the technical level of governance is systematically monitored in 47% of the countries.  The same percentage of countries deployed monitoring mechanisms for the political  governance level.  Figure 13: Monitoring mechanisms in place per level of governance  Source: Authors’ own elaboration.  Generally, most countries monitor the progress by focusing on objectives or actions without  creating a comprehensive assessment framework that could provide an overall index of  progress.  56%  17%  5%  17%  5% KPIs  Traffic light system  Reporting  Other  not in place  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  Strategic governance  Political governance Operational governance  Technical governance  In place Partially in place Not in place No answer  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  47  Good practices in the context of establishing monitoring mechanisms have been identified from  the interviews with the Member States’ representatives. These are detailed here below.  Good Practice – Extended set of KPIs to also monitor the state of cybersecurity across the population  In Spain not only a set of KPIs has been established to monitor the progress of the implementation of the  governance model, but a specific national observatory for cyber has been put in place. The observatory’s main  function is to monitor the KPIs and to publish reports on the KPIs deployed to measure the progress of the  implementation.  In addition, the KPIs developed by Spain do not only cover the implementation of the governance model and  the NCSS, but also aim at the wider objective of ensuring service and cybersecurity in the country. Therefore,  additional KPIs have been introduced, which focus on the behaviour of citizens during incidents.  Many of the KPIs are publicly available to also provide the population with the possibility to inform themselves  about the current status of the country, the goals and the progress. Furthermore, more sensitive KPIs, focusing  on more policy-specific aspects have been established. These however are not publicly available to ensure  security.  In Italy, it is foreseen develop specific measures and KPIs within the first twelve months after the adoption of  the NCSS. The KPIs deployed will not only aim on measuring the progress of the implementation of the  governance model and the NCSS, but some KPIs will aim at a more granular and more encompassing system  to also measure:  • Cybersecurity maturity;  • Involvement of specific categories of persons (women, young, unemployed and jobseekers) in the  cybersecurity training;  • Involvement of specific categories of persons (women, young, unemployed and jobseekers) in the  cybersecurity industry;  • Cybersecurity investments;  o Investments in and initiatives on cybersecurity research and development;  • Number of national companies insured by cybersecurity incidents.  Good Practice – Platform to enable the exchange of progress  In Austria, the new NCSS is not only set up to follow a whole-of-nation/whole-of-society approach but also to  allow to react to changing challenges and opportunities in the cyberspace. Accompanying the NCSS, a web  platform has been developed to collect and monitor objectives, and actions and to measure progress  dynamically. By using the PPPP-Model also non-governmental stakeholders are allowed to add to the platform  facilitating information sharing and exchange.  It provides insights into the progress of the implementation of the NCSS and its governance model. KPIs are  developed to monitor the progress of reaching the strategic objectives and to implement the related measures.  For every action, policy or measure of the governance model and the NCSS, a scorecard is created, each  scorecard provides insights into the progress of the specific objective, action or measure. The monitoring on the  scorecards is based on key project management principles in order to ensure granular and detailed monitoring  of the progress.  Twice a year a report based on the data on the platform is created and published on the website of the Austrian  Federal Chancellery thus giving the public insights into the state of play of Austrian Cybersecurity.  6.2 POTENTIAL RE-USE OF EXISTING KPIS  KPIs related to cybersecurity have been developed by different organisations already. The  uptake of these indicators is encouraged, while some adjustment could be beneficial. Here  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  48  below a short explanation of three sets of KPIs related to cybersecurity is provided. The longlists  of the KPIs deployed by the three sets are provided in the Annex of this report.  6.2.1 NCAF KPIs  The national capabilities self-assessment framework (NCAF), developed by ENISA, aims at  measuring the level of maturity of the different NCSSs. The framework specifically should  empower the Member States in  • Conducting the evaluation of their national cybersecurity capabilities.  • Enhancing awareness of the country’s maturity level;  • Identifying areas for improvement; and  • Building cybersecurity capabilities.  The framework provides an assessment of the NCSSs on 17 objectives, grouped into four main  clusters across five levels of maturity. The four main clusters of objectives are the following:  1. Cybersecurity governance and standards;  2. Capacity-building and awareness;  3. Legal and regulatory; and  4. Cooperation.  Among the different elements assessed to identify the level of maturity, there are some that  refer to the governance model of an NCSS and can be extracted and reused to evaluate the  governance model of a country. The specific indicators are listed in Annex B.1 of this report.  6.2.2 EU Cybersecurity Index  ENISA is working since 2021 on the development of an EU Cybersecurity Index, a tool to help  Member States making informed decisions by providing insights on the cybersecurity maturity  and posture of the Union and MS policies, capabilities and operations. With a view to the tasks  included in the latest NIS 2 Directive Proposal text59, the EU Cybersecurity Index project of  ENISA is expected to evolve in the direction of a biennial report on the state of cybersecurity in  the Union. For this aim, a set of indicators is being defined which will provide a better  understanding on which areas the EU will need to focus on to improve the overall Union  cybersecurity.  The development of the EU Cybersecurity Index is still work in progress and under consultation  and piloting with the Member States’ National Authorities. Currently, the focus and indicators of  the index will provide a better understanding on which areas the EU will need to focus on to  improve the overall Union cybersecurity. As soon as the NIS2 Directive has been finalised, work  will commence to evolve from the EU Cybersecurity Index project of ENISA to the new  requirements defined in the NIS 2 Directive and in particular Art. 15.  The main objectives of EU’s Cybersecurity Index include:  • assessing the current level of maturity of cybersecurity and relevant cyber capabilities;  • identifying opportunities for collaborative and local cybersecurity enhancements; and  • identifying areas of network and information system security weaknesses which may  provide a risk to the Union and its MS as well as its citizens, governmental structures,  CI/CII and digital services, and small, medium, and large enterprises.  59 Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on measures for a high  common level of cybersecurity across the Union, repealing Directive (EU) 2016/1148  https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0823&from=EN__;!!NEMsmePo_HYI!dxiTggex2rwwyYUT5khfjGIJyBUo3f1TPzlY8Cwd2iUasbSnlYbHH8bQMK_nilBMm5GcJAr8EFLnz_52ZSuYEoEDjrGzo37JUgo$ https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0823&from=EN__;!!NEMsmePo_HYI!dxiTggex2rwwyYUT5khfjGIJyBUo3f1TPzlY8Cwd2iUasbSnlYbHH8bQMK_nilBMm5GcJAr8EFLnz_52ZSuYEoEDjrGzo37JUgo$  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  49  For the time being the EU Cybersecurity Index consists of 5860 composite indicators in four  areas:  • Policy;  • Operations;  • Capacity; and  • Market/industry  The indicators are not yet publicly available but will be in due time.  6.2.3 ITU Global Cybersecurity Index indicators  The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the UN agency dedicated to ICTs and  launched the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) to measure the commitment to cybersecurity of  the countries around the globe. Aiming to assist the countries to identify possible areas of  improvement related to cybersecurity, the GCI’s main objective is to measure:  • The type, level, and evolution over time of cybersecurity commitment within countries  and relative to other countries;  • The progress in cybersecurity commitment of countries from a global perspective;  • The progress in cybersecurity commitment from a regional perspective; and  • The cybersecurity commitment divide (i.e., the difference between countries in terms of  their level of engagement in cybersecurity initiatives).  The 2020 GCI consists of 82 questions feeding into 20 indicators, which are mapped across five  main pillars. The main pillars of the GCI are:  1. Legal measures;  2. Technical measures;  3. Organizational measures;  4. Capacity development measures; and  5. Cooperation measures.  All indicators are listed in Annex B.2 of this report. Under pillar 3, the organizational measures,  the main indicator refers to the development, implementation and deployment of a national  cybersecurity strategy. The specific questions feeding into this indicator are also listed in Annex  B.2 of this report.  6.2.4 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM)  Developed by the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre61, the goal of the Cybersecurity  Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) is to increase the scale and effectiveness of  cybersecurity capacity-building. A first version of the model was deployed in 2014 and a revised  version has been made available in 2016 and a new one in 2021.  The CMM assesses cybersecurity capacity across five key dimensions, which – according to the  model – represent the clusters of cybersecurity. The five dimensions are:  1. Developing cybersecurity policy and strategy;  2. Encouraging responsible cybersecurity culture within society;  3. Building cybersecurity knowledge and capabilities;  4. Creating effective legal and regulatory frameworks; and  60 Subject to review. The number of indicators might change based on consultations with cybersecurity experts coming from  national authorities, EU Agencies, and the industry.  61 The Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre is part of the Oxford Martin School within the University of Oxford.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  50  5. Controlling risks through standards and technologies.  The CMM is based on five maturity levels to evaluate a nation’s level of capacity and to  measure progress in relation to specific factors and/or aspects of cybersecurity capacity: Start- up; Formative; Established; Strategic; and Dynamic.62  The detail of each factor of the different dimensions are listed in Annex B.3 of this report.  62 ENISA, National Capabilities Assessment Framework, 2020 ; Available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national-capabilities-assessment-framework.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national-capabilities-assessment-framework  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  51  7. CONCLUSION  Aimed at developing a good practice example of effective governance models for NCSSs,  different governance frameworks across the EU and beyond have been analysed. Based on  desk research of more than 49 sources, and 19 interviews with representatives of the EU  Member States, the analysis of the Governance Framework for NCSS from March to July 2022  resulted in some conclusions that can be regarded as takeaways for the Member States.  Identified through desk research, four main levels of governance frameworks have been  identified as predominant. Specifically, these levels are:  1. Political governance;  2. Strategic governance;  3. Operational governance; and  4. Technical governance.  This study’s research indicated that no evident correlation between the type of government,  self-governance, and the governance model of the NCSS deployed exists. Rather, several  additional factors such as the size of a country, its level of maturity in the cyber domain, and the  level of cooperation with the private sector, influence the definition of a governance model. This  finding led to the conclusion that it is not possible to have a unique governance model to be  used as a reference. Therefore, good practices rather than a single best practice governance  model have been identified for each layer. The four main levels of a governance framework  have been further defined and sub-areas have been detailed through intensified desk research  and interviews. These encompass all elements of good practice governance models.

In addition to the main elements governing the different levels of governance, the establishment  of monitoring mechanisms, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and other measures to  coherently monitor and evaluate progress, have been identified as important. KPIs and  monitoring measures facilitate the finetuning of the strategy’s actions and the successful  implementation of the NCSSs and the related governance model.  With regard to KPIs, this study provides a list of KPIs already developed by different  organisations, which could be adapted to the situation in different Member States.

Processes for strategy  development have been initiated.An  outline/draft national cybersecurity  strategy has been  articulated.Consultation processes  have been agreed for key stakeholder  groups, including private sector, civil  society and international partners.  A national cybersecurity strategy has  been published.An assessment of  country-specific national cybersecurity  risk has been conducted.The strategy  reflects the needs and roles of relevant  stakeholders across government  (national and sub-national), business  and civil society.An implementation  programme is in place which covers  the scope of the strategy.Mechanisms  are in place to enable strategy ‘owners’  to monitor achievement of outcomes,  address implementation issues and  maintain strategy alignment.  Strategy review and renewal  processes are in place.Emerging  cybersecurity risks are regularly  assessed and used to update the  strategy and implementation  plan.The impact of the strategy on  risk and harm reduction  isunderstood and is used to inform  funding and priority decisions.  The national cybersecurity strategy  and implementation plan are both  proactively reviewed to take account of  broader strategic developments within  the country (political, economic, social,  technical, legal and environmental).The  country is an acknowledged authority  within the international community and  is supportingthe development of  national and global cybersecurity  strategies.Cybersecurity considerations  are embedded within other relevant  national-level strategies and  implementation programmes.  Content  Various national policies and  strategies may exist that refer to  cybersecurity, but these are not  comprehensive and there is little  evidence that these reflect specific  national priorities and circumstances.  Content exists that reflects country- specific priorities and  circumstances.Links exist between  the strategy (or draft strategy) and  priorities such as national  security,digital strategy and economic  development, but these are generally  ad hoc and lack detail.The strategy  (or draft strategy) defines the key  outcomes against which success can  be evaluated.  The content of the national  cybersecurity strategy is based on a  comprehensive risk assessment that  includes explicit links to wider national  level economic and political policies  and strategies.The content includes  actions to raise public and  businessawareness, mitigate  cybercrime, establish incident response  capability, promote public-private  partnership and protect critical  infrastructure and the wider  economy.Consideration has been  given to how the national cybersecurity  strategy might incorporate or support  wider online policy objectives such as:  child protection; the promotion of  Human Rights; the promotion of  Equality, Diversity and Inclusion; and  managing disinformation.  The content takes account of the  impact on cybersecurity risk of  emerging technologies and their  use within critical infrastructure, the  wider economy and society.The  outcomes defined in the strategy  are specific and measurable.  Metrics have been defined which  enable stakeholders to evaluate  theeffectiveness of the strategy in  reducing harm.Consideration has  been given to how the beneficial  outcomes of the strategy can be  sustained beyond the strategy’s  lifetime, including how the  maintenance of new capabilities  will be financed.  The content takes account of the  impact of broader developments on  cybersecurity risk (political, economic,  social, technical, legal and  environmental).The content of the  national cybersecurity strategy  promotes and encourages bilateral and  multilateral co-operation between  countries to ensurea secure, resilient  and trusted cyberspace.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  88  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Implementation  and Review  No overarching national  cybersecurityimplementation  programme has been developed.  A co-ordinated cybersecurity  implementation programme is being  developed with relevant stakeholders  involved, including the private sector  and civil society.Actions within the  programme have been assigned to  specific ‘owners’ but the availability of  adequate resources has not yet been  confirmed.Mechanisms to review  processes are limited or ad hoc.  A detailed implementation plan has  been published including actions,  responsible entities and resource  budgets. The implementation plan  involves relevant stakeholders across  government and other sectors.A co- ordinating body has been assigned.  The body has sufficient authority to  ensure that action ‘owners’ are held to  account.The resources required to  deliver the actions of the programme  have been identified and are in place.  Budget shortfalls are identified and  escalated to the relevant  authority.Programme review processes  and metrics are in place that allow  progress to be measured and risks,  issues and dependencies to be  escalated to the relevant authority.  These processes are adequately  funded.  Outcome-oriented metrics are  being used to monitor the impact  that the programme is having on  risk reduction (and other relevant  strategy goals).There is evidence  of these metrics being used to  refine action plans.Metrics (both  progress and outcome-oriented  metrics) are drawn from a wide  variety of governmental, non- governmental and international  sources.There is independent  oversight and/or assurance of the  programme.  Mechanisms are in place to make  more far-reachingchanges to the  programme in the event of significant  changes in circumstance (political,  economic, social, technical, legal and  environmental).The programme  contributes to the global development  of outcome-oriented metrics and their  application.  International  Engagement  There is limited awareness of the  principal international debates relating  to cybersecurity policy (suchas  cybersecurity norms, mutual legal  assistance, Internet Governance, data  sovereignty, data protection).The  country may benefit from regional/  international operational collaboration  networks but does not actively  engage.  The country is aware of the  existence of international discussions  on cybersecurity policy and related  issues.The country may, on occasion,  participate in regional or international  discussions on matters related to  cybersecurity issues, but does not  generally play an active role.The  country may participate in relevant  operationalcollaboration and policy  bodies (such as FIRST, regional  CERT bodies, the IGF, or the UN  GGE), but takes mainly a passive  role.  An assessment has been made of how  the international debates on  cybersecurity policy and related issues  affect the country’s interests and  international standing. Specific  engagement objectives have been  defined accordingly. Multiple  stakeholders have been involved in this  process.The country is actively  participating in relevant international  bodies and forums, either directly or  through relevant representative  bodies.Their voices are being heard and  are having an impact.The country  actively contributes to regional/  international operational collaboration  and policy bodies.  The country is actively building  international communitiesof interest  around specific cybersecurity policy  goals and promoting their  adoption.The country makes a  major contribution to regional/  international operational bodies  and is actively involved in building  capacity in third-party countries.  The country is a leading actor in  building consensus, fostering inclusivity  and shaping the international debates  on key cybersecurity policy issues.The  country is focused on the future, seeing  emerging issues (around new  technology or new types of threat), and  is initiating new international debates  around the key issues.The country is  actively involved in creating new  regional/ international collaboration  mechanisms.

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  89  B.3.2 Factor - D 1.2: Incident Response and Crisis Management  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Identification  and  Categorisation  of Incidents  No process for identifying and  categorising national-level  incidents exists.  Some organisations and sectors have  internal mechanisms for identifying and  categorising incidents within their  purview.A process for identifying  national-level incidents is under  development.There is no central registry  in place but ad-hoc arrangements exist  for dealing with the most significant  events.  Most major organisations have internal  mechanisms for identifying and  categorising incidents.A central registry of  national- level cybersecurity incidents  exists and a process for timely escalation  of incidents, from the organisational to the  national level, is in place.Individual national  incidents are categorised according to  severity and resources are allocated  accordingly.  Insights arising from national level  incidents are routinely analysed in order  to establish lessons and inform broader  cybersecurity policy and strategy.  The criteria for categorising  incidents are sufficiently flexible to  cater for rapidly emerging  changes in the underlying  technological or threat  environment.The country is  contributing to international best  practice in incident identification  and categorisation.  Organisation  No organisation for national- level cyber incident response  exists.A few organisations may  have internal cybersecurity  response mechanisms in place  but co- ordination is minimal.  A national CERT might exist but lacks  sufficient resources and skills.Processes  for managing incidents are still in  development.Some organisations from  public and private sectors have internal  cybersecurity response mechanisms in  place but co- ordination with the national  CERT is ad hoc.The role of sub-national  bodies is unclear.Bilateral co-operation  with international partners is limited or ad  hoc.  A national body for incident response  has been established. It has the resources,  skills, documented processes and legal  authorities required to address the range of  cyber incidentscenarios that the country is  likely to face (including out-of-hours  capability, if appropriate).Relationships and  protocols are in place to enable incident  management co-ordinationbetween the  national body and other elements of the  public and private sectors.The role of sub- national bodies in incident response is  clear and mechanisms are in place  toenable co-ordination between the  national and sub-national levels.There is  regular sharing of threat and vulnerability  information, and operational good practices  between the national body and a wide  range of public and private sector  organisations, as well as international  partners.  The national body undertakes a wide  range of engagement activities such as  conveningcommunities of interest,  running cross-sector exercises and  promoting best cybersecurity  practices.The national body innovates  to provide a range of additional services  that improve the country’s ability to  prevent, detect, respond and recover  from threats.The national body is widely  recognised as an authoritative voice on  cybersecurity within the country.The  effectiveness of the national body in  reducing cyber risk and harm is  regularly evaluatedand benchmarked  against international good practice.  The government’s overall  operational response is adaptive  to changes in the underlying  technical and threat  environment.The country is  contributing to international best  practice on how to organise  operational responses to  cybersecurity threats.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  90  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Integration of  Cybersecurity  into National  Crisis  Management  No framework exists for  national- level crisis  management.Cybersecurity has  not been considered as a  potential national-level crisis  scenario.Emergency  communication capabilities are  limited.  A national crisis management  framework is in development and a  specific organisation has been allocated  responsibility for leading national-level  crisis response.Cybersecurity has been  recognised as relevant to national crisis  management, both as a factor in its own  right and as an element of other crisis  scenarios.An exercise programme is in  development and includes cybersecurity- based scenarios.Emergency  communication capabilities are in place  but may not be well integrated or lack  resilience to cyber disruption.  Cybersecurity is fully integrated into the  national crisis management framework and  the organisation responsible for crisis  management is equipped to deal with a  range of cybersecurity- related  scenarios.The role of a cyber incident  management authority within the crisis  management process is well defined and  established, and escalation thresholds are  fully understood.National crisis  management scenarios with cybersecurity  components are regularly  exercised.Emergency communication  systems are regularly tested for cyber  resilience against a range of cybersecurity- related scenarios.  Lessons learnt from cyber crisis  exercises are used to inform both  national crisis management policy and  the national cybersecurity strategy and  implementation plan.International crisis  planning and exercising with partners  exists and routinely includes  cybersecurity as an element.The  resilience of emergency  communications has been stress-  tested against a wide range of potential  scenarios.  The country is contributing to  the debate on the integration of  cyber into national  andinternational crisis  management.Emergency  communications capabilities are  capable of operating beyond the  country’s border in order to  support third- party countries and  global crisis responses.

B.3.3 Factor - D 1.3: Critical Infrastructure (CI) Protection  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Identification  There may be some  appreciation of what  constitutes a CI asset,  but no formal  categorisation of CI  assets has been  produced.  A list of general CI assets,  sectors and operators has  been created.  The list of CI assets has been formalised and  incorporates a range of appropriate public and private  sector organisations.Specific operators have been  identified and are aware of their status.The list is kept  up to date to reflect changes in the country’s  circumstances.Cross-border dependencies have been  identified.  The list of CI assets is adaptive to strategic  shifts in the underlying technical, social and  economic environment.Interdependencies  between sectors are managed.Cross-border  dependencies are managed.  There is flexibility in the process  for identifying CI assets to cater for  rapidly emerging changes in the  underlying technological or threat  environment.The country is  actively involved in the  identification and prioritisation of  global CI assets.Cross-sector and  cross-border dependencies are  mitigated.  Regulatory  Requirements  There are no existing  regulatory requirements  specific to the  cybersecurity of CI.  The need for baseline  standards to govern CI  assets isacknowledged but  these are not explicitly  mandated in  regulation.Sector regulators  do not routinely assess CI  operators for compliance.  CI operators are mandated by regulation to meet  appropriate cybersecurity standards (either in the form  of specific cyber regulation or as part of broader  regulatory requirements).Mandatory breach reporting  and vulnerability disclosure requirements are in place.  Formal processes are in place to evaluate CI operator  compliance with regulatory standards and incident and  vulnerability disclosure.  Novel approaches to regulatory supervision are  being developed to improve CI cybersecurity  while also facilitating effective and efficient CI  service delivery.The country is promoting best  practice regulatory approaches at an international  level.  Regulatory frameworks are  sufficiently flexible to cater for  rapidly emerging changes in the  underlying technological or threat  environment.The country is  actively involved in establishing  regulatory approaches to assuring  global CI.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  91  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Operational  Practice  A few CI operators  may be implementing  goodcybersecurity  practices, but this is  inconsistent.  Many CI operators are  implementing good  cybersecurity practice.There  is some self-assessment  against recognised industry  standards.Some informal  arrangements exist for  collaboration across and  within sectors.  CI operators are consistently implementing  recognised industry standards and the effectivenessof  their cybersecurity controls are regularly  assessed.Mechanisms are in place for operators to  share threat and vulnerability information, best  practices and lessons learned from incidents and near  misses.CI operators participate fully in national  incident response and crisis management planning  and exercising. Mechanisms are in place for public  authorities to provide information and other practical  support to CI operators, both pre- and post- incident.  There is extensive collaboration among CI  operators and with public authorities to develop  strategies that enhance collective  cybersecurity.The resilience of the critical  infrastructure ecosystem as a whole has been  assessedagainst a range of scenarios, and  measures are in place to address systemic risks  to the economy and society.  The country and its CI operators  are contributing to the international  debate on global critical  infrastructure resilience.Experts  from the regulators and CI  operators are recognised  internationally for their contribution  to addressing global infrastructure  protection challenges.

B.3.4 Factor - D 1.4: Cybersecurity in Defence and National Security  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Defence Force  Cybersecurity  Strategy  The potential impact  of cybersecurity on  national security and  defence may have  been considered but  has not been formally  articulated.  The potential impact of  cybersecurity on national security  and defence has been assessed and  a strategy for addressing these risks  is under development.This analysis  includes risks to the ability of the  country’s military and other national  security assets to operate in a  contested cyber environment.  A strategy for cybersecurity for national security  and defence has been formally adopted (stand-alone  or as part of a wider document).The strategy is  supported by appropriate legal authorities and  relevant operational doctrine and rules of  engagement. These are consistent with international  humanitarian law.The dependence of national  security and military entities on the cybersecurity of  other parts of the critical national infrastructure is  understood and is addressedin the defence  cybersecurity strategy.Cybersecurity considerations  inform other elements of national security and  defence strategy, where relevant.  Defence strategy includes appropriate  considerations of deterrence.The country’s  defence and national security establishment  (alongside other stakeholders) is actively  engaged in the global debate on  international humanitarian law and norms of  behaviour as they relateto conflict in  cyberspace. Declaratory strategy and  published doctrine may be part of this.  Strategy and doctrine are not  static but are adaptive tochanging  capabilities and to the geo-political  and technical threat  environment.The strategy is  designed to promote stability in  cyberspace. This includes  measures to predict and influence  the strategies and actions and  reactions of potential allies and  adversaries.  GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS FOR NCSS  February 2023  92  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Defence Force  Cybersecurity  Capability  Specialist  cybersecurity  capability within the  national security  establishment is  limited.  Specialist cybersecurity capability  requirements are understood, and  relevant organisational structures  have been defined.Initial steps have  been taken to establish these.  Capabilities and organisational structures are in  place and have been tested. Resourcing is provided  through the national military estimate or equivalent  process.Operational doctrine and rules of  engagement are fully embedded in training.Specialist  intelligence resources are being applied to provide  support and are appropriately resourced.Mechanisms  to facilitate collaboration with allies are in place and  have been tested.  Relevant deterrence and  defence/resilience capabilities are in place,  forming part of the country’s defence  cybersecurity strategy.Cybersecurity is  embedded in wider operational and  command training within the country’s  military forces.  Defence cybersecurity  capabilities are able to support  multilateral responses to shared  national security challenges.  Civil Defence  Co-ordination  Collaboration on  cybersecurity between  civil and defence  entities is limited.  Informal collaboration on  cybersecurity between civil and  defence entities may exist but has  not been formalised.Defence entities  have not been formally resourced to  undertake this work.  Collaboration on cybersecurity between civil and  defence entities exists and has been  formalised.Respective roles have been defined within  the country’s crisis management procedures.The  resources required within the defence and national  security community, to support civil and CI  authorities, have been formally assessed and  assigned.Formal mechanisms are in place to  determine military/ national security cybersecurity  dependencies on civil and CI infrastructure. The  ability of civiland CI infrastructure operators to provide  these services has been assured.  Civil defence collaboration on  cybersecurity is built into the strategic  planning of both sectors and designed to  address a range of future crisis  scenarios.Mechanisms are in place that  enable defence and the national security  community to draw on the skills and  capabilities of the broader economy and  society. (For example, via a formal cyber  reserve force)  The country is leading the  international debate on best  practice in cross-governmental,  civil-defence cybersecurity  collaboration.

Executives are made aware of general  cybersecurity issues, but not how these issues  and threats might affect their  organisations.Executives of particular sectors,  such as finance andtelecommunications, have  been made aware of cybersecurity risks in  general, and howthe organisation deals with  cybersecurity issues, but not of strategic  implications.  Awareness raising of executives in the  public, private, academic and civil society  sectors address cybersecurity risks in  general, some of the primary methods of  attack, and how the organisation deals with  cyber issues (usually abdicated to the  CIO).Select executive members are made  aware of how cybersecurity risks affect the  strategic decision making of the organisation,  particularly those in the financial and  telecommunications sectors.Awareness- raising efforts of cybersecurity crisis  management at the executive level is still  reactive in focus.  Executive awareness-raising efforts in  nearly all sectors include the identificationof  strategic assets, specific measures in place  to protect them, and the mechanism by  which they are protected.Executives are  able to alter strategic decision making and  allocate specific funding and people to the  various elements of cyber risk, contingent  on their company’s prevailing  situation.Executives are made aware of  what contingency plans arein place to  address various cyber-based attacks and  their aftermath.Executive awareness  courses in cybersecurity are mandatory for  nearly all sectors.  Cybersecurity risks are considered as  an agenda item at every executive  meeting, and funding and attention is  reallocated to address those  risks.Executives at regional and  international level are regarded as a  source of good practice in responsible  and accountable corporate cybersecurity  governance.

Traditional investigative  measures are applied to cybercrime  investigations, but digital  investigation capacity is limited.Law  enforcement officers may receive  training on cybercrime and digital  evidence, but it is ad hoc.  A comprehensive institutional capacity with  sufficient human, procedural and technological  resources to investigate cybercrime cases has been  established.Digital chain of custody and evidence  integrity is established, including formal processes,  roles and responsibilities.Standards for the training  of law enforcement officers on cybercrime and  digital evidence exist and are implemented.The  respective roles of national and state/local law  enforcement agencies are understood and state- /local-level forces are equipped to undertake their  role.  Quantified risk assessments are used to allocate  resources to operational cybercrime units (at  national and state/local levels).Trends and  statistics on cybercrime, law enforcement  interventions and their impact on harm reduction  are collected, analysed and used to inform strategy  and long-term resource allocation decision.Law  enforcement strategies include crime prevention  measures alongside enforcement measures.  Intelligence is used to support proactive  investigation.Law enforcement agencies have the  capabilities to maintainthe integrity of data to meet  international evidential standards in cross-border  investigation.  The country is actively  involved in the development of  collaborative platforms between  national law enforcement  authorities.The law enforcement  agencies within the country are  at the forefront of developing  new capabilities and  approaches for the prevention  and disruption of cybercrime  and promoting their use  internationally.  Prosecution  Prosecutors do not receive  adequate training and resources  to review electronic evidence or  prosecute  cybercrime.Consultation may  have begun to consider this  capacity in the prosecutor  community.  A limited number of prosecutors  have the capacity to conduct  cybercrime cases and to handle  electronic evidence, but this  capacity is largely ad hoc and is not  institutionalised.If prosecutors  receive training on cybercrime and  digital evidence, it is ad hoc.  A comprehensive institutional capacity, including  sufficient human and technological resources, to  prosecute cybercrime cases and cases involving  electronic evidence is established.A specialist cadre  of cybercrime prosecutors may have been  established.  Institutional structures are in place, with a clear  distribution of tasks and obligations within the  prosecution services at all levels of the state.A  mechanism exists that enables the exchange of  informationand good practices between  prosecutors and judges to ensure efficient and  effective prosecution of cybercrime cases.  There is national capacity to  prosecute complex domestic  and cross-border cybercrime  cases.  Courts  There is no process to equip  judges so they can preside over  cybercrime cases or cases  involving electronic  evidence.Consultation may have  begun to consider this capacity in  the judicial community.  A limited number of judges have  the capacity to preside over a  cybercrime case, but this capacity  is largely ad hoc.If judges receive  training on cybercrime and digital  evidence, it is ad hoc.  Sufficient human and technological resources are  available to ensure effective and efficient legal  proceedings regarding cybercrime cases and cases  involving electronic evidence.Judges receive  specialised training about cybercrime and electronic  evidence.States/local courts are equipped to deal  with cybercrime cases, appropriate to their  level.Relevant courts are equipped to process civil  litigation relating to cybersecurity liability.

Exchange of information on cybercrime  between domestic public and private  sectors is ad hoc and  unregulated.Specifically, ad-hoc co- operation between Internet service and  other technology providers and law  enforcement exists but is not always  effective.  Information is regularly exchanged between  domestic public and private sectors and is supported  by appropriate legislation.Effective co-operation  mechanisms between Internet service and other  technology providers and law enforcement have  been established aspart of these broader public–  private sector collaboration arrangements.  The effectiveness of public and private  co-operation is regularly assessed and  used to enhance collaborative  processes.Collaboration frameworks are  regularly adapted to takeaccount of new  technologies and emerging forms of  cybercrime.  The country is actively  contributing to the  promotion of public– private partnership and  the development of  international public– private partnership  platforms.  Co-operation  withForeign Law  Enforcement  Counterparts  There are minimal or no forms of  international co-operation to  prevent and combat cybercrime.  Formal mechanisms of international law  enforcement co-operation may exist, but  their application to cybercrime is ad hoc or  only possible in some cases.Law  enforcement is not formally integrated into  regional and international cybercrime  networks.  Formal mechanisms of international law  enforcement co-operation have been established to  facilitate the detection, investigation, and  prosecution of cybercrime.Mutual legal assistance,  extradition agreements and mechanisms have been  established and are applied to cybercrime  cases.Domestic law enforcement agencies are  integrated with regional and international networks,  such as Interpol or 24/7 networks.  Law enforcement agencies work jointly  with foreign counterparts, potentially  through joint task forces, resulting in  successful cross-border cybercrime  investigations and prosecutions.  The country actively  contributes to the  promotion and  development of  international co-operation  mechanisms.  Government-  Criminal Justice  Sector  Collaboration  There is minimal interaction  between government and criminal  justice actors.  Exchange of information between  government and criminal justice actors is  limited and ad hoc.  Formal relationships between government and  criminal justice actors have been established,  resulting in the regular exchange of information on  cybercrime issues.  The relationship between government  actors, prosecutors, judges and law  enforcement agencies is regularly  assessed and used to enhance their  effectiveness.

Information risk management  standards have been identified for use  and there have been some initial signs of  promotion and take-up within public and  private sectors.There is some evidence of  measurable implementation and use of  international standards and good  practices.  A nationally-agreed baseline of  cybersecurity-related standards and good  practices have been identified and  implemented widely across public and  private sectors.An entity within government  exists to assess the use of standards across  public and private sectors.Government  schemes exist to promote continued  enhancements, and metrics are being  applied to monitor compliance.Consideration  is being given as to how standards and best  practices can be used to address risk within  supply chains within the CI, by both  government and CI.  Government and organisations promote  use of standards and best practices  according to assessment of national risks  and budgetary choices.The choice of  standards and best practices and their  implementation is continuously  revised.Emerging cybersecurity risks are  regularly assessed and used to re-  evaluate the need for additional ICT  security standards.There is evidence of  debate between government and other  stakeholders as to how national and  organisational resource decisions should  align and drive implementation of  standards.Evidence of contribution to  international standards’ bodies exists and  contributes to thought leadership and  sharing of experience by organisations.  The country is actively involved in the  development and promotion of defined  standards internationally.Implementation of  standards and non-compliance decisions are  made in response to changing threat  environments and resource drivers across  sectors and CI, through collaborative risk  management.Evidence exists of debate  within all sectors on compliance to standards  and best practices, based on continuous  needs assessments.  Standards  in  Procurement  No standards or best  practices have been identified  foruse in guiding procurement  processes by the public and  private sectors. If they are  recognised, implementationis  ad hoc and un-co-ordinated.  Cybersecurity standards and best  practices guiding procurement  processes(including risk management,  lifecycle management, software and  hardware assurance, outsourcing, and  use of cloud services) have been  identified for use.Evidence of promotion  and implementation ofcybersecurity  standards and best practices in defining  procurement practices exists within public  and private sectors.  Cybersecurity standards and best  practices in guidingprocurement processes  (including risk management, lifecycle  management, software and hardware  assurance, outsourcing, and use of cloud  services) are being adhered to widely within  public and private sectors.Implementation  and compliance of standards in procurement  practices within the public and private  sectors is evidenced through measurement  and assessments of process effectiveness.  Organisations have the ability to monitor  and change use of standards and best  practices in procurement processes,  support deviations and non-compliance  decisions as the need arises through risk- based decision- making.Emerging  cybersecurity risks are regularly assessed  and used tore-evaluate the need for  additional standards in  procurement.Critical aspects of  procurement and supply, such as total  lifecycle cost, quality, inter- operability,maintenance, support and other  value- adding activities, are continuously  improved, and procurement process  improvements are made in the context of  wider resource planning.Organisations are  able to benchmark the skills of their  procurement professionals against the  competencies outlined in procurement  standards and identify any skills and  capability gaps.

Limited Internet services and  infrastructure are available, but with low  levels of adoption and issues of  unreliability.The ability of Internet  infrastructure in public and private sectors  to withstand incidents with minimum  disruption has been discussed by multiple  stakeholders but may not have been fully  addressed.Support for securing Internet  infrastructure may rely on regional  assistance.  Reliable Internet services are widely  available and used.Internet services are  trusted widely for conductinge-commerce and  electronic business transactions; appropriate  authentication processes are  established.Technology deployed and  processes used for managing Internet  infrastructure meet international standards  and follow good practices.National  infrastructure is formally managed, with  documented processes, roles and  responsibilities, and limited redundancy.  Regular assessments are  made of technology, of processes  for compliance with international  standards, and of guidelines that  address the national need inthe  face of emerging risks, and  changes are made as  required.There is effective and  controlled acquisition of critical  technologies, and there are  managed strategic planning and  service continuity processes in  place.  Acquisition of infrastructure technologies  is effectively controlled, with flexibility  incorporated according to changing market  dynamics.Costs for infrastructure  technologies are continually assessed and  optimised.Scientific, technical, industrial  and human capabilities are being  systematically maintained, enhanced, and  perpetuated in order to maintain the  country’s independent  resilience.Optimised efficiency is in place  to mediate extended outages of systems.  Monitoring  and Response  No risk assessments are conducted by  Internet infrastructure owners to identify  vulnerable assets and prioritise  protective actions.There is no monitoring  in place to detect that incidents have  occurred.No incident response plans are  in place.  Processes on developing risk  assessments for Internet infrastructure  owners have been initiated.There is ad- hoc monitoring of parts of the  Internetinfrastructure, but it may not be  comprehensive.Incident response plans  are in development in some sectors.  Mechanisms are in place in both public and  private sectors to conduct risk assessments,  monitor and test network resilience, and to  respond to incidents.Incident response plans  are in place in both public and private sectors  and are regularly tested and kept under  review.Appropriate resources are allocated to  hardwareintegration, technology stress  testing, personnel training, monitoring,  response, and drills to test response plans.  Risks related to emerging and  converging technologies are  regularly assessed by Internet  Infrastructure owners.Risks  related to emerging and  converging technologies are  regularly assessed by regulatory  agencies responsible for  electronic communications  networks and this is used to  inform funding and priority  decisions.  National-level assets can act to work  with the international community in the  event of a trans-jurisdictional crisis or  incident.Lessons learnt from international  collaborations are used toevolve  monitoring and response  capabilities.Evidence exists that sovereign  novel monitoring and response capabilities  are being developed in anticipation of  emerging threats.

If there is domestic production, the  need for secure processes is  recognised.If there is reliance on foreign  technologies, the security implications  are considered.  If there is domestic production, secure  processes are in place.If there is reliance on  foreign technologies, the security implications  are identified and mitigated in the context of an  international supply chain.  If there is local development of  cybersecurity technology, it abides by  secure codingguidelines, good  practices and adheres to  internationally- accepted  standards.Risk assessments and  market incentives inform the  prioritisation of productdevelopment  and mitigation of identified risks.The  security implications of using foreign  technologies are routinely analysed  and revised based on the assessment  of emerging cybersecurity risks.  Security functions in software and  computer system configurations are  automated in the development and  deployment of technologies.Domestic  cybersecurity products are exported to  other nations and are considered  superior products.The country has  established a body to assure the  security of foreign technologies  (devices and software) and supply  chains, or to certify entities which can  do this.  Cybersecurity  Services and  Expertise  Cybersecurity consultancy  services are not widely on offer  in the country.Few if any service  providers have professional  certification.  There are a growing number of  cybersecurity consultancyservices  available for private and public  organisations.A growing number of  service providers provide detail of the  professional certifications they  possess.There may be limited or no  guidance to assist organisations with the  selection of service providers.  There are widespread cybersecurity consultancy  services available for private and public  organisations.All service providers provide details  of the professional certifications they possess.A  national body accredits service providers, to  assist organisations in selecting service  providers.  Private and public organisations  routinely seek advice from  cybersecurity consultancy services,  including advice about emerging  risks.There is an adequate supply of  cybersecurity professionals in the  country.  The cybersecurity service sector in  the country helps shape the  international market.  Security  Implications of  Outsourcing  No risk assessments are  conducted to determine how to  mitigate the risks of outsourcing  IT to a third party or cloud  services.There is a lack of  understanding of the security  measures that the outsourced  IT service provider applies.  Some organisations and sectors  conduct risk assessments to determine  how to mitigate the risks of outsourcing  IT to a third party or cloud services.At  least some organisations and sectors  understand the security measures that  the outsourced IT service provider  applies.At least some organisations have  developed business continuity and  disaster recovery processes.  Most major organisations from the public and  private sectors conduct risk assessments to  determine how to mitigate the risks of  outsourcing IT to a third party or cloud  services.There is widespread understanding of  the security guarantees provided by the  outsourced IT service providers.Most  organisations have developed and tested  processes to support business continuity and  disaster recovery.  Insights arising from risk  assessments are routinely analysed in  order to establish and promote  cybersecurity best practices to  mitigate the risk of outsourcing  IT.Different risk scenarios with the IT  service provider are explored and  tested, including emerging risks.  The country is contributing to  international best practice on how to  mitigate the risk of outsourcing IT.  Cyber Insurance  The need for a cyber- insurance market may have  been identified, but no products  and servicesare widely  available, either domestically or  from external providers.  The need for a market in cyber-  insurance has been identified through  the assessment of financial risks for the  public and private sectors, and the  appropriateness of availableofferings is  now being discussed.  A market for cyber-insurance is established  and encourages the sharing of threat-  information among participants of the  market.Products suitable for small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) are also on offer.  Cyber-insurance market offers a  variety of covers to mitigate  consequential losses.Cover is  selected by organisations based on  strategic planning needs and identified  risk.The cyber-insurance market is  innovative and adapts to emerging  risks, standards andpractices, while  addressing the full scope of cyber  harm.Insurance premium reductions  are offered for consistent cyber-  secure behaviour.

Technical details of vulnerabilities are  shared informally with other stakeholders  which can distribute the information more  broadly.Software and service providers  are able to address bug and vulnerability  reports but there may not be formal  protocols for doing so.  There are formal information- sharing  mechanisms or channels in place to share the  technical details of vulnerabilities with other  stakeholders, which can distribute the  information more broadly.A substantial  proportion of vulnerabilities in products and  services are remedied within defined deadlines  after their discovery.  Vulnerability information-sharing  mechanisms are continuously  reviewed and updated basedon the  needs of all affected stakeholders, and  in the light of emerging risks.All  affected products and services are  routinely updated within defined  deadline.Processes are in place to  review and reduce deadlines where  possible.  The country is contributing to the  debate and international best practice  on the sharing of vulnerability  information.  Policies,  Processes and  Legislation for  Responsible  Disclosure of  Security Flaws  The need for a responsible-  disclosure policy in public and  private sector organisations,  and the right to legal protections  for those disclosing security  flaws are not yet acknowledged.  The need for a responsible- disclosure  policy in public and private sector  organisationsis recognised but policies or  processes may not be in place, or may  only be in development.The right to legal  protections for those disclosing security  flaws is recognised but legislation may  not be in place; or may only be in  development.Software and service  providers commit to refraining from  taking legal action against a party  disclosing information responsibly.  A responsible-disclosure policy or framework  is in place in public and private sector  organisations, and includes a disclosure  deadline, scheduled resolution, and the need for  acknowledgement.Organisations have  established processes to receive and  disseminate vulnerability information  responsibly.The right to legal protections for  those disclosing security flaws responsibly is in  place.  Responsible-disclosure policies and  processes are continuously reviewed  and updated based on the needs of all  affected stakeholders and in the light  of emerging risks.An analysis of the  technical details of vulnerabilitiesis  published and advisory information is  disseminated according to individual  roles and responsibilities.  The country is contributing to the debate  on responsible-disclosure frameworks  and legal protections for those  disclosing security flaws responsibly.

    "abstract": "This study is focusing on the good practices around the set-up and deployment of a governance framework to support the implementation of the NCSS in the EU. The objective is to systematically review existing governance models relevant to the deployment of a NCSS and to identify and select the most relevant instances, lessons learned, and good practices from the EU Member States. The report aims to collect insights on the definition of processes, roles, and responsibilities, the subsequent deployment of monitoring measures, and to identify the main challenges and good practices that the EU Member States put in place to ensure an effective governance framework for the implementation of NCSSs."

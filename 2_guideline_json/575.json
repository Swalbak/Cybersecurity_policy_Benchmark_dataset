ISBN: 978-92-9204-078-9 DOI: 10.2824/27590  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  iv  Executive summary  The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) reviewed the existing  measures and the procedures in EU Member States with regard to personal data breaches and  published in 2011 a study on the technical implementation of the Art. 4 of the ePrivacy Directive,  which included recommendations on how to plan and prepare for data breaches, how to detect and  assess them, how to notify individuals and competent authorities and how to respond to data  breaches. A proposal of a methodology for personal data breach severity assessment was also  included as an annex to the above-mentioned recommendations, which was, however, not  considered mature enough to be used at national level by the different Data Protection Authorities.  Against this background, the Data Protection Authorities of Greece and Germany in collaboration  with ENISA developed, based on the above mentioned work, an updated methodology for data  breach severity assessment that could be used both by DPAs as well as data controllers. This working  document is a first result of the co-operation between experts of the two DPAs and ENISA. It is  planned to further develop the methodology with the aim to generate a final practical tool for a data  breach severity assessment.  An overview of the proposed methodology is presented in section 2 of this paper, and further  elaborated in subsequent sections. Severity of a breach is defined as the estimation of the  magnitude of potential impact on the individuals derived from the data breach. The core elements  that have to be taken into account when assessing this severity are:   Data processing context – type of breached data adjusted to the context in which they are  used   Ease of identification of the individual based on the data breached   Circumstances of the breach, having additional influence on the severity of a breach  The methodology presented in this study is based on an as objective approach as possible whilst still  being flexible enough to be adopted by various Data Protection Authorities by adjusting it to their  size, national legal system and other factors. According to different requirements, the scoring of  some categories can be adjusted to produce the most appropriate results.

The European Commission,  as also stipulated in the Directive, has published implementing measures mainly on the format and  circumstances of the personal data breach notification – Commission Regulation (EU) No 611/20132.  Following the provision of the ePrivacy Directive, a proposal for a general obligation of the data  controllers for the notification of personal data breaches under certain conditions has been  introduced in the draft Regulation on the Protection of Personal Data (art. 31) in the context of the  overall Data Protection Reform Package3.  Both these legislative provisions constitute important developments with the potential to increase  the level of data security in Europe and foster reassurance amongst citizens on how their personal  data are being secured and protected by data controllers. As part of the effective implementation of  the data breach notification obligation, the Article 29 Working Party concluded, through its ePrivacy  and technology subgroups, that there is a serious need for the development of a methodology for  the assessment of the severity of personal data breaches. The discussions within the Article 29  Working Party are currently still ongoing.  The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) reviewed the already  existing measures and the procedures in EU Member States with regard to personal data breaches  and published in 2011 a report on the technical implementation of the Art. 4 of the ePrivacy  Directive4. A proposal of a methodology for personal data breach severity assessment was included  as an annex to that report, which was, however, not considered as mature enough to be used at  national level by the different Data Protection Authorities.  Against this background, the Data Protection Authorities of Greece and Germany in collaboration  with ENISA developed, based on the above mentioned work, an updated methodology for data  breach severity assessment that could be used both by DPAs as well as data controllers. This working  document is a first result of the co-operation between experts of the two DPAs and ENISA. It is  planed to further develop the methodology with the aim to generate a final practical tool for a data  breach severity assessment.  1.2 Objectives  The proposed methodology presented in this document has been designed with the following  objectives:   To provide data controllers with a quantitative tool (to the extent that this is possible) to assess  the severity of data breaches and accordingly notify the competent authorities as well as the  1  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0011:01:EN:HTML  2  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:173:SOM:EN:HTML  3  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  4  Recommendations on technical implementation guidelines of Article 4,  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/risks-and-data-breaches/dbn/art4_tech  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0011:01:EN:HTML http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:173:SOM:EN:HTML http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/risks-and-data-breaches/dbn/art4_tech  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  2  affected individuals. The tool could also serve as a means for data controllers to quickly  determine the necessary mitigation measures.   To provide the national competent authorities with a tool to assess the severity of the breaches  notified by the data controllers.   To support the national competent authorities in the process of performing detailed analyses  and statistics concerning the reported personal data breaches.   To contribute to the harmonization of the severity assessment of personal data breaches in the  European Union, by proposing a common methodology and severity scoring. This would be  especially important in the case of cross-border breaches.  1.3 Severity of data breaches  The severity of a personal data breach is defined, in the context of this methodology, as the  “estimation of the magnitude of potential impact on the individuals derived from the data  breach”.  As stipulated in Directive 2009/136/EC5 (recital (61)), the impact of a personal data breach may  include “for example, identity theft or fraud, physical harm, significant humiliation or damage to  reputation in connection with the provision of publicly available  communications  services  in  the  Community”.  With the use of this methodology the data controller is guided through the process by specific  quantitative criteria in order to make the overall assessment. The same criteria can be used by the  competent authorities, together with the information provided by the controller in the notification  form6, in order to make its own assessment of the breach.  It should be noted that the controller is applying the methodology using the information that is in  his/her possession at the time of the breach. In that sense, the methodology cannot always cover all  the possible casuistic, including likely impacts on specific groups of individuals or very special cases  that cannot be fully addressed under a general methodology. Therefore, it has to be reminded that  both, data controllers and competent authorities should put particular care when dealing with cases  that, because of their specificities, could not be rightly assessed using this methodology.  5  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0011:0036:en:PDF  6  An example of a template of a data breach notification form to the competent authorities is available in the  Appendix A of http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/risks-and-data- breaches/dbn/art4_tech  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0011:0036:en:PDF http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/risks-and-data-breaches/dbn/art4_tech http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/risks-and-data-breaches/dbn/art4_tech  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  3  2 Overview of the methodology  2.1 Criteria  The main criteria taken into account while assessing the severity of a personal data breach are:   Data Processing Context (DPC): Addresses the type of the breached data, together with a  number of factors linked to the overall context of processing.   Ease of Identification (EI): Determines how easily the identity of the individuals can be deduced  from the data involved in the breach.   Circumstances of breach (CB): Addresses the specific circumstances of the breach, which are  related to the type of the breach, including mainly the loss of security of the breached data, as  well as any involved malicious intent.  2.2 Calculation of the severity  Based on the above criteria, the approach of this methodology is the following:   DPC is at the core of the methodology and evaluates the criticality of a given data set in a  specific processing context.   EI is a correcting factor of the DPC. The overall criticality of a data processing can be reduced  depending on the value of EI. In other words, the lower the ease of identification is, the lower  gets the overall score. Therefore, the combination of the EI and DPC (multiplication) gives the  initial score of the severity (SE) of the data breach.   CB quantifies specific circumstances of the breach that may be present or not in a particular  situation. So, when present, CB can only add to the severity of a specific breach. For this reason  the initial score can be further adjusted by the CB.  Thus, the final score of the severity assessment can be extracted using the following formula:  In this way, in order for the controller to get the severity result, all three criteria should be scored.  The result belongs to a certain range of values which corresponds to one of the four severity levels:  low, medium, high and very high7. At the end of the assessment, other possibly relevant criteria  (number of individuals and unintelligibility of data) that have not been considered in the  methodology are evaluated and flagged to the competent authority when applicable.  It is essential to bear in mind that all scores and/or rankings used in this methodology were solely  set for the use within the severity formula. They are not meant to bear any significance to a  conclusion about the weighting or ranking of certain types of data in general, let alone an  indication to any legal consequences or precedents as to the use of this data for other purposes.  7  Severity levels will be explained in details in section 3.2.  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  4  3 Detailed description of scoring and severity levels  3.1 Scoring of the criteria  3.1.1 Data Processing Context (DPC)  In order to define the score for DPC, the data controller should follow the next steps:   Step 1: Definition and classification of the types of personal data  a) Define the types of the personal data involved in the breach.  b) Classify the data in at least one of the four categories: simple, behavioural, financial, and  sensitive data (these categories are explained in details in Annex 1). In this way a preliminary  basic DPC score is obtained.  The list of data types described under the four categories is not exhaustive; however most  data involved in real cases can be matched to at least one of the categories. Credentials are  not considered as a specific data category and should be handled based on the type of data  processed by the systems where they provide access to.   Step 2: Adjustment by contextual factors related to the data processing  c) Assess the occurrence of certain factors that could increase or decrease the basic score (data  volume, special characteristics of the controllers or the individuals, invalidity/inaccuracy of  data, public availability (before the breach), nature of data).  d) In case such factors exist, accordingly increase/decrease the basic score. Assessment Table 1  provides the adjustment scales per category of data, together with example cases that could  lead to lower/higher scores.  Please refer to the Annex 1 for a list of contextual factors and specific examples of DPC scoring.  Note: Even though, for the purpose of the methodology, four data categories are ranked, the  categorization itself is not to be seen as a general ranking of the types of data at hand. Much more,  additional contextual factors related to the data always need to be taken into account when  regarding the processing of a certain type of data. Therefore, the basic score is to be seen just as a  general indication of the criticality connected to a certain category of data and the DPC scoring of  any data type can always vary from 1 to 4.  If the data matches more than one category the above mentioned steps have to be followed for  each category applicable. In these cases the value to use for the overall calculation of the severity  will be the highest score reached.  If the controller chooses to alter the DPC basic score (within the range of Assessment Table 1), the  new score has to be supported by an explanation describing the particular contextual factors of the  breach and their influence.  3.1.2 Ease of identification (EI)  Ease of identification (EI) evaluates how easy it will be for a party who has access to the set of data  to univocally match them to a certain person.  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  5  For the purpose of this methodology we have defined four levels of EI (negligible, limited, significant  and maximum) with a linear increase in score. The lowest score is given when the possibility to  identify the individual is negligible, meaning that it is extremely difficult to match the data to a  particular person, but still it could be possible under certain conditions. The highest score is selected  when identification is possible directly from the data breached with no special research needed to  discover the individual’s identity. Annex 2 describes these levels in details.  When defining EI, it should be taken into account that identification may be directly (e.g. on the  basis of a given name) or indirectly (eg. on the basis of ID number) possible from the breached data,  but may also depend on the specific context of the breach. Therefore, certain identifiers may lead to  different EI scores according to the specific case of the breach.  Please refer to the Annex 2 for specific examples of EI scoring using common identifiers.  In addition, when defining EI the controller should take into account all the means likely reasonably  to be used by any person to identify the individuals. This includes information that is public, held or  obtained otherwise, including over the Internet, as well as possible cross-matching with other  sources than can be accessed by the data controller or a third party.  3.1.3 Circumstances of the breach (CB)  The elements that are considered under CB are the loss of security (confidentiality, integrity,  availability) and malicious intent and are complementary to DPC and EI, as follows:  Loss of confidentiality: Loss of confidentiality occurs when the information is accessed by parties  who are not authorized or don’t have a legitimate purpose to access it. The extent of loss of  confidentiality varies by the scope of disclosure, i.e. the potential number and type of parties that  may have unlawfully access to the information.  Loss of integrity: Loss of integrity occurs when the original information is altered and substitution of  data can be prejudicial for the individual. The most severe situation occurs when there are serious  possibilities that the altered data have been used in a way that could harm the individual.  Loss of availability: Loss of availability occurs when the original data cannot be accessed when there  is a need for it. It can be either temporal (data are recoverable but it will take a period of time and  this can be detrimental for the individual), or permanent (data cannot be recovered).  Malicious intent: This element examines whether the breach was due to an error or mistake, either  human or technical, or it was caused by an intentional action of malicious intent. Non malicious  breaches include cases of accidental loss, inadequate disposal, human error and software bug or  misconfiguration. Malicious breaches include cases of theft and hacking aiming to harm the  individuals (e.g. by exposing their personal data to unauthorised third parties). In other cases  malicious intent might include transfer of personal data to third parties for profit (e.g. selling of lists  of personal data). In some cases malicious intent could also be inferred from actions aiming to harm  the data controller (e.g. through stealing and exposing the personal data to unauthorized parties).  Malicious intent is a factor that increases the likelihood that the data is used in harmful way, since  this was the initial purpose of the breach.  With regard to CB scoring, contrary to DPC and EI where the maximum score reached is chosen, the  points obtained for each CB element are added to obtain the final score, as different circumstances  can occur in the same breach. Assessment Table 3 provides different scores per CB element and for  different types of circumstances.  Please refer to the Annex 3 for specific examples of CB scoring.  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  6  3.2 Definition of severity level  As introduced in the Section 2.2, the overall severity (SE) is calculated by the following formula:  The final score shows the level of severity of a certain breach, taking into account the impact to the  individuals8.  3.3 Flags  Once the severity level has been defined, it can be accompanied by flags indicating certain elements  of the breach that, although they do not affect a priori the scoring, they are important for the final  assessment. For the purpose of the methodology, two flags have been considered:  Number of individuals breached exceeds 100. Data of an individual, breached in the context of a  bigger incident, can potentially be more easily disclosed, whereas at the same time a high number of  affected individuals influences the overall scale of the breach.  Data unintelligible. Unintelligibility (e.g. in the form of strong encryption and without key  compromise) can substantially decrease the impact to individuals, since it highly decreases the  possibility of unauthorized parties accessing the data.  8 Table setting the levels of severity of a data breach was first introduced in the “Recommendations  on technical implementation guidelines of Article 4”, page 24, but has been made more precise in  this document.  Severity of a data breach  SE < 2  Low Individuals either will not be affected or may encounter a few  inconveniences, which they will overcome without any problem (time  spent re-entering information, annoyances, irritations, etc.).  2 ≤ SE < 3 Medium Individuals may encounter significant inconveniences, which they will  be able to overcome despite a few difficulties (extra costs, denial of  access to business services, fear, lack of understanding, stress, minor  physical ailments, etc.).  3 ≤ SE< 4 High Individuals may encounter significant consequences, which they should  be able to overcome albeit with serious difficulties (misappropriation of  funds, blacklisting by banks, property damage, loss of employment,  subpoena, worsening of health, etc.).  4 ≤ SE  Very High Individuals may encounter significant, or even irreversible,  consequences, which they may not overcome (financial distress such as  substantial debt or inability to work, long-term psychological or  physical ailments, death, etc.).  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  7  4 Use of the methodology  4.1.1 Notification to competent authorities  The severity level of the breach (together with the flags), as calculated through this methodology,  could be integrated in the notification sent by the controller to the competent authorities. This can  be done either automatically in the notification template or through the use of a standalone tool.  The competent authorities will be free to evaluate the result (using the same template/tool and the  information provided by the controller) and accept it or reject it, following their own assessment.  If for some reason the final severity level is deemed to be incorrect by the data controller, it could be  possible for the controller to state the “correct” level, including his/her arguments for the different  result, in a free text box (ex. integrated in the notification form). Moreover, any change in the default  score for the DPC criterion should also be explained by the controller using a free text box. These  boxes could also be used to leave comments without changing the severity level.  4.1.2 Notification to the individuals  The severity level could be used by the controller and the competent authority to determine if there  is a need to notify the individuals. The level upon which notification should be deemed necessary  could be mutually accepted by all competent authorities or vary depending national-wide criteria.  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  8  5 Closing remarks  On the previous pages we have presented a working document on our proposed methodology for  assessing data breaches. This proposal ultimately aims towards being integrated into a notification  template (such as in ENISA’s Recommendations for the technical implementation of the Art.4 of the  ePrivacy Directive9) to achieve an as far as possible automated severity assessment.  The methodology presented in this study is based on an as objective approach as possible whilst still  being flexible enough to be adopted by various Data Protection Authorities by adjusting it to their  size, national legal system and other factors. According to different requirements, the scoring of  some categories can be adjusted to produce the most appropriate results:   Data processing context can be adjusted according to the importance of data (simple,  behavioural, financial etc.) assigned by the specific DPA   Ease of identification can take into account the reality in a given country and its legal system  (public availability of personal numbers, names, addresses etc.)   Circumstances of a breach offer the highest flexibility to adjust the final result to the needs  of a DPA   Flags can either be adjusted (for example in function of records breached), complemented  by new ones or moved to the CB (circumstances of a breach) table.  ENISA and the DPAs of Greece and Germany aim at further developing the work presented in this  document with the final scope of publishing a practical data breach severity tool that can be useful  both for the DPAs and the data controllers across the EU.  9  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/risks-and-data-breaches/dbn/art4_tech  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/risks-and-data-breaches/dbn/art4_tech  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  9  Annex 1 – Data processing context  A1 Assessment tables  Table 1: Data Processing Context (DPC)  Score  Simple data Eg. biographical data, contact details, full name, data on education, family life, professional experience, etc.  Preliminary basic score: when the breach involves ‘’simple data’’ and the controller is not aware of any aggravating factors.  1  The DPC score could be increased by 1, e.g. when the volume of “simple data” and/or the characteristics of the controller are such that certain profiling of the  individual can be enabled or assumptions about the individual’s social/financial status can be made.  2  The DPC score could be by 2, e.g. when the “simple data” and/or the characteristics of the controller can lead to assumptions about the individual’s health status,  sexual preferences, political or religious beliefs.  3  The DPC score could be increased by 3, e.g. when due to certain characteristics of the individual (e.g. vulnerable groups, minors), the information can be critical for  their personal safety or physical/psychological conditions.  4  Behavioural data Eg. location, traffic data, data on personal preferences and habits, etc.  Preliminary basic score: when the breach involves ‘’behavioural data’’ and the controller is not aware of any aggravating or lessening factors.  2  The DPC score could be decreased by 1, e.g. when the nature of the data set does not provide any substantial insight to the individual’s behavioural information or  the data can be collected easily (independently from the breach) through publicly available sources (e.g. combination of information from web searches).  1  The DPC score can be increased by 1, e.g. when the volume of “behavioural data” and/or the characteristics of the controller are such that a profile of the individual  can be created, exposing detailed information about his/her everyday life and habits.  3  The DPC score can be increased by 2, e.g. if a profile based on individual’s sensitive data can be created.  4  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  10  Financial data Any type of financial data (e.g. income, financial transactions, bank statements, investments, credit cards, invoices, etc.). Includes social welfare data related to financial  information.  Preliminary basic score: when the breach involves ‘’financial data’’ and the controller is not aware of any aggravating or lessening factors.  3  The DPC score could be decreased by 2, e.g. when the nature of the data set does not provide any substantial insight to the individual’s financial information (e.g.  the fact that a person is the customer of a certain bank without further details).  1  The DPC score could be decreased by 1, e.g. when the specific data set includes some financial information but still does not provide any significant insight to the  individual’s financial status/situation (e.g. simple bank account numbers without further details).  2  The DPC score could be increased by 1, e.g. when due to the nature and/or volume of the specific data set, full financial (e.g. credit card) information is disclosed  that could enable fraud or an detailed social/financial profile is created.  4  Sensitive data Any type of sensitive data (e.g. health, political affiliation, sexual life)  Preliminary basic score: when the breach involves ‘sensitive data’’ and the controller is not aware of any lessening factors.  4  The DPC score could be decreased by 1, e.g. when the nature of the data set does not provide any substantial insight to the individual’s behavioural information or  the data can be collected easily (independently from the breach) through publicly available sources (e.g. combination of information from web searches).  1  The DPC score could be decreased by 2, e.g. when nature of data can lead to general assumptions.  2  The DPC score could be decreased by 1, e.g. when nature of data can lead to assumptions about sensitive information. 3  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  11  A2 Description of contextual factors to be considered in DPC scoring  Increasing factors:   The volume of the breached data (for the same individual): this factor can increase the basic  DPC score, due to the increment of the quantity of the breached information (i.e. acting as  aggravating factor). The volume should be considered both in terms of time (e.g. same type of  data over a certain period of time) and content (complementing data of the same type). For  example, in case of a breach of traffic data at an ISP, the DPC score would be higher (for the  same individual) if the data cover a period of one year than if they are limited to one week  (time). As another example, in case of a breach at a bank, the DPC score of the complete file of  an individual would be higher than that of a single document from the same file (content).   Special characteristics of the data controller: this factor relates to the field of operation and the  activities of the data controller, which could increase the basic DPC score of the data, revealing  additional information for a certain data set. For example, the DPC score of a customers’ list  would be higher if it comes from an online pharmacy than from a stationery shop.   Special characteristics of the individuals: the basic DPC score of a certain data set could also be  increased in case that the individuals belong to a social group with particular needs (e.g. minors,  individuals of a particular group with special characteristics). For example, the DPC score of a list  of telephone numbers would increase if it concerns known members of the national parliament.  Decreasing factors:   Invalidity/inaccuracy of the data: the basic DPC score of a certain data set can be decreased if  the invalidity or inaccuracy of the data is known to the controller (e.g. due to their age or  content) and, thus, their significance is reduced. The controller needs to be certain of this  circumstance to include it in the assessment. For example a postal service’s list of addresses  where letters could not be delivered would be considered as inaccurate (i.e. most probably the  individuals have moved to another address).   Public availability: the basic DPC score of a data set can also be decreased in case the breached  data were already publicly available before the breach or can be easily collected and/or accessed  through publicly available sources.   Nature of data: another decreasing factor could in some cases be the very nature of a particular  data set that, despite its initial DPC scoring, is of lower significance, in terms of the information  that it can reveal about the individual. This is, for example, the case of a medical certificate that  is just certifying that the individual is in a good state of health without disclosing any other  information. In this case, although the basic score would be 4 due to health data being sensitive  data, the specific data set’s final DPC score would be 1, as it cannot per se affect the individual’s  personal life. This factor, however, should be considered with great care and clear explanation of  the reason why a particular data processing  is by nature lower than its basic DPC score.  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  12  A3 Examples of DPC scoring/adjustment per category of data  Simple data  Example 1: List of names and telephone numbers   Case 1: the list is the customer list of a supermarket/restaurant.

Score = 2 (no alteration due to contextual factors)   Case 3: the data come from an ISP and include subscribers’ call history of the last year.  Score = 3 (a detailed profile of the individual can be created).   Case 4: the data come from a psychological support centre for people suffering from a  serious illness and includes incoming calls.  Score = 4 (by characteristics of controller disclosing health status).  Example 2: Data in a fidelity card   Case 1: the card is from a supermarket and includes only the number of points gained from  purchases.  Score = 1 (by nature of the data set).   Case 2: the card is from a supermarket and includes information on purchase history for  the last month.  Score = 2 (no alteration due to contextual factors).   Case 3: the data come from a transportation card and includes information about  location/movements over the last year.  Score = 3 (a detailed profile of the individual can be created).   Case 4: the card is from a pharmacy and includes information on recent purchases of  medical products.  Score = 4 (by nature of data set disclosing sensitive data).  Example 3: Data from a social network   Case 1: the data are publically available on the internet (e.g. pictures that the user has  published online).  Score = 1 (by public availability).   Case 2: the data include information about the user’s preferences and everyday life of the  last month that the user has shared with his/her friends (e.g. information published on  user’s wall).

Score = 4 (by volume and nature of data leading to detailed profiling).  Example 3: Credit card information   Case 1: the data come from a bank and contain credit card details of individuals but these  data are more than ten years old and therefore these cards are not valid.  Score = 1 (by age of the data set).   Case 2: the data come from an online shop and contain some credit card information of  individuals, but not the necessary set of details to perform financial transactions.  Score = 2 (by nature of data, info that can lead to limited information about financial status).

Score = 4 / Sensitive data (no alteration due to contextual factors)  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  17  Annex 2 – Ease of identification (EI) scoring  This annex will present the examples of EI scoring for common identifiers.  Identification can be direct or indirect and is performed with the use of certain identifiers, taking  also into account the overall context of the processing of personal data. The next examples show a  (non-exhaustive) list of common identifiers and different cases of their possible use for EI scoring.  It should be noted that in many cases the breach will include a combination of different identifiers,  which automatically increases the ease of identification. This is a very important element that should  be taken into account by the controller and is reflected in the examples below.  Full name (first name, surname)  It is considered as the most common direct identifier but EI score may vary depending on the case,  since the full name does not always in itself uniquely single out the individual. For example, when  identification is performed using only the individual’s full name:   EI = 0,25 (Negligible) throughout a country’s population where many people share that same full  name   EI = 0,5 (Limited) throughout a country’s population where few people share that same full  name.   EI = 0,75 (Significant) throughout a small city’s population where few or no people share that  same full name.   EI=1 (Maximum) throughout a country’s population using also date of birth and email address.  ID card/passport/social security number  They are all considered as unique identifiers and they can be used to single out the individual, as  long as it is possible to link them to a reference database (e.g. linking an ID card to a particular  person). For example, when identification is performed using only one of these numbers:   EI=0,25 (Negligible) when no other information is provided about the individual or it is not  possible to find additional information unless access to the reference database is obtained   EI=0,75 (Significant) when the identifier reveals additional identification information about the  individual (e.g. social security number revealing date of birth) and is linked to other data (e.g.  postal address or email).   EI=1 (Maximum) when information from the reference database is also available (e.g. ID card  and full name and/or picture).  Telephone number/Home address  They are both indirect identifiers, which can also be used to communicate with or access the  individual. When identification is based only on one of these two identifiers:   EI=0,25 (Negligible) throughout a country’s population when the number/address is not  registered in a publicly available register.   EI=0,5 (Limited) throughout a small city’s population and the number/address is not  registered in a publicly available register (identification possible through communication).    EI=1 (Maximum) throughout a country’s population and the number/address is included in  publicly available register.  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  18  Email address  It is also an indirect identifier, which can be used to communicate with the individual and in some  cases it may include information about his/her name (first name and/or surname). When  identification is based on email:   EI=0,25 (Negligible) when the email address does not reveal any other identification  information (e.g. name) and is not used as a primary address of the individual in internet  sites, forums or social networks.   EI=0,75 (Significant) when the email address does not reveal any other identification  information (e.g. name) but is used as a primary address of the individual in internet sites,  forums or social networks (searchable on the web).   EI=1 (Maximum) when the email address reveals the individual’s name and is used as his/her  primary address in internet sites, forums or social networks (searchable on the web).  Picture  It may be a direct or indirect identifier, depending on the case. For example, when identification is  based only on a picture:   EI=0.25 (Negligible) when the picture is unclear or vague (e.g. CCTV footage from a long  distance).   EI=05 (Limited) when the picture is unclear or vague but it includes additional information  (e.g. surroundings that show a specific location) that could lead to the identification of the  individual.   EI=0,75 (Significant) when the picture is clear but no other identification information is  linked to it.   EI=1 (Maximum) when the picture is clear and linked to some additional information (e.g.  information about membership to a specific group, home address, etc).  Coding/Aliases/Initials  Coding refers to the assignment of a unique ID number to each individual, e.g. in the context of a  specific database. The use of aliases is a form of pseudonymisation, in the sense that a specific  identifier (usually the individual’s full name) is substituted by an alias (pseudonym). The initials are a  type of alias that is extracted from the full name of the individual. Like in the case of unique  identifiers, codes and aliases can be used to identify the individual as long as it is possible to link  them to a reference database (e.g. linking the code/alias to the full name of  a particular person)  When identification is based on coding or use of aliases:   EI=0,25 (Negligible) when the code/alias does not reveal and cannot be linked to any other  personal data about the individual unless access to the reference database is obtained.   EI=0,75 (Significant) when the alias reveals some data about the individual (e.g. first name)  and is linked to other personal data (e.g. the individual’s email address).   EI=1 (Maximum) when the alias reveals the individual’s full name or data from the reference  database are also available.

ISBN: 978-92-9204-078-9 DOI: 10.2824/27590  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  iv  Executive summary  The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) reviewed the existing  measures and the procedures in EU Member States with regard to personal data breaches and  published in 2011 a study on the technical implementation of the Art. 4 of the ePrivacy Directive,  which included recommendations on how to plan and prepare for data breaches, how to detect and  assess them, how to notify individuals and competent authorities and how to respond to data  breaches. A proposal of a methodology for personal data breach severity assessment was also  included as an annex to the above-mentioned recommendations, which was, however, not  considered mature enough to be used at national level by the different Data Protection Authorities.  Against this background, the Data Protection Authorities of Greece and Germany in collaboration  with ENISA developed, based on the above mentioned work, an updated methodology for data  breach severity assessment that could be used both by DPAs as well as data controllers. This working  document is a first result of the co-operation between experts of the two DPAs and ENISA. It is  planned to further develop the methodology with the aim to generate a final practical tool for a data  breach severity assessment.  An overview of the proposed methodology is presented in section 2 of this paper, and further  elaborated in subsequent sections. Severity of a breach is defined as the estimation of the  magnitude of potential impact on the individuals derived from the data breach. The core elements  that have to be taken into account when assessing this severity are:   Data processing context – type of breached data adjusted to the context in which they are  used   Ease of identification of the individual based on the data breached   Circumstances of the breach, having additional influence on the severity of a breach  The methodology presented in this study is based on an as objective approach as possible whilst still  being flexible enough to be adopted by various Data Protection Authorities by adjusting it to their  size, national legal system and other factors. According to different requirements, the scoring of  some categories can be adjusted to produce the most appropriate results.

The European Commission,  as also stipulated in the Directive, has published implementing measures mainly on the format and  circumstances of the personal data breach notification – Commission Regulation (EU) No 611/20132.  Following the provision of the ePrivacy Directive, a proposal for a general obligation of the data  controllers for the notification of personal data breaches under certain conditions has been  introduced in the draft Regulation on the Protection of Personal Data (art. 31) in the context of the  overall Data Protection Reform Package3.  Both these legislative provisions constitute important developments with the potential to increase  the level of data security in Europe and foster reassurance amongst citizens on how their personal  data are being secured and protected by data controllers. As part of the effective implementation of  the data breach notification obligation, the Article 29 Working Party concluded, through its ePrivacy  and technology subgroups, that there is a serious need for the development of a methodology for  the assessment of the severity of personal data breaches. The discussions within the Article 29  Working Party are currently still ongoing.  The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) reviewed the already  existing measures and the procedures in EU Member States with regard to personal data breaches  and published in 2011 a report on the technical implementation of the Art. 4 of the ePrivacy  Directive4. A proposal of a methodology for personal data breach severity assessment was included  as an annex to that report, which was, however, not considered as mature enough to be used at  national level by the different Data Protection Authorities.  Against this background, the Data Protection Authorities of Greece and Germany in collaboration  with ENISA developed, based on the above mentioned work, an updated methodology for data  breach severity assessment that could be used both by DPAs as well as data controllers. This working  document is a first result of the co-operation between experts of the two DPAs and ENISA. It is  planed to further develop the methodology with the aim to generate a final practical tool for a data  breach severity assessment.  1.2 Objectives  The proposed methodology presented in this document has been designed with the following  objectives:   To provide data controllers with a quantitative tool (to the extent that this is possible) to assess  the severity of data breaches and accordingly notify the competent authorities as well as the  1  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0011:01:EN:HTML  2  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:173:SOM:EN:HTML  3  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  4  Recommendations on technical implementation guidelines of Article 4,  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/risks-and-data-breaches/dbn/art4_tech  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0011:01:EN:HTML http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:173:SOM:EN:HTML http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/risks-and-data-breaches/dbn/art4_tech  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  2  affected individuals. The tool could also serve as a means for data controllers to quickly  determine the necessary mitigation measures.   To provide the national competent authorities with a tool to assess the severity of the breaches  notified by the data controllers.   To support the national competent authorities in the process of performing detailed analyses  and statistics concerning the reported personal data breaches.   To contribute to the harmonization of the severity assessment of personal data breaches in the  European Union, by proposing a common methodology and severity scoring. This would be  especially important in the case of cross-border breaches.  1.3 Severity of data breaches  The severity of a personal data breach is defined, in the context of this methodology, as the  “estimation of the magnitude of potential impact on the individuals derived from the data  breach”.  As stipulated in Directive 2009/136/EC5 (recital (61)), the impact of a personal data breach may  include “for example, identity theft or fraud, physical harm, significant humiliation or damage to  reputation in connection with the provision of publicly available  communications  services  in  the  Community”.  With the use of this methodology the data controller is guided through the process by specific  quantitative criteria in order to make the overall assessment. The same criteria can be used by the  competent authorities, together with the information provided by the controller in the notification  form6, in order to make its own assessment of the breach.  It should be noted that the controller is applying the methodology using the information that is in  his/her possession at the time of the breach. In that sense, the methodology cannot always cover all  the possible casuistic, including likely impacts on specific groups of individuals or very special cases  that cannot be fully addressed under a general methodology. Therefore, it has to be reminded that  both, data controllers and competent authorities should put particular care when dealing with cases  that, because of their specificities, could not be rightly assessed using this methodology.  5  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0011:0036:en:PDF  6  An example of a template of a data breach notification form to the competent authorities is available in the  Appendix A of http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/risks-and-data- breaches/dbn/art4_tech  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0011:0036:en:PDF http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/risks-and-data-breaches/dbn/art4_tech http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/risks-and-data-breaches/dbn/art4_tech  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  3  2 Overview of the methodology  2.1 Criteria  The main criteria taken into account while assessing the severity of a personal data breach are:   Data Processing Context (DPC): Addresses the type of the breached data, together with a  number of factors linked to the overall context of processing.   Ease of Identification (EI): Determines how easily the identity of the individuals can be deduced  from the data involved in the breach.   Circumstances of breach (CB): Addresses the specific circumstances of the breach, which are  related to the type of the breach, including mainly the loss of security of the breached data, as  well as any involved malicious intent.  2.2 Calculation of the severity  Based on the above criteria, the approach of this methodology is the following:   DPC is at the core of the methodology and evaluates the criticality of a given data set in a  specific processing context.   EI is a correcting factor of the DPC. The overall criticality of a data processing can be reduced  depending on the value of EI. In other words, the lower the ease of identification is, the lower  gets the overall score. Therefore, the combination of the EI and DPC (multiplication) gives the  initial score of the severity (SE) of the data breach.   CB quantifies specific circumstances of the breach that may be present or not in a particular  situation. So, when present, CB can only add to the severity of a specific breach. For this reason  the initial score can be further adjusted by the CB.  Thus, the final score of the severity assessment can be extracted using the following formula:  In this way, in order for the controller to get the severity result, all three criteria should be scored.  The result belongs to a certain range of values which corresponds to one of the four severity levels:  low, medium, high and very high7. At the end of the assessment, other possibly relevant criteria  (number of individuals and unintelligibility of data) that have not been considered in the  methodology are evaluated and flagged to the competent authority when applicable.  It is essential to bear in mind that all scores and/or rankings used in this methodology were solely  set for the use within the severity formula. They are not meant to bear any significance to a  conclusion about the weighting or ranking of certain types of data in general, let alone an  indication to any legal consequences or precedents as to the use of this data for other purposes.  7  Severity levels will be explained in details in section 3.2.  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  4  3 Detailed description of scoring and severity levels  3.1 Scoring of the criteria  3.1.1 Data Processing Context (DPC)  In order to define the score for DPC, the data controller should follow the next steps:   Step 1: Definition and classification of the types of personal data  a) Define the types of the personal data involved in the breach.  b) Classify the data in at least one of the four categories: simple, behavioural, financial, and  sensitive data (these categories are explained in details in Annex 1). In this way a preliminary  basic DPC score is obtained.  The list of data types described under the four categories is not exhaustive; however most  data involved in real cases can be matched to at least one of the categories. Credentials are  not considered as a specific data category and should be handled based on the type of data  processed by the systems where they provide access to.   Step 2: Adjustment by contextual factors related to the data processing  c) Assess the occurrence of certain factors that could increase or decrease the basic score (data  volume, special characteristics of the controllers or the individuals, invalidity/inaccuracy of  data, public availability (before the breach), nature of data).  d) In case such factors exist, accordingly increase/decrease the basic score. Assessment Table 1  provides the adjustment scales per category of data, together with example cases that could  lead to lower/higher scores.  Please refer to the Annex 1 for a list of contextual factors and specific examples of DPC scoring.  Note: Even though, for the purpose of the methodology, four data categories are ranked, the  categorization itself is not to be seen as a general ranking of the types of data at hand. Much more,  additional contextual factors related to the data always need to be taken into account when  regarding the processing of a certain type of data. Therefore, the basic score is to be seen just as a  general indication of the criticality connected to a certain category of data and the DPC scoring of  any data type can always vary from 1 to 4.  If the data matches more than one category the above mentioned steps have to be followed for  each category applicable. In these cases the value to use for the overall calculation of the severity  will be the highest score reached.  If the controller chooses to alter the DPC basic score (within the range of Assessment Table 1), the  new score has to be supported by an explanation describing the particular contextual factors of the  breach and their influence.  3.1.2 Ease of identification (EI)  Ease of identification (EI) evaluates how easy it will be for a party who has access to the set of data  to univocally match them to a certain person.  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  5  For the purpose of this methodology we have defined four levels of EI (negligible, limited, significant  and maximum) with a linear increase in score. The lowest score is given when the possibility to  identify the individual is negligible, meaning that it is extremely difficult to match the data to a  particular person, but still it could be possible under certain conditions. The highest score is selected  when identification is possible directly from the data breached with no special research needed to  discover the individual’s identity. Annex 2 describes these levels in details.  When defining EI, it should be taken into account that identification may be directly (e.g. on the  basis of a given name) or indirectly (eg. on the basis of ID number) possible from the breached data,  but may also depend on the specific context of the breach. Therefore, certain identifiers may lead to  different EI scores according to the specific case of the breach.  Please refer to the Annex 2 for specific examples of EI scoring using common identifiers.  In addition, when defining EI the controller should take into account all the means likely reasonably  to be used by any person to identify the individuals. This includes information that is public, held or  obtained otherwise, including over the Internet, as well as possible cross-matching with other  sources than can be accessed by the data controller or a third party.  3.1.3 Circumstances of the breach (CB)  The elements that are considered under CB are the loss of security (confidentiality, integrity,  availability) and malicious intent and are complementary to DPC and EI, as follows:  Loss of confidentiality: Loss of confidentiality occurs when the information is accessed by parties  who are not authorized or don’t have a legitimate purpose to access it. The extent of loss of  confidentiality varies by the scope of disclosure, i.e. the potential number and type of parties that  may have unlawfully access to the information.  Loss of integrity: Loss of integrity occurs when the original information is altered and substitution of  data can be prejudicial for the individual. The most severe situation occurs when there are serious  possibilities that the altered data have been used in a way that could harm the individual.  Loss of availability: Loss of availability occurs when the original data cannot be accessed when there  is a need for it. It can be either temporal (data are recoverable but it will take a period of time and  this can be detrimental for the individual), or permanent (data cannot be recovered).  Malicious intent: This element examines whether the breach was due to an error or mistake, either  human or technical, or it was caused by an intentional action of malicious intent. Non malicious  breaches include cases of accidental loss, inadequate disposal, human error and software bug or  misconfiguration. Malicious breaches include cases of theft and hacking aiming to harm the  individuals (e.g. by exposing their personal data to unauthorised third parties). In other cases  malicious intent might include transfer of personal data to third parties for profit (e.g. selling of lists  of personal data). In some cases malicious intent could also be inferred from actions aiming to harm  the data controller (e.g. through stealing and exposing the personal data to unauthorized parties).  Malicious intent is a factor that increases the likelihood that the data is used in harmful way, since  this was the initial purpose of the breach.  With regard to CB scoring, contrary to DPC and EI where the maximum score reached is chosen, the  points obtained for each CB element are added to obtain the final score, as different circumstances  can occur in the same breach. Assessment Table 3 provides different scores per CB element and for  different types of circumstances.  Please refer to the Annex 3 for specific examples of CB scoring.  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  6  3.2 Definition of severity level  As introduced in the Section 2.2, the overall severity (SE) is calculated by the following formula:  The final score shows the level of severity of a certain breach, taking into account the impact to the  individuals8.  3.3 Flags  Once the severity level has been defined, it can be accompanied by flags indicating certain elements  of the breach that, although they do not affect a priori the scoring, they are important for the final  assessment. For the purpose of the methodology, two flags have been considered:  Number of individuals breached exceeds 100. Data of an individual, breached in the context of a  bigger incident, can potentially be more easily disclosed, whereas at the same time a high number of  affected individuals influences the overall scale of the breach.  Data unintelligible. Unintelligibility (e.g. in the form of strong encryption and without key  compromise) can substantially decrease the impact to individuals, since it highly decreases the  possibility of unauthorized parties accessing the data.  8 Table setting the levels of severity of a data breach was first introduced in the “Recommendations  on technical implementation guidelines of Article 4”, page 24, but has been made more precise in  this document.  Severity of a data breach  SE < 2  Low Individuals either will not be affected or may encounter a few  inconveniences, which they will overcome without any problem (time  spent re-entering information, annoyances, irritations, etc.).  2 ≤ SE < 3 Medium Individuals may encounter significant inconveniences, which they will  be able to overcome despite a few difficulties (extra costs, denial of  access to business services, fear, lack of understanding, stress, minor  physical ailments, etc.).  3 ≤ SE< 4 High Individuals may encounter significant consequences, which they should  be able to overcome albeit with serious difficulties (misappropriation of  funds, blacklisting by banks, property damage, loss of employment,  subpoena, worsening of health, etc.).  4 ≤ SE  Very High Individuals may encounter significant, or even irreversible,  consequences, which they may not overcome (financial distress such as  substantial debt or inability to work, long-term psychological or  physical ailments, death, etc.).  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  7  4 Use of the methodology  4.1.1 Notification to competent authorities  The severity level of the breach (together with the flags), as calculated through this methodology,  could be integrated in the notification sent by the controller to the competent authorities. This can  be done either automatically in the notification template or through the use of a standalone tool.  The competent authorities will be free to evaluate the result (using the same template/tool and the  information provided by the controller) and accept it or reject it, following their own assessment.  If for some reason the final severity level is deemed to be incorrect by the data controller, it could be  possible for the controller to state the “correct” level, including his/her arguments for the different  result, in a free text box (ex. integrated in the notification form). Moreover, any change in the default  score for the DPC criterion should also be explained by the controller using a free text box. These  boxes could also be used to leave comments without changing the severity level.  4.1.2 Notification to the individuals  The severity level could be used by the controller and the competent authority to determine if there  is a need to notify the individuals. The level upon which notification should be deemed necessary  could be mutually accepted by all competent authorities or vary depending national-wide criteria.  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  8  5 Closing remarks  On the previous pages we have presented a working document on our proposed methodology for  assessing data breaches. This proposal ultimately aims towards being integrated into a notification  template (such as in ENISA’s Recommendations for the technical implementation of the Art.4 of the  ePrivacy Directive9) to achieve an as far as possible automated severity assessment.  The methodology presented in this study is based on an as objective approach as possible whilst still  being flexible enough to be adopted by various Data Protection Authorities by adjusting it to their  size, national legal system and other factors. According to different requirements, the scoring of  some categories can be adjusted to produce the most appropriate results:   Data processing context can be adjusted according to the importance of data (simple,  behavioural, financial etc.) assigned by the specific DPA   Ease of identification can take into account the reality in a given country and its legal system  (public availability of personal numbers, names, addresses etc.)   Circumstances of a breach offer the highest flexibility to adjust the final result to the needs  of a DPA   Flags can either be adjusted (for example in function of records breached), complemented  by new ones or moved to the CB (circumstances of a breach) table.  ENISA and the DPAs of Greece and Germany aim at further developing the work presented in this  document with the final scope of publishing a practical data breach severity tool that can be useful  both for the DPAs and the data controllers across the EU.  9  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/risks-and-data-breaches/dbn/art4_tech  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/risks-and-data-breaches/dbn/art4_tech  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  9  Annex 1 – Data processing context  A1 Assessment tables  Table 1: Data Processing Context (DPC)  Score  Simple data Eg. biographical data, contact details, full name, data on education, family life, professional experience, etc.  Preliminary basic score: when the breach involves ‘’simple data’’ and the controller is not aware of any aggravating factors.  1  The DPC score could be increased by 1, e.g. when the volume of “simple data” and/or the characteristics of the controller are such that certain profiling of the  individual can be enabled or assumptions about the individual’s social/financial status can be made.  2  The DPC score could be by 2, e.g. when the “simple data” and/or the characteristics of the controller can lead to assumptions about the individual’s health status,  sexual preferences, political or religious beliefs.  3  The DPC score could be increased by 3, e.g. when due to certain characteristics of the individual (e.g. vulnerable groups, minors), the information can be critical for  their personal safety or physical/psychological conditions.  4  Behavioural data Eg. location, traffic data, data on personal preferences and habits, etc.  Preliminary basic score: when the breach involves ‘’behavioural data’’ and the controller is not aware of any aggravating or lessening factors.  2  The DPC score could be decreased by 1, e.g. when the nature of the data set does not provide any substantial insight to the individual’s behavioural information or  the data can be collected easily (independently from the breach) through publicly available sources (e.g. combination of information from web searches).  1  The DPC score can be increased by 1, e.g. when the volume of “behavioural data” and/or the characteristics of the controller are such that a profile of the individual  can be created, exposing detailed information about his/her everyday life and habits.  3  The DPC score can be increased by 2, e.g. if a profile based on individual’s sensitive data can be created.  4  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  10  Financial data Any type of financial data (e.g. income, financial transactions, bank statements, investments, credit cards, invoices, etc.). Includes social welfare data related to financial  information.  Preliminary basic score: when the breach involves ‘’financial data’’ and the controller is not aware of any aggravating or lessening factors.  3  The DPC score could be decreased by 2, e.g. when the nature of the data set does not provide any substantial insight to the individual’s financial information (e.g.  the fact that a person is the customer of a certain bank without further details).  1  The DPC score could be decreased by 1, e.g. when the specific data set includes some financial information but still does not provide any significant insight to the  individual’s financial status/situation (e.g. simple bank account numbers without further details).  2  The DPC score could be increased by 1, e.g. when due to the nature and/or volume of the specific data set, full financial (e.g. credit card) information is disclosed  that could enable fraud or an detailed social/financial profile is created.  4  Sensitive data Any type of sensitive data (e.g. health, political affiliation, sexual life)  Preliminary basic score: when the breach involves ‘sensitive data’’ and the controller is not aware of any lessening factors.  4  The DPC score could be decreased by 1, e.g. when the nature of the data set does not provide any substantial insight to the individual’s behavioural information or  the data can be collected easily (independently from the breach) through publicly available sources (e.g. combination of information from web searches).  1  The DPC score could be decreased by 2, e.g. when nature of data can lead to general assumptions.  2  The DPC score could be decreased by 1, e.g. when nature of data can lead to assumptions about sensitive information. 3  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  11  A2 Description of contextual factors to be considered in DPC scoring  Increasing factors:   The volume of the breached data (for the same individual): this factor can increase the basic  DPC score, due to the increment of the quantity of the breached information (i.e. acting as  aggravating factor). The volume should be considered both in terms of time (e.g. same type of  data over a certain period of time) and content (complementing data of the same type). For  example, in case of a breach of traffic data at an ISP, the DPC score would be higher (for the  same individual) if the data cover a period of one year than if they are limited to one week  (time). As another example, in case of a breach at a bank, the DPC score of the complete file of  an individual would be higher than that of a single document from the same file (content).   Special characteristics of the data controller: this factor relates to the field of operation and the  activities of the data controller, which could increase the basic DPC score of the data, revealing  additional information for a certain data set. For example, the DPC score of a customers’ list  would be higher if it comes from an online pharmacy than from a stationery shop.   Special characteristics of the individuals: the basic DPC score of a certain data set could also be  increased in case that the individuals belong to a social group with particular needs (e.g. minors,  individuals of a particular group with special characteristics). For example, the DPC score of a list  of telephone numbers would increase if it concerns known members of the national parliament.  Decreasing factors:   Invalidity/inaccuracy of the data: the basic DPC score of a certain data set can be decreased if  the invalidity or inaccuracy of the data is known to the controller (e.g. due to their age or  content) and, thus, their significance is reduced. The controller needs to be certain of this  circumstance to include it in the assessment. For example a postal service’s list of addresses  where letters could not be delivered would be considered as inaccurate (i.e. most probably the  individuals have moved to another address).   Public availability: the basic DPC score of a data set can also be decreased in case the breached  data were already publicly available before the breach or can be easily collected and/or accessed  through publicly available sources.   Nature of data: another decreasing factor could in some cases be the very nature of a particular  data set that, despite its initial DPC scoring, is of lower significance, in terms of the information  that it can reveal about the individual. This is, for example, the case of a medical certificate that  is just certifying that the individual is in a good state of health without disclosing any other  information. In this case, although the basic score would be 4 due to health data being sensitive  data, the specific data set’s final DPC score would be 1, as it cannot per se affect the individual’s  personal life. This factor, however, should be considered with great care and clear explanation of  the reason why a particular data processing  is by nature lower than its basic DPC score.  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  12  A3 Examples of DPC scoring/adjustment per category of data  Simple data  Example 1: List of names and telephone numbers   Case 1: the list is the customer list of a supermarket/restaurant.

Score = 2 (no alteration due to contextual factors)   Case 3: the data come from an ISP and include subscribers’ call history of the last year.  Score = 3 (a detailed profile of the individual can be created).   Case 4: the data come from a psychological support centre for people suffering from a  serious illness and includes incoming calls.  Score = 4 (by characteristics of controller disclosing health status).  Example 2: Data in a fidelity card   Case 1: the card is from a supermarket and includes only the number of points gained from  purchases.  Score = 1 (by nature of the data set).   Case 2: the card is from a supermarket and includes information on purchase history for  the last month.  Score = 2 (no alteration due to contextual factors).   Case 3: the data come from a transportation card and includes information about  location/movements over the last year.  Score = 3 (a detailed profile of the individual can be created).   Case 4: the card is from a pharmacy and includes information on recent purchases of  medical products.  Score = 4 (by nature of data set disclosing sensitive data).

Score= 4 (leads to detailed profiling related to sensitive data).  Financial data  Example 1: Bank statements   Case 1: the data come from a bank and include only a letter, through which the individual is  identified as a client without providing any information about the specific relations between  the client and the bank (e.g. only his/her name and address but no account number or  information about transactions).  Score = 1 (by nature of the data set).   Case 2: the data come from a bank and include only a transactions history of one day  without further details (e.g. account number, name and transaction).  Score = 2 (by nature of data, info that can lead to limited information about financial  behaviour).   Case 3: the data come from a bank and concern account balances of clients of the last  month.  Score = 3 (no alteration due to contextual factors).   Case 4: the data come from a bank and include account balances of clients of the last year,  showing all transactions and related with them details.  Score = 4 (by volume and nature of data leading to profiling)  Example 2: Income declaration   Case 1: the data contains a statement to confirm that the individual has submitted his/her  income declaration.

Example 3: Credit card information   Case 1: the data come from a bank and contain credit card details of individuals but these  data are more than ten years old and therefore these cards are not valid.  Score = 1 (by age of the data set).   Case 2: the data come from an online shop and contain some credit card information of  individuals, but not the necessary set of details to perform financial transactions.  Score = 2 (by nature of data, info that can lead to limited information about financial status).  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  15   Case 3: the data come from a bank and contain some credit card information of  individuals, but not the necessary set of details to perform financial transactions.

Identification can be direct or indirect and is performed with the use of certain identifiers, taking  also into account the overall context of the processing of personal data. The next examples show a  (non-exhaustive) list of common identifiers and different cases of their possible use for EI scoring.  It should be noted that in many cases the breach will include a combination of different identifiers,  which automatically increases the ease of identification. This is a very important element that should  be taken into account by the controller and is reflected in the examples below.  Full name (first name, surname)  It is considered as the most common direct identifier but EI score may vary depending on the case,  since the full name does not always in itself uniquely single out the individual. For example, when  identification is performed using only the individual’s full name:   EI = 0,25 (Negligible) throughout a country’s population where many people share that same full  name   EI = 0,5 (Limited) throughout a country’s population where few people share that same full  name.   EI = 0,75 (Significant) throughout a small city’s population where few or no people share that  same full name.   EI=1 (Maximum) throughout a country’s population using also date of birth and email address.  ID card/passport/social security number  They are all considered as unique identifiers and they can be used to single out the individual, as  long as it is possible to link them to a reference database (e.g. linking an ID card to a particular  person). For example, when identification is performed using only one of these numbers:   EI=0,25 (Negligible) when no other information is provided about the individual or it is not  possible to find additional information unless access to the reference database is obtained   EI=0,75 (Significant) when the identifier reveals additional identification information about the  individual (e.g. social security number revealing date of birth) and is linked to other data (e.g.  postal address or email).   EI=1 (Maximum) when information from the reference database is also available (e.g. ID card  and full name and/or picture).  Telephone number/Home address  They are both indirect identifiers, which can also be used to communicate with or access the  individual. When identification is based only on one of these two identifiers:   EI=0,25 (Negligible) throughout a country’s population when the number/address is not  registered in a publicly available register.   EI=0,5 (Limited) throughout a small city’s population and the number/address is not  registered in a publicly available register (identification possible through communication).    EI=1 (Maximum) throughout a country’s population and the number/address is included in  publicly available register.  Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal  data breaches  Working Document, v1.0, December 2013  Page  18  Email address  It is also an indirect identifier, which can be used to communicate with the individual and in some  cases it may include information about his/her name (first name and/or surname). When  identification is based on email:   EI=0,25 (Negligible) when the email address does not reveal any other identification  information (e.g. name) and is not used as a primary address of the individual in internet  sites, forums or social networks.   EI=0,75 (Significant) when the email address does not reveal any other identification  information (e.g. name) but is used as a primary address of the individual in internet sites,  forums or social networks (searchable on the web).   EI=1 (Maximum) when the email address reveals the individual’s name and is used as his/her  primary address in internet sites, forums or social networks (searchable on the web).  Picture  It may be a direct or indirect identifier, depending on the case. For example, when identification is  based only on a picture:   EI=0.25 (Negligible) when the picture is unclear or vague (e.g. CCTV footage from a long  distance).   EI=05 (Limited) when the picture is unclear or vague but it includes additional information  (e.g. surroundings that show a specific location) that could lead to the identification of the  individual.   EI=0,75 (Significant) when the picture is clear but no other identification information is  linked to it.   EI=1 (Maximum) when the picture is clear and linked to some additional information (e.g.  information about membership to a specific group, home address, etc).  Coding/Aliases/Initials  Coding refers to the assignment of a unique ID number to each individual, e.g. in the context of a  specific database. The use of aliases is a form of pseudonymisation, in the sense that a specific  identifier (usually the individual’s full name) is substituted by an alias (pseudonym). The initials are a  type of alias that is extracted from the full name of the individual. Like in the case of unique  identifiers, codes and aliases can be used to identify the individual as long as it is possible to link  them to a reference database (e.g. linking the code/alias to the full name of  a particular person)  When identification is based on coding or use of aliases:   EI=0,25 (Negligible) when the code/alias does not reveal and cannot be linked to any other  personal data about the individual unless access to the reference database is obtained.   EI=0,75 (Significant) when the alias reveals some data about the individual (e.g. first name)  and is linked to other personal data (e.g. the individual’s email address).   EI=1 (Maximum) when the alias reveals the individual’s full name or data from the reference  database are also available.

    "abstract": "The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) reviewed the existing measures and the procedures in EU Member States with regard to personal data breaches and published in 2011 a study on the technical implementation of the Art. 4 of the ePrivacy Directive, which included recommendations on how to plan and prepare for data breaches, how to detect and assess them, how to notify individuals and competent authorities and how to respond to data breaches. A proposal of a methodology for personal data breach severity assessment was also included as an annex to the above-mentioned recommendations, which was, however, not considered mature enough to be used at national level by the different Data Protection Authorities. Against this background, the Data Protection Authorities of Greece and Germany in collaboration with ENISA developed, based on the above mentioned work, an updated methodology for data breach severity assessment that could be used both by DPAs as well as data controllers. This working document is a first result of the co-operation between experts of the two DPAs and ENISA. It is planned to further develop the methodology with the aim to generate a final practical tool for a data breach severity assessment."

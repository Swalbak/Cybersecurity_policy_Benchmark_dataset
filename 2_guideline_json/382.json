INTRODUCTION  The importance of innovation to ensuring economic growth in the European Union is such that  facilitating, favouring and fostering it is critical. In this respect, start-ups and young companies  play a key role. For them, the Network and Information Security (NIS) sector is a particular area  of focus.  The cybersecurity sector has a strong annual growth rate, as the worldwide market for  information security is expected to reach €145 billion by 2020.1  This growth trend was confirmed by many stakeholders of the sector that were engaged for this  study and justifies the attention given to this market. This study intends to provide useful  information to NIS start-ups and SMEs in order to support their growth.  Information for this study was collected via desk research and interviews with 20 experts,  including 10 founders of NIS start-ups and 10 contributors of funding channels or national  or European bodies such as Venture Capital, incubators, accelerators, public institutions etc.  The target audience of this report comprises NIS start-ups and SMEs, as well as entrepreneurs  interested in entering the NIS domain. This report intends to help such companies in:   understanding the start-up landscape from a technological and market perspective and  determining what is currently established in the EU related to NIS products and services;   gaining insight into the investment and funding channels available for NIS start-ups from  both the public and private sector;   identifying the main challenges they may face in their endeavour and ways in which they  can address them   building knowledge of the opportunities for growth of the EU NIS start-up market within  the context of current EU policy frameworks, at all stages of evolution for start-ups.  1 Source: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevemorgan/2015/12/20/cybersecurity%E2%80%8B-%E2%80%8Bmarket-reaches- 75-billion-in-2015%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B-%E2%80%8Bexpected-to-reach-170-billion-by-2020/#66f1983c10c3  The  cybersecurity  sector has a  strong annual  growth rate, as  the worldwide  market for  information  security is  expected to  reach €145  billion by 2020.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevemorgan/2015/12/20/cybersecurity%E2%80%8B-%E2%80%8Bmarket-reaches-75-billion-in-2015%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B-%E2%80%8Bexpected-to-reach-170-billion-by-2020/#66f1983c10c3 https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevemorgan/2015/12/20/cybersecurity%E2%80%8B-%E2%80%8Bmarket-reaches-75-billion-in-2015%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B-%E2%80%8Bexpected-to-reach-170-billion-by-2020/#66f1983c10c3  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  5  2. NIS START-UPS IN THE EU  2.1 GROWTH PHASES FOR NIS START-UPS  An understanding of the different growth phases for a start-up is essential to the task of  identifying the disparate challenges faced by NIS start-ups during these phases. As well as  variance by phase of growth, these challenges may also vary depending on the level of  development of the start-up from the initial idea, on the number of pivots2 performed and on the  number of funding iterations required to support growth.  Based on both desk research3 and information given by experts that we interviewed for this  study we have defined the successive start-up growth phases from Idea to IPO (Initial Public  Offering) illustrated in Figure 1, mapped to the evolution of the start-up revenue plotted against  time.  The idea or inception phase corresponds to the start of a project to create a product or service  accompanied by an entrepreneurial ambition to target this product at a relatively big market.  The seed stage is the formalisation of the initial idea. Vision and mission are determined, and a  first version of the business plan is built even though not yet mature, key milestones are  foreseen to measure and validate important indicators such as growth or customer interest.  At the end of seed stage is the valley of death, a period when the start-up is still not profitable  but needs to make more investments to allow its growth and its transition to early stage.  2 Typically, \"pivot\" refers to change/correction of the business model due to sub-par results or in order to discover additional  growth  3 Source: https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/271290  http://www.startupcommons.org/startup-development-phases.html  https://startupxplore.com/en/blog/types-startup-investing/  Figure 1: NIS start-ups growth phases linked with the start-up project life cycle  https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/271290 http://www.startupcommons.org/startup-development-phases.html https://startupxplore.com/en/blog/types-startup-investing/  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  6  During the early stage4 the start-up has measurable growth in users, revenues and market  share. Customers are present in the whole country and further expansion is planned.  At the later growth stage5, or scaling phase, the start-up focuses on KPIs (Key Performance  Indicators) to measure growth in users, revenues and/or market share in a big or fast-growing  target market.  The break-even point corresponds to the point when the revenues match the spending  needs and the start-up is starting to make profit.  Overall, there is a collective agreement on the definition of the different stages of start-up  growth throughout the world, even though some differences in vocabulary can occur in Europe  and other countries (e.g. the US).  2.2 NIS START-UPS MAIN OFFERS  To be able to draw trends and conclusions about the NIS start-up landscape in the EU, several  start-up maps and studies were included in the review6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. A key objective was to  identify the topics addressed by start-ups and to determine whether the offerings are primarily  product or service-based.  Product refers to a tangible offer that can be provided by start-ups, e.g. a software or a physical  platform.  Service refers to a type of offer where no transfer of ownership is performed; rather services  are offered (except services, such as consulting, integration etc., which complement a product).  Estimates have showed that approximately ¾ of NIS start-ups offer products14 with the majority  of the remainder offering a service or a combination of services and products.15 Only very few  start-ups are exclusively oriented at services, such as bug bounty or cloud security services  (based on a subscription fee).  Determining what kind of offer a start-up provides proved to be a difficult exercise as boundaries  are thin. First, start-up business models are not always fully mature as they often adapt them to  their first clients. For example, they can adapt to their client’s need and offer two modes of  billing: direct sale of the product or a subscription in the form of a monthly or yearly service.  Secondly, some start-ups have a hybrid model with both product and service offers. For  example, they have a product-oriented business model but propose additional consulting or  monitoring services.16.  4 Also named as series A, B funding rounds  5 Also known as series C funding round  6 http://europeanstartupmonitor.com/fileadmin/esm_2016/report/ESM_2016.pdf  7 Boston local initiatives http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2016/04/20/boston-cybersecurity-map-shows-deep-diverse-local- sector/  8 https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/periodic-table-cybersecurity-start-ups/  9 https://whatsthebigdata.com/2016/09/19/cybersecurity-market-map/  10 https://www.wavestone.com/app/uploads/2017/07/Radar-des-startups-cybersecurite-en-France-2017.pdf  11 Bessemer Venture Partners https://www.bvp.com/sites/default/files/files/strategy- resource/Israel%20Cybersecurity%20Landscape%20January%202017.pdf  12 http://www.bpifrance-lehub.fr/mapping-french-start-ups-in-cybersecurity/  13 http://cybersecurityventures.com/cybersecurity-500/  14  Investors often support more product-focused companies vs. service-oriented. https://ipacso.eu/about/project- ipasco/ipacso-advisory-board/33-ipacso-innovation-process-themes/market/market-analysis/trends-and-challenges/218- investment-trends.html  15 From the Wavestone radar panel of European start-ups (about 200+ start-ups)  16 For example, some start-ups have a product-oriented business model but propose additional consulting or monitoring  services.

Figure 2 and Table 1 NIS categories derived from the NIS start-ups maps analysis show the  split of the topics addressed from our panel of 270+ EU NIS start-up maps as well as the 18  main categories of topics on which start-ups base their business were identified.

Mature cybersecurity topics still represent the greatest  market share as cyber threats against traditional IT are constantly evolving. Among identified  key topics addressed by NIS start-ups, the following topics stand out19 (see Figure 3):   Identity and access management   network and endpoint security   data security  17  Investors often support more product-focused companies vs. service-oriented. https://ipacso.eu/about/project- ipasco/ipacso-advisory-board/33-ipacso-innovation-process-themes/market/market-analysis/trends-and-challenges/218- investment-trends.html  18 From the Wavestone radar panel of European start-ups (about 200+ start-ups)  19 Forrester, The Top Security Technology Trends To Watch, 2017, Tools And Technology: The S&R Practice Playbook by  Merritt Maxim, Jeff Pollard, Amy DeMartine, Nick Hayes, Joseph Blankenship, Josh Zelonis, Andras Cser, April 2017  Figure 2: EU NIS start-ups trends derived from the NIS start-up maps analysis  https://ipacso.eu/about/project-ipasco/ipacso-advisory-board/33-ipacso-innovation-process-themes/market/market-analysis/trends-and-challenges/218-investment-trends.html https://ipacso.eu/about/project-ipasco/ipacso-advisory-board/33-ipacso-innovation-process-themes/market/market-analysis/trends-and-challenges/218-investment-trends.html https://ipacso.eu/about/project-ipasco/ipacso-advisory-board/33-ipacso-innovation-process-themes/market/market-analysis/trends-and-challenges/218-investment-trends.html  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  8   vulnerability and threat intelligence.  Even though these topics are considered as mature, there is still room for innovation. Traditional  products and services are nowadays enhanced by additional technologies bringing more  intelligence into security operations, analytics and reporting platforms, through machine  learning, analytics and AI.20  2.3 EMERGING TOPICS FOR NIS START-UPS  There are also new emerging cybersecurity and market segments appearing that are driving the  adaptation of the cybersecurity market, by fostering the creation of response capabilities from  NIS start-ups in anticipation of the emergence of new threats. Such capabilities can address  either new usage (such as cloud, blockchain or IoT) or new trends (such as forensics,  deceptions).  Following are some of the main emerging cybersecurity segments that NIS start-ups address:   Deceptions – which is an innovative technique to mislead and confuse attackers, causing  them to take (or not take) specific actions that help cyber security defences, a more  sophisticated version of the traditional \"honeypots\";   Behavioural Biometrics21 – where using new innovative ways of verifying the identity of a  person such as a complex mix of mouse dynamics (rhythm, click patterns…), keystroke  dynamics (length, rhythm…) and the users’ GUI22 interaction (frequency, navigation) brings a  higher level of security as those behavioural patterns are hard to steal compared to classic  biometrics (fingerprints for example);   Post Quantum Cryptography – provides the next-generation type of encryption whilst  many popular encryption and signature schemes will be breakable by quantum computers;   Awareness – innovative ways to train and alert employees or customers about  cybersecurity threats such as role games and online exercises;   Industrial Security and Industrial IoT – refers to security of Industry 4.0 e.g. security of  intelligent, connected devices in factories;   NIS products/services built on Automation – which is an advanced response to  automated cyberattacks either at the prevention level e.g. to roll-out security patches or at the  detection level e.g. to automate incident responses.  20 See https://www.cbinsights.com/research/cybersecurity-ai-startups-threat-trends/  22 Graphical User Interface  Figure 3: Top 10 EU NIS start-ups categories consolidated from NIS start-ups map sources  https://www.cbinsights.com/research/cybersecurity-ai-startups-threat-trends/  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  9   NIS products/services based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) - by implementing AI and  machine learning techniques which allow faster detection and remediation for real-time  Information System monitoring.  In addition to these market trends, the impacts of regulation must be considered in the EU.  Indeed, regulations play a large part in governing demand. This will continue in the  coming years both at European level (GDPR, NIS) and at local level (national enforcement  laws) and will be an area where innovation will play a key role in building potential market  share for NIS start-ups.  According to the results of the study, the main topics that will need to be addressed regarding  GDPR are:   anonymization, which aims at sanitizing data to remove any personally identified information  or to encrypt data;   consent management where consumers will establish consent directives to determine who  will access their private data.  The market is not yet mature in providing tools to respond to these needs. For instance, the  sector of anonymization has been little explored by start-ups according the NIS start-ups maps  and is likely to rise with the GDPR coming into force in 2018.  The NIS Directive implies additional compliance and will be required in mature functions and  processes such as network and infrastructure security, with key aspects on securing  administration and ensuring network segregation in the Information System. There is also a  focus on industrial Smart Infrastructure security already been identified by start-ups as  Industrial SI security and IOT in the Top 10 and is promising to be a key area where the  demand will rise.  These trends were already partially identified and anticipated through Horizon 2020 with call for  tenders in 2017 targeting the following subjects23:   Cryptography   Advanced Threats   Privacy   Data protection   Prevention, detection, response and mitigation of the combination of physical and cyber  threats to the critical infrastructure of Europe.  23 http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-security_en.pdf  Regulations play  a large part in  governing  demand. This  will continue in  the coming years  both at European  and local level  and will be an  area where  innovation will  play a key role in  building  potential market  share for NIS  start-ups.  http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-security_en.pdf  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  10  3. FUNDING AND INVESTMENT  CHANNELS  3.1 OVERVIEW  Start-up capital can come in different forms in the successive growth stages and NIS start-ups  should be aware of the different options available to them. The provision of capital can be made  by various actors, each of which have specific expectations in return. As per expert’s  explanation, the following types of funding can be considered:  1. Equity capital. As defined by Business dictionary24, this represents funds invested in the new  business, and contrasts with debt capital, which is not repaid to the investors in the normal course of  business. It represents the risk capital staked by the owners through purchase of a company's stock.  It includes venture capital and corporate venture.  2. Non-equity capital, which can take different forms such as grants and subsidies25 , tax  incentives26  Figure 4 illustrates the funding and investment channel ecosystem: financing cycle and  associated amount of funding per stage, funding and investment channels providing non-  equity or equity financing, other stakeholders “more than money support” providing support  to start-ups other than funding; and whilst presenting also the start-up project cycle.  24 http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/equity-capital.html  25 These grants are monetary awards that do not obligate the entrepreneur financially. The start-up will receive the grant as  a subsidy to launch the business. If there are no financial obligations associated, other duties must be observed e.g. to  maintain accurate bookkeeping, use the funding as directed etc. A grant may derive its funding from both government and  private sector sources in the form of a joint venture.  26 They are established most of the time by governments to encourage investments in specific sectors. Start-ups can  benefit from a cut on R&D costs, on social charges and on corporate taxes. Investors who invest in start-ups and innovation  can also benefit from cuts in charges which can lead to turning the investment riskless, as the funds invested would have  been otherwise spent in paying taxes.  http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/equity-capital.html  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  11  Figure 4: Funding channels stakeholders at each stage of the start-up development  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  12  3.2 PRIVATE FUNDING AND INVESTMENT  Private investment and funding channels stakeholders can provide either equity  financing which is the case for founders, love money, corporate ventures/large groups and  venture capitals and non-equity financing which is the case with angels and banks through  loans.  Access to funds is mostly difficult or very difficult for all types of private funds except  from the founders’ money (see Figure 5)27.  On top of the category of investment and funding channels, we identified the following types of  stakeholders investing in NIS start-ups:   investors specialised in cybersecurity – who provide additional support due to their deep  knowledge of the market. Accelerators specialised in cybersecurity are very efficient for  connecting the start-up to the ecosystem (investors and clients) and getting the business  started.   investors non-specialised in cybersecurity – who view cybersecurity like other ICT topics.   private stakeholders that provide support other than funding to NIS start-ups or “more  than money support” - who are private incubators, private accelerators and corporate open  innovation in large companies.  While looking at alternative ways of private funding on a future-looking perspective, ICO (Initial  Coin Offering)28 recently appears as a potential new means of funding for start-ups, whose  sustainability and efficiency are still to be proven in the long term.29  27 Note: crowdfunding does not appear in Figure 5 above as our study led us to understand that crowdfunding is difficult to  implement for a BtoB business model, which is the model of the majority of cybersecurity start-ups. The BtoB model  consists of selling goods to other companies (and not directly to the consumer), this makes it difficult to raise sufficient  interest in the public at large. Cybersecurity start-ups also offer solutions to technical problems that are hard to promote to  the general population, which is why crowdfunding is not successful in that domain.  28 http://www.journaldunet.com/economie/finance/1195462-ico-initial-coin-offering/  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/business/dealbook/coin-digital-currency.html  29  This type of fundraising is similar to crowdfunding where a company sells tokens on a dedicated platform and then,  investors will benefit from the company via dividend payments.

National authorities in charge of cybersecurity, which have developed in the EU, can raise  cybersecurity awareness amongst citizens and the entire NIS market by highlighting and  explaining key issues to the start-up ecosystem30. In addition, they can provide technical  expertise to the NIS start-ups when developing products to ensure they meet the nation’s  requirements.  Tax incentives or national or regional funding mechanisms can also support start-ups  through tax incentives or grants.  3.4 EU FUNDING MECHANISMS  There are a number of European institutions and programs supporting NIS development  with the main goal to ensure cyber protection for all: citizens, companies (including SMEs) and  public administration by supporting the development of an EU cybersecurity industry31 32 33.   The EC created and signed a cybersecurity contractual Public-Private Partnership  (cPPP) with ECSO (European Cyber Security Organisation) with the aim to stimulate the  cybersecurity industry by bridging the gap between different stakeholders and by aligning  cybersecurity products and solutions with demand.   The Horizon 202034 Research and Innovation programme focuses on several  cybersecurity topics35.There are national contact-points (NCP) 36 in EU member states to  provide guidance and practical support and information for start-ups wanting to apply for  Horizon 2020 funding.   Existing EU initiatives to favour start-up development, such as Start-up Europe37, the  European Innovation Council (EIC) pilot38 and “Europe’s next leaders: the Start-up and  Scale-up Initiative.   Other financial instruments provided by the EU, e.g. European Structural and Investment  (ESI) Fund39.  It seems that very few start-ups or funding channels are effectively using EU funding mechanisms. The main  reasons behind this are the lack of knowledge of the EU funding mechanisms available, the difficulty in  accessing this funding and the unwillingness of start-ups to divert resources from their main business to  develop and submit a funding application or proposal.  30 This supports building trust with private investors by explaining the cybersecurity market, as technical products and  services are more difficult to understand - funding channels do not often have the cybersecurity experts in their team  necessary to fully understand the NIS ecosystem.  31 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/cybersecurity-industry  32 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1496330315823&uri=CELEX:52017DC0228  33 http://ec.europa.eu/research/sam/pdf/sam_cybersecurity_report.pdf  34 https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/h2020-sections  35 There are national contact-points (NCP) in EU member states to provide guidance and practical support and information  for parties wanting to apply for Horizon 2020 funding.  36 http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/support/national_contact_points.html  37https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/start-up-europe  http://start-upeuropeclub.eu/about-us/  38 https://ec.europa.eu/research/eic/  39 Source: ENISA conference \"Funding mechanisms for cybersecurity SMEs\" presented by EU Commission in March 2017  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/cybersecurity-industry http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1496330315823&uri=CELEX:52017DC0228 http://ec.europa.eu/research/sam/pdf/sam_cybersecurity_report.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/h2020-sections http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/support/national_contact_points.html https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/startup-europe http://startupeuropeclub.eu/about-us/ https://ec.europa.eu/research/eic/  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  14  3.5 MORE-THAN-MONEY SUPPORT  The expression “more than money” perfectly captures the philosophy that funding alone is no  longer a sufficient means for ensuring success. There are several areas of interest for fostering  the growth of NIS start-ups:  1. Developing working synergies between start-ups and companies is essential to build  trust for NIS start-ups and to initiate the commercial relationship, as business relationship  between start-ups and large companies are still too weak.  2. Developing the action of \"trusted third parties\", which acts as an interface between  large private corporate groups, public stakeholders, start-ups and schools / universities to  bridge the different parties and accelerate the transfer of mutual skills amongst the  different stakeholders and developing “open innovation” in large corporates.  3. Ensuring the right talent is available to NIS start-ups from creation to later growth is  also key.  4. Building a strong networking enables start-ups to bridge with the NIS ecosystem.  Numerous  stakeholders of  the ecosystem  are offering  support to start- up founders in  diverse ways -  not only  financial.  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  15  4. OPPORTUNITIES AND OBSTACLES  Through our interviews of experts and our desk research, we identified a number of specific  challenges and opportunities faced by NIS start-ups in their development within the EU. The  primary challenges identified by the panel of experts are presented in Figure 6.  Overall, the challenges and opportunities for NIS start-ups in the EU are presented in the  following across 3 dimensions:   Challenges and opportunities related to funding   Challenges and opportunities specifically related to the NIS sector   Challenges and opportunities related to other factors  Figure 6: NIS start-ups panel main challenges in growing and funding a business from panel  Figure 7: Opportunities and obstacles linked to funding mechanisms  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  16  Figure 8: NIS sector specific opportunities and obstacles  Figure 9: Opportunities and obstacles due to other factors  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  17  Among the challenges identified for NIS start-ups in the EU, a few stand-out and are worth  exploring in more detail:  Challenge to penetrate the Business-to-Business (BtoB) market   Networking and building visibility around the start-up to win the first contract is often  challenging. In several EU countries, the lack of an innovation network bridging start-ups and  companies is still an obstacle in building synergies between them.   Start-ups often have difficulties in understanding the customers’ expectations or assessing  correctly the market maturity and hence do not offer NIS products or services that meet a  real need in the market that would attract investors. NIS start-ups also have difficulty  integrating their product/service in a very complex environment with many other products  and many players involved.   The NIS sector has specifically long sales cycles, and the long decision process for  procurement in large companies does not match start-ups business rhythm.  Difficulties obtaining funding   There is a lack of seed funding and a lack of growth stage funding (to scale up) and more  generally the amount of funding proposed is much lower in Europe than in the US and Israel  for instance: Estimations give the level of funding to be around €5 billion in the EU, compared  to more than €26 billion in the US40.   Finding appropriate funds (private and public funds) is also a great challenge. Some funds  ask start-ups to be break-even and to make profit before offering support, which is  incompatible with the goal of many start-ups, which is to reinvest the initial profits made. Other  programmes offer funds in exchange for certain conditions being met e.g. based on the  number of employees to be hired. This can be an obstacle if start-ups need to review their  business model and strategy to match these funding conditions.   Applying for European funding is difficult, as the application process is complex and very  time-consuming. Successful applications may also result in relatively benefits that are only  realised over a very long timeframe.  Skills shortage   There is a lack of cybersecurity educational paths, and a lack of business and entrepreneurial  skills amongst many technical entrepreneurs.   It is difficult to source the right cybersecurity skills to scale-up, because of a scarcity of  appropriate profiles (such as developers or ethical hackers) and the cost of sourcing roles  against competition from big companies.   Highly skilled cybersecurity experts are often attracted by advance innovation  hotspots/clusters outside of the EU  40 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2016:733:FIN  ,  https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/alliances-joint-ventures-growth-state-of-european-venture- capital/?chapter=2  65% of the NIS  start-ups panel  do not find it  easy to attract  the best talents  for their  business. High  cost (53%) and  lack of suitable  skills (47%) are  cited as the most  important  factors.  EU start-ups face  strong  competition from  Israel and US NIS  start-ups, which  benefit from  larger and easier  funding and the  biggest market  shares, even in  the EU.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2016:733:FIN https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/alliances-joint-ventures-growth-state-of-european-venture-capital/?chapter=2 https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/alliances-joint-ventures-growth-state-of-european-venture-capital/?chapter=2  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  18  5. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR START-UPS  Based on the analysis of the identified challenges and opportunities, as well as on feedback  collected from the panel of experts, this report proposes the following set of recommendations  to start-ups and SMEs active in the NIS market.  These recommendations aim to serve as a non-exhaustive list of actionable good practices to  help NIS start-ups better reach their objectives and potential as regards business growth.   Carefully and clearly define your product/service development strategy; the  product/service should address real needs and the start-up itself should be adaptable enough  to pivot based on the market dynamics. Understand the commercial aspects of selling NIS  solutions, especially in a B2B context; create solutions that address specific requirements  and/or integrate with existing established products.   Invest in building your team with the proper mix of skills - do not underestimate the  importance of non-technical skills such as business development, marketing and sales. Aside  from being critical for business success, team composition is among the key selection criteria  for investors, especially those not specialised in the NIS domain.   When necessary or pragmatic, invest in compliance with standards or certification  schemes that will allow you to access the entire EU market and beyond. The upcoming EU  Cybersecurity Certification Framework may increase the demand for compliance with  certification schemes and also serves as an opportunity for start-ups as it removes the current  existing fragmentation with multiple national certification schemes.   Leverage existing European clusters specialized in cybersecurity to develop your  business in close proximity with other start-ups, incubators/accelerators, universities and big  corporations.   Invest in networking and build mentorship-like relationships with larger enterprises who  will provide more-than-money support, get you in contact with potential customers and help  you better understand the market. Seek our accelerators specialised in cybersecurity if  possible.   Understand the EU funding opportunities available to you and assess their usefulness in  supporting the different stages of your growth, particularly when attracting other (e.g. private)  capital is most challenging.   Pursue partnerships and events that will allow you to position you solution to prospective  customers. Creating joint offers with larger companies that have established relationships with  customers or pursuing Proof of Concepts are two effective ways of achieving credible visibility  with customers.  These  recommendations  aim to serve as a  non-exhaustive list of  actionable good  practices to help NIS  start-ups better reach  their objectives and  potential as regards  business growth.

INTRODUCTION  The importance of innovation to ensuring economic growth in the European Union is such that  facilitating, favouring and fostering it is critical. In this respect, start-ups and young companies  play a key role. For them, the Network and Information Security (NIS) sector is a particular area  of focus.  The cybersecurity sector has a strong annual growth rate, as the worldwide market for  information security is expected to reach €145 billion by 2020.1  This growth trend was confirmed by many stakeholders of the sector that were engaged for this  study and justifies the attention given to this market. This study intends to provide useful  information to NIS start-ups and SMEs in order to support their growth.  Information for this study was collected via desk research and interviews with 20 experts,  including 10 founders of NIS start-ups and 10 contributors of funding channels or national  or European bodies such as Venture Capital, incubators, accelerators, public institutions etc.  The target audience of this report comprises NIS start-ups and SMEs, as well as entrepreneurs  interested in entering the NIS domain. This report intends to help such companies in:   understanding the start-up landscape from a technological and market perspective and  determining what is currently established in the EU related to NIS products and services;   gaining insight into the investment and funding channels available for NIS start-ups from  both the public and private sector;   identifying the main challenges they may face in their endeavour and ways in which they  can address them   building knowledge of the opportunities for growth of the EU NIS start-up market within  the context of current EU policy frameworks, at all stages of evolution for start-ups.  1 Source: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevemorgan/2015/12/20/cybersecurity%E2%80%8B-%E2%80%8Bmarket-reaches- 75-billion-in-2015%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B-%E2%80%8Bexpected-to-reach-170-billion-by-2020/#66f1983c10c3  The  cybersecurity  sector has a  strong annual  growth rate, as  the worldwide  market for  information  security is  expected to  reach €145  billion by 2020.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevemorgan/2015/12/20/cybersecurity%E2%80%8B-%E2%80%8Bmarket-reaches-75-billion-in-2015%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B-%E2%80%8Bexpected-to-reach-170-billion-by-2020/#66f1983c10c3 https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevemorgan/2015/12/20/cybersecurity%E2%80%8B-%E2%80%8Bmarket-reaches-75-billion-in-2015%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B-%E2%80%8Bexpected-to-reach-170-billion-by-2020/#66f1983c10c3  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  5  2. NIS START-UPS IN THE EU  2.1 GROWTH PHASES FOR NIS START-UPS  An understanding of the different growth phases for a start-up is essential to the task of  identifying the disparate challenges faced by NIS start-ups during these phases. As well as  variance by phase of growth, these challenges may also vary depending on the level of  development of the start-up from the initial idea, on the number of pivots2 performed and on the  number of funding iterations required to support growth.  Based on both desk research3 and information given by experts that we interviewed for this  study we have defined the successive start-up growth phases from Idea to IPO (Initial Public  Offering) illustrated in Figure 1, mapped to the evolution of the start-up revenue plotted against  time.  The idea or inception phase corresponds to the start of a project to create a product or service  accompanied by an entrepreneurial ambition to target this product at a relatively big market.  The seed stage is the formalisation of the initial idea. Vision and mission are determined, and a  first version of the business plan is built even though not yet mature, key milestones are  foreseen to measure and validate important indicators such as growth or customer interest.  At the end of seed stage is the valley of death, a period when the start-up is still not profitable  but needs to make more investments to allow its growth and its transition to early stage.  2 Typically, \"pivot\" refers to change/correction of the business model due to sub-par results or in order to discover additional  growth  3 Source: https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/271290  http://www.startupcommons.org/startup-development-phases.html  https://startupxplore.com/en/blog/types-startup-investing/  Figure 1: NIS start-ups growth phases linked with the start-up project life cycle  https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/271290 http://www.startupcommons.org/startup-development-phases.html https://startupxplore.com/en/blog/types-startup-investing/  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  6  During the early stage4 the start-up has measurable growth in users, revenues and market  share. Customers are present in the whole country and further expansion is planned.  At the later growth stage5, or scaling phase, the start-up focuses on KPIs (Key Performance  Indicators) to measure growth in users, revenues and/or market share in a big or fast-growing  target market.  The break-even point corresponds to the point when the revenues match the spending  needs and the start-up is starting to make profit.  Overall, there is a collective agreement on the definition of the different stages of start-up  growth throughout the world, even though some differences in vocabulary can occur in Europe  and other countries (e.g. the US).  2.2 NIS START-UPS MAIN OFFERS  To be able to draw trends and conclusions about the NIS start-up landscape in the EU, several  start-up maps and studies were included in the review6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. A key objective was to  identify the topics addressed by start-ups and to determine whether the offerings are primarily  product or service-based.  Product refers to a tangible offer that can be provided by start-ups, e.g. a software or a physical  platform.  Service refers to a type of offer where no transfer of ownership is performed; rather services  are offered (except services, such as consulting, integration etc., which complement a product).  Estimates have showed that approximately ¾ of NIS start-ups offer products14 with the majority  of the remainder offering a service or a combination of services and products.15 Only very few  start-ups are exclusively oriented at services, such as bug bounty or cloud security services  (based on a subscription fee).  Determining what kind of offer a start-up provides proved to be a difficult exercise as boundaries  are thin. First, start-up business models are not always fully mature as they often adapt them to  their first clients. For example, they can adapt to their client’s need and offer two modes of  billing: direct sale of the product or a subscription in the form of a monthly or yearly service.  Secondly, some start-ups have a hybrid model with both product and service offers. For  example, they have a product-oriented business model but propose additional consulting or  monitoring services.16.  4 Also named as series A, B funding rounds  5 Also known as series C funding round  6 http://europeanstartupmonitor.com/fileadmin/esm_2016/report/ESM_2016.pdf  7 Boston local initiatives http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2016/04/20/boston-cybersecurity-map-shows-deep-diverse-local- sector/  8 https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/periodic-table-cybersecurity-start-ups/  9 https://whatsthebigdata.com/2016/09/19/cybersecurity-market-map/  10 https://www.wavestone.com/app/uploads/2017/07/Radar-des-startups-cybersecurite-en-France-2017.pdf  11 Bessemer Venture Partners https://www.bvp.com/sites/default/files/files/strategy- resource/Israel%20Cybersecurity%20Landscape%20January%202017.pdf  12 http://www.bpifrance-lehub.fr/mapping-french-start-ups-in-cybersecurity/  13 http://cybersecurityventures.com/cybersecurity-500/  14  Investors often support more product-focused companies vs. service-oriented. https://ipacso.eu/about/project- ipasco/ipacso-advisory-board/33-ipacso-innovation-process-themes/market/market-analysis/trends-and-challenges/218- investment-trends.html  15 From the Wavestone radar panel of European start-ups (about 200+ start-ups)  16 For example, some start-ups have a product-oriented business model but propose additional consulting or monitoring  services.

Mature cybersecurity topics still represent the greatest  market share as cyber threats against traditional IT are constantly evolving. Among identified  key topics addressed by NIS start-ups, the following topics stand out19 (see Figure 3):   Identity and access management   network and endpoint security   data security  17  Investors often support more product-focused companies vs. service-oriented. https://ipacso.eu/about/project- ipasco/ipacso-advisory-board/33-ipacso-innovation-process-themes/market/market-analysis/trends-and-challenges/218- investment-trends.html  18 From the Wavestone radar panel of European start-ups (about 200+ start-ups)  19 Forrester, The Top Security Technology Trends To Watch, 2017, Tools And Technology: The S&R Practice Playbook by  Merritt Maxim, Jeff Pollard, Amy DeMartine, Nick Hayes, Joseph Blankenship, Josh Zelonis, Andras Cser, April 2017  Figure 2: EU NIS start-ups trends derived from the NIS start-up maps analysis  https://ipacso.eu/about/project-ipasco/ipacso-advisory-board/33-ipacso-innovation-process-themes/market/market-analysis/trends-and-challenges/218-investment-trends.html https://ipacso.eu/about/project-ipasco/ipacso-advisory-board/33-ipacso-innovation-process-themes/market/market-analysis/trends-and-challenges/218-investment-trends.html https://ipacso.eu/about/project-ipasco/ipacso-advisory-board/33-ipacso-innovation-process-themes/market/market-analysis/trends-and-challenges/218-investment-trends.html  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  8   vulnerability and threat intelligence.  Even though these topics are considered as mature, there is still room for innovation. Traditional  products and services are nowadays enhanced by additional technologies bringing more  intelligence into security operations, analytics and reporting platforms, through machine  learning, analytics and AI.20  2.3 EMERGING TOPICS FOR NIS START-UPS  There are also new emerging cybersecurity and market segments appearing that are driving the  adaptation of the cybersecurity market, by fostering the creation of response capabilities from  NIS start-ups in anticipation of the emergence of new threats. Such capabilities can address  either new usage (such as cloud, blockchain or IoT) or new trends (such as forensics,  deceptions).  Following are some of the main emerging cybersecurity segments that NIS start-ups address:   Deceptions – which is an innovative technique to mislead and confuse attackers, causing  them to take (or not take) specific actions that help cyber security defences, a more  sophisticated version of the traditional \"honeypots\";   Behavioural Biometrics21 – where using new innovative ways of verifying the identity of a  person such as a complex mix of mouse dynamics (rhythm, click patterns…), keystroke  dynamics (length, rhythm…) and the users’ GUI22 interaction (frequency, navigation) brings a  higher level of security as those behavioural patterns are hard to steal compared to classic  biometrics (fingerprints for example);   Post Quantum Cryptography – provides the next-generation type of encryption whilst  many popular encryption and signature schemes will be breakable by quantum computers;   Awareness – innovative ways to train and alert employees or customers about  cybersecurity threats such as role games and online exercises;   Industrial Security and Industrial IoT – refers to security of Industry 4.0 e.g. security of  intelligent, connected devices in factories;   NIS products/services built on Automation – which is an advanced response to  automated cyberattacks either at the prevention level e.g. to roll-out security patches or at the  detection level e.g. to automate incident responses.  20 See https://www.cbinsights.com/research/cybersecurity-ai-startups-threat-trends/  22 Graphical User Interface  Figure 3: Top 10 EU NIS start-ups categories consolidated from NIS start-ups map sources  https://www.cbinsights.com/research/cybersecurity-ai-startups-threat-trends/  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  9   NIS products/services based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) - by implementing AI and  machine learning techniques which allow faster detection and remediation for real-time  Information System monitoring.  In addition to these market trends, the impacts of regulation must be considered in the EU.  Indeed, regulations play a large part in governing demand. This will continue in the  coming years both at European level (GDPR, NIS) and at local level (national enforcement  laws) and will be an area where innovation will play a key role in building potential market  share for NIS start-ups.  According to the results of the study, the main topics that will need to be addressed regarding  GDPR are:   anonymization, which aims at sanitizing data to remove any personally identified information  or to encrypt data;   consent management where consumers will establish consent directives to determine who  will access their private data.  The market is not yet mature in providing tools to respond to these needs. For instance, the  sector of anonymization has been little explored by start-ups according the NIS start-ups maps  and is likely to rise with the GDPR coming into force in 2018.  The NIS Directive implies additional compliance and will be required in mature functions and  processes such as network and infrastructure security, with key aspects on securing  administration and ensuring network segregation in the Information System. There is also a  focus on industrial Smart Infrastructure security already been identified by start-ups as  Industrial SI security and IOT in the Top 10 and is promising to be a key area where the  demand will rise.  These trends were already partially identified and anticipated through Horizon 2020 with call for  tenders in 2017 targeting the following subjects23:   Cryptography   Advanced Threats   Privacy   Data protection   Prevention, detection, response and mitigation of the combination of physical and cyber  threats to the critical infrastructure of Europe.  23 http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-security_en.pdf  Regulations play  a large part in  governing  demand. This  will continue in  the coming years  both at European  and local level  and will be an  area where  innovation will  play a key role in  building  potential market  share for NIS  start-ups.  http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-security_en.pdf  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  10  3. FUNDING AND INVESTMENT  CHANNELS  3.1 OVERVIEW  Start-up capital can come in different forms in the successive growth stages and NIS start-ups  should be aware of the different options available to them. The provision of capital can be made  by various actors, each of which have specific expectations in return. As per expert’s  explanation, the following types of funding can be considered:  1. Equity capital. As defined by Business dictionary24, this represents funds invested in the new  business, and contrasts with debt capital, which is not repaid to the investors in the normal course of  business. It represents the risk capital staked by the owners through purchase of a company's stock.  It includes venture capital and corporate venture.  2. Non-equity capital, which can take different forms such as grants and subsidies25 , tax  incentives26  Figure 4 illustrates the funding and investment channel ecosystem: financing cycle and  associated amount of funding per stage, funding and investment channels providing non-  equity or equity financing, other stakeholders “more than money support” providing support  to start-ups other than funding; and whilst presenting also the start-up project cycle.  24 http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/equity-capital.html  25 These grants are monetary awards that do not obligate the entrepreneur financially. The start-up will receive the grant as  a subsidy to launch the business. If there are no financial obligations associated, other duties must be observed e.g. to  maintain accurate bookkeeping, use the funding as directed etc. A grant may derive its funding from both government and  private sector sources in the form of a joint venture.  26 They are established most of the time by governments to encourage investments in specific sectors. Start-ups can  benefit from a cut on R&D costs, on social charges and on corporate taxes. Investors who invest in start-ups and innovation  can also benefit from cuts in charges which can lead to turning the investment riskless, as the funds invested would have  been otherwise spent in paying taxes.  http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/equity-capital.html  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  11  Figure 4: Funding channels stakeholders at each stage of the start-up development  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  12  3.2 PRIVATE FUNDING AND INVESTMENT  Private investment and funding channels stakeholders can provide either equity  financing which is the case for founders, love money, corporate ventures/large groups and  venture capitals and non-equity financing which is the case with angels and banks through  loans.  Access to funds is mostly difficult or very difficult for all types of private funds except  from the founders’ money (see Figure 5)27.  On top of the category of investment and funding channels, we identified the following types of  stakeholders investing in NIS start-ups:   investors specialised in cybersecurity – who provide additional support due to their deep  knowledge of the market. Accelerators specialised in cybersecurity are very efficient for  connecting the start-up to the ecosystem (investors and clients) and getting the business  started.   investors non-specialised in cybersecurity – who view cybersecurity like other ICT topics.   private stakeholders that provide support other than funding to NIS start-ups or “more  than money support” - who are private incubators, private accelerators and corporate open  innovation in large companies.  While looking at alternative ways of private funding on a future-looking perspective, ICO (Initial  Coin Offering)28 recently appears as a potential new means of funding for start-ups, whose  sustainability and efficiency are still to be proven in the long term.29  27 Note: crowdfunding does not appear in Figure 5 above as our study led us to understand that crowdfunding is difficult to  implement for a BtoB business model, which is the model of the majority of cybersecurity start-ups. The BtoB model  consists of selling goods to other companies (and not directly to the consumer), this makes it difficult to raise sufficient  interest in the public at large. Cybersecurity start-ups also offer solutions to technical problems that are hard to promote to  the general population, which is why crowdfunding is not successful in that domain.  28 http://www.journaldunet.com/economie/finance/1195462-ico-initial-coin-offering/  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/business/dealbook/coin-digital-currency.html  29  This type of fundraising is similar to crowdfunding where a company sells tokens on a dedicated platform and then,  investors will benefit from the company via dividend payments.

National authorities in charge of cybersecurity, which have developed in the EU, can raise  cybersecurity awareness amongst citizens and the entire NIS market by highlighting and  explaining key issues to the start-up ecosystem30. In addition, they can provide technical  expertise to the NIS start-ups when developing products to ensure they meet the nation’s  requirements.  Tax incentives or national or regional funding mechanisms can also support start-ups  through tax incentives or grants.  3.4 EU FUNDING MECHANISMS  There are a number of European institutions and programs supporting NIS development  with the main goal to ensure cyber protection for all: citizens, companies (including SMEs) and  public administration by supporting the development of an EU cybersecurity industry31 32 33.   The EC created and signed a cybersecurity contractual Public-Private Partnership  (cPPP) with ECSO (European Cyber Security Organisation) with the aim to stimulate the  cybersecurity industry by bridging the gap between different stakeholders and by aligning  cybersecurity products and solutions with demand.   The Horizon 202034 Research and Innovation programme focuses on several  cybersecurity topics35.There are national contact-points (NCP) 36 in EU member states to  provide guidance and practical support and information for start-ups wanting to apply for  Horizon 2020 funding.   Existing EU initiatives to favour start-up development, such as Start-up Europe37, the  European Innovation Council (EIC) pilot38 and “Europe’s next leaders: the Start-up and  Scale-up Initiative.   Other financial instruments provided by the EU, e.g. European Structural and Investment  (ESI) Fund39.  It seems that very few start-ups or funding channels are effectively using EU funding mechanisms. The main  reasons behind this are the lack of knowledge of the EU funding mechanisms available, the difficulty in  accessing this funding and the unwillingness of start-ups to divert resources from their main business to  develop and submit a funding application or proposal.  30 This supports building trust with private investors by explaining the cybersecurity market, as technical products and  services are more difficult to understand - funding channels do not often have the cybersecurity experts in their team  necessary to fully understand the NIS ecosystem.  31 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/cybersecurity-industry  32 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1496330315823&uri=CELEX:52017DC0228  33 http://ec.europa.eu/research/sam/pdf/sam_cybersecurity_report.pdf  34 https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/h2020-sections  35 There are national contact-points (NCP) in EU member states to provide guidance and practical support and information  for parties wanting to apply for Horizon 2020 funding.  36 http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/support/national_contact_points.html  37https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/start-up-europe  http://start-upeuropeclub.eu/about-us/  38 https://ec.europa.eu/research/eic/  39 Source: ENISA conference \"Funding mechanisms for cybersecurity SMEs\" presented by EU Commission in March 2017  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/cybersecurity-industry http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1496330315823&uri=CELEX:52017DC0228 http://ec.europa.eu/research/sam/pdf/sam_cybersecurity_report.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/h2020-sections http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/support/national_contact_points.html https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/startup-europe http://startupeuropeclub.eu/about-us/ https://ec.europa.eu/research/eic/  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  14  3.5 MORE-THAN-MONEY SUPPORT  The expression “more than money” perfectly captures the philosophy that funding alone is no  longer a sufficient means for ensuring success. There are several areas of interest for fostering  the growth of NIS start-ups:  1. Developing working synergies between start-ups and companies is essential to build  trust for NIS start-ups and to initiate the commercial relationship, as business relationship  between start-ups and large companies are still too weak.  2. Developing the action of \"trusted third parties\", which acts as an interface between  large private corporate groups, public stakeholders, start-ups and schools / universities to  bridge the different parties and accelerate the transfer of mutual skills amongst the  different stakeholders and developing “open innovation” in large corporates.  3. Ensuring the right talent is available to NIS start-ups from creation to later growth is  also key.  4. Building a strong networking enables start-ups to bridge with the NIS ecosystem.  Numerous  stakeholders of  the ecosystem  are offering  support to start- up founders in  diverse ways -  not only  financial.  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  15  4. OPPORTUNITIES AND OBSTACLES  Through our interviews of experts and our desk research, we identified a number of specific  challenges and opportunities faced by NIS start-ups in their development within the EU. The  primary challenges identified by the panel of experts are presented in Figure 6.  Overall, the challenges and opportunities for NIS start-ups in the EU are presented in the  following across 3 dimensions:   Challenges and opportunities related to funding   Challenges and opportunities specifically related to the NIS sector   Challenges and opportunities related to other factors  Figure 6: NIS start-ups panel main challenges in growing and funding a business from panel  Figure 7: Opportunities and obstacles linked to funding mechanisms  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  16  Figure 8: NIS sector specific opportunities and obstacles  Figure 9: Opportunities and obstacles due to other factors  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  17  Among the challenges identified for NIS start-ups in the EU, a few stand-out and are worth  exploring in more detail:  Challenge to penetrate the Business-to-Business (BtoB) market   Networking and building visibility around the start-up to win the first contract is often  challenging. In several EU countries, the lack of an innovation network bridging start-ups and  companies is still an obstacle in building synergies between them.   Start-ups often have difficulties in understanding the customers’ expectations or assessing  correctly the market maturity and hence do not offer NIS products or services that meet a  real need in the market that would attract investors. NIS start-ups also have difficulty  integrating their product/service in a very complex environment with many other products  and many players involved.   The NIS sector has specifically long sales cycles, and the long decision process for  procurement in large companies does not match start-ups business rhythm.  Difficulties obtaining funding   There is a lack of seed funding and a lack of growth stage funding (to scale up) and more  generally the amount of funding proposed is much lower in Europe than in the US and Israel  for instance: Estimations give the level of funding to be around €5 billion in the EU, compared  to more than €26 billion in the US40.   Finding appropriate funds (private and public funds) is also a great challenge. Some funds  ask start-ups to be break-even and to make profit before offering support, which is  incompatible with the goal of many start-ups, which is to reinvest the initial profits made. Other  programmes offer funds in exchange for certain conditions being met e.g. based on the  number of employees to be hired. This can be an obstacle if start-ups need to review their  business model and strategy to match these funding conditions.   Applying for European funding is difficult, as the application process is complex and very  time-consuming. Successful applications may also result in relatively benefits that are only  realised over a very long timeframe.  Skills shortage   There is a lack of cybersecurity educational paths, and a lack of business and entrepreneurial  skills amongst many technical entrepreneurs.   It is difficult to source the right cybersecurity skills to scale-up, because of a scarcity of  appropriate profiles (such as developers or ethical hackers) and the cost of sourcing roles  against competition from big companies.   Highly skilled cybersecurity experts are often attracted by advance innovation  hotspots/clusters outside of the EU  40 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2016:733:FIN  ,  https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/alliances-joint-ventures-growth-state-of-european-venture- capital/?chapter=2  65% of the NIS  start-ups panel  do not find it  easy to attract  the best talents  for their  business. High  cost (53%) and  lack of suitable  skills (47%) are  cited as the most  important  factors.  EU start-ups face  strong  competition from  Israel and US NIS  start-ups, which  benefit from  larger and easier  funding and the  biggest market  shares, even in  the EU.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2016:733:FIN https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/alliances-joint-ventures-growth-state-of-european-venture-capital/?chapter=2 https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/alliances-joint-ventures-growth-state-of-european-venture-capital/?chapter=2  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EU CYBERSECURITY START-UPS  MAY 2019  18  5. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR START-UPS  Based on the analysis of the identified challenges and opportunities, as well as on feedback  collected from the panel of experts, this report proposes the following set of recommendations  to start-ups and SMEs active in the NIS market.  These recommendations aim to serve as a non-exhaustive list of actionable good practices to  help NIS start-ups better reach their objectives and potential as regards business growth.   Carefully and clearly define your product/service development strategy; the  product/service should address real needs and the start-up itself should be adaptable enough  to pivot based on the market dynamics. Understand the commercial aspects of selling NIS  solutions, especially in a B2B context; create solutions that address specific requirements  and/or integrate with existing established products.   Invest in building your team with the proper mix of skills - do not underestimate the  importance of non-technical skills such as business development, marketing and sales. Aside  from being critical for business success, team composition is among the key selection criteria  for investors, especially those not specialised in the NIS domain.   When necessary or pragmatic, invest in compliance with standards or certification  schemes that will allow you to access the entire EU market and beyond. The upcoming EU  Cybersecurity Certification Framework may increase the demand for compliance with  certification schemes and also serves as an opportunity for start-ups as it removes the current  existing fragmentation with multiple national certification schemes.   Leverage existing European clusters specialized in cybersecurity to develop your  business in close proximity with other start-ups, incubators/accelerators, universities and big  corporations.   Invest in networking and build mentorship-like relationships with larger enterprises who  will provide more-than-money support, get you in contact with potential customers and help  you better understand the market. Seek our accelerators specialised in cybersecurity if  possible.   Understand the EU funding opportunities available to you and assess their usefulness in  supporting the different stages of your growth, particularly when attracting other (e.g. private)  capital is most challenging.   Pursue partnerships and events that will allow you to position you solution to prospective  customers. Creating joint offers with larger companies that have established relationships with  customers or pursuing Proof of Concepts are two effective ways of achieving credible visibility  with customers.  These  recommendations  aim to serve as a  non-exhaustive list of  actionable good  practices to help NIS  start-ups better reach  their objectives and  potential as regards  business growth.

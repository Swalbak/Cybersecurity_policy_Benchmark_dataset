Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page  iv  Executive Summary  The ever increasing complexity of cyber-attacks requires more effective information sharing among  Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs). Local detection, accompanied by trusted forms of  information exchange, leads to global prevention of cyber-attacks. In other words, it is very  beneficial for the successful identification (and subsequent handling) of an incident, if it has already  been detected by CERTs sharing this information. Furthermore, effective information sharing saves  time and effort in incident response and post-mortem analysis, increases synergies and aligns  practices among CERTs.  Much progress has been made recently in establishing national/governmental (n/g) CERTs in Europe.  All these teams, which are at different maturity levels, actively take on the job of coordinating  responses to cyber-attacks. As the nature of cyber-attacks is often global, it is crucial that responses  to these incidents are coordinated not only within national boundaries, but also at a cross-border  level. In order for this to happen, secure and effective information exchange and the sharing of  information on such incidents must take place.  Despite fruitful cooperation between many CERTs (n/g and others) bringing visible results in  improving cyber security in EU member states (for example TI Certification or TRANSITS CERT  trainings), the teams still face obstacles that work against seamless security information exchange  and sharing. The key problems for effective information sharing are legal and technical barriers, as  well as lack of interest from cybersecurity stakeholders in sharing information.  While trying to promote interoperability of solutions and cooperation between CERTs,  improvements to information sharing must build on existing solutions and standardisation efforts in  data exchange formats. A number of recent initiatives aim to streamline and make data sharing  effective among CERTs1. These initiatives are being developed by (n/g and other sector) CERTs in  Europe, by NATO, or by private companies and are driven by “cyber community” interests. Some of  them have already attracted solid user communities, and they tend to be user-friendly and flexible,  as they are mostly open source.  It is important to make all these approaches interoperable, irrespective of incident feeds,  information exchange formats, or the ticketing systems used.  ENISA has identified a set of recommendations targeted to itself, the CERT community and other  security actors aiming at:   Promoting the continuity of incident feeds, which are often changed without prior notice   Making existing tools interoperable and promoting the use of standards for data exchange   Enhancing the functionality of existing tools as regards:  o Interoperability  o Correlation engines for incident analysis  o Improved threat intelligence  o Advanced analytics and visualisation for massive numbers of incidents  o Automatic prioritisation  The European Union, including ENISA, can help n/g CERTs in this process, which will further facilitate  the exchange among them of information on incidents.  1  These initiatives are discussed in more detail throughout the report.

It aims  at:   Taking stock of existing communication solutions and practices among European CERTs   Identifying the functional and technical gaps that limit threat intelligence exchange between  n/g CERTs and their counterparts in Europe, as well as other CERTs within their respective  countries   Defining basic requirements for improved communications interoperable with existing  solutions  This report aims at building on existing solutions and promoting achievable good practices, rather  than offer unrealistic “revolutionary” solutions. It needs to be said that this is an overview of a  quickly evolving domain, which necessitates frequent updates in line with the evolving environment  of cybersecurity and cybercrime.  1.2 Europe’s Involvement in Supporting Secure and Effective Information  Exchange and Sharing  Many EU documents have stressed the importance of CERTs, especially their early warning and  incident response capabilities. Most recently, a proposal for a Directive on network and information  security2, which accompanies the EU Cyber Security Strategy3, addressed the topic of secure  information systems. Article 9 of the proposal for the Directive states that the exchange of sensitive  and confidential information shall take place through secure infrastructure.  The European Commission is empowered to adopt supplementary acts on the definition of criteria  to be fulfilled by EU member states in order to be authorised to participate in the secure information  system regarding the following:  a) The availability of secure and resilient communication and information infrastructure at a  national level, compatible and interoperable with the secure infrastructure of the  cooperation network  b) The existence of adequate technical, financial, and human resources, as well as processes for  the relevant competent authority and CERT, to allow effective, efficient, and secure  participation in the secure information-sharing system  1.3 ENISA’s Involvement in the Area of Secure Communication and  Information Sharing among CERTs  ENISA aims at supporting the process of establishing secure systems for information sharing, like the  one mentioned in the draft Directive. Since 2005, ENISA has been running a programme dedicated to  the capability building of national/governmental CERTs. A recent ENISA project resulted in a good  2  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online- freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  3  Ibid.  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 2  practice guide for CERTs on honeypots for the proactive detection of IT security incidents.4 ENISA  also maintains training and exercise material focussing on enhancing the capabilities of CERTs in EU  Member States (and beyond).5 The emphasis was put on practical and applicable material about  current technical and operational topics, and ENISA intends to continue maintaining and extending  its CERT training library in the coming years. At the same time, ENISA is paying increased attention to  the legal aspects of information sharing.6  One of the more in-depth studies commissioned by ENISA in recent years was  Proactive Detection  of  Network  Security  Incidents 7. This community-driven effort investigated  proactive ways in which CERTs detect incidents targeting and affecting their constituencies,  identified good practices and common mistakes, and recommended options for improvement.  ENISA also dealt with the specific topic of secure communication between CERTs and produced a  report entitled Secure Communication with the CERTs and Other Stakeholders 8. The focus of the  earlier work was rather on communication channels (PGP, S/MIME, VPN, etc.). The 2013 project  aims at a broader and more pragmatic approach by taking into consideration all collaborative tools  like sharing infrastructures, messaging systems, ticketing systems, incident handling and notification  systems, and so forth. These tools are hereafter referred to as communication solutions – used by  CERT teams in the exchange of information between them.  1.4 Target Audience and Scope  The intended target audience for this report is primarily the national/governmental CERTs but in  principle it is applicable for any kind of CERT, in Europe and worldwide. The report is tailored to be  useful for both well-established CERTs and new/upcoming teams.  4  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-of-security- incidents-II-honeypots  5  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  6  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/legal-information-sharing  7  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-report  8  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/files/secure-communication  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-of-security-incidents-II-honeypots http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-of-security-incidents-II-honeypots http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/legal-information-sharing http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-report http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/files/secure-communication  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 3  2 Overview of the Methodology  For the purposes of this report, several methodological approaches (in addition to basic desk  research) were applied: surveys, interviews, and a dedicated workshop that enabled a free exchange  of ideas between the interested stakeholders – national/governmental CERTs.  Survey  A survey was developed on the current communication practices of CERTs vis-à-vis other CERTs in  their respective countries, their counterparts in other countries, and operators and ISPs. A total of  27 teams have responded to the survey, with the majority (63%) of them being  national/governmental CERTs in Europe. While the majority of the responding teams came from EU  countries, responses also came from the U.S., Asia, and the Middle East9.  Figure 1: Completed Survey by CERT Type  Interviews  Based on the survey output, accompanying interviews were held with stakeholders in order to clarify  and go beyond the replies received. These interviews were held electronically, via email  correspondence, and actually in person in one case. In total, 12 interviews were conducted.  Face-to-Face Workshop  During a TF-CSIRT10 meeting in Bucharest, a face-to-face workshop was held on 24 May 2013. At the  meeting, the interim results of the project were presented to the participants (14 in total). Also, the  participants presented and discussed initiatives aimed at enhancing the communication practices of  CERTs.  9  Responding teams came from: Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, European Union,  Finland, France, Greece, Hong Kong/China, Japan, Latvia, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Romania, Slovenia, South  Korea, Spain, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, USA  10  TERENA’s Task Force CSIRT promotes collaboration and coordination between CERT teams in Europe.

First it provides a summary of main communication solutions used by the teams,  followed by identification of barriers and requirements for such effective and information exchange.  3.1 Overview of n/g CERTs' Communication Practices and Solutions  It is noteworthy that the main communication practices between n/g CERTs from different member  states do not differ from those between n/g CERTs and other CERTs in the same country (see Figure  2).  Figure 2: Use of Communication Solutions among CERTs  Number of respondents: 27 CERTs  3.1.1 Secure and Regular Email  'Secure email is the preferred way of communicating, mainly because it is easy to use, simple,  and flexible, allows for fast communication, and, most importantly, is the most common tool  everyone can support.'  – One of the surveyed CERTs  Secure and/or regular email is by far the most popular communication solution used in CERTs’  everyday operations.  Email communication has a few features that make it an optimal tool for sharing unstructured  information between organisations. It is truly universal (everyone uses email), interoperable (it  works on almost any operating system), asynchronous (users do not have to be logged in at the  same time), and can carry attachment files of any type (albeit limited by size).  For the purposes of  secure communication, email can be encrypted, ideally by using asymmetric encryption methods.  24  19  6 5  2 1  7 7  26 23  7 6  2 1 2  4  12  22  5 4  2 0  4 4  0  5  10  15  20  25  30  Secure Email (PGP/SMIME)  Normal Email IRC Jabber Skype Lync Telephone Other (custom solutions, personal  meetings, web interfaces)  Communication with other CERTs in the same country  Communication with CERTs counterparts in Europe  Communication with operators/ISPs and Industry  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 5  Most of the queried CERTs have reported that they are using PGP encryption11 for the purposes of  secure information exchange within the CERT community, while S/MIME is used more rarely. Secure  email with PGP is an informally adopted standard within the CERT community and the wider Internet  security community in general.  While the use of secure email is common in the CERT community, both the survey and conversations  with CERT representatives revealed that other stakeholders (ISPs, public administration, police, etc.)  lack the culture of secure communication in general: Communication between CERTs and other  parties therefore happens most often via unencrypted email.  Due to a certain degree of impracticality of secure email in everyday use, CERTs often decide on a  case-by-case basis whether to send information via secure email, regular email, or another solution,  such as fast and easy-to-use chat clients.  Worldwide, CERTs communicate primarily with their counterparts in other countries, but they also  communicate with ISPs and system administrators, for example when a particular incident is not  covered by a particular CERT. On a national level CERTs communicate most often with ISPs.  The majority of CERTs are satisfied with PGP-encrypted email as the basis for secure information  exchange in their everyday operations. The incident-related sensitive information that is typically  shared is only partly structured, is text-based (therefore easily compressible), and is often both  machine- and human-readable. Furthermore, email as an information transportation mechanism is  open and universal, which CERT experts truly appreciate.  While many CERTs admit that secure and regular email may not be quite optimal tools for  information sharing in general and within the CERT community in particular, a commonly shared  opinion was that any better tool would be virtually impossible to implement due to diverse  requirements from different teams. However, CERTs are facing an ever increasing amount of data  related to incidents, and secure email communication doesn’t scale easily. Teams reported that  management of PGP- or S/MIME keys gets more and more complex as the number or recipients  grows, that emails are difficult to process automatically and that they can’t cope with large data  volumes or high rate of incidents due to this shortcomings. In order to reflect the changing  requirements for information exchange due to large volumes and lack of common structure, some  CERTs look into alternatives. It should be noted, that sharing of more data is not necessarily an  improvement per se. Instead, it is important to pay attention to the quality rather than to the  quantity of information.  3.1.2 Instant Messaging  The landscape of instant messaging solutions in use in the CERT community is fragmented. Solutions  include (in order of popularity): IRC12, Jabber/XMPP13, Skype14, and Lync15. No solution was found to  be a clear leader in popularity; however, IRC and Jabber were generally mentioned more often than  Skype and Lync.  A few interviewed CERTs stressed that, while chat clients are not absolutely crucial to their daily  operations, they are indeed helpful and must be included in this guide.  11  See http://www.imc.org/smime-pgpmime.html on PGP and S/MIME  12  See http://www.irc.org  13  See http://xmpp.org  14  See http://www.skype.com  15  See http://lync.microsoft.com  http://www.imc.org/smime-pgpmime.html http://www.irc.org/ http://xmpp.org/ http://www.skype.com/ http://lync.microsoft.com/  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 6  In contrast to email, IM typically requires both (or more) communicating parties to be present at  their terminals at the same time so as to communicate almost instantly. Chat clients facilitate the  rapid exchange of ideas and technical details, while giving the users instant feedback and a platform  for an active, real-time discussion. As a communication tool, the IM family is considered to be of  lower latency and less formal than email. Although solutions exist to secure instant messaging  communication16, a minority of teams uses them. The solutions in use today can be considered more  as supportive rather than as primary communication channels.  3.1.3 Secure Message Boards and Closed Mailing Lists  Interviews have shown that, apart from obvious tools such as secure email and instant messaging,  another class of decades-old and still very useful tools – closed Mailing List (i.e. TI-accredited CSIRTs,  or ENISA N/G CERTs ML) and message boards or forums – have also proved useful in secure  information sharing among the CERT community. These fora allow groups of authenticated users to  share and discuss security-incident-related insights. They provide ways to communicate with a  whole spectrum of trusted experts, while providing strong security mechanisms; for example, to  have access to it, one needs to be invited by one established member of a given forum and to be  recommended by another.  3.1.4 Incident Handling and Ticketing Systems  Figure 3: Use of Ticketing and Incident Tracking Solutions  Number of respondents: 25 CERTs  Almost all CERTs report that they are using some kind of ticketing or incident tracking system. The  most popular ticketing system was found to be Request Tracker17 (RT). Request Tracker for Incident  Response18 (RTIR) was found to be the most popular tool for incident response tracking –  unsurprisingly so, as the tool is a purpose-built product for the computer security community.  Another tool developed for CERTs and ISPs, AbuseHelper19, was found to be the most popular for the  purposes of automatic process incident notifications. Other solutions the interviewed CERTs use  include the BMC Remedy Action Request System20 (BMC ARS), the Open Source Ticket Request  System21 (OTRS), and MS Sharepoint22-based or MS Excel-based in-house ticketing systems.  RT and RTIR  16  See OTR http://otr.cypherpunks.ca/ or http://safetyjabber.com/  17  See http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/  18  See http://bestpractical.com/rtir/  19  See http://abusehelper.be  20  See http://www.bmc.com  21  See http://www.otrs.com  22  See http://sharepoint.microsoft.com  6  5  4  1  8  1  0  5  10  RTIR Abuse Helper RT (without the IR plugin)  OTRS Other None  http://otr.cypherpunks.ca/ http://safetyjabber.com/ http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/ http://bestpractical.com/rtir/ http://abusehelper.be/ http://www.bmc.com/ http://www.otrs.com/ http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 7  CERTs recognise and appreciate that RTIR has, in fact, been designed with the CERT community in  mind, and together with that community. RT-based platforms are recognised to be working  adequately for the specific purposes of CERTs. They are believed to have the most optimised  workflow out of the box, are integrated with email (including the handling of the PGP security  protocol), and are flexible, easily customisable, extendable, and interoperable with other systems.  Multiple users are able to handle the same incident, and reports are easily generated. User  interfaces include a web interface, email, a command line tool, and programmable application  programming interfaces (APIs). Some teams reported having problems when handling large amounts  of data related to a ticket or when using the automatic incident notification. They are now looking  for alternatives.  3.1.5 Customer Relationship Management Systems  A significant majority of CERTs do not use customer relationship management (CRM) systems. Those  that do, use CRM solutions delivered by Oracle, SAP, Microsoft or other parties, with no clear leader  among the mentioned systems.  3.2 Barriers to and Requirements for Information Exchange and Sharing  Figure 4: Main Obstacles to More Secure and Effective Communication  Number of respondents: 22 CERTs  Technical issues were identified as the most common barrier to more effective information  exchange between CERTs. These technical issues mainly concern the automated exchange of data  about security incidents. Another issue mentioned was the quality of the data23.  One solution for automated processing of incident reports is the already mentioned tool  AbuseHelper. Even though, as shown in Figure 3, it is used by only five out of a sample of 25 CERTs  right now, many other CERTs are also looking into using it. AbuseHelper has the potential to become  23  In 2014, ENISA will carry out a project for good practice in this field.  8  16  12  9 9  3  10 10  12 12  5 4  12 11 11  6  11  1  0  5  10  15  20  Legal Technical Procedural Trust issues Insufficient interest of the  partners  No crucial barriers  Other CERTs in the same country  CERTs of the same type/constituency in another state  Operator/ISPs or Industry  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 8  the most popular tool for this purpose24, or at least build the basis for a tailor-made in-house  solution that, according also to other studies25 many teams apply (in Figure 3, these are collated in  the ‘Other’ category).  We have identified a consensus in the CERT community with regard to the severity of challenges in  the daily operations of CERTs. Technical barriers, though being most common, are generally thought  to be more easily overcome than legal issues. As for information exchange with CERTs of the same  type in other states, legal barriers and trust issues are more often cited as hindering this exchange.  Additionally, CERTs often cite a low level of interest among operators in sharing information they  have or in acting upon the information CERTs shared with them.  3.2.1 Legal and Procedural Obstacles and Requirements  Issues around the legal and procedural aspects of information exchange between CERTs and other  stakeholders were among the most frequently cited, both in the survey and especially in the in- depth interviews.  Essentially, CERTs and other similar organisations have doubts about whether a particular set of  information can be shared at all, with whom, on what conditions, after what treatment, and so on.  CERTs are often unsure about what sort of information can be exchanged so as not to pose legal  questions regarding data protection and privacy protection. Privacy commissioners in various EU  member states have a range of interpretations of how personal information is defined. For example,  an IP address can qualify as personal information in one country but not in another. Categorisation is  another issue in terms of which types of personal data should receive the highest level of protection.  Due to such privacy questions being complex at times, extensive information sharing between CERTs  and other actors is often inhibited.  According to some opinions, the legal problems do not only result from lack of harmonisation of  data protection law across the EU, but also in the different interpretations of the law by different  bodies.  Interviewees often indicated that these problems are even more severe than the technical  challenges mentioned before, like a lack of a web portal or other means.  Many interviewees claimed that, in order to help with the issues described here, common standards  should emerge in the interpretation of data protection law across the EU, at least in matters relating  to cyber security incidents (which is out of scope of this particular report). For more information on  the legal aspects of information sharing, see the ENISA study entitled A Flair for Sharing –  Encouraging Information Exchange between CERTs.26  On the operational side, with incidents that require looking up details on entities that are  responsible for URLs and IP addresses under investigation, a European forum exists that has a  database of all European IPs and their corresponding owners (the Regional Internet Registry27, or  RIPE); however, the data in this registry is quite difficult to retrieve, and it can sometimes be  impossible to find the entity responsible for an IP address.  24  ENISA will further investigate how to support the community more actively in the field of automated  processing of actionable information in 2014  25  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-report  26  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/legal-information-sharing  27  See http://www.ripe.net  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-report http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/legal-information-sharing http://www.ripe.net/  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 9  3.2.2  Trust Issues – Barriers and Requirements  'The single most important requirement is trust. Trust can germinate through real-life  contact and grows with regular (virtual) meeting. A secure European platform for  communication can facilitate – but never replace – trust.'  – One of the surveyed CERTs  Trust issues are among the most crucial obstacles to enhanced and effective communication  between CERTs and other stakeholders. Some interviewees have pointed out that, in the particular  community of cybersecurity experts, trust is the single most important feature of a successful  cooperative relationship.  To illustrate the consequences of a lack of trust between stakeholders, one of the interviewees  noted that they had even stopped sharing security incident information with people/organisations  that had committed actions that had destroyed trust between the parties, meaning that no further  information was exchanged between the parties. Also, trust is undermined when only one party is  active in sharing information, without getting much in return from the other party.  Situations in which trust between members of the community is diminishing or non-existent have  the immediate effect of undermining the value of information shared: the size of the community. As  a general observation it can be stated that the larger a sharing community is, the less valuable and  less sensitive is the information and the less timely is the sharing.  In other words, trust doesn’t scale  and needs to be paired with effective information sharing tools28. Protocols such as TLP allow for  information to be shared in a more structured way in face-to-face communication.  3.2.3 Insufficient Interest from Partners  Within the realms of CERT-to-CERT communication, insufficient interest from partners is a very rare  phenomenon. Only five of the teams responded like this.  Conversely, the in-depth interviews have confirmed the rich culture of information sharing present  within the European CERT community. Typically, CERTs are not only willing to share security incident  information as it happens but also to write up summary reports and share them with the  community. These reports are typically very well received and appreciated within the CERT  community; however, due to very heavy workloads, they are often delayed. When CERTs are  handling an incident, experts focus on its mitigation and on coordination with others, and they  sometimes lack the time to share reports with other CERTs. Large-scale incidents are a primary  example of a situation that sparks report writing and sharing. The culture of information sharing and  demand for it is definitely not an issue, but workloads are often a major inhibitor.  3.2.4 Technical Barriers and Requirements  'Every communication channel with each partner or type of partner CSIRT is unique. This does  not scale well, and to have more fruitful, 'full-duplex', trusted engagements, standard  procedures and protocols need to be established and relied upon.'  – One of the surveyed CERTs  Before moving into discussing the more technical side of issues regarding secure information  exchange within the CERT community, it needs to be stated again that many interviewees  mentioned that, compared with legal, procedural, and trust issues, technical deficiencies, such as the  lack of a web portal or incident repository and the proliferation of communication channels, are of  28  In 2014 ENISA will carry out a project in the area of trust building among or within communities  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 10  less significance. It is easier to find a common ground on overcoming these technical barriers than  solving complicated international legal issues often pertaining to the areas of national interests and  sovereignty.  Nevertheless, technical issues do exist:   Many CERTs appreciate receiving automated feeds from some CERTs, using them to inform  their constituencies about infections; however, feeds are often found to be problematic due  to:  o format changes without prior notice,  o timestamp/time zone issues,  o information coming very late after the incident is noticed, which means CERTs  typically work on each case separately to treat/react to the incidents,  o data received regarding incidents contains not enough information to launch an  investigation.   Formats of regularly shared information, starting with a reasonable taxonomy of the  information, needs improvement; many standards exist in the cybersecurity field, but  organisations keep on doing ad hoc CSV-like exchanges.   CERTs often lack good quality software to build up and maintain the basic database a CERT  needs for a number of functions (a special kind of CRM for CERT work):  o IP to Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) mapping (current, historical)  o IP to country mapping (current, historical)  o Domain to registrar mapping  o Contact information for all these  o Keeping track of the quality of contacts.   Dealing with abundant false positive detections – teams use various tools that produce  varying numbers of false positives.   Many CERTs use in-house software solutions, which they also find hard to maintain due to a  general lack of software development resources. In addition, very few tools are widely  adopted in the CERT community.   Some of the incident tracking systems cannot handle large numbers of tickets.   It may be difficult to export data from a given tracking system and link it to another system  (systems compatibility issues).   A centralised web-based service is lacking for the exchange of structured information.  Additional and more detailed technical discussions of barriers and requirements for the automated  exchange of network security information can be found in two reports: Proactive Detection of  Network Security Incidents29 and Proactive Detection and Automated Exchange of Network Security  Incidents30.  When asked about priorities with regard to a potential secure European platform for communication  among CERTs, surveyed teams put the highest emphasis on security aspects (confidentiality,  integrity, and authenticity) when exchanging information with their peers (see Figure 5:  Requirements for a potential Secure European Platform for Communication among CERTs):  Functionality ranks just behind. On the other hand, cost aspects are not as crucial as technical ones,  indicating that, in order to achieve the high level of security required, the teams are inclined to  invest reasonable sums into effective communication solutions.  29  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-report  30  http://www.cert.pl/PDF/MP-IST-111-18.pdf  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-report http://www.cert.pl/PDF/MP-IST-111-18.pdf  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 11  Figure 5: Requirements for a potential Secure European Platform for Communication among CERTs  Number of respondents: 23 CERTs  Note: The total score was calculated by multiplying the number of responses for the given criterion by the  ranking on a scale of 1–5.  3.2.5 Other Barriers and Requirements  The oft-quoted problem in effective information exchange is the workload, which is sometimes so  heavy among CERTs that they do not have the time to write reports and share them with the  community. When handling an incident, teams are often focused on its mitigation and immediate  coordination with others and therefore do not always have the time to share lessons learned with  other CERTs afterwards (which, from time to time, will happen after major incidents). This lack of  post-processing of important incidents is considered most useful by all responding teams, alas  extensive workload in day-to-day operation is a major obstacle, besides the fact that tools are not  optimized to support these wrap-up reports.  99  92  85 80 74  0  20  40  60  80  100  120  very high (score: 5)  high (score: 4)  average (score: 3)  low (score: 2)  very low (score: 1)  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 12  4 Data Exchange Formats and Current Efforts for Secure and Effective Data  Exchange  Figure 6: Mapping of Standardisation and Solutions for Response, Incident, and IoC Information Sharing  Several practices have emerged in Europe and worldwide that aim at addressing effective  information exchange and sharing data about cyber incidents (as identified in the survey; see Section  3). These efforts can be considered as possible approaches to secure information exchange as  envisaged by the EU Cyber Security Strategy and the draft Directive on Network and Information  Security31. The following sections of this chapter include illustrative examples of initiatives on  information exchange standards and current efforts in the area of secure and effective  communication about incidents.  31  See the Article 9 (Secure information-sharing system) of the proposed Directive.  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1666  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1666  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 13  Any piece of information that can be  used to search for or identify potentially  compromised systems is known as an  indicator of compromise (IoC). These  IoCs can include IP address/domain  name, URL, file hash, email address, X- mailer, HTTP user agent, and file mutex.  This information can be compiled into  incident reports and enriched with  analysis and remediation reports.  Several standards exist for formatting  information, however there is not a single leading one in place. However, the trend to share  structured information rather than unstructured in plan emails can be observed.  While, as  mentioned, there is currently no single standard for data format that is generally accepted, it is  crucial for an automated processing of received information! We provide an overview of existing  standards below (section 4.1), followed by the summary and discussion of known challenges related  to automated IoC exchanges.  Multiple initiatives exist, or are currently in development, that aim to address the aforementioned  barriers (see 0) in a systematic way: CERTs still find it difficult to exchange information about  (targeted) malware and attacks within a group of trusted partners or by bilateral agreement.  Despite of the trend to exchange of structured information, much of the information sharing  nowadays still occurs through unstructured reports, where it is necessary, in order to process data,  to manually copy & paste the information into text files that have to be parsed to be exported to  (N)IDS and systems or used in log searches.  Some solutions to overcome these problems are being developed by CERTs, NATO, and private  organisations, often with the participation of multiple stakeholders. In section 0, a few of them are  presented that enjoy a certain degree of support in the CERT community, which have reached a  good level of development, and might address the barriers presented in this report. Adopting these  solutions more widely would help CERTs in forming and building larger sharing communities to  exchange the benefits of previous detections and remediation efforts. This approach ultimately  would lead to more confident and efficient incident response.32  4.1 Standardisation Efforts for Sharing Indicators of Compromise  This section is based to a large extent on the following sources: Rosella Mattioli, Information  Exchange Framework for Cyber Security Incidents, Tallin University of Technology33; and on Chris  Harrington’s Sharing Indicators of Compromise: An Overview of Standards and Formats, EMC Critical  Incident Response Center34.  4.1.1 OpenIOC  OpenIOC (http://www.openioc.org/) is an extensible XML schema that enables to describe the  technical characteristics of threats, an attacker’s methodology, or other evidence of compromise.  Originally, it was designed to enable some commercial products to codify intelligence in order to  rapidly search for potential security breaches. In response to requests from across the user  32  See the Recommendations section.  33  http://www.07011979.org/post/26825136212/information-exchange-framework-for-cyber-security  34  http://www.rsaconference.com/events/us13/.../sharing-indicators-of-compromise-an-overview-of  INCIDENTS VS EVENTS SHARING  ‘Incidents’ data usually contains all the information  related to a security incident, including sensitive  information, which cannot be easily shared. Security  ‘events’ contain the non-sensitive metadata related  to an incident. ‘Events’ are therefore less valuable  for security analysis but are more easily shared.  Tools and standards tend to be specific for one type  of information (incident or event data).  http://www.openioc.org/ http://www.07011979.org/post/26825136212/information-exchange-framework-for-cyber-security http://www.rsaconference.com/events/us13/agenda/sessions/181/sharing-indicators-of-compromise-an-overview-of  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 14  community, the company (Mandiant) has standardised and open-sourced the OpenIOC schema to  allow communication of threat information at machine speed (meaning automatically). Future  versions of OpenIOC will include more flexible indicators and metadata extensions to the IoC  (comments, confidentiality, criticality, etc.).  The following pros and cons have been observed in relation to OpenIOC:  Pros  – Free (Apache 2 license)  – XML schema – can be extended as needed  – Three free software programs to create (IOC Editor), find (IOC Finder), and manipulate  (IOC_Writer python library) OpenIOC indicators  – Full support for Mandiant products  Cons  – Limited adoption (outside of Mandiant products)  – Limited support for network-based IoCs – more suitable for file-based IoCs  – OpenIOCs not easily integrated on IDS – viewed as a 'vendor' solution  – No support for describing tactics, techniques, and procedures  Figure 7: Sample of OpenIOC document for DUQU  35 :  <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"us-ascii\"?>  <ioc xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"  xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" id=\"72669174-dd77-4a4e-82ed-99a96784f36e\"  last-modified=\"2012-01-05T02:49:14\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.mandiant.com/2010/ioc\">  <short_description>DUQU (METHODOLOGY)</short_description>  <description>Indicator for the duqu trojan.

In this  effort, the MILE working group defined two main standards for describing (IODEF) and exchanging  (RID) incident information. Like all IETF standards, they benefit from the review of security,  application, and transport experts.  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 16  Although the current implementations of IODEF and RID are mostly limited to internal description  and local exchange of IoCs, the standards are designed to allow large scale sharing of complex  incidents and more projects are implementing them or are planning to do so36.  4.1.2.1 Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF)  The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) specification (RFC 5070,  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5070.txt) defines a data representation that provides a framework for  sharing information commonly exchanged by CERT teams about computer security incidents. It  provides an XML representation for conveying incident information across administrative domains  between parties that have an operational responsibility for remediation or watch-and-warning over  defined constituencies. The data model encodes information about hosts, networks, and the services  running on these systems; attack methodology and associated forensic evidence; the impact of the  activity; and limited approaches for documenting workflow.  The following pros and cons have been observed for IODEF:  Pros  – IETF Open Standard defined by CERTs and for CERTs  – Enables a collaborative effort  – Vendor neutral in origin  – Flexible format (XML) allowing for extensions and the grouping of events data  – Allows for the grouping of events data  Cons  – Limited adoption  – Incident data can contain sensitive information harder to share  – High granularity that can complicate implementation  Figure 8: XML-coded IODEF document reporting an instance of the Code Red worm37  <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>  <!-- This example demonstrates a report for a very  old worm (Code Red) -->  <IODEF-Document version=\"1.00\" lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iodef-1.0\"  xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"  xsi:schemaLocation=\"urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:iodef-1.0\">  <Incident purpose=\"reporting\">  <IncidentID name=\"csirt.example.com\">189493</IncidentID>  <ReportTime>2001-09-13T23:19:24+00:00</ReportTime>  <Description>Host sending out Code Red probes</Description>  <!-- An administrative privilege was attempted, but failed -->  <Assessment>  <Impact completion=\"failed\" type=\"admin\"/>  </Assessment>  <Contact role=\"creator\" type=\"organization\">  <ContactName>Example.com CSIRT</ContactName>  <RegistryHandle registry=\"arin\">example-com</RegistryHandle>  <Email>contact@csirt.example.com</Email>  </Contact>  <EventData>  <Flow>  36  The Anti-Phishing Working Group is using IODEF to distribute its security information to its members.

RID is flexible enough to exchange  other schemas/data models either embedded in IODEF or independent of IODEF, with a transport  binding using HTTP/TLS. RID is preferred for peer-to-peer models with higher levels of security and  privacy. This transport method enables increased automation over embedding the IODEF document  in, for example, a secured email.  The following up- and down-sides have been observed for RID:  Pros:  – Developed, reviewed, and published by the IETF  – Benefits from the community review of security, application, and transport experts  38  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6545  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6545  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 18  – Existing open source implementations tested for interoperability  – TLS offers mutual authentication and session encryption  – Object level security (XML encryption and digital signatures applied in a standard way)  Cons:  – Limited adoption  – High granularity that can complicate implementation  – Security options can lead to high implementation costs, ROLIE (Resource-Oriented  Lightweight Indicator Exchange)39 is more suitable if high trust model is not necessary.  4.1.3 CyboX, STIX, and TAXII  The Department of Homeland Security, the National Cyber Security Communications and Integration  Center, and US-CERT in the United States are at the forefront of efforts to automate and structure  operational cyber security information sharing techniques on a global scale40:   TAXII™, the Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information   STIX™, the Structured Threat Information eXpression   CybOX™, the Cyber Observable eXpression  TAXII, STIX, and CybOX (all free for public use) are community-driven technical specifications  designed to enable automated information sharing for cyber security situational awareness, real-  time network defence, and sophisticated threat analysis.

Organisations targeted by MACCSA include international and multinational bodies such as the EU  Military Staff, Europol, NATO, the U.S., countries from Europe and Asia/Pacific, and a number of  private companies such as security vendors, operators, industrial companies, and consultancies.  The ISF of MACCSA includes two main components: information sharing model and information  sharing management. The information sharing model describes the means required for sharing  information – proactive (push) and reactive (pull) – on alerts and warnings, best practices, and  security quality management and for handling proactive artefacts.  Information sharing management focuses on ensuring the quality of the shared information.  MACCSA proposes a mesh of hubs and nodes to coordinate information sharing. The model is based  on existing federated secure collaboration capabilities in defence, intelligence, and industry,  comprising independent entities bound together by information sharing agreements and further  united by collaborative and community-centric governance authorities.  44  http://www.federatedbusiness.org/mne7  45  The final MNE Cyber Transition meeting took take place in Brussels on 28/29 May, hosted and supported by  the European External Action Service (EEAS).  http://www.federatedbusiness.org/mne7  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 23  Challenges with Data Exchange Formats  '… there is no need to create new standards or specifications. The current need is to develop a system  that enables the aggregation of all basic components that are common in various feeds  independently from their source...'  – Rosella Mattioli, Information Exchange Framework for Cyber Security Incidents46  One outstanding issue known within the community is the considerable gap between the existence  and advancement of available data feed formats and their low, scattered, or unstable adoption.  Software packages developed to help CERTs deal with security incidents, such as RT/RTIR/AH etc.,  often do not easily enable the adoption of a range of data exchange formats. Additionally, many  CERTs use different standard data formats for automatic IoC exchange.  Currently, many interested parties develop their own parsers and other software tools, which help  them to deal with the incoming streams of security incident related feeds.  Another issue identified within the CERT community is the fact that, even when CERTs produce  automated incident-related feeds, usually formats can change without prior notice and problems  occur with timestamps/time zones or other details.  4.2 Examples of Current Efforts in Information Sharing Solutions  4.2.1 Malware Information Sharing Platform  The Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) has recently been released as open-source  software and as a successor to the previous project, Cydefsig47. The Belgian Defence CERT and the  NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) have actively developed the tool, while other  teams in Europe are now participating in its testing and development. The following are among the  main features of MISP:   Central IoC database – storing technical and non-technical information about malware and  attacks   Correlation – automatically creating relations between malware, events, and attributes   Storing data – in a structured format, allowing automated use of the database for various  purposes   Export – generating IDS, OpenIOC, plain text, and XML output to integrate with other  systems (network IDS, host IDS, custom tools, etc.)   Data sharing – automatic exchange and synchronisation with other parties and trust groups   Notification – automatic notification using PGP   Selective sharing – support for sharing specific attributes with specific communities  Six national/governmental CERTs have tested the MISP software. The results reveal the following:  46  http://institutional.07011979.org/Information_exchange_framework_for_cyber_security_incidents.pdf  47  https://github.com/MISP/MISP  http://institutional.07011979.org/Information_exchange_framework_for_cyber_security_incidents.pdf https://github.com/MISP/MISP  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 24   The software works well as long as the various teams are contributing.   Automatic notification using PGP is efficient.   Structured messages export (Snort rules or XML) works properly, but events synchronisation  (merging) could be improved.   MISP bloomfilter48 is an implementation tool that obtains XML data from MISP and builds  bloomfilter databases. The bloomfilter can be safely shared within CERTs’ constituencies  (e.g., Suricata NIDS and log files lookup).  The MISP user community claims to have achieved faster detection of targeted attacks, as well as  improvements to the detection ratio and confidence in detected suspicions, while reducing false  positives. It also avoids duplicating efforts, as it identifies quickly that other teams have already  worked on handling the specific malware.  Figure 13: The Red October/Sputnik Malware as Seen in MISP  49  48  A bloomfilter is a space-efficient fast data structure, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970. The set of objects is  stored in hashed form, which takes up less space. Different inputs can result in a same hash output; therefore a false  positive is possible when testing whether an element is present in the structure. A negative is always certain.  49 Source:  http://www.circl.lu/files/CIRCL-MISP.pdf  http://www.circl.lu/files/CIRCL-MISP.pdf  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 25  The example of Red October/Sputnik50 malware demonstrates the relationship with previous events  that have similar artifacts.  European CERTs discussed the MISP initiative at the face-to-face project workshop (see Overview of  the Methodology). Although not always familiar with the solution, the teams generally accepted  MISP's usefulness and called for a common approach as regards a common database of incidents,  while highlighting, for example, the problem of different taxonomies (in this respect, ENISA pointed  to its previous work in this area)51. However, some scepticism was voiced regarding the likelihood of  a quick agreement on common standards, let alone an agreement on solutions used. Workshop  participants also called for a central database of existing ticketing systems. Overcoming the legal and  political issues limiting IoC sharing may prove challenging, though.  4.2.2 Commercial Programs for Cyber Security  Microsoft, as a leading software vendor, has been active in the fight against cybercrime and, in 2010,  launched the project MARS52 (Microsoft Active Response for Security) to proactively combat  botnets. The information gathered from Microsoft's botnet operations is actively shared with ISPs  and CERTs.  The sharing of information on known botnet malware infections is now shared in real time with ISPs  and CERTs. The new Cyber Threat Intelligence Program52 (C-TIP) allow these organisations to have  better situational awareness of cyber threats and notify people of potential security issues with their  computers more quickly and efficiently.  Among the early adopters of the C-TIP cloud service are the INTECO-CERT from Spain as well as two  CERTs from Luxembourg, CIRCL and the Governmental CERT of Luxembourg. C-TIP allows ISPs and  CERTs to receive updated threat data related to infected computers in their specific country or  network approximately every 30 seconds. Participation allows these organisations almost instant  access to threat data generated from both previous and forthcoming MARS operations.  The system receives hundreds of millions of attempted check-ins daily from computers infected with  malware such as Conficker53, Waledac54, Rustock55, Kelihos56, Zeus57, Nitol58, and Bamital59. This data  50  Red October is a malware family, also known as Sputnik, which was detected in October 2012 by Kaspersky.  It has been active since 2007; installations have been spotted around the globe, with diplomatic and  governmental agencies targeted. The malware was usually sent by email to selected people in the respective  organisations. As a cover, different office file formats have been used to transport the malware loader, using  different exploits to drop the malicious content. After several stages of unpacking, the malware runs  persistently on the computer, and once it successfully probes internet connectivity, it decrypts a separate file  and starts to behave maliciously: it connects to a Command and Control server, awaiting new commands or  downloading and executing specific malware modules.

Currently, 44 organisations in 38 countries receive these threat  intelligence emails60. In addition to the mentioned CERTs a number of others have either signed up  for the new cloud service or are in the process of signing up.  The Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP)61 also needs to be mentioned. It was initially  directed at security software providers, but, in the second half of 2013 it was extended to CERTs.62  Members of MAPP receive security vulnerability information from the Microsoft Security Response  Center (MSRC) in advance of Microsoft's monthly security updates. When MAPP partners receive  vulnerability information early, they can provide updated protections to customers via their security  software or devices, such as antivirus, network-based intrusion detection systems, and/or host- based intrusion prevention systems.  It is also worth mentioning that many anti-virus companies provides specific and highly valuable  information to CERT teams on a more ad-hoc basis.  4.2.3 NATO CDXI  Cyber Security Data Exchange and Collaboration Infrastructure (CDXI) is a system that is developed  by NATO 63 . CDXI aims at serving as a repository for participants worldwide (individuals,  organisations, non-NATO entities, industry, government, and academic institutions) that will  automatically push and pull cyber defence data using a variety of application programming  interfaces (APIs). Quality assurance of data and data confidentiality are integral to the CDXI design,  and, in order to achieve the right balance of information protection (i.e., sharing with appropriate  parties) and openness of the network, confidentiality and access control are implemented based on  user, role, and NATO classification level.  CDXI data is structured for machine processing and automation but will also have a human-readable  component. It will be integrated with cyber security appliances by means of standard APIs. To  ensure a large community of adopters, NATO is considering making CDXI freely available.  60  Status: May 2013  61  http://www.microsoft.com/security/msrc/collaboration/mapp.aspx#  62  http://threatpost.com/microsoft-expands-mapp-program-to-incident-response-teams  63  iego Fern nde  ue  et al., “Conceptual Framework for Cyber Defense Information Sharing within Trust  Relationships”, 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict  http://www.microsoft.com/security/msrc/collaboration/mapp.aspx http://threatpost.com/microsoft-expands-mapp-program-to-incident-response-teams  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 27  Figure 14: CDXI targeted architecture 64  CDXI ultimately aims at:   Transporting cyber defence data between organisations through a resilient global  infrastructure   Feeding defence data directly into automated applications   Providing assurance of the data's origin and quality   Providing access controls for confidentiality   Providing tools to collaborate on improving the data   Enabling commercial exploitation  Among CDXI's mutually dependent benefits highlighted by its developers are:   Reduced costs – adopting new standards and data sets without the need to incur further  development costs, smooth deployment for all sizes and structures of organisation thanks  64 Source: Luc Dandurand, Cyber Defence Data Exchange and Collaboration Infrastructure (CDXI), an ITU-T  workshop addressing security challenges on a global scale; see: http://www.slideserve.com/nalani/cyber- defence-data-exchange-and-collaboration-infrastructure-cdxi  Law  Enforcement  Org.

The main goal of the project is to collect security-related  data from multiple sources and provide mechanisms to effectively query, correlate, and share it. CIF  evolved from the Security Event System – a project with similar goals, also developed by REN-ISAC –  and is currently funded through a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant.  CIF is internally implementing IODEF, while interoperability of tools using IODEF is enforced through  a scheme that is part of the Request for Comments (RFC)66. Adoption of IODEF means that every  element of information that is a part of an incident report has well-defined semantics. The system  periodically generates feeds of recent reports for every type of threat based on the means that can  be used to identify a particular threat, such as an IP address, URL, or cryptographic hash. CIF  periodically runs a set of data enrichment routines (analytics) on newly collected events. CIF also  integrates with the Team Cymru Hash Registry service to check malware hashes67, looks up entries in  the Spamhaus68 database, and uses the normal DNS infrastructure to extract addresses and name  servers (A and NS records) for domains.  Over 200 users are on the CIF mailing list69, including national and private CERTs, private researchers,  and corporate security teams from around the world; also in developing countries the emerging  equivalents of CERTs are turning to CIF to obtain information. Contrary to other information  exchange platforms, which rely on various “threat languages”, CIF focuses on getting the data in the  output format preferred by the user, whether it is STIX, JSON pairs, CSV, or Snort rules.  65  http://www.ren-isac.net/  66  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5070  67  Team Cymru Hash Registry: http://www.team-cymru.org/Services/MHR/  68  See http://www.spamhaus.org/  69  Status: Sept. 2013  http://www.ren-isac.net/ http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5070 http://www.team-cymru.org/Services/MHR/ http://www.spamhaus.org/  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 29  Figure 15: CIF Architecture  70  Figure 16: Submitting Data through CIF Web Interface 71  70  Source: https://code.google.com/p/collective-intelligence-framework/  71 Source: http://collective-intelligence-framework.googlecode.com/files/2013_MAAWG_wesyoung.pdf  https://code.google.com/p/collective-intelligence-framework/ http://collective-intelligence-framework.googlecode.com/files/2013_MAAWG_wesyoung.pdf  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 30  Figure 17: Data Querying Through CIF Web Interface  72  72 Source: http://collective-intelligence-framework.googlecode.com/files/2013_MAAWG_wesyoung.pdf  http://collective-intelligence-framework.googlecode.com/files/2013_MAAWG_wesyoung.pdf  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 31  5 Recommendations  'Look at what is already there; use existing platforms for CERT cooperation; and just  facilitate the needs of CERTs. Don't invent new stuff just for the sake of it, because it's  fancy.'  –  One of the surveyed CERTs  The above quote pretty much summarises the need for action in the area of exchange and sharing of  information on incidents: better utilise current communication tools and practices! It is important to  make tools and practices more interoperable, irrespective of which incident feeds, information  exchange formats, or ticketing systems are used. After all, the core idea behind the sharing of  information on incidents is that local detection, accompanied with trusted forms of information  exchange, will ultimately lead to improved prevention of cyber incidents on a global scale. The  probability of identifying (and subsequently handling an incident) is much greater if it is detected by  several CERTs that share this information.  5.1 Recommendation 1: ENISA should facilitate the adoption of Essential  Tools for the CERT Community  The sharing of information among CERTs on an efficient (automated) basis assumes that the teams  first effectively handle the information on incidents internally. This requires the adoption of specific  tools by CERTs that relate to ticket tracking and automated incident information processing (RTIR  and Abuse Helper are among the most popular tools used by the teams). CERTs interested in  working together on RT/RTIR/AH upgrades and improvements should synchronise their efforts.  Whenever CERTs require new functionalities, demand arises for expert developers, a resource CERTs  usually lack. CERTs can seek funding from the EU’s research and technology programs for updates  and upgrades.  These programmes often include, as a condition for financing, the participation of multiple parties or  consortia. Such a cooperative software adaptation and improvement approach could be tested in  relation to the specific needs of the CERT community, as well as being further used to create new  tools if the need should surface. These efforts should be of the bottom-up type in terms of software  development strategies and facilitated with top-down coordination within the community of CERTs.  CERTs are encouraged to request that ENISA facilitates the adoption, coherence, and interoperability  of these tools via training sessions at ENISA CERT workshops or via other arrangements.  5.2 Recommendation 2: Security information providers should improve the  stability of existing incident information feeds  Many CERTs appreciate receiving automated feeds from established services (Shadowserver, Zeus  Tracker, Malware Domain List, etc.) and from other CERTs to inform their constituencies about  infections. However, feed formats are often changed by their publishers without prior notice. As  many parties emphasise, this particular problem is even more troublesome than the fact that many  feed publishers do not adhere to the standardised feed formats and create their own feed  templates. CERTs have indicated that it is less problematic to create a parser for a new format of  XML or CSV feed than to deal with the ever-changing feed formats.  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 32  One way to overcome these issues is the employment of “soft” tools, such as published reports,  workshops, webinars, seminars, and conferences, in order to encourage improved behaviour among  the feed publishers, especially:   Wider adoption of some of the best standards of data format for the automated sharing of  indicators of compromise (IODEF, STIX, OpenIOC, etc.)   Wider adoption of 'good community citizen' behaviour, like establishing a minimal  notification period for sharing feed format updates  It must be emphasised that any recommendations regarding setting and promoting better standards  for automated information exchange feeds must be thoroughly discussed and supported by the  community, especially by feed publishers and users (CERTs). The right platform for discussing the  aspects of the continuity of feeds could be organisations and events that bring CERTs together.  ENISA will further investigate these areas and provide adequate and appropriate support for  CERTs and their projects.  The previous two recommendations are natural and unavoidable, considering the state of issues with  tools that help the European CERT community participants to fulfil their roles. The next few  recommendations were not designed to be followed all in parallel – rather, they represent scenarios  the CERT community may choose to follow. Hence, they are more of a set of alternatives, rather than  a to-do list  5.3 Recommendation 3: CERTs should coordinate to enhance functionalities  of existing tools for more effective data sharing within the community  As previously stated (Recommendation 1), technical barriers may present a hindrance to the  adoption of essential information management tools. The same applies to information-sharing  solutions.  A more crucial need than formal feed format standardisation is the enhancement of existing  software tools for information sharing, processing, analysis, and presentation. It is unlikely that any  commercial, non-governmental, or other organisation will create a tool that fits everybody’s need  and will resolve all outstanding issues and be accepted and adopted by all CERTs and other cyber  security stakeholders. It is rather safe to assume that the software tools ecosystem will continue to  be fragmented, yet vibrant. It will consist of many small solutions and tools for solving specific  problems. The following are among the functionalities to enhance existing tools and support  interoperability in incident data sharing:  - First and foremost, interoperability for cross-hub and cross-platform sharing  - Correlation engines for incident analysis  - Advanced analytics and visualisation for massive numbers of incidents  - Automatic prioritisation features  All of these classes (and more) of software tools will have to be enhanced in order to enable CERTs  to cope with the ever-increasing demands of the modern cyber security environment. However,  most CERTs do not have developers working for them. Again, it is possible to access EU funds for  information society projects. The actual development of enhanced tools would come from the  bottom up (e.g., developers embedded at CERTs who are cooperating internationally).  ENISA will support these efforts by offering targeted training upon request from the n/g CERT  community. Whenever appropriate and feasible, ENISA will actively support community driven  efforts in this area.  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 33  5.4 Recommendation 4: A central trusted body at the cross-border level  should develop a common incident information repository with the  integration of current data exchange efforts  While CERTs are largely satisfied with the tools in use today, some see the benefits of a hypothetical  new central service offering an information repository for n/g CERTs in Europe. Such a repository  would include CERTs' contact information to facilitate incident detection and information correlation  (DNS, ASN, and IP ranking) and a repository for past incident information, with options for sorting  and filtering the database of archived information. Access to the shared incident repository should  be convenient. The user could create and manage groups with other registered users and share  information with those particular groups. This repository would have functionalities to send  notifications based on severity or other criteria, such as IP addresses, ASNs, and ranges  (constituency, country, community of interest, etc.).  In the perspective of one stakeholder:  'What could be done is to build a common attack database, or repository, with major input from  CERTs – one containing the methods and characteristics attackers employ and the attack tactics and  techniques they use – so that we can adapt to new avenues of attack and identify common patterns.'  However, it is widely believed that trust issues could make generating sharing practices and  managing access rights to such shared repositories more troublesome than building the tool itself. A  progressive approach, initially targeting useful but insensitive information (a contact repository),  would facilitate the adoption of this infrastructure. In the medium term, this platform would offer  brokering facilities to exchange information among existing sharing communities of n/g CERTs. A  trusted organisation like FIRST, TI, or ENISA could support this service so as to encourage all n/g  CERTs to join such a global sharing effort.  In 2014, ENISA will carry out a project aiming at providing better support to CERTs in the area  exchanging and processing of actionable information, with the goal to, in accordance with the  CERT community and as much as possible, engage in this coordination role.  5.5 Recommendation 5: Bridge Sharing CERT Communities in Europe  The 'perfect' scenario for enhancing sharing practices in the CERTs community would include  building a bridging platform that would extend existing communities and broker information across  these communities. Such a cross-hub exchange would require:  - Local adoption of interoperable standards of data formats (e.g. IODEF, STIX, etc.)  - The definition of diffusion policy standards (e.g., CDXI Information diffusion policy), thus  enabling more complex schemes than Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)  - Coordination at international level  At the EU level, this inter-exchange effort could be entrusted to the CERT community and supported  by ENISA.  In 2014, ENISA will further improve its abilities to provide active support for their key stakeholders  in this area.

Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page  iv  Executive Summary  The ever increasing complexity of cyber-attacks requires more effective information sharing among  Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs). Local detection, accompanied by trusted forms of  information exchange, leads to global prevention of cyber-attacks. In other words, it is very  beneficial for the successful identification (and subsequent handling) of an incident, if it has already  been detected by CERTs sharing this information. Furthermore, effective information sharing saves  time and effort in incident response and post-mortem analysis, increases synergies and aligns  practices among CERTs.  Much progress has been made recently in establishing national/governmental (n/g) CERTs in Europe.  All these teams, which are at different maturity levels, actively take on the job of coordinating  responses to cyber-attacks. As the nature of cyber-attacks is often global, it is crucial that responses  to these incidents are coordinated not only within national boundaries, but also at a cross-border  level. In order for this to happen, secure and effective information exchange and the sharing of  information on such incidents must take place.  Despite fruitful cooperation between many CERTs (n/g and others) bringing visible results in  improving cyber security in EU member states (for example TI Certification or TRANSITS CERT  trainings), the teams still face obstacles that work against seamless security information exchange  and sharing. The key problems for effective information sharing are legal and technical barriers, as  well as lack of interest from cybersecurity stakeholders in sharing information.  While trying to promote interoperability of solutions and cooperation between CERTs,  improvements to information sharing must build on existing solutions and standardisation efforts in  data exchange formats. A number of recent initiatives aim to streamline and make data sharing  effective among CERTs1. These initiatives are being developed by (n/g and other sector) CERTs in  Europe, by NATO, or by private companies and are driven by “cyber community” interests. Some of  them have already attracted solid user communities, and they tend to be user-friendly and flexible,  as they are mostly open source.  It is important to make all these approaches interoperable, irrespective of incident feeds,  information exchange formats, or the ticketing systems used.  ENISA has identified a set of recommendations targeted to itself, the CERT community and other  security actors aiming at:   Promoting the continuity of incident feeds, which are often changed without prior notice   Making existing tools interoperable and promoting the use of standards for data exchange   Enhancing the functionality of existing tools as regards:  o Interoperability  o Correlation engines for incident analysis  o Improved threat intelligence  o Advanced analytics and visualisation for massive numbers of incidents  o Automatic prioritisation  The European Union, including ENISA, can help n/g CERTs in this process, which will further facilitate  the exchange among them of information on incidents.  1  These initiatives are discussed in more detail throughout the report.

It aims  at:   Taking stock of existing communication solutions and practices among European CERTs   Identifying the functional and technical gaps that limit threat intelligence exchange between  n/g CERTs and their counterparts in Europe, as well as other CERTs within their respective  countries   Defining basic requirements for improved communications interoperable with existing  solutions  This report aims at building on existing solutions and promoting achievable good practices, rather  than offer unrealistic “revolutionary” solutions. It needs to be said that this is an overview of a  quickly evolving domain, which necessitates frequent updates in line with the evolving environment  of cybersecurity and cybercrime.  1.2 Europe’s Involvement in Supporting Secure and Effective Information  Exchange and Sharing  Many EU documents have stressed the importance of CERTs, especially their early warning and  incident response capabilities. Most recently, a proposal for a Directive on network and information  security2, which accompanies the EU Cyber Security Strategy3, addressed the topic of secure  information systems. Article 9 of the proposal for the Directive states that the exchange of sensitive  and confidential information shall take place through secure infrastructure.  The European Commission is empowered to adopt supplementary acts on the definition of criteria  to be fulfilled by EU member states in order to be authorised to participate in the secure information  system regarding the following:  a) The availability of secure and resilient communication and information infrastructure at a  national level, compatible and interoperable with the secure infrastructure of the  cooperation network  b) The existence of adequate technical, financial, and human resources, as well as processes for  the relevant competent authority and CERT, to allow effective, efficient, and secure  participation in the secure information-sharing system  1.3 ENISA’s Involvement in the Area of Secure Communication and  Information Sharing among CERTs  ENISA aims at supporting the process of establishing secure systems for information sharing, like the  one mentioned in the draft Directive. Since 2005, ENISA has been running a programme dedicated to  the capability building of national/governmental CERTs. A recent ENISA project resulted in a good  2  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online- freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  3  Ibid.  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 2  practice guide for CERTs on honeypots for the proactive detection of IT security incidents.4 ENISA  also maintains training and exercise material focussing on enhancing the capabilities of CERTs in EU  Member States (and beyond).5 The emphasis was put on practical and applicable material about  current technical and operational topics, and ENISA intends to continue maintaining and extending  its CERT training library in the coming years. At the same time, ENISA is paying increased attention to  the legal aspects of information sharing.6  One of the more in-depth studies commissioned by ENISA in recent years was  Proactive Detection  of  Network  Security  Incidents 7. This community-driven effort investigated  proactive ways in which CERTs detect incidents targeting and affecting their constituencies,  identified good practices and common mistakes, and recommended options for improvement.  ENISA also dealt with the specific topic of secure communication between CERTs and produced a  report entitled Secure Communication with the CERTs and Other Stakeholders 8. The focus of the  earlier work was rather on communication channels (PGP, S/MIME, VPN, etc.). The 2013 project  aims at a broader and more pragmatic approach by taking into consideration all collaborative tools  like sharing infrastructures, messaging systems, ticketing systems, incident handling and notification  systems, and so forth. These tools are hereafter referred to as communication solutions – used by  CERT teams in the exchange of information between them.  1.4 Target Audience and Scope  The intended target audience for this report is primarily the national/governmental CERTs but in  principle it is applicable for any kind of CERT, in Europe and worldwide. The report is tailored to be  useful for both well-established CERTs and new/upcoming teams.  4  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-of-security- incidents-II-honeypots  5  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  6  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/legal-information-sharing  7  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-report  8  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/files/secure-communication  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-of-security-incidents-II-honeypots http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-of-security-incidents-II-honeypots http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/legal-information-sharing http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-report http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/files/secure-communication  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 3  2 Overview of the Methodology  For the purposes of this report, several methodological approaches (in addition to basic desk  research) were applied: surveys, interviews, and a dedicated workshop that enabled a free exchange  of ideas between the interested stakeholders – national/governmental CERTs.  Survey  A survey was developed on the current communication practices of CERTs vis-à-vis other CERTs in  their respective countries, their counterparts in other countries, and operators and ISPs. A total of  27 teams have responded to the survey, with the majority (63%) of them being  national/governmental CERTs in Europe. While the majority of the responding teams came from EU  countries, responses also came from the U.S., Asia, and the Middle East9.  Figure 1: Completed Survey by CERT Type  Interviews  Based on the survey output, accompanying interviews were held with stakeholders in order to clarify  and go beyond the replies received. These interviews were held electronically, via email  correspondence, and actually in person in one case. In total, 12 interviews were conducted.  Face-to-Face Workshop  During a TF-CSIRT10 meeting in Bucharest, a face-to-face workshop was held on 24 May 2013. At the  meeting, the interim results of the project were presented to the participants (14 in total). Also, the  participants presented and discussed initiatives aimed at enhancing the communication practices of  CERTs.  9  Responding teams came from: Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, European Union,  Finland, France, Greece, Hong Kong/China, Japan, Latvia, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Romania, Slovenia, South  Korea, Spain, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, USA  10  TERENA’s Task Force CSIRT promotes collaboration and coordination between CERT teams in Europe.

First it provides a summary of main communication solutions used by the teams,  followed by identification of barriers and requirements for such effective and information exchange.  3.1 Overview of n/g CERTs' Communication Practices and Solutions  It is noteworthy that the main communication practices between n/g CERTs from different member  states do not differ from those between n/g CERTs and other CERTs in the same country (see Figure  2).  Figure 2: Use of Communication Solutions among CERTs  Number of respondents: 27 CERTs  3.1.1 Secure and Regular Email  'Secure email is the preferred way of communicating, mainly because it is easy to use, simple,  and flexible, allows for fast communication, and, most importantly, is the most common tool  everyone can support.'  – One of the surveyed CERTs  Secure and/or regular email is by far the most popular communication solution used in CERTs’  everyday operations.  Email communication has a few features that make it an optimal tool for sharing unstructured  information between organisations. It is truly universal (everyone uses email), interoperable (it  works on almost any operating system), asynchronous (users do not have to be logged in at the  same time), and can carry attachment files of any type (albeit limited by size).  For the purposes of  secure communication, email can be encrypted, ideally by using asymmetric encryption methods.  24  19  6 5  2 1  7 7  26 23  7 6  2 1 2  4  12  22  5 4  2 0  4 4  0  5  10  15  20  25  30  Secure Email (PGP/SMIME)  Normal Email IRC Jabber Skype Lync Telephone Other (custom solutions, personal  meetings, web interfaces)  Communication with other CERTs in the same country  Communication with CERTs counterparts in Europe  Communication with operators/ISPs and Industry  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 5  Most of the queried CERTs have reported that they are using PGP encryption11 for the purposes of  secure information exchange within the CERT community, while S/MIME is used more rarely. Secure  email with PGP is an informally adopted standard within the CERT community and the wider Internet  security community in general.  While the use of secure email is common in the CERT community, both the survey and conversations  with CERT representatives revealed that other stakeholders (ISPs, public administration, police, etc.)  lack the culture of secure communication in general: Communication between CERTs and other  parties therefore happens most often via unencrypted email.  Due to a certain degree of impracticality of secure email in everyday use, CERTs often decide on a  case-by-case basis whether to send information via secure email, regular email, or another solution,  such as fast and easy-to-use chat clients.  Worldwide, CERTs communicate primarily with their counterparts in other countries, but they also  communicate with ISPs and system administrators, for example when a particular incident is not  covered by a particular CERT. On a national level CERTs communicate most often with ISPs.  The majority of CERTs are satisfied with PGP-encrypted email as the basis for secure information  exchange in their everyday operations. The incident-related sensitive information that is typically  shared is only partly structured, is text-based (therefore easily compressible), and is often both  machine- and human-readable. Furthermore, email as an information transportation mechanism is  open and universal, which CERT experts truly appreciate.  While many CERTs admit that secure and regular email may not be quite optimal tools for  information sharing in general and within the CERT community in particular, a commonly shared  opinion was that any better tool would be virtually impossible to implement due to diverse  requirements from different teams. However, CERTs are facing an ever increasing amount of data  related to incidents, and secure email communication doesn’t scale easily. Teams reported that  management of PGP- or S/MIME keys gets more and more complex as the number or recipients  grows, that emails are difficult to process automatically and that they can’t cope with large data  volumes or high rate of incidents due to this shortcomings. In order to reflect the changing  requirements for information exchange due to large volumes and lack of common structure, some  CERTs look into alternatives. It should be noted, that sharing of more data is not necessarily an  improvement per se. Instead, it is important to pay attention to the quality rather than to the  quantity of information.  3.1.2 Instant Messaging  The landscape of instant messaging solutions in use in the CERT community is fragmented. Solutions  include (in order of popularity): IRC12, Jabber/XMPP13, Skype14, and Lync15. No solution was found to  be a clear leader in popularity; however, IRC and Jabber were generally mentioned more often than  Skype and Lync.  A few interviewed CERTs stressed that, while chat clients are not absolutely crucial to their daily  operations, they are indeed helpful and must be included in this guide.  11  See http://www.imc.org/smime-pgpmime.html on PGP and S/MIME  12  See http://www.irc.org  13  See http://xmpp.org  14  See http://www.skype.com  15  See http://lync.microsoft.com  http://www.imc.org/smime-pgpmime.html http://www.irc.org/ http://xmpp.org/ http://www.skype.com/ http://lync.microsoft.com/  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 6  In contrast to email, IM typically requires both (or more) communicating parties to be present at  their terminals at the same time so as to communicate almost instantly. Chat clients facilitate the  rapid exchange of ideas and technical details, while giving the users instant feedback and a platform  for an active, real-time discussion. As a communication tool, the IM family is considered to be of  lower latency and less formal than email. Although solutions exist to secure instant messaging  communication16, a minority of teams uses them. The solutions in use today can be considered more  as supportive rather than as primary communication channels.  3.1.3 Secure Message Boards and Closed Mailing Lists  Interviews have shown that, apart from obvious tools such as secure email and instant messaging,  another class of decades-old and still very useful tools – closed Mailing List (i.e. TI-accredited CSIRTs,  or ENISA N/G CERTs ML) and message boards or forums – have also proved useful in secure  information sharing among the CERT community. These fora allow groups of authenticated users to  share and discuss security-incident-related insights. They provide ways to communicate with a  whole spectrum of trusted experts, while providing strong security mechanisms; for example, to  have access to it, one needs to be invited by one established member of a given forum and to be  recommended by another.  3.1.4 Incident Handling and Ticketing Systems  Figure 3: Use of Ticketing and Incident Tracking Solutions  Number of respondents: 25 CERTs  Almost all CERTs report that they are using some kind of ticketing or incident tracking system. The  most popular ticketing system was found to be Request Tracker17 (RT). Request Tracker for Incident  Response18 (RTIR) was found to be the most popular tool for incident response tracking –  unsurprisingly so, as the tool is a purpose-built product for the computer security community.  Another tool developed for CERTs and ISPs, AbuseHelper19, was found to be the most popular for the  purposes of automatic process incident notifications. Other solutions the interviewed CERTs use  include the BMC Remedy Action Request System20 (BMC ARS), the Open Source Ticket Request  System21 (OTRS), and MS Sharepoint22-based or MS Excel-based in-house ticketing systems.  RT and RTIR  16  See OTR http://otr.cypherpunks.ca/ or http://safetyjabber.com/  17  See http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/  18  See http://bestpractical.com/rtir/  19  See http://abusehelper.be  20  See http://www.bmc.com  21  See http://www.otrs.com  22  See http://sharepoint.microsoft.com  6  5  4  1  8  1  0  5  10  RTIR Abuse Helper RT (without the IR plugin)  OTRS Other None  http://otr.cypherpunks.ca/ http://safetyjabber.com/ http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/ http://bestpractical.com/rtir/ http://abusehelper.be/ http://www.bmc.com/ http://www.otrs.com/ http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 7  CERTs recognise and appreciate that RTIR has, in fact, been designed with the CERT community in  mind, and together with that community. RT-based platforms are recognised to be working  adequately for the specific purposes of CERTs. They are believed to have the most optimised  workflow out of the box, are integrated with email (including the handling of the PGP security  protocol), and are flexible, easily customisable, extendable, and interoperable with other systems.  Multiple users are able to handle the same incident, and reports are easily generated. User  interfaces include a web interface, email, a command line tool, and programmable application  programming interfaces (APIs). Some teams reported having problems when handling large amounts  of data related to a ticket or when using the automatic incident notification. They are now looking  for alternatives.  3.1.5 Customer Relationship Management Systems  A significant majority of CERTs do not use customer relationship management (CRM) systems. Those  that do, use CRM solutions delivered by Oracle, SAP, Microsoft or other parties, with no clear leader  among the mentioned systems.  3.2 Barriers to and Requirements for Information Exchange and Sharing  Figure 4: Main Obstacles to More Secure and Effective Communication  Number of respondents: 22 CERTs  Technical issues were identified as the most common barrier to more effective information  exchange between CERTs. These technical issues mainly concern the automated exchange of data  about security incidents. Another issue mentioned was the quality of the data23.  One solution for automated processing of incident reports is the already mentioned tool  AbuseHelper. Even though, as shown in Figure 3, it is used by only five out of a sample of 25 CERTs  right now, many other CERTs are also looking into using it. AbuseHelper has the potential to become  23  In 2014, ENISA will carry out a project for good practice in this field.  8  16  12  9 9  3  10 10  12 12  5 4  12 11 11  6  11  1  0  5  10  15  20  Legal Technical Procedural Trust issues Insufficient interest of the  partners  No crucial barriers  Other CERTs in the same country  CERTs of the same type/constituency in another state  Operator/ISPs or Industry  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 8  the most popular tool for this purpose24, or at least build the basis for a tailor-made in-house  solution that, according also to other studies25 many teams apply (in Figure 3, these are collated in  the ‘Other’ category).  We have identified a consensus in the CERT community with regard to the severity of challenges in  the daily operations of CERTs. Technical barriers, though being most common, are generally thought  to be more easily overcome than legal issues. As for information exchange with CERTs of the same  type in other states, legal barriers and trust issues are more often cited as hindering this exchange.  Additionally, CERTs often cite a low level of interest among operators in sharing information they  have or in acting upon the information CERTs shared with them.  3.2.1 Legal and Procedural Obstacles and Requirements  Issues around the legal and procedural aspects of information exchange between CERTs and other  stakeholders were among the most frequently cited, both in the survey and especially in the in- depth interviews.  Essentially, CERTs and other similar organisations have doubts about whether a particular set of  information can be shared at all, with whom, on what conditions, after what treatment, and so on.  CERTs are often unsure about what sort of information can be exchanged so as not to pose legal  questions regarding data protection and privacy protection. Privacy commissioners in various EU  member states have a range of interpretations of how personal information is defined. For example,  an IP address can qualify as personal information in one country but not in another. Categorisation is  another issue in terms of which types of personal data should receive the highest level of protection.  Due to such privacy questions being complex at times, extensive information sharing between CERTs  and other actors is often inhibited.  According to some opinions, the legal problems do not only result from lack of harmonisation of  data protection law across the EU, but also in the different interpretations of the law by different  bodies.  Interviewees often indicated that these problems are even more severe than the technical  challenges mentioned before, like a lack of a web portal or other means.  Many interviewees claimed that, in order to help with the issues described here, common standards  should emerge in the interpretation of data protection law across the EU, at least in matters relating  to cyber security incidents (which is out of scope of this particular report). For more information on  the legal aspects of information sharing, see the ENISA study entitled A Flair for Sharing –  Encouraging Information Exchange between CERTs.26  On the operational side, with incidents that require looking up details on entities that are  responsible for URLs and IP addresses under investigation, a European forum exists that has a  database of all European IPs and their corresponding owners (the Regional Internet Registry27, or  RIPE); however, the data in this registry is quite difficult to retrieve, and it can sometimes be  impossible to find the entity responsible for an IP address.  24  ENISA will further investigate how to support the community more actively in the field of automated  processing of actionable information in 2014  25  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-report  26  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/legal-information-sharing  27  See http://www.ripe.net  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-report http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/legal-information-sharing http://www.ripe.net/  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 9  3.2.2  Trust Issues – Barriers and Requirements  'The single most important requirement is trust. Trust can germinate through real-life  contact and grows with regular (virtual) meeting. A secure European platform for  communication can facilitate – but never replace – trust.'  – One of the surveyed CERTs  Trust issues are among the most crucial obstacles to enhanced and effective communication  between CERTs and other stakeholders. Some interviewees have pointed out that, in the particular  community of cybersecurity experts, trust is the single most important feature of a successful  cooperative relationship.  To illustrate the consequences of a lack of trust between stakeholders, one of the interviewees  noted that they had even stopped sharing security incident information with people/organisations  that had committed actions that had destroyed trust between the parties, meaning that no further  information was exchanged between the parties. Also, trust is undermined when only one party is  active in sharing information, without getting much in return from the other party.  Situations in which trust between members of the community is diminishing or non-existent have  the immediate effect of undermining the value of information shared: the size of the community. As  a general observation it can be stated that the larger a sharing community is, the less valuable and  less sensitive is the information and the less timely is the sharing.  In other words, trust doesn’t scale  and needs to be paired with effective information sharing tools28. Protocols such as TLP allow for  information to be shared in a more structured way in face-to-face communication.  3.2.3 Insufficient Interest from Partners  Within the realms of CERT-to-CERT communication, insufficient interest from partners is a very rare  phenomenon. Only five of the teams responded like this.  Conversely, the in-depth interviews have confirmed the rich culture of information sharing present  within the European CERT community. Typically, CERTs are not only willing to share security incident  information as it happens but also to write up summary reports and share them with the  community. These reports are typically very well received and appreciated within the CERT  community; however, due to very heavy workloads, they are often delayed. When CERTs are  handling an incident, experts focus on its mitigation and on coordination with others, and they  sometimes lack the time to share reports with other CERTs. Large-scale incidents are a primary  example of a situation that sparks report writing and sharing. The culture of information sharing and  demand for it is definitely not an issue, but workloads are often a major inhibitor.  3.2.4 Technical Barriers and Requirements  'Every communication channel with each partner or type of partner CSIRT is unique. This does  not scale well, and to have more fruitful, 'full-duplex', trusted engagements, standard  procedures and protocols need to be established and relied upon.'  – One of the surveyed CERTs  Before moving into discussing the more technical side of issues regarding secure information  exchange within the CERT community, it needs to be stated again that many interviewees  mentioned that, compared with legal, procedural, and trust issues, technical deficiencies, such as the  lack of a web portal or incident repository and the proliferation of communication channels, are of  28  In 2014 ENISA will carry out a project in the area of trust building among or within communities  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 10  less significance. It is easier to find a common ground on overcoming these technical barriers than  solving complicated international legal issues often pertaining to the areas of national interests and  sovereignty.  Nevertheless, technical issues do exist:   Many CERTs appreciate receiving automated feeds from some CERTs, using them to inform  their constituencies about infections; however, feeds are often found to be problematic due  to:  o format changes without prior notice,  o timestamp/time zone issues,  o information coming very late after the incident is noticed, which means CERTs  typically work on each case separately to treat/react to the incidents,  o data received regarding incidents contains not enough information to launch an  investigation.   Formats of regularly shared information, starting with a reasonable taxonomy of the  information, needs improvement; many standards exist in the cybersecurity field, but  organisations keep on doing ad hoc CSV-like exchanges.   CERTs often lack good quality software to build up and maintain the basic database a CERT  needs for a number of functions (a special kind of CRM for CERT work):  o IP to Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) mapping (current, historical)  o IP to country mapping (current, historical)  o Domain to registrar mapping  o Contact information for all these  o Keeping track of the quality of contacts.   Dealing with abundant false positive detections – teams use various tools that produce  varying numbers of false positives.   Many CERTs use in-house software solutions, which they also find hard to maintain due to a  general lack of software development resources. In addition, very few tools are widely  adopted in the CERT community.   Some of the incident tracking systems cannot handle large numbers of tickets.   It may be difficult to export data from a given tracking system and link it to another system  (systems compatibility issues).   A centralised web-based service is lacking for the exchange of structured information.  Additional and more detailed technical discussions of barriers and requirements for the automated  exchange of network security information can be found in two reports: Proactive Detection of  Network Security Incidents29 and Proactive Detection and Automated Exchange of Network Security  Incidents30.  When asked about priorities with regard to a potential secure European platform for communication  among CERTs, surveyed teams put the highest emphasis on security aspects (confidentiality,  integrity, and authenticity) when exchanging information with their peers (see Figure 5:  Requirements for a potential Secure European Platform for Communication among CERTs):  Functionality ranks just behind. On the other hand, cost aspects are not as crucial as technical ones,  indicating that, in order to achieve the high level of security required, the teams are inclined to  invest reasonable sums into effective communication solutions.  29  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-report  30  http://www.cert.pl/PDF/MP-IST-111-18.pdf  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-report http://www.cert.pl/PDF/MP-IST-111-18.pdf  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 11  Figure 5: Requirements for a potential Secure European Platform for Communication among CERTs  Number of respondents: 23 CERTs  Note: The total score was calculated by multiplying the number of responses for the given criterion by the  ranking on a scale of 1–5.  3.2.5 Other Barriers and Requirements  The oft-quoted problem in effective information exchange is the workload, which is sometimes so  heavy among CERTs that they do not have the time to write reports and share them with the  community. When handling an incident, teams are often focused on its mitigation and immediate  coordination with others and therefore do not always have the time to share lessons learned with  other CERTs afterwards (which, from time to time, will happen after major incidents). This lack of  post-processing of important incidents is considered most useful by all responding teams, alas  extensive workload in day-to-day operation is a major obstacle, besides the fact that tools are not  optimized to support these wrap-up reports.  99  92  85 80 74  0  20  40  60  80  100  120  very high (score: 5)  high (score: 4)  average (score: 3)  low (score: 2)  very low (score: 1)  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 12  4 Data Exchange Formats and Current Efforts for Secure and Effective Data  Exchange  Figure 6: Mapping of Standardisation and Solutions for Response, Incident, and IoC Information Sharing  Several practices have emerged in Europe and worldwide that aim at addressing effective  information exchange and sharing data about cyber incidents (as identified in the survey; see Section  3). These efforts can be considered as possible approaches to secure information exchange as  envisaged by the EU Cyber Security Strategy and the draft Directive on Network and Information  Security31. The following sections of this chapter include illustrative examples of initiatives on  information exchange standards and current efforts in the area of secure and effective  communication about incidents.  31  See the Article 9 (Secure information-sharing system) of the proposed Directive.  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1666  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1666  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 13  Any piece of information that can be  used to search for or identify potentially  compromised systems is known as an  indicator of compromise (IoC). These  IoCs can include IP address/domain  name, URL, file hash, email address, X- mailer, HTTP user agent, and file mutex.  This information can be compiled into  incident reports and enriched with  analysis and remediation reports.  Several standards exist for formatting  information, however there is not a single leading one in place. However, the trend to share  structured information rather than unstructured in plan emails can be observed.  While, as  mentioned, there is currently no single standard for data format that is generally accepted, it is  crucial for an automated processing of received information! We provide an overview of existing  standards below (section 4.1), followed by the summary and discussion of known challenges related  to automated IoC exchanges.  Multiple initiatives exist, or are currently in development, that aim to address the aforementioned  barriers (see 0) in a systematic way: CERTs still find it difficult to exchange information about  (targeted) malware and attacks within a group of trusted partners or by bilateral agreement.  Despite of the trend to exchange of structured information, much of the information sharing  nowadays still occurs through unstructured reports, where it is necessary, in order to process data,  to manually copy & paste the information into text files that have to be parsed to be exported to  (N)IDS and systems or used in log searches.  Some solutions to overcome these problems are being developed by CERTs, NATO, and private  organisations, often with the participation of multiple stakeholders. In section 0, a few of them are  presented that enjoy a certain degree of support in the CERT community, which have reached a  good level of development, and might address the barriers presented in this report. Adopting these  solutions more widely would help CERTs in forming and building larger sharing communities to  exchange the benefits of previous detections and remediation efforts. This approach ultimately  would lead to more confident and efficient incident response.32  4.1 Standardisation Efforts for Sharing Indicators of Compromise  This section is based to a large extent on the following sources: Rosella Mattioli, Information  Exchange Framework for Cyber Security Incidents, Tallin University of Technology33; and on Chris  Harrington’s Sharing Indicators of Compromise: An Overview of Standards and Formats, EMC Critical  Incident Response Center34.  4.1.1 OpenIOC  OpenIOC (http://www.openioc.org/) is an extensible XML schema that enables to describe the  technical characteristics of threats, an attacker’s methodology, or other evidence of compromise.  Originally, it was designed to enable some commercial products to codify intelligence in order to  rapidly search for potential security breaches. In response to requests from across the user  32  See the Recommendations section.  33  http://www.07011979.org/post/26825136212/information-exchange-framework-for-cyber-security  34  http://www.rsaconference.com/events/us13/.../sharing-indicators-of-compromise-an-overview-of  INCIDENTS VS EVENTS SHARING  ‘Incidents’ data usually contains all the information  related to a security incident, including sensitive  information, which cannot be easily shared. Security  ‘events’ contain the non-sensitive metadata related  to an incident. ‘Events’ are therefore less valuable  for security analysis but are more easily shared.  Tools and standards tend to be specific for one type  of information (incident or event data).  http://www.openioc.org/ http://www.07011979.org/post/26825136212/information-exchange-framework-for-cyber-security http://www.rsaconference.com/events/us13/agenda/sessions/181/sharing-indicators-of-compromise-an-overview-of  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 14  community, the company (Mandiant) has standardised and open-sourced the OpenIOC schema to  allow communication of threat information at machine speed (meaning automatically). Future  versions of OpenIOC will include more flexible indicators and metadata extensions to the IoC  (comments, confidentiality, criticality, etc.).  The following pros and cons have been observed in relation to OpenIOC:  Pros  – Free (Apache 2 license)  – XML schema – can be extended as needed  – Three free software programs to create (IOC Editor), find (IOC Finder), and manipulate  (IOC_Writer python library) OpenIOC indicators  – Full support for Mandiant products  Cons  – Limited adoption (outside of Mandiant products)  – Limited support for network-based IoCs – more suitable for file-based IoCs  – OpenIOCs not easily integrated on IDS – viewed as a 'vendor' solution  – No support for describing tactics, techniques, and procedures  Figure 7: Sample of OpenIOC document for DUQU  35 :  <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"us-ascii\"?>  <ioc xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"  xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" id=\"72669174-dd77-4a4e-82ed-99a96784f36e\"  last-modified=\"2012-01-05T02:49:14\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.mandiant.com/2010/ioc\">  <short_description>DUQU (METHODOLOGY)</short_description>  <description>Indicator for the duqu trojan.

In this  effort, the MILE working group defined two main standards for describing (IODEF) and exchanging  (RID) incident information. Like all IETF standards, they benefit from the review of security,  application, and transport experts.  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 16  Although the current implementations of IODEF and RID are mostly limited to internal description  and local exchange of IoCs, the standards are designed to allow large scale sharing of complex  incidents and more projects are implementing them or are planning to do so36.  4.1.2.1 Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF)  The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) specification (RFC 5070,  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5070.txt) defines a data representation that provides a framework for  sharing information commonly exchanged by CERT teams about computer security incidents. It  provides an XML representation for conveying incident information across administrative domains  between parties that have an operational responsibility for remediation or watch-and-warning over  defined constituencies. The data model encodes information about hosts, networks, and the services  running on these systems; attack methodology and associated forensic evidence; the impact of the  activity; and limited approaches for documenting workflow.

RID is flexible enough to exchange  other schemas/data models either embedded in IODEF or independent of IODEF, with a transport  binding using HTTP/TLS. RID is preferred for peer-to-peer models with higher levels of security and  privacy. This transport method enables increased automation over embedding the IODEF document  in, for example, a secured email.  The following up- and down-sides have been observed for RID:  Pros:  – Developed, reviewed, and published by the IETF  – Benefits from the community review of security, application, and transport experts  38  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6545  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6545  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 18  – Existing open source implementations tested for interoperability  – TLS offers mutual authentication and session encryption  – Object level security (XML encryption and digital signatures applied in a standard way)  Cons:  – Limited adoption  – High granularity that can complicate implementation  – Security options can lead to high implementation costs, ROLIE (Resource-Oriented  Lightweight Indicator Exchange)39 is more suitable if high trust model is not necessary.  4.1.3 CyboX, STIX, and TAXII  The Department of Homeland Security, the National Cyber Security Communications and Integration  Center, and US-CERT in the United States are at the forefront of efforts to automate and structure  operational cyber security information sharing techniques on a global scale40:   TAXII™, the Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information   STIX™, the Structured Threat Information eXpression   CybOX™, the Cyber Observable eXpression  TAXII, STIX, and CybOX (all free for public use) are community-driven technical specifications  designed to enable automated information sharing for cyber security situational awareness, real-  time network defence, and sophisticated threat analysis.

A wide variety of high-level cyber security use cases rely on  such information, including event management/logging, malware characterisation, intrusion  detection, incident response/management, and attack pattern characterisation. CybOX provides a  common mechanism (structure and content) for addressing cyber observables across and among  this full range of use cases, improving consistency, efficiency, interoperability, and overall situational  awareness.

Organisations targeted by MACCSA include international and multinational bodies such as the EU  Military Staff, Europol, NATO, the U.S., countries from Europe and Asia/Pacific, and a number of  private companies such as security vendors, operators, industrial companies, and consultancies.  The ISF of MACCSA includes two main components: information sharing model and information  sharing management. The information sharing model describes the means required for sharing  information – proactive (push) and reactive (pull) – on alerts and warnings, best practices, and  security quality management and for handling proactive artefacts.  Information sharing management focuses on ensuring the quality of the shared information.  MACCSA proposes a mesh of hubs and nodes to coordinate information sharing. The model is based  on existing federated secure collaboration capabilities in defence, intelligence, and industry,  comprising independent entities bound together by information sharing agreements and further  united by collaborative and community-centric governance authorities.  44  http://www.federatedbusiness.org/mne7  45  The final MNE Cyber Transition meeting took take place in Brussels on 28/29 May, hosted and supported by  the European External Action Service (EEAS).  http://www.federatedbusiness.org/mne7  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 23  Challenges with Data Exchange Formats  '… there is no need to create new standards or specifications. The current need is to develop a system  that enables the aggregation of all basic components that are common in various feeds  independently from their source...'  – Rosella Mattioli, Information Exchange Framework for Cyber Security Incidents46  One outstanding issue known within the community is the considerable gap between the existence  and advancement of available data feed formats and their low, scattered, or unstable adoption.  Software packages developed to help CERTs deal with security incidents, such as RT/RTIR/AH etc.,  often do not easily enable the adoption of a range of data exchange formats. Additionally, many  CERTs use different standard data formats for automatic IoC exchange.  Currently, many interested parties develop their own parsers and other software tools, which help  them to deal with the incoming streams of security incident related feeds.  Another issue identified within the CERT community is the fact that, even when CERTs produce  automated incident-related feeds, usually formats can change without prior notice and problems  occur with timestamps/time zones or other details.  4.2 Examples of Current Efforts in Information Sharing Solutions  4.2.1 Malware Information Sharing Platform  The Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) has recently been released as open-source  software and as a successor to the previous project, Cydefsig47. The Belgian Defence CERT and the  NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) have actively developed the tool, while other  teams in Europe are now participating in its testing and development. The following are among the  main features of MISP:   Central IoC database – storing technical and non-technical information about malware and  attacks   Correlation – automatically creating relations between malware, events, and attributes   Storing data – in a structured format, allowing automated use of the database for various  purposes   Export – generating IDS, OpenIOC, plain text, and XML output to integrate with other  systems (network IDS, host IDS, custom tools, etc.)   Data sharing – automatic exchange and synchronisation with other parties and trust groups   Notification – automatic notification using PGP   Selective sharing – support for sharing specific attributes with specific communities  Six national/governmental CERTs have tested the MISP software. The results reveal the following:  46  http://institutional.07011979.org/Information_exchange_framework_for_cyber_security_incidents.pdf  47  https://github.com/MISP/MISP  http://institutional.07011979.org/Information_exchange_framework_for_cyber_security_incidents.pdf https://github.com/MISP/MISP  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 24   The software works well as long as the various teams are contributing.   Automatic notification using PGP is efficient.   Structured messages export (Snort rules or XML) works properly, but events synchronisation  (merging) could be improved.   MISP bloomfilter48 is an implementation tool that obtains XML data from MISP and builds  bloomfilter databases. The bloomfilter can be safely shared within CERTs’ constituencies  (e.g., Suricata NIDS and log files lookup).  The MISP user community claims to have achieved faster detection of targeted attacks, as well as  improvements to the detection ratio and confidence in detected suspicions, while reducing false  positives. It also avoids duplicating efforts, as it identifies quickly that other teams have already  worked on handling the specific malware.  Figure 13: The Red October/Sputnik Malware as Seen in MISP  49  48  A bloomfilter is a space-efficient fast data structure, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970. The set of objects is  stored in hashed form, which takes up less space. Different inputs can result in a same hash output; therefore a false  positive is possible when testing whether an element is present in the structure. A negative is always certain.  49 Source:  http://www.circl.lu/files/CIRCL-MISP.pdf  http://www.circl.lu/files/CIRCL-MISP.pdf  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 25  The example of Red October/Sputnik50 malware demonstrates the relationship with previous events  that have similar artifacts.  European CERTs discussed the MISP initiative at the face-to-face project workshop (see Overview of  the Methodology). Although not always familiar with the solution, the teams generally accepted  MISP's usefulness and called for a common approach as regards a common database of incidents,  while highlighting, for example, the problem of different taxonomies (in this respect, ENISA pointed  to its previous work in this area)51. However, some scepticism was voiced regarding the likelihood of  a quick agreement on common standards, let alone an agreement on solutions used. Workshop  participants also called for a central database of existing ticketing systems. Overcoming the legal and  political issues limiting IoC sharing may prove challenging, though.  4.2.2 Commercial Programs for Cyber Security  Microsoft, as a leading software vendor, has been active in the fight against cybercrime and, in 2010,  launched the project MARS52 (Microsoft Active Response for Security) to proactively combat  botnets. The information gathered from Microsoft's botnet operations is actively shared with ISPs  and CERTs.  The sharing of information on known botnet malware infections is now shared in real time with ISPs  and CERTs. The new Cyber Threat Intelligence Program52 (C-TIP) allow these organisations to have  better situational awareness of cyber threats and notify people of potential security issues with their  computers more quickly and efficiently.  Among the early adopters of the C-TIP cloud service are the INTECO-CERT from Spain as well as two  CERTs from Luxembourg, CIRCL and the Governmental CERT of Luxembourg. C-TIP allows ISPs and  CERTs to receive updated threat data related to infected computers in their specific country or  network approximately every 30 seconds. Participation allows these organisations almost instant  access to threat data generated from both previous and forthcoming MARS operations.  The system receives hundreds of millions of attempted check-ins daily from computers infected with  malware such as Conficker53, Waledac54, Rustock55, Kelihos56, Zeus57, Nitol58, and Bamital59. This data  50  Red October is a malware family, also known as Sputnik, which was detected in October 2012 by Kaspersky.  It has been active since 2007; installations have been spotted around the globe, with diplomatic and  governmental agencies targeted. The malware was usually sent by email to selected people in the respective  organisations. As a cover, different office file formats have been used to transport the malware loader, using  different exploits to drop the malicious content. After several stages of unpacking, the malware runs  persistently on the computer, and once it successfully probes internet connectivity, it decrypts a separate file  and starts to behave maliciously: it connects to a Command and Control server, awaiting new commands or  downloading and executing specific malware modules.

Currently, 44 organisations in 38 countries receive these threat  intelligence emails60. In addition to the mentioned CERTs a number of others have either signed up  for the new cloud service or are in the process of signing up.  The Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP)61 also needs to be mentioned. It was initially  directed at security software providers, but, in the second half of 2013 it was extended to CERTs.62  Members of MAPP receive security vulnerability information from the Microsoft Security Response  Center (MSRC) in advance of Microsoft's monthly security updates. When MAPP partners receive  vulnerability information early, they can provide updated protections to customers via their security  software or devices, such as antivirus, network-based intrusion detection systems, and/or host- based intrusion prevention systems.  It is also worth mentioning that many anti-virus companies provides specific and highly valuable  information to CERT teams on a more ad-hoc basis.  4.2.3 NATO CDXI  Cyber Security Data Exchange and Collaboration Infrastructure (CDXI) is a system that is developed  by NATO 63 . CDXI aims at serving as a repository for participants worldwide (individuals,  organisations, non-NATO entities, industry, government, and academic institutions) that will  automatically push and pull cyber defence data using a variety of application programming  interfaces (APIs). Quality assurance of data and data confidentiality are integral to the CDXI design,  and, in order to achieve the right balance of information protection (i.e., sharing with appropriate  parties) and openness of the network, confidentiality and access control are implemented based on  user, role, and NATO classification level.  CDXI data is structured for machine processing and automation but will also have a human-readable  component. It will be integrated with cyber security appliances by means of standard APIs. To  ensure a large community of adopters, NATO is considering making CDXI freely available.  60  Status: May 2013  61  http://www.microsoft.com/security/msrc/collaboration/mapp.aspx#  62  http://threatpost.com/microsoft-expands-mapp-program-to-incident-response-teams  63  iego Fern nde  ue  et al., “Conceptual Framework for Cyber Defense Information Sharing within Trust  Relationships”, 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict  http://www.microsoft.com/security/msrc/collaboration/mapp.aspx http://threatpost.com/microsoft-expands-mapp-program-to-incident-response-teams  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 27  Figure 14: CDXI targeted architecture 64  CDXI ultimately aims at:   Transporting cyber defence data between organisations through a resilient global  infrastructure   Feeding defence data directly into automated applications   Providing assurance of the data's origin and quality   Providing access controls for confidentiality   Providing tools to collaborate on improving the data   Enabling commercial exploitation  Among CDXI's mutually dependent benefits highlighted by its developers are:   Reduced costs – adopting new standards and data sets without the need to incur further  development costs, smooth deployment for all sizes and structures of organisation thanks  64 Source: Luc Dandurand, Cyber Defence Data Exchange and Collaboration Infrastructure (CDXI), an ITU-T  workshop addressing security challenges on a global scale; see: http://www.slideserve.com/nalani/cyber- defence-data-exchange-and-collaboration-infrastructure-cdxi  Law  Enforcement  Org.

The main goal of the project is to collect security-related  data from multiple sources and provide mechanisms to effectively query, correlate, and share it. CIF  evolved from the Security Event System – a project with similar goals, also developed by REN-ISAC –  and is currently funded through a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant.  CIF is internally implementing IODEF, while interoperability of tools using IODEF is enforced through  a scheme that is part of the Request for Comments (RFC)66. Adoption of IODEF means that every  element of information that is a part of an incident report has well-defined semantics. The system  periodically generates feeds of recent reports for every type of threat based on the means that can  be used to identify a particular threat, such as an IP address, URL, or cryptographic hash. CIF  periodically runs a set of data enrichment routines (analytics) on newly collected events. CIF also  integrates with the Team Cymru Hash Registry service to check malware hashes67, looks up entries in  the Spamhaus68 database, and uses the normal DNS infrastructure to extract addresses and name  servers (A and NS records) for domains.  Over 200 users are on the CIF mailing list69, including national and private CERTs, private researchers,  and corporate security teams from around the world; also in developing countries the emerging  equivalents of CERTs are turning to CIF to obtain information. Contrary to other information  exchange platforms, which rely on various “threat languages”, CIF focuses on getting the data in the  output format preferred by the user, whether it is STIX, JSON pairs, CSV, or Snort rules.  65  http://www.ren-isac.net/  66  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5070  67  Team Cymru Hash Registry: http://www.team-cymru.org/Services/MHR/  68  See http://www.spamhaus.org/  69  Status: Sept. 2013  http://www.ren-isac.net/ http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5070 http://www.team-cymru.org/Services/MHR/ http://www.spamhaus.org/  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 29  Figure 15: CIF Architecture  70  Figure 16: Submitting Data through CIF Web Interface 71  70  Source: https://code.google.com/p/collective-intelligence-framework/  71 Source: http://collective-intelligence-framework.googlecode.com/files/2013_MAAWG_wesyoung.pdf  https://code.google.com/p/collective-intelligence-framework/ http://collective-intelligence-framework.googlecode.com/files/2013_MAAWG_wesyoung.pdf  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 30  Figure 17: Data Querying Through CIF Web Interface  72  72 Source: http://collective-intelligence-framework.googlecode.com/files/2013_MAAWG_wesyoung.pdf  http://collective-intelligence-framework.googlecode.com/files/2013_MAAWG_wesyoung.pdf  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 31  5 Recommendations  'Look at what is already there; use existing platforms for CERT cooperation; and just  facilitate the needs of CERTs. Don't invent new stuff just for the sake of it, because it's  fancy.'  –  One of the surveyed CERTs  The above quote pretty much summarises the need for action in the area of exchange and sharing of  information on incidents: better utilise current communication tools and practices! It is important to  make tools and practices more interoperable, irrespective of which incident feeds, information  exchange formats, or ticketing systems are used. After all, the core idea behind the sharing of  information on incidents is that local detection, accompanied with trusted forms of information  exchange, will ultimately lead to improved prevention of cyber incidents on a global scale. The  probability of identifying (and subsequently handling an incident) is much greater if it is detected by  several CERTs that share this information.  5.1 Recommendation 1: ENISA should facilitate the adoption of Essential  Tools for the CERT Community  The sharing of information among CERTs on an efficient (automated) basis assumes that the teams  first effectively handle the information on incidents internally. This requires the adoption of specific  tools by CERTs that relate to ticket tracking and automated incident information processing (RTIR  and Abuse Helper are among the most popular tools used by the teams). CERTs interested in  working together on RT/RTIR/AH upgrades and improvements should synchronise their efforts.  Whenever CERTs require new functionalities, demand arises for expert developers, a resource CERTs  usually lack. CERTs can seek funding from the EU’s research and technology programs for updates  and upgrades.  These programmes often include, as a condition for financing, the participation of multiple parties or  consortia. Such a cooperative software adaptation and improvement approach could be tested in  relation to the specific needs of the CERT community, as well as being further used to create new  tools if the need should surface. These efforts should be of the bottom-up type in terms of software  development strategies and facilitated with top-down coordination within the community of CERTs.  CERTs are encouraged to request that ENISA facilitates the adoption, coherence, and interoperability  of these tools via training sessions at ENISA CERT workshops or via other arrangements.  5.2 Recommendation 2: Security information providers should improve the  stability of existing incident information feeds  Many CERTs appreciate receiving automated feeds from established services (Shadowserver, Zeus  Tracker, Malware Domain List, etc.) and from other CERTs to inform their constituencies about  infections. However, feed formats are often changed by their publishers without prior notice. As  many parties emphasise, this particular problem is even more troublesome than the fact that many  feed publishers do not adhere to the standardised feed formats and create their own feed  templates. CERTs have indicated that it is less problematic to create a parser for a new format of  XML or CSV feed than to deal with the ever-changing feed formats.  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 32  One way to overcome these issues is the employment of “soft” tools, such as published reports,  workshops, webinars, seminars, and conferences, in order to encourage improved behaviour among  the feed publishers, especially:   Wider adoption of some of the best standards of data format for the automated sharing of  indicators of compromise (IODEF, STIX, OpenIOC, etc.)   Wider adoption of 'good community citizen' behaviour, like establishing a minimal  notification period for sharing feed format updates  It must be emphasised that any recommendations regarding setting and promoting better standards  for automated information exchange feeds must be thoroughly discussed and supported by the  community, especially by feed publishers and users (CERTs). The right platform for discussing the  aspects of the continuity of feeds could be organisations and events that bring CERTs together.  ENISA will further investigate these areas and provide adequate and appropriate support for  CERTs and their projects.  The previous two recommendations are natural and unavoidable, considering the state of issues with  tools that help the European CERT community participants to fulfil their roles. The next few  recommendations were not designed to be followed all in parallel – rather, they represent scenarios  the CERT community may choose to follow. Hence, they are more of a set of alternatives, rather than  a to-do list  5.3 Recommendation 3: CERTs should coordinate to enhance functionalities  of existing tools for more effective data sharing within the community  As previously stated (Recommendation 1), technical barriers may present a hindrance to the  adoption of essential information management tools. The same applies to information-sharing  solutions.  A more crucial need than formal feed format standardisation is the enhancement of existing  software tools for information sharing, processing, analysis, and presentation. It is unlikely that any  commercial, non-governmental, or other organisation will create a tool that fits everybody’s need  and will resolve all outstanding issues and be accepted and adopted by all CERTs and other cyber  security stakeholders. It is rather safe to assume that the software tools ecosystem will continue to  be fragmented, yet vibrant. It will consist of many small solutions and tools for solving specific  problems. The following are among the functionalities to enhance existing tools and support  interoperability in incident data sharing:  - First and foremost, interoperability for cross-hub and cross-platform sharing  - Correlation engines for incident analysis  - Advanced analytics and visualisation for massive numbers of incidents  - Automatic prioritisation features  All of these classes (and more) of software tools will have to be enhanced in order to enable CERTs  to cope with the ever-increasing demands of the modern cyber security environment. However,  most CERTs do not have developers working for them. Again, it is possible to access EU funds for  information society projects. The actual development of enhanced tools would come from the  bottom up (e.g., developers embedded at CERTs who are cooperating internationally).  ENISA will support these efforts by offering targeted training upon request from the n/g CERT  community. Whenever appropriate and feasible, ENISA will actively support community driven  efforts in this area.  Detect, SHARE, Protect  Solutions for Improving Threat Data Exchange among CERTs  October 2013  Page 33  5.4 Recommendation 4: A central trusted body at the cross-border level  should develop a common incident information repository with the  integration of current data exchange efforts  While CERTs are largely satisfied with the tools in use today, some see the benefits of a hypothetical  new central service offering an information repository for n/g CERTs in Europe. Such a repository  would include CERTs' contact information to facilitate incident detection and information correlation  (DNS, ASN, and IP ranking) and a repository for past incident information, with options for sorting  and filtering the database of archived information. Access to the shared incident repository should  be convenient. The user could create and manage groups with other registered users and share  information with those particular groups. This repository would have functionalities to send  notifications based on severity or other criteria, such as IP addresses, ASNs, and ranges  (constituency, country, community of interest, etc.).  In the perspective of one stakeholder:  'What could be done is to build a common attack database, or repository, with major input from  CERTs – one containing the methods and characteristics attackers employ and the attack tactics and  techniques they use – so that we can adapt to new avenues of attack and identify common patterns.'  However, it is widely believed that trust issues could make generating sharing practices and  managing access rights to such shared repositories more troublesome than building the tool itself. A  progressive approach, initially targeting useful but insensitive information (a contact repository),  would facilitate the adoption of this infrastructure. In the medium term, this platform would offer  brokering facilities to exchange information among existing sharing communities of n/g CERTs. A  trusted organisation like FIRST, TI, or ENISA could support this service so as to encourage all n/g  CERTs to join such a global sharing effort.  In 2014, ENISA will carry out a project aiming at providing better support to CERTs in the area  exchanging and processing of actionable information, with the goal to, in accordance with the  CERT community and as much as possible, engage in this coordination role.  5.5 Recommendation 5: Bridge Sharing CERT Communities in Europe  The 'perfect' scenario for enhancing sharing practices in the CERTs community would include  building a bridging platform that would extend existing communities and broker information across  these communities. Such a cross-hub exchange would require:  - Local adoption of interoperable standards of data formats (e.g. IODEF, STIX, etc.)  - The definition of diffusion policy standards (e.g., CDXI Information diffusion policy), thus  enabling more complex schemes than Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)  - Coordination at international level  At the EU level, this inter-exchange effort could be entrusted to the CERT community and supported  by ENISA.  In 2014, ENISA will further improve its abilities to provide active support for their key stakeholders  in this area.

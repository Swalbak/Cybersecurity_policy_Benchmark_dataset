In such cases, the ransomware victim may suffer economic  losses either by paying the ransom demanded or by paying the cost of  recovering from the loss, if they do not comply with the attacker’s  demands. In an incident in 2019, Baltimore, Maryland suffered a lockout  and recovery is expected to pay US $18,2 million (ca. €15,4 million),  although the city refused to pay the ransom.1 With the growing number  of incidents growing, it is evident that becoming a victim is not an ‘if’ but  rather a ‘when’ hypothesis. However, in the majority of countries’ fights  against ransomware, several challenges need to be addressed, such as  the lack of coordination and collaboration between agencies and  authorities, and the lack of legislation, that clearly criminalises  ransomware attacks.  Although cyber insurance policies exist since early 20002, ransomware  attacks are one of the main reasons for the increased interest in this type  of insurance during the last 5 years. In some of the 2019 incidents7, the  ransom or the costs of recovery was covered by such contracts.  Unfortunately, if potential ransomware targets are known to be insured,  the attackers assume that they will most probably be paid. Another  downside for the victim is that insurance providers are paying the  ransom in advance to mitigate the damage and to keep the victim’s  reputation intact. However, such compliance by paying ransoms  encourages the hacker community and ensures neither the victim’s  recovery nor their reputation.3  2  3  __Findings  €10,1_billion estimated to be paid in ransoms  during 2019 The amount of paid ransoms was US €3,3 billion more than in  2018.  365%_increase in detections in businesses in  2019  Ransomware detection in machines in business environments  increased compared with the fists half of 2018.22  66%_of healthcare organisations experienced an  attack More than 66% of healthcare organisations experienced a  ransomware attack in 2019.23  45%_of attacked organisations paid the ransom This is the percentage of organisations attacked in 2019 that paid  the ransom and half of them still lost their data.37  28%_of security incidents were attributed to  malware Ransomware was the second most common functionality  following malware C2 and was related to one-third (28%) of  security incidents.32  4  Kill chain  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  5  Installation Command &  Control  Actions on  Objectives  Ransomware  MORE INFORMATION  The Cyber Kill Chain® framework was developed by  Lockheed Martin, adapted from a military concept related  with the structure of an attack. To study a particular attack  vector, use this kill-chain diagram to map each step of the  process and reference the tools, techniques and  procedures used by the attacker.  https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html  6  Description  The Q1 and Q2 2019, ransomware attacks were fewer than those recorded  in the same period during the previous 3 years. However, these  ransomware attacks focused on high-profile targets. Throughout 2018, the  deployment of Remote Access Trojan (RAT), downloaders and backdoors  was noted but, during that year, that malware remained idle.9,10 It is now  concluded that this software provided the attackers with the intelligence  to identify vulnerable high-profile targets, willing to pay higher amounts of  ransom. Following this vein, in the reporting year, ransomware expanded  to other sectors beyond the healthcare industry, targeting industrial and  manufacturing firms. Recently, the LockerGoga ransomware family was  used to damage systems that control the physical equipment in  production plants.11  _Ransomware aims higher  _Cyber insurance more popular  Cyber insurance policies in 2019 represented an US $8 billion (ca. €6,7  billion) market in the United States alone. Although such products exist  since the Y2K or Millennium bug, in recent years they have become more  appealing to governmental organisations, cities, healthcare organisations  and several other potential high-risk ransomware targets. The SamSam  attack in Atlanta, Georgia and the Lake City, Florida, incident were covered  by such policies.16 As the ransom demands increase, cyber-insurance  policies are becoming increasingly necessary for organisations and  companies. However, common sense suggests that the victims must avoid  caving in to demands, if possible. When the ransom demands are met not  only is the attacker encouraged to repeat the act but the victim may also  not recover as in several cases the attacker do not keep their end of the  bargain.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl-2020-malware  7  Several successful ransomware families such as SamSam, BitPaymer and  CrySiS target RDP servers to initiate an attack.20 Unfortunately, many  organisations still use RDP instead of the more secure Virtual Private  Network (VPN) for remote access. The problems with the RDP is that it  suffers from vulnerabilities that can be exploited and the RDP service may  rely on internet-facing servers which are easily accessed. More than  800.000 systems with RDP services have been reported to be unpatched  and vulnerable; among them, systems in the IP range of the Microsoft  Azure data centre.51 Although Microsoft assured the public that these  systems belonged to a third-party, an issue arises regarding cloud service  providers’ security.  _Open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a  high risk  1.58%  0.39%  0.27%  0.16%  0.10%  0.09%  0.07%  0.07%  0.05%  0.05%  USA  Kazakhstan  Iran  Pakistan  Saudi Arabia  Mexico  Canda  Italy  Singapore  Indonesia  0% 1% 1% 2% 2%  Top 10 countries by share of users attacked by mobile ransomware Trojans in Q2 2919. Source: Kapersky  34  LOCKERGOGA_ was first reported in January 2019 in an attack on the  French engineering consultancy company, Altran Technologies.40 Its IT  networks and all the applications went down and the company’s  operations in several countries were affected. LockerGoga is dropped and  executed by the PsExec tool, which is a light-weight telnet replacement,  able to pass some security checks as semi-valid software.11 Once installed,  the user accounts in the targeted system are modified and the system is  forcibly logged-off. In addition, the tool files are self-renamed and self-  relocated, and, as a result they become almost impossible to be located. In  later versions of LockerGoga, the lock-down is so tight that the victims are  not even able to see the ransomware note or the instructions for recovery,  even if the demands are met. Only a few anti-malware and anti-virus  products are able to detect and defend systems against LockerGoga and a  specific decryptor does not exist.10 Other than Altran Technologies,  NorskHydro and two United States-based chemical companies, Hexion  and Momentive were targeted by LockerGogain 2019.41 For the  NorskHydro attack alone, the cost of the damage was estimated at US $50  million (ca. €42 million).21  KATYUSHA_ is a ransomware trojan first used in October 2018. It encrypts  the victim’s files, deletes shadow copies and delivers attachments by e-  mail. Katyusha uses the EternalBlueand DoublePulsar exploits to spread.45  Unfortunately, no tools or decryptors are yet available for defence.  JIGSAW_ not only encrypts the victim’s files, but it also deletes them if the  demands are not met within the, most commonly, 24 hour deadline given.  Furthermore, if the victim attempts something like shutting down their  computer, the deletion rate increases. It is not an accident that this  ransomware was named after a horror movie character.45 However,  security companies constantly releases updates for an efficient Jigsaw  decryptor.46  _ The most wanted  8  Description  9  PEWCRYPT_ was created at the beginning of 2019 and, unlike most  ransomware its only goal is to force people to subscribe to the PewDiePie  YouTuber channel. PewDiePie was in a popularity competition with an  Indian Bollywood channel, T-Series and his fans decided to use PewCrypt  to increase their idol’s chances of winning. PewCrypt is a typical  ransomware spread by spam e-mails and malicious online advertisements.  It was created in the Java programming language. In March 2019, the  author himself released a decryption tool.47  RYUK_ first appeared in August 2018 and was assumed to be associated  with North Korean hacking groups. Soon enough, the Ryuk authors were  proved to be the same group that became known for using the Hermes  ransomware while also stealing its code. Ryuk’s main characteristics are its  use of military algorithms and its targeted attacks on big enterprises.  Moreover, most of its victims are asked to pay the ransom in Bitcoins.45  DHARMA_ is a crypto virus that first appeared in 2016 but new versions  are still being released. Dharma not only encrypts the victim’s files but also  deletes any shadow copies. In 2019, it was spread by contaminated files  with popular, harmful or legitimate extensions such as ‘.gif’, ‘.AUF’, ‘.USA’,  ‘.xwx’, ‘.best’ and ‘.heets’. In September 2019, a security researcher released  the Rakhnidecryptor42 to help Dharma victims decrypt their files.  GANDCRAB_ was used for the first time in January 2018 and infected more  than 50,000 systems in less than a month, becoming one of the most  popular ransomwares of 2018.43 It exploits Microsoft Office macros,  VBScript and PowerShell to attack undetected.45 GandCrab is similar to  Cerber, it is based on the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model and  allows the developers and the criminals to share profit. A team created by  Europol, the Romanian police, the General Prosecutor’s Office and  Bitdefender managed to produce a decryptortool44 after hacking the  GandCrab servers. The operators of GandCrab announced their retirement  in Q2 2019 after collecting more than US $2 billion in ransom payments.  However, the Sodinokibi ransomware, which is observed in small  campaigns, is alleged to be GandCrab’s successor.10  REVIL or SODINOKIBI or SODIN_ first appeared in a web attack on the  Italian WinRAR tool in June 2019. It is also suspected to be involved in  three MSP attacks and a fourth one against the American company  PerCSoft, the clientele of which is mainly from the healthcare sector.48  Sodinokibi seems to be a product of the well-known cyber-espionage  group FruityArmor, which has been active since 2016. Sodinokibi has  affected several countries worldwide. Taiwan has suffered 17,56% of all  recorded Sodinokibi attacks so far, making it Sodinokibi’s most targeted  country. In Europe, the most targeted countries are Germany (8,05%), Italy  (5,12%) and Spain (4,88%). Sodinokibi is distributed by a RaaS model and  encrypts the files needed for an attack to take place in a per-system  manner. The attackers embed a ‘skeleton key’ within their code allowing  them to remotely decrypt files, regardless of the original encryption.49  However, if a computer has Russian, Armenian, Syrian or certain other  keyboard layouts it is no possible for Sodinokibi’s to encrypt it, a fact  probably pointing to the origin of the authors.50  SAMSAM_ continues to target critical infrastructure globally for a fifth  consecutive year. SamSam attacks mainly focus on hospitals, healthcare  companies and governmental organisations to ensure fast payment of big  ransoms. It exploits vulnerabilities of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).  To date the group responsible for the distributing SamSam has raised  more than US $6 million (ca. €5 million) in ransom payments and has cost  the victims more than US $30 million (ca. €25,4 million).45 From the 2018  attack against on the city of Atlanta alone the damage and recovery costs  amounted US $17 million (ca. €14,4 million).43  _ The most wanted  10  Description  11  “The sophistication  of threat capabilities  increased in 2019,  with many  adversaries using  exploits, credential  stealing and multi-  stage attacks.” in ETL 2020  _ Targeted sectors  12  Description  NATION-STATES ARE STILL IN THE SPOTLIGHT_ In 2018, ransomware  was used to target nation-state organisations as a money making tool.  This trend continued in 2019, whereby nations or nation groups  obfuscated their identity by using the very same tools created by other  groups or nation-state actors. This manipulation of tools allows the  attacker’s origin to remain hidden and their nation to avoid any  diplomatic consequences, especially when the target is a governmental or  a state organisation.  In 2019, several attacks against governmental or state organisations took  place such as the one in which the Californian city of Lodi4 was asked to  pay US $400.000 (ca. €340.000) in ransom to be released from a lock out  of the Police Department’s phone lines, the Public Works’ emergency line,  the City Hall’s numbers and the city’s payment data and financial systems.  The city refused to comply and recovered from the attack by using  backups. The Texas Department of Information Resources reported a  coordinated ransomware attack on 23 small governmental organisations  in August 2019.5 The cost for the Texas county was estimated to be US  $3,25 million (ca. €2,75 million). Baltimore suffered a RobbinHood attack  causing a damage costing US $18,2 million (ca. €15,4 million), while the  Lake City in Florida endured a Ryuk attack causing a loss of US $460.000  (ca. €389.768). The city of New Bedford in Massachusetts was also hit by  ransomware attack in July 20196 and demanded the payment of a  ransom of US $5,3 million (ca. €4,4 million). The city refused to pay the  ransom and instead spent US $1 million to recover from the attack.7  13  EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE JOINING THE PARTY_ During 2019, we  observed a shift in attacks towards educational institutions. According to a  report released by the security company Emsisoft, 1.051 schools and  colleges were victims of 62 ransomware incidents. In 2018, the incidents  affecting educational institutions were only 11. The report declares that  American schools were the second more common victims after the local  municipalities.8  THE HEALTH SECTOR CONTINUOUS TO SUFFER_ Healthcare organisations  were the favourite target of ransomware attackers during all of the  previous years, and this trend also continued in 2019. Californian providers  Wood Ranch Medical were hit during summer, and the electronic medical  records of the company were completely destroyed (including the backups)  as a result of its refusal to pay the ransom. The incident forced Wood Ranch  Medical to announce that it would cease to operate by the end of the year.12  In April 2019, the exact same exact sequence of events befell another  medical provider, Michigan Brookside ENT and Hearing Centre13, which was  also forced to shut down. Furthermore, in Australia, two hospital groups  were attacked: the GippslandHealth Alliance and the South West Alliance of  Rural Health. The result was that hospitals in several cities including  Warrnambool, Colac, Geelong, Warragul, Sale, and Bairnsdale could not  fulfil normal patient procedures, as their systems went offline to limit the  exposure.14 In this sector, the data loss is equally damaging to the financial  loss. For instance, more than 300.000 patients’ Protected Health  Information was leaked as a result of a ransomware attack placed in June  2019 against the Premier Family Medical group in Utah.15  MSP ARE DOWN_ Numerous industries rely on managed service providers  (MSP) and cloud service providers (CSP) to host sensitive information, that  is essential to their operations. They also rely on them for the integrity of  the data and the prevention of unauthorized access to them.17 However, the  GandCrab and Sodin ransomwares target vulnerabilities in the MSPs that  expose their infrastructure and the data they host and, eventually, they  allow the ransomware attack to spread to the entire MSP’s clientele. The  Webroot2FA, a common MSP tool, embeds such vulnerabilities and has  been used in several cases during 2019.18 This year, several MSPs were  attacked within a period of three months only, such as PM Consultants,  CloudJumper, Datto, PercSoft, TSM Consulting Services Inc. and IT By  Design.19  _ How  14  Attack vectors  A new ransomware called Sodinokibi exploits the recently announced CVE-  2019-2725 Oracle WebLogic Server’s vulnerability to gain remote code  execution abilities. The victim is infected with no action taken. Official  patches have also been released for the Oracle WebLogic Server versions  10.3.6.0 and 12.1.3.0.51 The same attack exploits the CVE-2018-8453  vulnerability to gain more (elevate) user privileges, terminate blacklisted  processes, delete blacklisted files and exfiltrate host information.48  Another vulnerability, the CVE-2019-0708, is also used for planting  ransomware. It allows unauthorized connection via Microsoft’s remote  desktop protocol (RDP). In May 2019, Microsoft released patches for the  current operating system (OS) versions as well as for those versions that  are not supported any more.51  20.96%  20%  9%  6.58%  5%  4.63%  3.97%  3%  2.50%  WannaCry  Trojan-ransom.win32.Phny  GranCrab  Trojan-ransom.win32.Encoder  Trojan-ransom.win32.Crypren  Stop  Rakhni  Trojan-ransom.win32.Crymod  PolyRansom/VirLock  0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25%  Top ransomware attacks in 2019.

    "original document": "ENISA ETL2020 - Ransomware  From January 2019 to April 2020  Ransomware ENISA Threat Landscape  ENEN  Overview  Ransomware has become a popular weapon in the hands of malicious  actors who try to harm governments, businesses and individuals on a  daily basis. In such cases, the ransomware victim may suffer economic  losses either by paying the ransom demanded or by paying the cost of  recovering from the loss, if they do not comply with the attacker’s  demands. In an incident in 2019, Baltimore, Maryland suffered a lockout  and recovery is expected to pay US $18,2 million (ca. €15,4 million),  although the city refused to pay the ransom.1 With the growing number  of incidents growing, it is evident that becoming a victim is not an ‘if’ but  rather a ‘when’ hypothesis. However, in the majority of countries’ fights  against ransomware, several challenges need to be addressed, such as  the lack of coordination and collaboration between agencies and  authorities, and the lack of legislation, that clearly criminalises  ransomware attacks.  Although cyber insurance policies exist since early 20002, ransomware  attacks are one of the main reasons for the increased interest in this type  of insurance during the last 5 years. In some of the 2019 incidents7, the  ransom or the costs of recovery was covered by such contracts.  Unfortunately, if potential ransomware targets are known to be insured,  the attackers assume that they will most probably be paid. Another  downside for the victim is that insurance providers are paying the  ransom in advance to mitigate the damage and to keep the victim’s  reputation intact. However, such compliance by paying ransoms  encourages the hacker community and ensures neither the victim’s  recovery nor their reputation.3  2  3  __Findings  €10,1_billion estimated to be paid in ransoms  during 2019 The amount of paid ransoms was US €3,3 billion more than in  2018.  365%_increase in detections in businesses in  2019  Ransomware detection in machines in business environments  increased compared with the fists half of 2018.22  66%_of healthcare organisations experienced an  attack More than 66% of healthcare organisations experienced a  ransomware attack in 2019.23  45%_of attacked organisations paid the ransom This is the percentage of organisations attacked in 2019 that paid  the ransom and half of them still lost their data.37  28%_of security incidents were attributed to  malware Ransomware was the second most common functionality  following malware C2 and was related to one-third (28%) of  security incidents.32  4  Kill chain  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  5  Installation Command &  Control  Actions on  Objectives  Ransomware  MORE INFORMATION  The Cyber Kill Chain® framework was developed by  Lockheed Martin, adapted from a military concept related  with the structure of an attack. To study a particular attack  vector, use this kill-chain diagram to map each step of the  process and reference the tools, techniques and  procedures used by the attacker.  https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html  6  Description  The Q1 and Q2 2019, ransomware attacks were fewer than those recorded  in the same period during the previous 3 years. However, these  ransomware attacks focused on high-profile targets. Throughout 2018, the  deployment of Remote Access Trojan (RAT), downloaders and backdoors  was noted but, during that year, that malware remained idle.9,10 It is now  concluded that this software provided the attackers with the intelligence  to identify vulnerable high-profile targets, willing to pay higher amounts of  ransom. Following this vein, in the reporting year, ransomware expanded  to other sectors beyond the healthcare industry, targeting industrial and  manufacturing firms. Recently, the LockerGoga ransomware family was  used to damage systems that control the physical equipment in  production plants.11  _Ransomware aims higher  _Cyber insurance more popular  Cyber insurance policies in 2019 represented an US $8 billion (ca. €6,7  billion) market in the United States alone. Although such products exist  since the Y2K or Millennium bug, in recent years they have become more  appealing to governmental organisations, cities, healthcare organisations  and several other potential high-risk ransomware targets. The SamSam  attack in Atlanta, Georgia and the Lake City, Florida, incident were covered  by such policies.16 As the ransom demands increase, cyber-insurance  policies are becoming increasingly necessary for organisations and  companies. However, common sense suggests that the victims must avoid  caving in to demands, if possible. When the ransom demands are met not  only is the attacker encouraged to repeat the act but the victim may also  not recover as in several cases the attacker do not keep their end of the  bargain.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl-2020-malware  7  Several successful ransomware families such as SamSam, BitPaymer and  CrySiS target RDP servers to initiate an attack.20 Unfortunately, many  organisations still use RDP instead of the more secure Virtual Private  Network (VPN) for remote access. The problems with the RDP is that it  suffers from vulnerabilities that can be exploited and the RDP service may  rely on internet-facing servers which are easily accessed. More than  800.000 systems with RDP services have been reported to be unpatched  and vulnerable; among them, systems in the IP range of the Microsoft  Azure data centre.51 Although Microsoft assured the public that these  systems belonged to a third-party, an issue arises regarding cloud service  providers’ security.  _Open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a  high risk  1.58%  0.39%  0.27%  0.16%  0.10%  0.09%  0.07%  0.07%  0.05%  0.05%  USA  Kazakhstan  Iran  Pakistan  Saudi Arabia  Mexico  Canda  Italy  Singapore  Indonesia  0% 1% 1% 2% 2%  Top 10 countries by share of users attacked by mobile ransomware Trojans in Q2 2919. Source: Kapersky  34  LOCKERGOGA_ was first reported in January 2019 in an attack on the  French engineering consultancy company, Altran Technologies.40 Its IT  networks and all the applications went down and the company’s  operations in several countries were affected. LockerGoga is dropped and  executed by the PsExec tool, which is a light-weight telnet replacement,  able to pass some security checks as semi-valid software.11 Once installed,  the user accounts in the targeted system are modified and the system is  forcibly logged-off. In addition, the tool files are self-renamed and self-  relocated, and, as a result they become almost impossible to be located. In  later versions of LockerGoga, the lock-down is so tight that the victims are  not even able to see the ransomware note or the instructions for recovery,  even if the demands are met. Only a few anti-malware and anti-virus  products are able to detect and defend systems against LockerGoga and a  specific decryptor does not exist.10 Other than Altran Technologies,  NorskHydro and two United States-based chemical companies, Hexion  and Momentive were targeted by LockerGogain 2019.41 For the  NorskHydro attack alone, the cost of the damage was estimated at US $50  million (ca. €42 million).21  KATYUSHA_ is a ransomware trojan first used in October 2018. It encrypts  the victim’s files, deletes shadow copies and delivers attachments by e-  mail. Katyusha uses the EternalBlueand DoublePulsar exploits to spread.45  Unfortunately, no tools or decryptors are yet available for defence.  JIGSAW_ not only encrypts the victim’s files, but it also deletes them if the  demands are not met within the, most commonly, 24 hour deadline given.  Furthermore, if the victim attempts something like shutting down their  computer, the deletion rate increases. It is not an accident that this  ransomware was named after a horror movie character.45 However,  security companies constantly releases updates for an efficient Jigsaw  decryptor.46  _ The most wanted  8  Description  9  PEWCRYPT_ was created at the beginning of 2019 and, unlike most  ransomware its only goal is to force people to subscribe to the PewDiePie  YouTuber channel. PewDiePie was in a popularity competition with an  Indian Bollywood channel, T-Series and his fans decided to use PewCrypt  to increase their idol’s chances of winning. PewCrypt is a typical  ransomware spread by spam e-mails and malicious online advertisements.  It was created in the Java programming language. In March 2019, the  author himself released a decryption tool.47  RYUK_ first appeared in August 2018 and was assumed to be associated  with North Korean hacking groups. Soon enough, the Ryuk authors were  proved to be the same group that became known for using the Hermes  ransomware while also stealing its code. Ryuk’s main characteristics are its  use of military algorithms and its targeted attacks on big enterprises.  Moreover, most of its victims are asked to pay the ransom in Bitcoins.45  DHARMA_ is a crypto virus that first appeared in 2016 but new versions  are still being released. Dharma not only encrypts the victim’s files but also  deletes any shadow copies. In 2019, it was spread by contaminated files  with popular, harmful or legitimate extensions such as ‘.gif’, ‘.AUF’, ‘.USA’,  ‘.xwx’, ‘.best’ and ‘.heets’. In September 2019, a security researcher released  the Rakhnidecryptor42 to help Dharma victims decrypt their files.  GANDCRAB_ was used for the first time in January 2018 and infected more  than 50,000 systems in less than a month, becoming one of the most  popular ransomwares of 2018.43 It exploits Microsoft Office macros,  VBScript and PowerShell to attack undetected.45 GandCrab is similar to  Cerber, it is based on the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model and  allows the developers and the criminals to share profit. A team created by  Europol, the Romanian police, the General Prosecutor’s Office and  Bitdefender managed to produce a decryptortool44 after hacking the  GandCrab servers. The operators of GandCrab announced their retirement  in Q2 2019 after collecting more than US $2 billion in ransom payments.  However, the Sodinokibi ransomware, which is observed in small  campaigns, is alleged to be GandCrab’s successor.10  REVIL or SODINOKIBI or SODIN_ first appeared in a web attack on the  Italian WinRAR tool in June 2019. It is also suspected to be involved in  three MSP attacks and a fourth one against the American company  PerCSoft, the clientele of which is mainly from the healthcare sector.48  Sodinokibi seems to be a product of the well-known cyber-espionage  group FruityArmor, which has been active since 2016. Sodinokibi has  affected several countries worldwide. Taiwan has suffered 17,56% of all  recorded Sodinokibi attacks so far, making it Sodinokibi’s most targeted  country. In Europe, the most targeted countries are Germany (8,05%), Italy  (5,12%) and Spain (4,88%). Sodinokibi is distributed by a RaaS model and  encrypts the files needed for an attack to take place in a per-system  manner. The attackers embed a ‘skeleton key’ within their code allowing  them to remotely decrypt files, regardless of the original encryption.49  However, if a computer has Russian, Armenian, Syrian or certain other  keyboard layouts it is no possible for Sodinokibi’s to encrypt it, a fact  probably pointing to the origin of the authors.50  SAMSAM_ continues to target critical infrastructure globally for a fifth  consecutive year. SamSam attacks mainly focus on hospitals, healthcare  companies and governmental organisations to ensure fast payment of big  ransoms. It exploits vulnerabilities of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).  To date the group responsible for the distributing SamSam has raised  more than US $6 million (ca. €5 million) in ransom payments and has cost  the victims more than US $30 million (ca. €25,4 million).45 From the 2018  attack against on the city of Atlanta alone the damage and recovery costs  amounted US $17 million (ca. €14,4 million).43  _ The most wanted  10  Description  11  “The sophistication  of threat capabilities  increased in 2019,  with many  adversaries using  exploits, credential  stealing and multi-  stage attacks.” in ETL 2020  _ Targeted sectors  12  Description  NATION-STATES ARE STILL IN THE SPOTLIGHT_ In 2018, ransomware  was used to target nation-state organisations as a money making tool.  This trend continued in 2019, whereby nations or nation groups  obfuscated their identity by using the very same tools created by other  groups or nation-state actors. This manipulation of tools allows the  attacker’s origin to remain hidden and their nation to avoid any  diplomatic consequences, especially when the target is a governmental or  a state organisation.  In 2019, several attacks against governmental or state organisations took  place such as the one in which the Californian city of Lodi4 was asked to  pay US $400.000 (ca. €340.000) in ransom to be released from a lock out  of the Police Department’s phone lines, the Public Works’ emergency line,  the City Hall’s numbers and the city’s payment data and financial systems.  The city refused to comply and recovered from the attack by using  backups. The Texas Department of Information Resources reported a  coordinated ransomware attack on 23 small governmental organisations  in August 2019.5 The cost for the Texas county was estimated to be US  $3,25 million (ca. €2,75 million). Baltimore suffered a RobbinHood attack  causing a damage costing US $18,2 million (ca. €15,4 million), while the  Lake City in Florida endured a Ryuk attack causing a loss of US $460.000  (ca. €389.768). The city of New Bedford in Massachusetts was also hit by  ransomware attack in July 20196 and demanded the payment of a  ransom of US $5,3 million (ca. €4,4 million). The city refused to pay the  ransom and instead spent US $1 million to recover from the attack.7  13  EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE JOINING THE PARTY_ During 2019, we  observed a shift in attacks towards educational institutions. According to a  report released by the security company Emsisoft, 1.051 schools and  colleges were victims of 62 ransomware incidents. In 2018, the incidents  affecting educational institutions were only 11. The report declares that  American schools were the second more common victims after the local  municipalities.8  THE HEALTH SECTOR CONTINUOUS TO SUFFER_ Healthcare organisations  were the favourite target of ransomware attackers during all of the  previous years, and this trend also continued in 2019. Californian providers  Wood Ranch Medical were hit during summer, and the electronic medical  records of the company were completely destroyed (including the backups)  as a result of its refusal to pay the ransom. The incident forced Wood Ranch  Medical to announce that it would cease to operate by the end of the year.12  In April 2019, the exact same exact sequence of events befell another  medical provider, Michigan Brookside ENT and Hearing Centre13, which was  also forced to shut down. Furthermore, in Australia, two hospital groups  were attacked: the GippslandHealth Alliance and the South West Alliance of  Rural Health. The result was that hospitals in several cities including  Warrnambool, Colac, Geelong, Warragul, Sale, and Bairnsdale could not  fulfil normal patient procedures, as their systems went offline to limit the  exposure.14 In this sector, the data loss is equally damaging to the financial  loss. For instance, more than 300.000 patients’ Protected Health  Information was leaked as a result of a ransomware attack placed in June  2019 against the Premier Family Medical group in Utah.15  MSP ARE DOWN_ Numerous industries rely on managed service providers  (MSP) and cloud service providers (CSP) to host sensitive information, that  is essential to their operations. They also rely on them for the integrity of  the data and the prevention of unauthorized access to them.17 However, the  GandCrab and Sodin ransomwares target vulnerabilities in the MSPs that  expose their infrastructure and the data they host and, eventually, they  allow the ransomware attack to spread to the entire MSP’s clientele. The  Webroot2FA, a common MSP tool, embeds such vulnerabilities and has  been used in several cases during 2019.18 This year, several MSPs were  attacked within a period of three months only, such as PM Consultants,  CloudJumper, Datto, PercSoft, TSM Consulting Services Inc. and IT By  Design.19  _ How  14  Attack vectors  A new ransomware called Sodinokibi exploits the recently announced CVE-  2019-2725 Oracle WebLogic Server’s vulnerability to gain remote code  execution abilities. The victim is infected with no action taken. Official  patches have also been released for the Oracle WebLogic Server versions  10.3.6.0 and 12.1.3.0.51 The same attack exploits the CVE-2018-8453  vulnerability to gain more (elevate) user privileges, terminate blacklisted  processes, delete blacklisted files and exfiltrate host information.48  Another vulnerability, the CVE-2019-0708, is also used for planting  ransomware. It allows unauthorized connection via Microsoft’s remote  desktop protocol (RDP). In May 2019, Microsoft released patches for the  current operating system (OS) versions as well as for those versions that  are not supported any more.51  20.96%  20%  9%  6.58%  5%  4.63%  3.97%  3%  2.50%  WannaCry  Trojan-ransom.win32.Phny  GranCrab  Trojan-ransom.win32.Encoder  Trojan-ransom.win32.Crypren  Stop  Rakhni  Trojan-ransom.win32.Crymod  PolyRansom/VirLock  0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25%  Top ransomware attacks in 2019.

Established in 2004 and strengthened by the EU  Cybersecurity Act, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  contributes to EU cyber policy, enhances the trustworthiness of ICT  products, services and processes with cybersecurity certification schemes,  cooperates with Member States and EU bodies, and helps Europe prepare  for the cyber challenges of tomorrow. Through knowledge sharing,  capacity building and awareness raising, the Agency works together with  its key stakeholders to strengthen trust in the connected economy, to  boost resilience of the Union’s infrastructure, and, ultimately, to keep  Europe’s society and citizens digitally secure.

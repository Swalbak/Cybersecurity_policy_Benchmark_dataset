 |  F Y  2 0 1 4  1  C Y E R S E C U R I T Y  O F  C Y B E R - P H Y S I C A L  S Y S T E M S  | C P S  The Computer Security Division (CSD), a component of the Information Technology Laboratory at the  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is responsible for developing standards, guidelines,  tests, and metrics for protection of non-national security federal information systems. NIST standards and  guidelines are developed in an open, transparent, and collaborative manner that enlists broad expertise  from around the world. While developed for federal agency use, these resources are voluntarily adopted by  other organizations because they are effective and accepted globally.  The need for cybersecurity standards and best practices that address interoperability, usability and  privacy continues to be critical for the Nation. CSD continues to align its resources to enable greater  development and application of practical, innovative security technologies and methodologies that  enhance our ability to address current and future computer and information security challenges. Our foundational research and  applied cybersecurity programs continue to advance in many areas including cryptography, roots of trust, identity and access  management, advanced security testing and measurement, cyber-physical systems, and public safety networks.  Trust is crucial to the broad adoption of our standards and guidelines, including our cryptographic standards and  guidelines. To ensure that our cryptography resources have been developed according the highest standard of inclusiveness,  transparency and security, NIST initiated a formal review of our cryptographic standards development efforts in 2014. We  documented and solicited public comment on the principles and rigorous processes we use to engage stakeholders and experts  in industry, academia, and government to develop and revise these standards. We anticipate a final report in 2015 that will serve  as a basis for our future standards development and revision efforts.  Increasing the trustworthiness and resilience of the IT infrastructure is a significant undertaking that requires a  substantial investment in the architectural design and development of our systems and networks. A disciplined and structured  set of systems security engineering processes that starts with and builds on well-established international standards provides an  important starting point. Draft Special Publication 800-160, Systems Security Engineering: An Integrated Approach to Building  Trustworthy Resilient Systems, issued in May 2014, helps organizations to develop a more defensible and survivable information  technology infrastructure. This resource, coupled with other NIST standards and guidelines, contributes to systems that are  more resilient in the face of cyber attacks and other threats.  Strong partnerships with diverse stakeholders are vital to the success of our technical programs. In February 2014,  NIST issued the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity as directed in Executive Order 13636. The  Framework, created through collaboration between industry and government, consists of standards, guidelines, and practices  to promote the protection of critical infrastructure. Its approach helps owners and operators of critical infrastructure to manage  cybersecurity-related risk. Collaborations continue as NIST works with stakeholders from across the country and around  the world. Working closely with standards developing organizations, industry and interagency partners, we are evolving  and expanding security automation capabilities to help organizations manage and measure the security of systems and  technologies.  Active engagement with diverse stakeholders continues to be critical to our success. In the federal space, this  interaction is most prominent in our strengthened collaborations with the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community,  and the Committee on National Security Systems to establish a common foundation for information security across the federal  government. Our cybersecurity awareness, training, and education programs also exemplify the importance of engagements  with academic institutions, federal agencies, small and medium businesses and others to increase awareness and enhance the  overall cybersecurity posture of the Nation.  For many years, CSD, in collaboration with our global partners across industry, academia, and government, has made  great contributions to help secure the nation’s critical information and infrastructure. We look forward to strengthening these  relationships as we lead the development and practical application of scalable and sustainable information security standards  and practices.

OVERVIEW: The Cryptographic Technology Group’s (CTG) work in  the field of cryptography includes researching, analyzing  and standardizing cryptographic technology, such as hash  algorithms, symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic  techniques, key management, authentication, and random  number generation. The CTG’s goal is to identify and  promote methods to enhance trust in communications, data,  and storage through cryptographic technology, encouraging  innovative development and helping technology users to  manage risk.  In FY 2014, the CTG continued to make an impact  in the field of cryptography, both within and outside the  Federal Government, by collaborating with national and  international agencies, academic and research organizations,  and standards bodies to develop interoperable security  standards and guidelines. In addition, the CTG worked with  industry partners to promote the use of NIST-approved  cryptographic methods.  The NIST cryptographic standards’ program  standardizes cryptographic primitives, algorithms,  schemes, and guidelines in Federal Information Processing  Standards (FIPSs), NIST Special Publications (SPs), and  NIST Interagency or Internal Reports (NISTIRs). The NIST  standardized cryptographic tools have been adopted as  standards by standards-setting organizations, such as the  Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Institute of  Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the Trusted  Computing Group (TCG), and have been implemented on a  variety of platforms.  In FY 2014, in response to public concerns about  NIST cryptographic standards -in particular, the DUAL_ EC_DRBG, a deterministic random number generator  specified in SP 800-90A, Recommendation for Random  Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit  Generators—NIST initiated a review of the cryptographic  standards development process. The CTG summarized the  development process for each cryptographic standard and  provided materials and presentations to the NIST Visiting  Committee on Advanced Technology (VCAT) and a NIST  Committee of Visitors (COV), consisting of experts invited by  the VCAT, to conduct the review. A summary for this review  is provided in the Cryptographic Standards and Guidelines  Process Review section of this annual report.  CTG researchers were highly engaged and productive in  several critical cryptographic areas, such as post-quantum  cryptography, elliptic curve cryptography, privacy-enhancing  cryptography, and lightweight cryptographic schemes  for constrained environments. The CTG has collaborated  with many universities internationally, and research results  were published in the major cryptography conferences and  journals. The CTG also held workshops and conferences, as  well as hosted guest researchers.  Several guidelines on cryptographic applications were  published in various areas, such as key management, Internet  protocols, and trusted platforms. The CTG contributed  to other CSD cybersecurity projects, such as the Smart  Grid and Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standards.  The CTG also worked closely with the Security Testing,  Validation, and Measurement Group of the CSD on FIPS 140- 2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, the  Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP), and  the Cryptographic Module Validation Programs (CMVP).  GROUP MANAGER (ACTING): Dr. Lily Chen  (301) 975-6974  lily.chen@nist.gov  S E C U R I T Y  C O M P O N E N T S  A N D  M E C H A N I S M S  G R O U P  ( S C M G )  MISSION STATEMENT: Research, develop, and standardize foundational security  mechanisms, protocols, and services.  OVERVIEW: The SCMG’s security research focuses on the  development and management of foundational building- block security mechanisms and techniques that can be  integrated into a wide variety of mission-critical U.S.  information systems. The group’s work spans the spectrum  from near-term hardening and improvement of systems, to the  design and analysis of next-generation, leap-ahead security  capabilities. Computer security depends fundamentally on  the level of trust of computer software and systems. This  work, therefore, focuses strongly on assurance-building  activities ranging from the analysis of software configuration  settings, to advanced trust architectures, and to testing  mailto:lily.chen@nist.gov  I N T R O D U C T I O N  T O  C S D ’ S  5  G R O U P S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  5  tools that identify flaws in software modules. This work also  focuses significantly on increasing the applicability and  effectiveness of automated techniques, wherever feasible.  The SCMG conducts collaborative research with government,  industry, and academia. Outputs of this research consist  of prototype systems, software tools, demonstrations,  guidelines, and other documentary resources.  Collaborating extensively with government, academia,  and the private sector, SCMG works on a variety of topics,  such as:  •  Specifications for the automated exchange of security  information between systems;  • Computer-security incident-handling guidelines;  •  Formulation of high-assurance software configuration  settings;  • Hardware roots-of-trust for mobile devices;  • Secure Basic Input Output System (BIOS) layers;  • Combinatorial testing techniques;  •  Conformity assessment of software implementing  biometric standards; and  •  Adoption of Internet Protocol Version 6 and Internet  Protocol security extensions.  In FY 2014, collaborators and the associated  collaborations have included Carnegie Mellon University  (test development environment), Johns Hopkins Applied  Physics Lab (practical application of combinatorial coverage  measurement tool), the University of Texas at Arlington  (covering array generation algorithm), Mexico’s Centro  Nacional de Metrología (constraints for a testing coverage  tool), National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA) (practical application for combinatorial coverage  measurement), U.S. Air Force Test and Evaluation (a new  event sequence testing method), the University of Texas  Dallas and East Carolina University (safety-critical systems  testing), the National Science Foundation (cybersecurity  metrics and assurance building), the National Security  Agency (secure software tool chain competition  development), and the Department of Homeland Security  (incident coordination).  SCMG accomplishments include updates to the  Advanced Combinatorial Testing System (ACTS) software  and documentation, and the NIST Biometrics Conformance  Test Software (BioCTS) 2014 biometric conformance testing  tool and test assertions.

OVERVIEW: SSAG’s security research focuses on identifying  emerging and high-priority technologies, and on developing  security solutions that will have a high impact on the U.S.  critical infrastructures. The group conducted research and  development on behalf of government and industry from the  earliest stages of technology development through proof- of-concept, reference and prototype implementations and  demonstrations. In addition, the group worked to transfer  new technologies to industry; to produce new standards and  guidance for federal agencies and industry; and to develop  tests, test methodologies, and assurance methods.  SSAG investigated the security concerns associated  with such areas as mobile devices, cloud computing and  virtualization, identity management, access control and  authorization management, and software assurance.  SSAG’s research helps to meet federal information security  requirements that may not be fully addressed by existing  technology. The group collaborated extensively with  government, academia, and private sector entities.  Example successes from this work include:  • Tools for access control policy testing;  •  New concepts in access control and policy enforce- ment;  •  Published several Personal Identity Verification docu- ments;  •  Methods for achieving comprehensive policy enforce- ment and data interoperability across enterprise data  services; and  •  Test methods for mobile device (smart phone) applica- tion security.  In particular, the SSAG released an open-source  reference implementation of ANSI/INCITS 499, Next  Generation Access Control. The group also published SP  800-162, Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Definition  and Considerations, providing the first authoritative  definition of ABAC. In support of the Federal Government’s  mobile security initiatives, the group published SP 800- 163, Vetting the Security of Mobile Applications, to provide  mailto:lee.badger@nist.gov  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  6  agencies with guidelines on how to test mobile applications  for government use. In support of the Federal Government’s  cloud computing initiatives, the group led the NIST Security  Working Group that published the NIST Cloud Computing -  Security Reference Architecture. In support of the recently  revised FIPS 201-2, Personal Identity Verification (PIV)  of Federal Employees and Contractors, six PIV-related  800-series SPs were revised. In addition to these, draft SP  800-157, Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity Verification  (PIV) Credentials, was published to guide the implementation  and deployment of PIV credentials for mobile devices.  To improve access to new technologies, the group also  chaired, edited, and participated in the development of a  wide variety of national and international security standards.

OVERVIEW: The U.S. economy, citizens, and government rely on  information technology (IT), so the protection of the IT and  information infrastructure is critical. SOIG leverages broad  cybersecurity and risk-management expertise to develop,  integrate, and promote security standards, guidelines, tools,  technologies, methodologies, tests, and measurements to  address cybersecurity needs in many areas of national and  international importance.  The SOIG collaborates with stakeholders to address  cybersecurity considerations in many diverse program areas,  including the Information and Communications Technologies  (ICT) supply chain, Smart Grid, Electronic Voting, Cyber  Physical and Industrial Control Systems, Health Information  Technology, and the National Public Safety Broadband  Network. The group produces standards and guidelines  through the Federal Information Security Management Act  (FISMA) implementation program to help federal agencies  build strong cybersecurity risk-management programs. In  each of these program areas, the group extends outreach  to stakeholders across federal, state, and local governments;  industry; academia; small businesses; and the public. The  SOIG also leads several broad cybersecurity awareness,  training, education, and outreach efforts, including the  National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE),  the Federal Computer Security Managers’ Forum, and the  Federal Information Systems Security Educators’ Association  (FISSEA).  Key to the group’s success is the ability to interact  with a broad constituency to ensure that SOIG’s program is  consistent with national objectives related to or impacted  by information security. Through open and transparent  public engagement, collaboration, and cooperation, the  group works to address critical cybersecurity challenges,  enable greater U.S. industrial competitiveness, and facilitate  the practical implementation of scalable and sustainable  information security standards and practices.

OVERVIEW: Federal agencies, industry, and the public rely on  cryptography for the protection of information and  communications used in electronic commerce, critical  infrastructures, and other application areas. The STVMG  supports the testing and validation of cryptographic  modules and the cryptographic algorithms specified in NIST  standards. These cryptographic modules and algorithms  enable products and systems to provide security services,  such as confidentiality, integrity authentication, and source  authentication. Although cryptography provides security,  poor designs or weak algorithms can render a product  insecure and place highly sensitive information at risk. When  protecting sensitive data, Federal Government agencies  require a minimum level of assurance that cryptographic  mailto:david.ferraiolo@nist.gov mailto:kevin.stine@nist.gov  I N T R O D U C T I O N  T O  C S D ’ S  5  G R O U P S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  7  products meet established security requirements and  use only tested and validated cryptographic modules and  algorithms.  STVMG’s testing-focused activities include validating  cryptographic algorithm implementations, cryptographic  modules, and Security Content Automation Protocol  (SCAP)-compliant products; developing test suites and test  methods; providing implementation guidance and technical  support to industry forums; and conducting education,  training, and outreach programs.  STVMG’s validation programs work together with  independent Cryptographic and Security Testing  laboratories that are accredited by the NIST National  Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP).  Based on the independent laboratory test report and  test evidence, the Validation Program then validates the  implementation under test. NIST publishes, through public  websites, lists of the validations awarded.

Title III of the E-Government Act,  entitled the Federal Information Security Management Act  (FISMA) of 2002, included duties and responsibilities for the  National Institute of Standards and Technology, Information  Technology Laboratory, Computer Security Division (CSD). In  2014, the CSD addressed its FISMA responsibilities through  the following activities:  •  Issued a draft Federal Information Processing Standard  (FIPS): FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based  Hash and Extendable-Output Functions, which spec- ifies the Secure Hash Algorithm-3 (SHA-3) family of  functions on binary data. Each of the SHA-3 functions  is based on an instance of the KeccaK algorithm that  NIST selected as the winner of the SHA-3 Cryptograph- ic Hash Algorithm Competition.  •  Issued 23 draft and final NIST Special Publications  (SPs) that provide management, operational, and tech- nical security guidelines in areas such as application  whitelisting, attribute-based access control, person- al identity verification and derived credentials, key  management, BIOS protection, mobile device forensics,  secure communications protocol implementations,  third-party mobile application vetting, supply chain  risk management practices, role-based cybersecurity  training, industrial control systems security, systems  security engineering, and security and privacy controls  assessments.  •  Issued 13 draft and final NIST Interagency or Internal  Reports (NISTIRs) on a variety of topics, including  smart grid cybersecurity, personal identity verification,  Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) imple- mentation, cloud computing forensics; identity man- agement in Public Safety mobile networks, replication  device cybersecurity, automated access management  using Secure Shell, and the development process for  NIST cryptographic standards and guidelines.  •  Performed research and conducted outreach on stan- dards, practices, and technologies to enable prompt  and effective computer security incident handling and  coordination.  •  Continued the successful collaboration with the Office  of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the  Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS),  and the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish a  common foundation for information security across the  Federal Government, including a structured, yet flexible  approach for managing information security risk across  an organization. In 2014, this collaboration produced  updated guidelines for assessing security and privacy  controls employed in federal information systems and  organizations.  •  Provided assistance to agencies and the private sector  through many outreach programs, including the Na- tional Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), the  Federal Information Systems Security Educators’ As- sociation (FISSEA), and the Federal Computer Security  Managers’ Forum.  •  Conducted workshops, awareness briefings, and out- reach to CSD customers to ensure the comprehension  of standards and guidelines, to share ongoing and  planned activities, and to aid in scoping guidelines in  a collaborative, open, and transparent manner. CSD  public workshops addressed a diverse range of in- formation security and technology topics, including  cloud and mobile technologies; cyber physical systems;  cryptographic key management; safeguarding health  information; secure hash algorithms; supply-chain risk  management; improving critical infrastructure cyber- security; broad computer security awareness, training,  education, and outreach events; and cybersecurity  innovation forums.  •  Engaged with international standards bodies in a  variety of areas, including promoting a broader inter- national adoption of security automation specifica- tions. Additionally, NIST’s CSD continued to lead, the  Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP), in  conjunction with the Government of Canada’s Commu- nications Security Establishment. The Common Criteria  Evaluation and Validation Scheme (CCEVS) and CMVP  facilitate security testing of IT products usable by the  Federal Government.  •  Solicited recommendations of the Information Security  and Privacy Advisory Board (ISPAB) on draft standards  and guidelines, and on information security and privacy  issues.  •  Produced the CSD 2014 annual report and released it  as a NIST SP. CSD annual reports from fiscal years 2003  through 2014 are available on the Computer Security  Resource Center (CSRC) at http://csrc.nist.gov/  publications/PubsTC.html#AnnualReports.  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsTC.html#AnnualReports http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsTC.html#AnnualReports  1 0  PROGRAM AND PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS  FOR FISCAL YEAR 2014  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  1 1  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  F O R  F Y  2 0 1 4  In FY 2014, CSD continued to research and develop  guidance for a broad array of technical areas, including  supply-chain risk management; security analytics; cloud,  mobile, and privacy-enhancing technologies; hardware- enabled security; and cyber-physical and embedded  systems. The staff and guest researchers within CSD  have collaborated with global partners from government,  industry, and academia, making significant contributions  to help secure critical information and infrastructures.  The following sections describe the CSD’s programs and  project achievements that include extensive research and  development for high-quality, cost-effective security and  privacy mechanisms, standards, guidelines, tests, and  metrics that address current and future computer and  information security challenges.

This EO directed NIST to work with  stakeholders to develop a voluntary framework – based on  existing standards, guidelines, and practices − for reducing  cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructures.  The Cybersecurity Framework provides a prioritized,  flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective  approach to help owners and operators of critical  infrastructures and other interested entities identify, assess,  and manage cybersecurity-related risk, while protecting  business confidentiality, individual privacy, and civil liberties.  In FY 2014, NIST continued to work with a diverse  stakeholder community to develop the Framework through  an open public process. This process included:  •  Preparing a Preliminary Cybersecurity Framework for  official public review and comment;  •  Hosting a workshop at the North Carolina State Univer-  sity in Raleigh, North Carolina to gather input on the  Preliminary Cybersecurity Framework;  •  Issuing the Cybersecurity Framework in February 2014  as directed in the Executive Order;  •  Publishing a companion Cybersecurity Framework  Roadmap detailing high-priority areas that should be  addressed in order to improve future versions of the  Framework; and  •  The release of a formal Request for Information (RFI),  seeking feedback on awareness, experiences with the  Framework, and related activities to support the use of  the Framework.  Since the release of the Framework, NIST’s primary goal  has been to raise awareness of the Framework and encourage  its use as a tool to help industry sectors and organizations  manage cybersecurity risks. NIST has strengthened its  collaboration with critical-infrastructure owners and  operators, industry leaders, government partners, and  other stakeholders, building on interactions over the  previous year that were crucial to the Framework’s  development.  In FY 2015, NIST will continue to conduct stakeholder  outreach and will work collaboratively with them to further  understand stakeholder needs regarding tools and resources  to enable a more effective use of the Framework. NIST will  conduct additional public workshops, including a forum  hosted by the Florida Center for Cybersecurity (FC2) located  at the University of South Florida in Tampa on October 29- 30, 2014. Periodic updates will be provided and additional  events announced through the Framework website.  http://www.nist.gov/cyberframework  CONTACTS: Mr. Kevin Stine  Mr. Adam Sedgewick  (301) 975-4483  (301) 367-4678  kevin.stine@nist.gov  adam.sedgewick@nist.gov  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  1 2  C S D  W O R K  I N  N AT I O N A L  A N D  I N T E R N AT I O N A L  S TA N D A R D S  CSD’s Part  in  National  and  International  ISO Security Standards  Processes  Figure 1 (below) shows many of the national and  international standards-developing organizations (SDOs)  involved in cybersecurity standardization. CSD participates  in many cybersecurity standards’ activities in many of these  organizations, either in leadership positions or as editors  and contributors, including the BioAPI Consortium;  the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG): Bluetooth  Security Expert Group (BT-SEG); the International  Telecommunications Union - Telecommunication Standardi- zation Sector (ITU-T); various groups within the Institute of  Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Internet  Engineering Task Force (IETF); the North American Security  Products Organization (NASPO); the Trusted Computing  Group (TCG); and Accredited Standards Committee  X9, Inc. (X9) (e.g. Financial Industry Standards X9F). Many of  CSD’s publications have been the basis for both national and  international standards projects.  The following write-ups discuss the CSD’s standards  activities in conjunction with the InterNational Committee  for Information Technology Standards (INCITS) Technical  Committee Cyber Security (CS1), where CSD’s Dan  Benigni served as the Chair and U.S. Head of Delegation to  subcommittee SC 27, and CSD’s Sal Francomacaro served  as the CS1 Vice Chair.  The International  Organization for  Standardization (ISO)  The International Organization for Standardization  (ISO) is a network of the national standards institutes of 148  countries, with representation by one member per country.  The scope of ISO covers the standardization in all fields  except electrical and electronic engineering standards, which  are the responsibility of the International Electrotechnical  Commission (IEC).  Figure 1: SDOs involved in Cybersecurity  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  1 3  The IEC prepares and publishes international  standards for all electrical, electronic, and related  technologies,including electronics, magnetics and  electromagnetics, electroacoustics, multimedia, tele- communication, and energy production and distribution,  as well as associated general disciplines, such as  terminology and symbols, electromagnetic compatibility,  measurement and performance, dependability, design and  development, safety, and the environment.  (http://www.iec.ch/about/)  Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) was formed by ISO  and IEC to be responsible for international standardization  in the field of Information Technology (http://www.iso.org/ iso/jtc1_home.html). It develops, maintains, promotes, and  facilitates the IT standards required by global markets,  meeting business and user requirements concerning:  • Design and development of IT systems and tools;  •  Performance and quality of IT products and systems;  • Security of IT systems and information;  • Portability of application programs;  • Interoperability of IT products and systems;  • Unified tools and environments;  • Harmonized IT vocabulary; and  •  User-friendly and ergonomically designed user inter- faces.  JTC 1 consists of a number of subcommittees (SCs) and  working groups that address specific technologies. SCs that  produce standards relating to IT security include:  •  SC 06 - Telecommunications and Information Exchange  Between Systems;  • SC 17 - Cards and Personal Identification;  • SC 27 - IT Security Techniques; and  •  SC 37 – Biometrics (Note: Fernando Podio, NIST CSD,  served as Chair).  JTC 1 also has:  • Technical Committee 68 – Financial Services;  •  SC 2 - Operations and Procedures, including Security;  • SC 4 – Securities;  •  SC 6 - Financial Transaction Cards, Related Media and  Operations;  • SC 7 – Software and Systems Engineering, and  •  SC 38 – Distributed application platforms and services  (DAPS).  The American National  Standards  Institute (ANSI)  ANSI is a private, nonprofit (501(c)(3)) organization  that administers and coordinates the U.S. voluntary  standardization and conformity assessment system, and  facilitates the development of American National Standards  (ANSs) by accrediting the procedures of SDOs.  ANSI promotes the use of U.S. standards internationally,  advocates U.S. policy and technical positions in international  and regional standards organizations, and encourages the  adoption of international standards as national standards  where they meet the needs of the U.S. user community.  ANSI is the sole U.S. representative and dues-paying  member of the two major non-treaty international  standards organizations: ISO and, via the United States  National Committee (USNC), the IEC.  INCITS is accredited by ANSI, and serves as the ANSI  Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for ISO/IEC Joint Technical  Committee 1. INCITS is sponsored by the Information  Technology Industry (ITI) Council, a trade association  representing the leading U.S. providers of information  technology products and services.  INCITS is organized into Technical Committees that  focus on the creation of standards for different technology  areas. Technical committees that focus on IT security and IT  security-related technologies or that may require separate  security standards include:  • B10 – Identification Cards and Related Devices;  •  CS1 – Cyber Security (Dan Benigni, NIST CSD, Chair, Sal  Francomacaro, NIST CSD, Vice Chair, and NIST Principal  Voting Member);  • E22 – Item Authentication;  • M1 – Biometrics (Fernando Podio, NIST CSD, Chair);  • T3 – Open Distributed Processing (ODP);  • T6 – Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Technology;  • GIT1 – Governance of IT; and  •  DAPS38 – Distributed Application Platforms and  Services.  As a technical committee of INCITS, CS1 develops United  States, national, ANSI-accredited standards in the area of  cybersecurity. Its scope encompasses:  • Management of information security and systems;  •  Management of third-party information security service  providers;  • Intrusion detection;  • Network security;  http://www.iso.org/iso/jtc1_home.html http://www.iso.org/iso/jtc1_home.html  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  1 4  • Cloud computing security;  • Supply-chain risk management;  • Incident handling;  • IT security evaluation and assurance;  • Security assessment of operational systems;  • Security requirements for cryptographic modules;  • Protection profiles;  • Role-based access control;  • Security checklists;  • Security metrics;  •  Cryptographic and non-cryptographic techniques and  mechanisms, including confidentiality, entity authen- tication, non-repudiation, key management, data  integrity, message authentication, hash functions, and  digital signatures;  •  Future service and applications standards supporting  the implementation of control objectives and controls  as defined in ISO 27001, in the areas of business conti- nuity, and outsourcing;  •  Identity management, including an identity manage- ment framework, role-based access control, and single  sign-on; and  •  Privacy technologies, including a privacy framework,  privacy reference architecture, privacy infrastructure,  anonymity and credentials, and specific privacy-en- hancing technologies.  The scope of CS1 explicitly excludes the areas of  cybersecurity standardization, which is presently under  development in INCITS B10, M1, T3, T10, and T11, as  well as other standard groups, such as the Alliance for  Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), the IEEE,  the IETF, the Travel Industry Association of America (TIAA),  and Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X9. The CS1  scope of work includes standardization in most of the same  cybersecurity areas as are covered in the NIST CSD.  As the U.S. TAG to ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27, CS1 contributes  to the SC 27 program of work on IT Security Techniques  in terms of U.S. comments and contributions on SC 27  standards projects; U.S. votes on SC 27 standards documents  at various stages of development; and nominates U.S.  experts to work on various SC 27 projects as editors,  co-editors, or in other SC 27 leadership positions. Currently,  over a dozen CS1 members are serving as SC 27  document editors or co-editors on various standards  projects.  All input from CS1 is processed through INCITS to ANSI,  then to SC 27. It is also a conduit for getting U.S.-based new  work item proposals and U.S.-developed national standards  into the international SC 27 standards development process.  In its international efforts, CS1 responded to all calls for U.S.  contributions and/or voting positions on all international  security standards projects in ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 27 in a  consistent, efficient, and timely manner.  NIST’s CSD contributes to many of CS1’s national  and international IT security standards efforts through  its membership on CS1, where Dan Benigni served as  the nonvoting chair and Sal Francomacaro as the NIST  Principal voting member. Internationally, there are over 100  published standards, and almost all have been adopted as  U.S. national standards. There are more than 100 current  international standards projects. During FY 2014, eighteen  new standards were published in SC 27, and all of them have  been recommended by CS1 for adoption as U.S. national  standards.  CSD’s Role in  Cybersecurity  Standardization  CSD’s cybersecurity research also plays a direct role  in the Cybersecurity Standardization efforts of CS1 at the  national level. The following is a description of the national- level progress achieved during FY 2014 by CSD and CS1.  The NIST Policy Machine research and development has  resulted in three ongoing national standards projects in CS1  in the early stages of development. They include:  •  Next Generation Access Control –Functional Architec- ture (NGAC-FA), project number INCITS 499-2013, was  published in FY 2013 and is recently beginning an early  revision;  •  Next Generation Access Control – Generic Operations  & Abstract Data Structures (NGAC-GOADS). Serban  Gavrila, NIST CSD, is the editor. The project is assigned  project number 2195-D, and the document (planned for  publication in FY 2015) is out for second public review;  and  •  Next Generation Access Control -Implementation  Requirements, Protocols and API Definitions (NGAC-IR- PADS). Project number is 2193-D has been assigned.  Dan Benigni also served as cybersecurity standards  coordinator in CSD.

Identity  Management Standards within  INCITS B10 and ISO JTC1/SC17  CSD supports identity management standardization  activities through participation in national and international  standards bodies and organizations. CSD actively  participates in the INCITS B10 committee, which is focused  on the interoperability of Identification Cards and Related  Devices. CSD has contributed and provided valuable  feedback to many INCITS B10 standards in the development  process.  In addition, CSD also participates in the B10.12  committee. The B10.12 committee develops interoperable  standards for Integrated Circuit Cards with Contacts, and it is  the US TAG (Technical Advisory Group) for the international  ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 17 Working Groups 4 and 11. During FY 2014,  Mr. Salvatore Francomacaro, a CSD staff member; served as  the U.S. Head of delegation to ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 17 WG4 and  WG11.  CSD provides technical and editorial support in the  development of national and international standards.  Specifically, a CSD staff member serves as the technical  editor of ANSI 504-1, Generic Identity Command Set (GICS).  GICS enables PIV, PIV-Interoperable (PIV-I) and Common  Access Card (CAC) card applications, and others, to be built  from a single platform. GICS defines an open platform where  identity applications can be instantiated, deployed, and used  in an interoperable way between the credential issuers and  credential users. During FY 2014, INCITS 504 Parts 1 and 2  have started an amendment process to better align them  with the new NIST SP 800-73-4 (PIV) specifications.  CSD staff also provided significant input to standards of  major interest to U.S. government agencies and U.S. markets.  CSD played a role in the development and revision of:  •  ISO/IEC 7816 (Identification Cards, Integrated Circuit  Cards);  •  ISO/IEC 24727 (Identification Cards, Integrated Circuit  Card Programming Interfaces); and  •  ISO/IEC 24787 (Biometrics “Match On Card” Compari- son).  During FY 2015, the INCITS B10 committee, along with  the active collaboration of CSD staff, plans to:  • Publish Part 3 of INCITS 504;  •  Complete the amendment process for INCITS 504 Part  1 and 2; and  •  Contribute to the publication of several revisions of the  ISO/IEC 7816 family of standards (all relevant to FIPS  201 specifications).  CSD staff will continue to actively support relevant ID  management standard initiatives, such as ISO/IEC  19286  (Integrated Circuit Card (ICC) protocols and services ensuring  privacy) and ISO/IEC 18328 (ICC managed Devices).  CSD’s investment in these activities is motivated by new  technical ideas that emerge from these ISO standards. For  example, INCITS 504 is an ID platform that leverages the  FIPS 201 infrastructure to support a larger number of  government and enterprise initiatives. In particular, INCITS  504 aims to support initiatives such as the National  Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC).  ISO/IEC 24727 aims to create an interoperability framework  that increases the resilience and scalability of identity  management solutions and to foster domestic and  international interoperability.

During FY 2014, CSD continued to strengthen its  collaboration with the Department of Defense (DOD), the  Intelligence Community, and the Committee on National  Security Systems (CNSS), in partnership with the Joint  Task Force (JTF) Transformation Initiative. The JTF partners  continue to develop and update key cybersecurity guidelines  for protecting federal information and information systems  as part of the Unified Information Security Framework.  Previously, the Joint Task Force developed common  security guidance in the critical areas of security controls for  information systems and organizations, security assessment  procedures to demonstrate security control effectiveness,  security authorizations for risk acceptance decisions, and  continuous monitoring activities to ensure that decision  makers receive the most up-to-date information on the  security state of their information systems. In addition, CSD  began work with the General Services Administration (GSA)  Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program  (FedRAMP) to develop a high-impact security control  baseline overlay for FedRAMP cloud systems in accordance  with NIST standards and guidelines.  In FY 2014, CSD worked on the following three initiatives:  •  Risk Management Guidelines: SP 800-53 Revision 4,  Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information  Systems and Organizations, provides organizations  with the security controls necessary to appropriately  strengthen their information systems and the envi- ronments in which those systems operate, and with a  process for selecting the appropriate controls, which  contributes to systems that are resilient in the face of  attacks and other threats. This “Build It Right” strategy  is reinforced with the May 2014 publication of the Initial  Public Draft (IPD) of SP 800-160, Systems Security  Engineering: An Integrated Approach to Building Trust- worthy Resilient Systems. The implementation of SPs  800-53 and 800-160, combined with the implementa- tion of SP 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Manage- ment Framework to Federal Information Systems, and  SP 800-137, Information Security Continuous Monitor- ing for Federal Information Systems and Organizations,  provide organizations with near real-time information  that is essential for senior leaders making ongoing  risk-based decisions affecting their critical missions and  business functions.  •  Guidelines for a Role-Based Information Security  Training Model: SP 800-16, A Role-Based Model for  Federal Information Technology/Cybersecurity Train- ing, describes a process for developing information  technology/cybersecurity role-based training. Its pri- mary focus is to provide a comprehensive, yet flexible,  methodology for the development of training courses  or modules for personnel who have been identified as  having significant information technology/cybersecu- rity responsibilities within agencies.  Agencies can use  SP 800-16 to tailor the Role-Based Security Training to  meet the needs of their own organization.  •  FISMA Outreach Activity to Public and Private Sector  Organizations: CSD conducted cybersecurity outreach  briefings and provided support to state and local gov- ernments, as well as private sector organizations, on  topics of interest, such as an effective implementation  of the NIST RMF. In addition, CSD conducted outreach  activities with academic institutions, providing infor- mation on NIST’s security standards and guidelines,  exploring new areas of cybersecurity research and  development, and serving on cybersecurity advisory  panels.  In FY 2014, CSD completed the following activities:  •  Published the IPD of SP 800-53A Revision 4,  Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  1 7  Information Systems and Organizations, and began  public comment adjudication;  •  Published errata versions of SPs 800-37 Revision 1 and  800-53 Revision 4 to make necessary clarifications  and ensure consistency with subsequently published/ revised NIST SPs and new/updated federal policy  requirements;  •  Published Supplemental Guidance on Ongoing Autho- rization to assist federal agencies in transitioning from  the static point-in-time information system security  assessment and authorization model to the dynamic,  near real-time ongoing assessment and authorization  model;  •  Collaborated with the Department of Homeland Securi- ty (DHS) to develop a multiple-volume Interagency Re- port on Automation Support for Ongoing Assessments,  which is based on NIST standards and guidelines; and  •  Continued the development of a preliminary draft of SP  800-18 Revision 2, Guide for Developing Security Plans  for Federal Information Systems and Organizations.  In FY 2015, CSD intends to:  •  Finalize SP 800-53A Revision 4, Assessing Security and  Privacy Controls in Federal Information Systems and  Organizations;  • P ublish an errata update to SP 800-53 Revision 4;  •  Begin the automation of the SP 800-53 revision and  public comment process in support of more timely  updates to counter threats and keep up with techno- logical advancements;  •  Finalize SP 800-16, A Role-Based Model for Federal  Information Technology / CyberSecurity Training;  •  Finalize SP 800-160, Systems Security Engineering: An  Integrated Approach to Building Trustworthy Resilient  Systems;  •  Publish the IPD of SP 800-171, Protecting Controlled  Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information  Systems and Organizations;  •  Begin the development of SP 800-60 Revision 2, Guide  for Mapping Types of Information and Information  Systems to Security Categories;  •  Finalize SP 800-18 Revision 2, Guide for Developing  Security Plans for Federal Information Systems and  Organizations;  •  Expand cybersecurity outreach to include additional  state, local, and tribal governments, as well as private  sector organizations and academic institutions; and  •  Continue to support federal agencies in the effective  implementation of the NIST RMF.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fisma  CONTACTS: Dr. Ron Ross  Ms. Pat Toth  (301) 975-5390  (301) 975-5140  ron.ross@nist.gov  patricia.toth@nist.gov  Ms. Kelley Dempsey  Ms. Peggy Himes  (301) 975-2827  (301) 975-2489  kelley.dempsey@nist.gov  peggy.himes@nist.gov  B I O M E T R I C  S TA N D A R D S  A N D  A S S O C I AT E D  C O N F O R M I T Y  A S S E S S M E N T  T E S T I N G  T O O L S  NIST’s CSD supports the development of biometric  conformance-testing methodology standards and other  conformity-assessment efforts through active technical  participation in the development of these standards and the  development of associated conformance-test architectures  and test suites. These test tools are developed to promote  the adoption of these standards and to support users that  require conformance to selected biometric standards,  product developers and testing labs. CSD’s project team  contributes to the development of biometric standards  and leads the InterNational Committee for Information  Technology Standards (INCITS) Technical Committee  M1 – Biometrics and International Organization for  Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical  Commission (IEC) Joint Technical Committee (JTC) 1  Subcommittee (SC) 37 – Biometrics standards bodies. The  CSD plans to continue this work in FY 2015.  The development of the two versions of the Biometric  Conformance Test Software (BioCTS) continued. “BioCTS  for ANSI/NIST” (which targets biometric transactions  based on the NIST SP 500-290, and SP 500-290 Revision  1 - Data Format for the Interchange of Fingerprint, Facial  & Other Biometric Information) received enhanced testing  features for XML files, as well as updates to begin supporting  the revision of SP 500-290; for more information see:  http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/ansi_standard.cfm. “BioCTS  for ISO/IEC” (which targets several ISO/IEC biometric data  interchange formats and profiles) received updates to add  additional conformance test suites (CTSs) for selected  PIV Profiles of biometric data formats (as specified in  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fisma http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/ansi_standard.cfm  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  1 8  SP 800-76-2), as well as support for ISO/IEC 19794-4:2011  Amendment 2, which is an XML encoding for the finger  image data format. The latest versions of BioCTS were  released in September 2014, together with documentation  and sample data.  Intensive research was performed to study the  feasibility of implementing the existing conformance- testing tools within a cloud-computing setting. This  research was conducted on an Apache Hadoop platform,  investigating implementation requirements, benefits and  potential applications for biometric conformance testing.  To progress the work beyond the original goal of research,  the development of a solution was performed, resulting  in a working implementation of an existing CSD BioCTS  CTS (developed in Microsoft C#) being incorporated into  a Linux and Java-based Apache Hadoop MapReduce  job. This work successfully overcame several initial  implementation problems, and resulted in a release package  and methodology for using BioCTS software in Apache  Hadoop (for more information on Apache Hadoop see:  https://hadoop.apache.org/). The process, problems,  and methods used to overcome them were presented  at Global Identity Summit 2014. BioCTS Web, an  ASP.NET Web application that runs existing BioCTS  CTSs, was updated to support more testing suites.  For more information on BioCTS in the Cloud, see:  http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/biometrics/biocts_cloud.cfm.  Figure 2: BioCTS in the Cloud  In addition to the conformance test tools, additional  supporting tools were developed and released to benefit  users of the test tools.  They include a Data Extractor, which  allows users to extract data from an ANSI/NIST-ITL formatted  file; a Directory Hash Summary program, which allows users  to generate a SHA-256 hash value for every file within the a  given directory recursively; and enhanced statistical features  within BioCTS for both versions of BioCTS.  In addition,  advanced editing features were incorporated in BioCTS for  ANSI/NIST.

A number of technical contributions towards the  development of ANSI/NIST and international standards  were submitted. They included technical contributions on  international biometric data interchange formats and their  associated conformance testing methodologies, as well  as on the SP 500-290 Revision 1 and the associated NIEM  XML Schema. A member of the project team, Dylan Yaga,  CSD, received the INCITS Standards Service Award for his  technical excellence, performance and dedication towards  supporting the development of biometric standards.  (Further details of Dylan’s award is located in the Honors  and Awards section of this annual report - page 77.)  Outreach efforts in FY 2014 in support of biometric  standards development and conformity assessment  included contributions on the test tools to the standards  developers (in support of ongoing development projects),  and presentations on ANSI/NIST and international biometric  standards and related conformity assessment activities.  The  work included the development of technical publications,  https://hadoop.apache.org/ http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/biometrics/biocts_cloud.cfm http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/biometrics/biocta_download.cfm http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/biometrics/biocta_download.cfm  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  1 9  the review of research papers for external publications, and  participation in conference program committees.  This effort  included participation in the program development of the  Global Identity Summit conference (previously the Biometric  Consortium Conferences), which was held September 16- 18, 2014, in Tampa, Florida. The conference included nearly  1500 attendees from 30 countries representing government,  industry, and academia.  NIST’s CSD supported a booth at  the conference’s technical exposition and a member of the  project team (Dylan Yaga) presented material regarding  the conformance test tool development project.

CSD remained committed to the value of  communicating its R&D efforts to other federal colleagues  and identifying the opportunities to support R&D efforts  throughout the Federal Government.  In FY 2014, the NITRD Cyber Security and Information  Assurance (CSIA) Interagency Working Group (IWG)  monthly meetings provided an opportunity to learn and  share information about ongoing research related to the  themes and thrusts expressed in the Strategic Plan for the  Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development. NIST’s  CSD briefed the IWG on initiatives in privacy engineering,  combinatorial testing, android application testing, cyber- physical systems, big data, the National Initiative for  Cybersecurity Education (NICE), and usability.  With the NITRD CSIA Senior Steering Group, CSD  participated in the dialogue and planning that resulted  in the creation of the National Privacy Research Forum to  address concerns about privacy that were voiced in recent  President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology  (PCAST) reports and to develop a strategic plan for privacy  R&D in FY 2015.  CSD is also a regular participant in the coordination  activities of the federal Special Cyber Operations  Research and Engineering (SCORE) Committee. SCORE  enables technology transfer through the sharing of NIST  cybersecurity expertise and output. The SCORE committee  interacts with federal leaders and reports to the National  Science & Technology Council’s Committee on Homeland &  National Security.

HAVA established the Election  Assistance Commission (EAC) and the Technical Guidelines  Development Committee (TGDC), chaired by the Director of  NIST. HAVA directs NIST to provide technical support to the  EAC and TGDC in efforts related to human factors, security,  and laboratory accreditation. As part of NIST’s efforts,  CSD supports the activities of the EAC related to voting  equipment security.  In the past year, NIST continued to support the EAC in  finalizing changes to the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines  (VVSG) 1.1. The security guidelines were updated in FY 2012  to improve the auditability of voting systems, to provide  greater software integrity protections, to expand and  improve access-control requirements, and to help ensure  http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/biometrics/biocta_download.cfm  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  2 0  that cryptographic security mechanisms are implemented  properly. In addition, CSD supported the efforts of the EAC  and Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) of DOD to  improve the voting process for citizens under the Uniformed  and Overseas Citizens Voting Act (UOCAVA) by leveraging  electronic technologies. The team worked with the TDCG’s  UOCAVA Working Group to develop a risk analysis on the  technologies used in current UOCAVA voting processes,  including vote-by-mail, online voter registration, electronic  ballot delivery, and online ballot marking.  Finally, CSD began working with NIST’s Systems and  Software Division (SSD) to explore applying software  assurance concepts to electronic voting systems. The  initial work in this area applies the Common Weakness  Enumeration (CWE) list of software weaknesses to voting  systems. The CWE was used to assist in the categorization  of reported vulnerabilities within voting voting-system  security security-analysis reports. Additionally, the  vulnerabilities within the CWE are being mapped to the  Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG)—both the  current and upcoming standard.  Proposed plans for FY 2015, NIST will continue  researching the applicability of software assurance concepts  to electronic voting systems and continue to support  efforts to improve the voting process for UOCAVA voters.  Additionally, CSD will continue security research efforts to  support future standards development efforts, particularly  in the areas of risks to voting systems and innovative  voting system architectures.  http://vote.nist.gov  CONTACTS: Mr. Andrew Regenscheid  Mr. Joshua Franklin  (301) 975-5155  (301) 975-8463  andrew.regenscheid@nist.gov joshua.franklin@nist.gov  H E A LT H  I N F O R M AT I O N  T E C H N O L O G Y  S E C U R I T Y  Health Information Technology (HIT) enables better  patient care through the secure use and sharing of health  information. HIT leads to improvements in healthcare  quality, reduced medical errors, increased efficiencies in care  delivery and administration, and improved  population health. Central to reaching these goals  is the assurance of the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of health information. CSD works with  government, industry, academia, and others to provide  security tools, technologies, and methodologies that provide  for the security and privacy of health information.  NIST CSD continued its HIT security outreach efforts in  FY 2014. NIST and the Department of Health and Human  Services’ (DHHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) co-hosted  the seventh annual HIPAA Security Rule conference,  Safeguarding Health Information: Building Assurance  through HIPAA Security, in September 2014 in Washington,  D.C. The conference offered important sessions that  focused on broad topics of interest to the healthcare  and health IT security community. Over 600 in-person  and virtual attendees from federal, state, and local  governments, academia, HIPAA-covered entities and  business associates, industry groups, and vendors heard  from, and interacted with, healthcare, security, and  privacy experts on technologies and methodologies  for safeguarding health information and for implementing  the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule. Presentations  and panel discussions covered a variety of security  management and technical assurance topics, including:  •  Updates on the OCR audit and enforcement programs;  •  Use of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework in the  healthcare sector;  •  Safeguarding data using cryptographic technologies  and strong identity and access management;  •  Strategies for engaging the executive leadership to  privacy and security risks; and  •  Case studies on safeguarding patient information, and  lessons learned for health data breaches.  Keynote addresses were delivered by Darren Dworkin,  Senior Vice President of Enterprise Information Systems  and Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Cedars-Sinai Health  System, and Daniel Solove, the John Marshall Harlan Research  Professor of Law at the George Washington University Law  School.  In FY 2015, NIST CSD will continue to work with diverse  healthcare stakeholders, including partners in government  and industry, to identify opportunities to strengthen  the sector’s cybersecurity risk management efforts by  using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. As part of its  continued outreach efforts, NIST CSD also plans to co- host the eighth annual Safeguarding Health Information  conference with OCR.  http://www.nist.gov/healthcare/security/  CONTACT: Mr. Kevin Stine  (301) 975-4483  kevin.stine@nist.gov  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  2 1  S U P P LY- C H A I N  R I S K  M A N A G E M E N T  ( S C R M )  F O R  I N F O R M AT I O N  A N D  C O M M U N I C AT I O N S  T E C H N O L O G Y  ( I C T )  Information and communication technologies (ICT)  rely on a complex, globally distributed, and interconnected  supply-chain ecosystem that is long, has geographically  diverse routes, and consists of multiple tiers of outsourcing.  In addition, Federal Government information systems have  rapidly expanded in terms of capability and number, with  an increased reliance on outsourcing and commercially  available products.  These trends have caused federal departments and  agencies to have a lack of visibility and understanding  throughout the supply chain of how the technology being  acquired is developed, integrated and deployed, as well as  the processes, procedures, and practices used to assure the  integrity, security, resilience, and quality of the products and  services. This lack of visibility and understanding, in turn,  has decreased the control that federal departments and  agencies have with regard to the decisions impacting the  inherited risks traversing the supply chain and the ability  to effectively manage those risks. Figure 4 (below) shows  how ICT supply-chain risk may be derived from adversarial  or non-adversarial threats, as well as external or internal  vulnerabilities. The likelihood of an event and the potential  impact of an event are also key factors.  This project seeks to provide federal agencies with a  standardized, repeatable, and feasible toolkit of technical  and intelligence resources to strategically manage supply- chain risk throughout the entire lifecycle of systems,  products and services.  In FY 2014, CSD reviewed and addressed comments  from the initial public draft of SP 800-161, Supply Chain Risk  Management Practices for Federal Information Systems  and Organizations. This document provides guidance to  federal departments and agencies on identifying, assessing,  and mitigating ICT supply-chain risks at all levels in their  organizations and utilizes and builds on existing guidance in  Figure 4: ICT Supply Chain Risk  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  2 2  the unified information security framework. A second public  draft of the document was published in June 2014.  In June 2014, the University of Maryland Supply Chain  Management Center of the R. H. Smith School of Business  completed the fourth phase of a multi-year research project  through a NIST grant awarded in 2013. Previous phases of  the project resulted in the development of a Cyber Risk  Portal where users can conduct ICT supply-chain risk self- assessments and gain access to a number of resources. This  phase of the project deployed wide-scale testing of the  portal and made improvements to the security infrastructure  and applications.  NIST awarded the University of Maryland Supply Chain  Management Center an additional grant in 2014 to define an  effective engagement model that will enable representatives  of stakeholder organizations to come together in person  and online to learn how to map and manage their critical  ICT supply-chain risks using the portal-based tool set. The  project will be completed in April 2015.  In FY 2015, CSD will:  • Publish SP 800-161;  •  Research and develop tools and guidance to help  agencies effectively conduct criticality analysis and  other aspects needed to manage supply-chain risk;  •  Continue to co-chair Working Group 2 of the White  House’s Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initia- tive (CNCI) 11, Develop a Multi-Pronged Approach for  Global Supply Chain Risk Management; and  •  Begin researching best practices and developing an  organizational strategy for supply-chain risk manage- ment in response to the NIST Roadmap for Improving  Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.

One portion of this  legislation calls for the establishment of a nationwide,  interoperable public-safety broadband network based on  the 3rd Generation Partnership Project’s (3GPP) Long-Term  Evolution (LTE) technology. The network will be deployed  and operated by the First Responder Network Authority  (FirstNet). The planned National Public Safety Broadband  Network (NPSBN) will “create a much needed nationwide  interoperable broadband network that will help police,  firefighters, emergency medical service professionals  and other public safety officials stay safe and do their  jobs.”(http://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/public-safety).  NIST is directed to establish a list of certified devices and  required components to be used by public safety officials,  vendors, and other interested parties for interacting with  the nationwide network. NIST is also directed to conduct  research and development that supports the acceleration  and advancement of the nationwide network.  In FY 2014, CSD supported the joint National  Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)  and NIST Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR)  program (http://www.pscr.gov) with efforts in public-safety  mobile-application security, identity management, and  enabling cybersecurity capabilities on the PSCR 700 MHz  LTE demonstration network located in Boulder, Colorado.  In February 2014, CSD, in cooperation with the Association  of Public-Safety Communications Officials (APCO)  International and FirstNet, held a half-day workshop  titled “Public Safety Mobile Application Security  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  2 3  Requirements”. The outcome of that workshop is captured  in Draft NISTIR 8018, Public Safety Mobile Application  Security Requirements Workshop Summary. At PSRC’s  Annual Public Safety Broadband Stakeholder Conference  in June 2014, CSD organized and moderated a panel titled  “Mobile Applications Security for Public Safety”.  CSD developed Draft NISTIR 8014, Considerations for  Identity Management in Public Safety Mobile Networks,  that provides a brief introduction to identity management,  summarizes existing guidance (including OMB-04- 04, E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies;  Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD12):  Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal  Employees and Contractors; and NIST SP 800-63-2,  Electronic Authentication Guideline), and describes possible  identity tokens/credentials that could be supported by  mobile devices.  CSD participated in the standards development process  for LTE technology within the 3rd Generation Partnership  Project (3GPP) supporting security requirements for public  safety that are related to Proximity Services (ProSe), Group  Communication System Enablers (GCSE), and Mission  Critical Push-To-Talk (MCPTT). In addition, CSD broadened  its scope within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)  to include efforts related to public safety.  In FY 2015, CSD will continue representing public safety  in international standardization efforts, such as the IETF  and 3GPP. CSD will work to implement and exercise  cybersecurity capabilities in the PSCR 700 MHz LTE  demonstration network, conduct research into mobile  authentication solutions to support the different public- safety disciplines, and investigate mobile application- security services to support the security requirements of  public-safety mobile applications. CSD will continue to  engage the public-safety communications community by  organizing workshops and conferences; and participating  in events such as APCO’s Annual Meeting, PSRC’s Annual  Public Safety Broadband Stakeholder Conference, and the  International Wireless Communications Expo (IWCE).

CPS is commonly used in the nation’s critical  infrastructure and includes systems in the electric grid,  manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation sectors.  Composed of heterogeneous, potentially distributed  components and systems, CPS provides a promise of  increased efficiency and interaction between the digital  and physical worlds. However, assuring that these emerging  and evolving systems are reliable, robust, resilient,  trustworthy, secure, and that they protect the privacy of  information poses a unique cybersecurity challenge.  CPS present unique challenges, including the need  for integration with legacy components and allowance for  emerging technologies, and real-time response in support  of extremely high availability, predictability, and reliability.  Cybersecurity is an important crosscutting discipline that  is critical to the safe and resilient design, development  and operation of CPS. Addressing the opportunities  and challenges of CPS requires a broad collaboration to  develop a common foundation to work from, including a  consensus definition, vocabulary, reference architecture,  and a shared understanding of the essential roles of timing,  cybersecurity and data interoperability. CSD is researching  the cybersecurity needs of the broader landscape of CPS,  by leveraging CSD’s expertise in cybersecurity in different  domains and applications of CPS (such as industrial control  systems, smart grid, hardware-enabled security, and  embedded systems).  In June 2014, NIST established the CPS Public Working  Group (PWG), which is open to all, to foster and capture  inputs from those involved in CPS, both nationally and  globally. CSD is working in collaboration with NIST’s  Engineering Laboratory (EL) Smart Grid and Cyber-Physical  Systems Program Office, NIST’s Physical Measurement  Laboratory Time and Frequency Division, ITL’s Software  and Systems Division and ITL’s Advanced Networking  Technologies Division to lead a public-private working group  of government, academia, and industry stakeholders. The  CPS PWG consists of five technical subgroups:  • Definition, Vocabulary, and Reference Architecture;  • Use Cases;  • Cybersecurity and Privacy;  • Data Interoperability; and  • Timing and Synchronization.  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  2 4  Each subgroup consists of co-leads from academia,  industry and NIST. CSD co-leads the Cybersecurity and  Privacy subgroup focused on identifying strategies  for cybersecurity and privacy in CPS, and will work  collaboratively with the other subgroups to ensure that  cybersecurity is included as a design principle during  development.  In 2015, the CPS PWG will publish an integrated  Framework that includes the work of the five technical  subgroups and begin work on a CPS Technology Roadmap,  which will identify opportunities for a coordinated effort  on key technical challenges. The CPS PWG deliverables will  be technology and business-model neutral, and freely  available online and intended for open use by all stakeholders.  Additionally, in 2015, CSD, in conjunction with NIST’s  Engineering Laboratory, Intelligent Systems Division, will  finalize SP 800-82 Revision 2, Guide to Industrial Control  Systems Security. CSD will also continue to participate in the  International Society of Automation (ISA) 99 Committee,  which develops and establishes standards, recommended  practices, technical reports, and related information that  define procedures for implementing electronically secure  industrial automation and control systems and security  practices, and for assessing electronic security performance.  http://www.nist.gov/cps/ http://www.nist.gov/cps/cpspwg.cfm  CONTACTS: Ms. Victoria Yan Pillitteri  Ms. Suzanne Lightman  (301) 975-8542  (301) 975-6442  victoria.pillitteri@nist.gov  suzanne.lightman@nist.gov  S M A R T  G R I D  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  Figure 5: Smart Meter  The major elements of the smart grid are: information  technology, industrial control systems/operational  technology, and the communications infrastructure. The  infrastructure is used to send command information across  the electric grid from generation to distribution systems, and  to exchange usage and billing information between utilities  and their customers. Key to the successful deployment  of the smart grid infrastructure is the development of the  cybersecurity strategy that includes cybersecurity as a  design consideration for new and emerging systems, and  an approach to adding cybersecurity into existing systems.  The electric grid is critical to the economic and physical well- being of the nation, and emerging cyber threats targeting  power systems highlight the need to integrate advanced  security to protect critical assets.  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  2 5  The Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP) became a  membership-supported organization in January 2013. The  SGIP Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG) was renamed  the Smart Grid Cybersecurity Committee (SGCC), and  continues to be led by a NIST representative in support of  responsibilities identified in the Energy Independence and  Security Act of 2007. The SGCC chair is a voting member of  the SGIP Technical Committee, and serves as an ex-officio  Director of the Board. In addition, the SGIP SGCC continues  to include additional leadership by a management team  comprised of three volunteer vice-chairs (representing the  Department of Energy (DOE), an electric utility, and a smart  grid vendor) and a volunteer secretariat.  In 2014, the SGCC contributed to the update of NISTIR  7628 Revision 1, Guidelines for Smart Grid Cybersecurity,  which was published in September, following a public  comment period and comment resolution by the  SGCC members. The revision updates and expands the  development strategy, cryptography and key management,  privacy, vulnerability classes, research and development  topics, standards review, and key power-system use cases  to reflect changes in the smart grid environment since  2010. In addition to the revision of NISTIR 7628, the SGCC  have focused on developing documents to be published  through SGIP on cybersecurity risk management, a User’s  Guide for NISTIR 7628, cloud computing for the smart grid,  and a mapping between NISTIR 7628 and the Framework  for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. Work in  these areas is completed through SGCC subgroups, which  are created and disbanded on an as-needed basis.  The SGCC also continues to support the SGIP Catalog  of Standards (CoS), a compendium of standards, practices,  guidelines and other technical documents considered  relevant for the development of a robust, secure, and  interoperable smart grid. Through the ongoing efforts of the  SGCC, these documents are reviewed for cybersecurity, and  recommendations are made for including cybersecurity in  future revisions and in the implementation of the standards.  CSD supports the SGCC in assessing the security of the  cryptographic methods used in these standards, practices,  guidelines, and other technical documents. In many cases,  the standards bodies have taken the results of the reviews  and modified the standards or documents to address NIST  recommendations. The SGCC has worked closely with some  of the standards bodies to ensure that the recommendations  are interpreted correctly and that the mitigation strategies  selected meet the intent of the NISTIR 7628 high-level  security requirements. The result is cybersecurity “baked-in”  to the standards, rather than “bolted-on” after the standard  is implemented.  Future activities include working with the SGIP  Committees, Domain Expert Working Groups, and Priority  Action Plans to integrate cybersecurity into their work  efforts. Additionally, the SGIP SGCC will continue to  collaborate with industry, academia, other working groups,  and government agencies to address the cybersecurity  needs for the smart grid.  In FY 2015, CSD will continue to support the SGCC  in the evaluation of the cryptographic methods used  in standards, practices, guidelines, and other technical  documents for inclusion in the SGIP CoS. In addition to the  SGIP SGCC activities, CSD will also coordinate with NIST’s  Engineering Laboratory (EL) and Smart Grid Program Office  on the development of a Cybersecurity Smart Grid Test  Lab, part of the NIST Smart Grid Testbed Facility now under  construction. CSD will also collaborate with ITL’s Software  and Systems Division on cybersecurity research in relation  to the IEEE 1588, Precision Time Protocol, a standard on time  synchronization that is used for the electric grid and other  special-purpose industrial automation and measurement  networks.  http://www.nist.gov/smartgrid  http://www.sgip.org  CONTACTS: Ms. Victoria Yan Pillitteri  Ms. Tanya Brewer  (301) 975-8542  (301) 975-4534  victoria.pillitteri@nist.gov  tbrewer@nist.gov  Mr. Quynh Dang  (301) 975-3610  qdang@nist.gov  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  AWA R E N E S S ,  T R A I N I N G ,  E D U C AT I O N ,  A N D  O U T R E A C H  National  Init iat ive for  Cybersecurity  Education (NICE)  NIST has been the lead for the National Initiative for  Cybersecurity Education (NICE) since its inception in 2010.

NIST’s CSD is leading the NICE initiative working from  the strengths and energy of more than 20 federal  departments and agencies leveraging each of their  relationships with academia and industry sectors to ensure  coordination, cooperation, focus, public engagement,  technology transfer and sustainability. NIST will highlight  these activities, engage various stakeholder groups and  create forums for sharing information and leveraging best  practices.  CSD is home to the NIST NICE Leadership Team that  focuses on the following activities:  •  Developing planning documents and building consen- sus on the strategy and implementation activities of  NICE;  •  Utilizing a newly established public-private working  group to make progress towards NICE’s goals;  •  Promoting the use of data-driven initiatives within  NICE;  •  Facilitating cross-functional cooperation among federal  departments and agencies by coordinating meetings,  facilitating discussions, and disseminating information;  •  Promoting the initiative and its efforts by representing  NICE and speaking at cybersecurity events nationwide;  •  Planning and hosting an annual workshop to promote  and support the evolving issues in cybersecurity work- force and education; and  •  Coordinating with other federal initiatives and efforts  related to NICE.  The NICE leadership team attended many events,  symposia, forums, competitions, educational outreach  meetings, and workshops to promote the activities within  NICE. The team continued its leadership of the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM) Cross-Agency Priority  Goal: “Closing Skills Gap” for IT/Cybersecurity focused on  reducing cybersecurity workforce gaps and supported the  goals of the White House’s Ready to Work initiative.  In FY 2015, CSD will continue to promote the  coordination of existing and future cybersecurity education,  training, and workforce activities. The Fifth annual NICE  Workshop will take place on November 5-6, 2014 in  Columbia, Maryland (http://csrc.nist.gov/nice/events.html).  The CSD will also identify opportunities to extend and  integrate the NICE  focus on cybersecurity workforce,  education, and training within NIST Special Publications  and informational reports while promoting the value of  the National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NCWF)  and the forthcoming Department of Defense Cyberspace  Workforce Strategy as resources that address cybersecurity  workforce needs.  http://www.nist.gov/nice/  CONTACTS: Mr. Bill Newhouse  Dr. Ernest McDuffie (retired)  NICE Program Manager  FY 2014 NICE Lead  (301) 975-2869  william.newhouse@nist.gov  Computer  Security Resource Center  (CSRC)  The CSRC, CSD’s website, is one of the most visited  websites at NIST.

During FY 2014, the CSRC underwent what the CSD  terms as “Quick Fixes” to the CSRC website. These “Quick  Fixes” will improve the overall navigation experience on  CSRC. The CSRC homepage was streamlined by providing  hot topics (these hot topics are the most popular projects/ programs that have webpages), updated references in  the Useful Resources section, and an improved News and  Events section. The homepage was condensed to reduce  the amount of scrolling on the page. Another improvement  made to the CSRC website was the dropdown menus,  which appear on all pages. In previous years, the division’s  projects/programs listings were placed under the division’s  group layout. Now, the projects/programs listings are under  their own category (Ex. Education & Outreach category, a  project falling under this category: Small and Medium-Sized  Business (SMB) Outreach). The CSRC team created an A to  Z listing of the webpages for all of CSD’s projects/programs  in order to ease the finding of a particular area.  Plans for FY 2015 for the CSRC website will include  moving the CSRC website to a content management system  (CMS). Moving to a CMS is expected to improve the website’s  functionality.  Questions on the website can be sent to the CSRC  Webmaster at: webmaster-csrc@nist.gov.

The  Forum, which serves more than 1100 members, strives to  provide an ongoing opportunity for managers of federal  information security programs to exchange information  security materials in a timely manner, build upon the  experiences of other programs, and reduce possible  duplication of effort. It provides a mechanism for NIST to  share information directly with federal agency information  security program managers in fulfillment of NIST’s  leadership mandate under FISMA. It assists NIST in  establishing and maintaining relationships with other  individuals or organizations that are actively addressing  information security issues within the Federal Government.  NIST’s CSD serves as the Secretariat of the Forum, providing  necessary administrative and logistical support. Patricia Toth  serves as the Chairperson.  The Forum maintains an extensive email subscription  service. Participation in the service is only open to Federal  Government employees who participate in the management  of their organization’s information system security  program. The Forum also holds bimonthly meetings and an  annual two-day conference to discuss current issues and  developments of interest to those responsible for protecting  sensitive (unclassified) federal systems.  Topics of discussion at Forum meetings in FY 2014  included briefings from various federal agencies on  Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Implementation  Activities, Cross Agency Priority (CAP) Goals, Automated  Assessment Practicals, Automated Assessment Concepts  Supporting Information Security Continuous Monitoring  (ISCM), NIST’s Role in Ongoing Assessments, Ongoing  Authorization Clarifying and Amplifying Guidance, and the  National Cybersecurity Framework.  This year’s annual two-day offsite meeting featured  updates on the computer security activities of the  Government Accountability Office (GAO), General Services  Administration (GSA), Bureau of the Fiscal Service,  Department of State, National Security Council, Department  of Homeland Security (DHS), and NIST. Technical sessions  included briefings on updates from NIST Computer Security  Division (CSD), FedRAMP Overview and Security Processes,  Supply Chain Risk Management, Ongoing Authorization,  Fiscal Service’s Risk-Based ISCM Strategy, Derived PIV  Credentials, Cybersecurity Training, Incident Response,  White House Initiatives, FY 2015 FISMA Metrics and recent  updates to the FISMA publications.  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/subscribe.html  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  2 8  The Forum plays a valuable role in helping NIST and  other federal agencies to develop and maintain a strong,  proactive stance in the identification and resolution of new  strategic and tactical IT security issues as they emerge.

FISSEA strives to elevate the general level of information  system security knowledge for the Federal Government and  the federal workforce. It also seeks to assist the professional  development of its members.  FISSEA membership is open to information system  security professionals, professional trainers and educators,  and managers responsible for information system security  training programs in federal agencies, as well as contractors  of these agencies and faculty members of accredited  educational institutions who are involved in information  security training and education. To become a FISSEA  member; all that is required is a willingness to share  products, information, and experiences. A working group  meets monthly to administer business activities.  FISSEA maintains a website, a mailing list, and  participates in a social networking site as a means of  communication for its members. NIST’s CSD assists FISSEA  with its operations by providing staff support for several of  its activities and by being FISSEA’s host agency.  FISSEA membership in 2014 spanned federal agencies,  industry, military, contractors, state governments, academia,  the press, and foreign organizations in a total of ten countries.  The 700 federal agency members represent 89 agencies  from the executive and legislative branches of government.  The 27th Annual FISSEA Conference occurred March  18-20, 2014, at NIST. Approximately 180 information system  security professionals and trainers attended from federal  agencies, academia, and industry.  This year’s theme was, “Partners in Performance:  Shaping the Future of Cybersecurity Awareness, Education,  and Training.” The program team solicited presentations that  reflected current projects, trends, and future initiatives in  federal security programs. Attendees gained new techniques  for developing/conducting training, cost-effective practices,  workforce development, free resources and contacts, as  well as an update on National Initiative for Cybersecurity  Education (NICE) activities.  Keynote presentations were given by: Dr. Ron Ross,  NIST Fellow, CSD; Ambassador  Karen Kornbluh, Executive  Vice President of External Affairs for Nielsen, former U.S.  Ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development (OECD); and Ms. Linda Cureton, Chief  Executive Officer and Founder of Muse Technologies, Inc.  (former NASA CIO).  Presenters represented NIST, DHS, DOS, NSA, NASA,  IRS, private industry and academia. Attendees had an  opportunity to visit fifteen vendors on the second day. A  Government Best Practice Poster and Demonstration session  was held on the third day, which provided an opportunity for  agencies to share and tell about their specific awareness and  2014 FISSEA Educator of the Year Award:  Sam Maroon, FITSI Foundation / Wounded Warrior  Cyber Combat Academy  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  2 9  training programs. In addition, there was a panel discussion  of former FISSEA Educator of the Year recipients - influential  leaders who have demonstrated a superior level of expertise,  effectiveness, and dedication to the advancement of  the information system security awareness, training and  education profession. They discussed their best and worst  ideas for improving cybersecurity programs, shared  significant activities, and answered questions.  The FISSEA Educator of the Year Award was  established to recognize and honor a contemporary who is  making special efforts to create, build, manage, or inspire  an information system security awareness, training, or  education program. This year’s Educator of the Year award  was presented to Sam Maroon, Federal IT Security Institute  (FITSI) Foundation/ Wounded Warrior Cyber Combat  Academy. The nomination letter recommending him for this  award made the following statements: “Mr. Maroon deserves  this award for his unflagging work supporting this country’s  injured servicemen and women in transitioning them to  the cyber battlefield through the Wounded Warrior Cyber  Combat Academy. … He has donated at least 300 hours  of his own personal time…” The full nomination letters are  posted on the FISSEA website.  FISSEA conference events also included announcing the  winners of FISSEA contests and awarding prize drawings.  The FISSEA Security Awareness, Training & Education  Contest includes five categories from one of FISSEA’s  three key areas of Awareness, Training, and Education.  The winner is selected from each category and awarded a  certificate.

The Board  was originally created by the Computer Security Act of  1987 (P.L. 100-235) as the Computer System Security and  Privacy Advisory Board (CSSPAB) within the Department  of Commerce. The CSSPAB was chartered in May 1988 in  accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act,  as amended, 5 U.S.C., App. In December 2002, Public  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  3 0  Law 107-347, The E-Government Act of 2002, Title III, The  Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of  2002, Section 21 of the National Institute of Standards and  Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278g-4) amended the statutory  authority of the Board and renamed it the Information  Security and Privacy Advisory Board.  Since the inception of this Advisory Board in 1987, ISPAB  successfully renewed its charter with proper authority every  two years. The legislative history for Public Law 100-235 and  Public Law 107-347 underscores that Congress intended that  the Board be a continuing body. The Board plays a central  and unique role in providing the government with expert  advice concerning information security and privacy issues  that may affect federal information systems. No other similar  group of experts meets regularly to review information  security issues involved in unclassified Federal Government  computer systems and networks. Also, Title III of the  E-Government Act of 2002 reaffirmed the need for this  Board by giving it additional responsibilities: to thoroughly  review all of the proposed information technology standards  and guidelines developed under Section 20 of the National  Institute of Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278g-3),  as amended.  Congress indicated the long-term need for the Board by  setting the term of Board members at a minimum of four  years. The charter (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/ documents/ispab_charter_2014-2016.pdf) requires that the  NIST Director appoint the Chairman and all twelve members  of the Board. They are selected for their preeminence in the  information technology industry or related disciplines.  The Charter also stipulates that Board members be  selected from three main categories, with each category  providing four members. Category 1 includes members  from outside the Federal Government who are eminent in  the information technology industry, at least one of whom  is representative of small or medium-sized companies in  such industries. Category 2 also includes members from  outside the Federal Government and not employed by or  representative of a producer of information, but who are  eminent in the field of information technology, or related  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/documents/ispab_charter_2014-2016.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/documents/ispab_charter_2014-2016.pdf  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  3 1  disciplines. Category 3 includes experienced information  system managers from the Federal Government, including  those with experience in information security and privacy,  at least one of whom should be from the National Security  Agency. The categorization of Board members is intended  to meet ISPAB’s statutory objectives. Federal members  bring a detailed understanding of the federal processing  environment; industry brings concerns and experiences  regarding product development and market formation,  while private computer security experts are able to bring  their experiences of commercial cost-effective security  measures into Board discussion.  Presently, the ISPAB Chairperson is Matt Thomlinson,  Senior Vice President, Microsoft Security, who assumed  the chair in October 2012. He is supported by the following  Board members:  •  Julie Boughn, (formerly from Center for Medicare &  Medicaid,  Innovation Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS));  • Christopher Boyer, AT&T;  • John Centafont, National Security Agency (NSA);  • David Cullinane, Security Starfish, LLC;  • Kevin Fu, The University of Michigan;  •  Gregory Garcia, Financial Services Sector Coordinating  Council (FSSCC);  •  Toby Levin, Retired (formerly from U.S. Department of  Homeland Security);  • Edward Roback, U.S. Department of Treasury;  • Gale Stone, Social Security Administration; and  • Peter Weinberger, Google, Inc.  During FY 2014, ISPAB held three meetings, all in  Washington D.C:  •  December 19-20, 2013 – this meeting was to replace  the meeting scheduled for October 10-12, 2013 that was  cancelled due to a government shutdown;  • March 12-14, 2014; and  • June 11-13, 2014.  During the December 2013 meeting, the Board  developed a FY 2014 work plan. The resulting plan included  the following areas of focus:  •  Coordination with Office of Management and Budget  (OMB), and other federal agencies, such as National  Security Agency (NSA) and U.S. Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), on all matters relating to  information security and privacy;  •  Cybersecurity technical transfer and implementation  interests, considering items of particular note to indi- vidual industry sectors;  •  Updates from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight  Board (PCLOB);  •  Updates from NIST’s CSD regarding cybersecurity and  cryptographic work;  •  Updates regarding embedded software security, in- cluding medical device security;  •  Considerations surrounding Trusted Internet Connec- tions, DHS Enhanced Cybersecurity Services (ECS) and  special needs for critical infrastructures;  •  Procurement and requirements to reduce supply-chain  risk;  •  Cross-Agency Priority Goals (CAP Goals) for cyberse- curity;  •  Information sharing with a focus on information securi- ty and privacy;  •  Updates regarding FISMA, the related security controls  (SP 800-53), and FedRAMP; and  • Updates of other critical NIST publications.  In addition to the work-plan focus areas, the Board also  considered the following topics during FY 2014:  • Internet of Things (IOT);  • Cryptography and NIST Cryptography processes;  •  Transportation Sector and Vehicle-to-Vehicle Commu- nication;  •  GAO reports relating to information security and priva- cy;  • Big Data and Privacy;  • Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Program;  •  Federal Cloud Credential Exchange (FCCX) and the  NSTIC; and  •  National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE)  Updates.  The presenters at each Board meeting were leaders  and experts representing private industry; academia;  federal agency CIOs, IGs and CISOs.

A computer failure or system  breach could jeopardize the company’s reputation and may  result in significant damage and recovery cost or going  out of business. The small business owner who recognizes  the threat of computer crime and takes steps to deter  inappropriate activities is less likely to become a victim.  The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) reports  that over 27 million U.S. companies - more than 99 percent  of all U.S. businesses - are SMBs of 500 employees or fewer  (http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/allprofiles12.pdf).  While the threats to individual small and medium-size  businesses (SMBs) may not be significantly different from  those facing larger organizations, a SMB frequently has  fewer resources available to protect systems, detect attacks,  or respond to security issues. A vulnerability common to a  large percentage of SMBs could pose a threat to the nation’s  information infrastructure and economic base.  To help address information security risk, these  businesses require assistance with the identification of  security mechanisms and with practical, cost-effective  training. Training helps SMB’s use their limited resources  most effectively to address relevant and serious threats. In  response to this need, NIST, the SBA, and the Federal Bureau  of Investigation (FBI) co-sponsor a series of cybersecurity  training workshops for small businesses. These workshops  provide an overview of cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities,  and corresponding protective tools and techniques, with  a special emphasis on information that small business  personnel can apply directly.  In FY 2014, NIST, in collaboration with the FBI and the  SBA, focused on implementing a three-year renewal of the  co-sponsorship agreement that governs this cybersecurity  workshop outreach program.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/sbc/  CONTACT: Ms. Patricia Toth  301-975-5140  patricia.toth@nist.gov  (Editor Note: Mr. Richard Kissel led this program until his  recent retirement.)  C R Y P T O G R A P H I C  S TA N D A R D S  P R O G R A M  Hash Algorithms and the Secure Hash  Algorithm-3 (SHA-3) Standard (Draft  FIPS 202)  NIST opened a public competition in 2007 to develop a  new cryptographic hash algorithm, SHA-3, to augment the  hash algorithms specified in the Secure Hash Standard, FIPS  180-4. The competition ended on October 2, 2012 when NIST  announced the selection of KeccaK as the winning algorithm  for standardization as the new SHA-3 Standard. NIST  consulted with the KeccaK designers and the cryptographic  community, and then developed a SHA-3 standardization  plan, which was presented at numerous cryptography  conferences in 2013, and posted at the NIST hash website,  indicated below, for public feedback.  On May 28, 2014, NIST CSD announced Draft FIPS  202, SHA-3 Standard:  Permutation-Based Hash and  Extendable-Output Functions, in the Federal Register (79  FR 30549) and requested comments. The announcement  also proposed a revision of the Applicability Clause (#6)  of the Announcement Section of FIPS 180-4, Secure Hash  Standard, to allow the use of hash algorithms specified in  either FIPS 180-4 or FIPS 202 for federal applications that  require a cryptographic hash algorithm. The revision was  necessary because the original text in FIPS 180-4 mandates  the use of hash algorithms specified in FIPS 180-4 only. The  other sections of FIPS 180-4 remain unchanged. The ninety- day public comment period for Draft FIPS 202 and the  revision in FIPS 180-4 ended on August 26, 2014.  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  3 3  The CSD also hosted a SHA-3 workshop at the  University of California, Santa Barbara, on August 22, 2014  to obtain feedback on the proposed SHA-3 Standard, and  on additional modes of operation based on SHA-3 that are  being considered for standardization. Approximately 75  participants from around the world attended the workshop.  The CSD received much feedback throughout the  year, especially during the week of the workshop. Official  comments received on Draft FIPS 202 and on the revision  of the Applicability Clause of FIPS 180-4 are posted at  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/fips-202-public- comments-aug2014.html. CSD is in the process of addressing  these comments, and incorporating them, as appropriate, in  the final versions of FIPS 202 and FIPS 180-4, to be approved  by the Secretary of Commerce. NIST will announce the final  approval by the Secretary in the Federal Register.  Information about the SHA-3 standardization effort is  available at:  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/sha-3_ standardization.html.  CONTACT: Ms. Shu-jen Chang  (301) 975-2940  shu-jen.chang@nist.gov  Random Number Generation (RNG) Random numbers are required for the security for many  cryptographic algorithms. For example, random numbers  are used to generate the keys needed for encryption and  digital signature applications.  In the late 1990s, a project to develop more rigorous  requirements and specifications for random number  generation (RNG) was initiated in coordination with the  American National Standards Institute’s (ANSI) Accredited  Standards Committee (ASC) X9. The resulting standard  (American National Standard (ANS) X9.82) contains four  parts: Part 1 provides general information; Part 2, which is  nearing completion, will provide requirements for entropy  sources; Part 3 provides specifications for deterministic  random bit generator (DRBG) mechanisms; and Part 4  provides guidance on constructing random bit generators  (RBGs) from entropy sources and DRBG mechanisms.  In March 2007, CSD published SP 800-90,  Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using  Deterministic Random Bit Generators, which contained the  DRBG mechanisms in Part 3 of ANS X9.82, plus an additional  DRBG mechanism. This recommendation was revised as SP  800-90A in January 2012 to include additional capabilities  identified during the development of Part 4 of ANS X9.82.  In September 2013, articles from major news  organizations, based on leaked classified documents,  raised public concern that one of the DRBGs specified in  SP 800-90A could contain a backdoor, namely, the Dual_ EC_DRBG, which is based on the use of elliptic curves. This  weakness could allow attackers to successfully predict the  secret cryptographic keys that form the foundation for the  assurances provided by security products. CSD immediately  published an ITL Bulletin (September 2013, visit the CSRC ITL  Bulletins page http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsITLSB. html) that provided a high-level discussion of the issues,  reopened the SP 800-90 series of publications for public  comment, and recommended that the Dual_EC_DRBG no  longer be used, pending the resolution of the comments. In  April 2014, another public comment period was held on a  revision of SP 800-90A that removed the Dual_EC_DRBG  from the document. An additional public comment period  was held in late 2014 that included additional changes  suggested during the April 2014 comment period.  Two additional documents (SP 800-90B,  Recommendation for the Entropy Sources Used for  Random Bit Generation, and SP 800-90C, Recommendation  for Random Bit Generator (RBG) Constructions) are under  development, and the initial drafts were made available  for public comment in 2012. SP 800-90B addresses the  development and testing of entropy sources, including  descriptions of the validation tests for NIST’s Cryptographic  Algorithm Validation Program to validate candidate  entropy sources. SP 800-90C provides basic guidance on  the construction of RBGs from entropy sources and DRBG  mechanisms. These documents have undergone further  changes as a result of the public comments and discussions  with industry representatives. Updated drafts will be  provided for another public comment period in early FY  2015.

A block cipher  transforms some fixed-length binary data (i.e., a “block”)  into seemingly random data of the same length. The  transformation is determined by the choice of some secret  data called the “key.” The same key is used to reverse the  transformation and recover the original block of data. A  cryptographic technique that is constructed from a block  cipher is called a mode of operation.  NIST’s CSD is developing AES modes of operation for  format-preserving encryption (FPE), based on proposals  that were submitted from the private sector. A format  can be a sequence of decimal digits, such as a credit card  number or a social security number (SSN); formats can  also be defined for other sets of characters besides decimal  digits. FPE produces ciphertext with the same format as the  corresponding plaintext, so that, for example, an encrypted  SSN still looks like a valid SSN. FPE is expected to facilitate  the retrofitting of encryption to existing applications. For  example, FPE could be applied to database systems, so that  the sensitive data could be targeted for encryption without  disrupting the underlying data fields/pathways.  Draft SP 800-38G, Recommendation for Block Cipher  Modes of Operation: Methods for Format-Preserving  Encryption, which was released for public comment in July  2013, included three methods for FPE called FF1, FF2, and  FF3. These methods are modes of operation of the AES that  are intended to support a security strength of 128 bits or  more.  As part of the public review of Draft SP 800-38G and  as part of its routine consultation with other agencies, NIST  was advised by the National Security Agency that the FF2  mode in the draft could not support 128 bits of security  strength for some use cases. NIST independently confirmed  this assessment, and in June 2014, NIST’s CSD announced its  intention to remove FF2 from the document.  The FF2 mode was designed for the payment card  industry and submitted for NIST’s consideration in 2011 by  VeriFone Systems, Inc. NIST’s analysis does not imply any  practical vulnerability for the implementations of FF2 in  the payment card industry. Nevertheless, in order for FF2  to meet NIST’s security requirements for other potential  applications, VeriFone Systems, Inc. has indicated that it will  submit a revised proposal for NIST CSD to review. Meanwhile,  CSD expects to finalize SP 800-38G with FF1 and FF3 in FY  2015.

SP 800-56B, Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key  Establishment Schemes Using Integer Factorization  Cryptography, was first published in August 2009. This  publication specifies approved methods for automated  key establishment using Rivest, Shamir, Adleman (RSA)  key-transport and key-agreement schemes. In an RSA key- transport scheme, one party (called the sender) generates  a key to be used in subsequent communications and sends  it to another party (called the receiver), encrypted using  the receiver’s public key. In a key-agreement scheme, two  parties contribute information that is used by each party  to compute a shared secret, which is then used to derive  a key that is known by both parties. The 2009 version  approved the use of 1024- and 2048-bit keys for both key- transport and key-agreement schemes, and in the case  of the key-agreement schemes, specified two approved  methods for key derivation, both using an approved hash  function. SP 800-56B has been revised to remove the use  of 1024-bit keys because they no longer provide adequate  protection for federal information, and to approve the use  of 3072-bit keys. This revision also includes the approval of  additional key-derivation methods specified in SP 800-56C,  Recommendation for Key Derivation through Extraction- then-Expansion, and SP 800-135, Recommendation for  Existing Application-Specific Key Derivation Functions,  and the use of Hash-based Message Authentication Code  (HMAC), as well as a hash function, during the key-derivation  process. HMAC is specified in FIPS 198-1, The Keyed-Hash  Message Authentication Code (HMAC). The revision of SP  800-56B was published in September 2014.  SP 800-57, Recommendation for Key Management,  Part 3: Application-Specific Key Management Guidance,  was first published in 2009. This document addresses the  key-management issues of currently available cryptographic  mechanisms, including the use of Public Key Infrastructures  (PKI) and several commonly used security protocols. A  revision of this document was provided for public comment  in May 2014 that updated the guidance provided in the 2009  version, included an additional section on the Secure Shell  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  3 5  (SSH) protocol and removed the TLS section, which is now  being addressed in SP 800-52 Revision 1, Guidelines for the  Selection, Configuration, and Use of Transport Layer Security  (TLS) Implementations. The final version of SP 800-57, Part  3 will be published in early 2015.  SP 800-152, A Profile for U.S. Federal Cryptographic  Key Management Systems (CKMS), is under development  to provide guidance on the CKMSs to be used by the  Federal Government. This document provides refinements  of the requirements for CKMS designers that are specified  in SP 800-130, A Framework for Designing Cryptographic  Key Management Systems. SP 800-152 also provides  requirements and recommendations for the service providers  of CKMSs used by federal agencies and their contractors,  as well as guidance for the federal agencies in selecting a  CKMS that supports the security and management policies  of those agencies. A draft of this document was provided  for public comment in FY 2013, and a workshop was held  in March 2013 to discuss the draft. A second draft has been  under development throughout FY 2014 to address the  received comments and issues raised at the workshop. This  draft will be available for public comment in December 2014.  A new NIST publication is under development  that provides guidance on the security strength of a  cryptographic key that is used to protect data (i.e., a  data-protection key), given the manner in which the key  was generated and handled prior to its use to protect the  target data. This document, SP 800-158, Key Management:  Obtaining a Targeted Security Strength, involves a  considerable amount of new research, since it is an area that  has not been fully addressed to date. This publication will be  available for public comment in FY 2015.  Additional key-management work to be conducted in  FY 2015 includes revisions to the following publications:  •  SP 800-56A, Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key-Es- tablishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm  Cryptography: This revision will align SP 800-56A  more closely with SP 800-56B, including the addition  of 3072-bit keys for the finite-field Diffie-Hellman  key-agreement schemes.  •  SP 800-57 Part 1, Recommendation for Key Man- agement: Part 1: General: The revision will include an  update of the approved key sizes for cryptographic  algorithms, and reference the new SHA-3 hash func- tions specified in FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permuta- tion-Based Hash and Extendable-Output Functions.  •  SP 800-131A, Transitions: Recommendation for Tran- sitioning the Use of Cryptographic Algorithms and  Key Lengths: This document will be revised to include  references to the SHA-3 hash functions and to update  guidance on the continued use of cryptographic algo- rithms and key sizes by the Federal government.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/key_mgmt  CONTACTS: Ms. Elaine Barker  Dr. Dustin Moody  (301) 975-2911  (301) 975-8136  elaine.barker@nist.gov  dustin.moody@nist.gov  Dr. Lily Chen  Mr. Ray Perlner  (301) 975-6974  (301) 975-3357  lily.chen@nist.gov  ray.perlner@nist.gov  Mr. Quynh Dang  (301) 975-3610  quynh.dang@nist.gov  Transport  Layer  Security SP 800-52 Revision 1, Guidelines for the Selection,  Configuration, and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS)  Implementations, provides recommendations regarding  TLS server and client implementations. TLS is a widely  used cryptographic protocol that provides communication  security for a variety of network applications, such as email,  e-commerce, and healthcare.  The first version of SP 800-52, published in 2005,  was withdrawn in March 2013. In September 2013, CSD  announced Draft SP 800-52 Revision 1. Changes to the  document were made based on comments received during  the public comment period, which ended in mid-December  2013. The final version of SP 800-52 Revision 1 was published  in April 2014.  SP 800-52 Revision 1 is a significant update to the  original guidance and includes recommendations providing  higher levels of security. New recommendations include the  support of TLS versions 1.1 and 1.2, guidance on certificate  profiles and validation methods, TLS extensions, and support  for a greater variety of cryptographic algorithms.  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is actively  developing extensions that can be used to add functionality  to TLS. The CSD’s Cryptographic Technology Group (CTG)  will review updates and additions to the TLS protocol in the  second half of FY 2015. If there are changes that should be  incorporated into SP 800-52, the development of a new  revision will begin.

If large- scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to  break the existing infrastructure of public-key cryptography.  The focus of the Post Quantum Cryptography project is  to identify candidate quantum-resistant systems that are  secure against both quantum and classical computers, as  well as the impact that such post-quantum algorithms will  have on current protocols and security infrastructures.  In FY 2014, CSD researchers internally presented status  reports in the areas of quantum computation, coding-based  cryptography, lattice-based cryptography, and multivariate  cryptography, which included detailed surveys of the  respective fields, as well as security overviews and specific  results. The project members also created evaluation criteria  to compare proposed post quantum cryptosystems with the  end goal of standardization.  CSD staff also engaged the international cryptographic  community with presentations and publications.  Presentations were made at the 2014 Conference on Theory of  Quantum Computation, Communication, and Cryptography,  CRYPTO 2014, and PQCrypto 2014 Conference. CSD staff  were invited to give talks at QCrypt 2014, and at  the  PQCrypto 2014 Conference. A CSD staff member gave a  course on quantum algorithms.  CSD staff helped organize  the joint NIST-University of Maryland Workshop on Quantum  Information and Computer Science. CSD also contributed  to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute  whitepaper on quantum-safe cryptography. The CSD also  hosted two leading experts in the field, Dr. Jintai Ding and  Dr. Vadim Lyubashevsky, for extended visits.  In FY 2015, the CSD will continue to explore the security  capacity of purported quantum-resistant technologies  with the ultimate goal of uncovering the fundamental  mechanisms necessary for efficient, trustworthy, and cost- effective information assurance in the post-quantum market.  Upon the successful completion of this phase of the project,  CSD will be prepared for possible standardization efforts in  this area. The CSD will hold a workshop on cybersecurity in a  post-quantum world in March of 2015.

There are many technical challenges in doing this, as  it is typically hard to separate private data from general data  (e.g. to convert a third-party-signed date-of-birth certificate  into a certificate indicating that a person is of voting age).  Zero-knowledge (ZK) proof techniques and their variants  can be used to accomplish this for a large class of assertions.  These techniques allow one party to prove to another  party that a given statement is true, without conveying  any additional information apart from the fact that the  statement is indeed true. However, even though many such  ZK protocols are practical, adoption by industry is slow. CSD’s  CTG is also following the progress of emerging technologies,  such as fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). FHE could  potentially solve a large class of problems by allowing  computation on encrypted data without decryption. CTG has  also shown that the NIST Randomness Beacon (discussed  below) can be used as a primitive in secure multi-party  computation, such as sealed-bid online auctions, in which  losing bids are never opened.  Team members continue to work in collaboration with  the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace  (NSTIC) program and the Federal Cloud Credential  Exchange (FCCX) project. In this context, CTG has served as  evaluators and in technical support roles. Information about  NSTIC and FCCX is available at http://www.nist.gov/nstic/.  Current communication security standards are primarily  designed for two-party communication. CTG believes that  future protocols, such as those for identification, commercial  transactions, and social media, will necessitate standards  for three-party communications (e.g., two parties involved  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  3 7  in a commercial transaction and a third party that serves  as an enabler of some aspects of the transaction). This is  particularly important if standards are to provide privacy  protection. CTG has developed some basic protocols for this  purpose. One such protocol allows for privacy-preserving  identification with the aid of a mediator. In this protocol, the  issuer of an assertion, such as “John Smith is an employee  of the Department of Commerce,” does not need to know  who the consumer of the assertion is, yet it can encrypt the  assertion with a key only known to that consumer (i.e. the  mediator cannot see the unencrypted assertion).  CONTACT: Dr. René Peralta  (301) 975-8702  rene.peralta@nist.gov  Cryptographic Standards and  Guidel ines Process Review  In September 2013, news reports about leaked classified  documents raised concerns over the trustworthiness of the  Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator  (Dual_EC_DRBG), which is included in SP 800-90A,  Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using  Deterministic Random Bit Generators. In response to these  concerns, NIST initiated an internal review, reopened public  comment on SP 800-90A, and invited an independent  review of its standards development processes.  As a first step, NIST’s CSD solicited public comments  to obtain feedback on the following: the processes used to  develop standards, and the mechanisms used to engage  experts in industry, academia and government to develop  them. As part of this process, the team compiled information  about the principles, processes and procedures that drive  NIST cryptographic standards development efforts. This  supports guidance to help the public understand how such  standards are developed. This information was published  in draft NISTIR 7977,  NIST Cryptographic Standards and  Guidelines Development Process.  NIST’s federal advisory committee, the  Visiting  Committee on Advanced Technology (VCAT), was asked  to review NIST’s cryptographic standards program. The  VCAT formed a Committee of Visitors (COV) with invited  experts from standards organizations, industry, and the  cryptographic research community to assist in this review.  During three meetings in April and May 2014, the COV  reviewed NIST’s cryptographic standards development  process, including the events that led up to the inclusion of  the Dual_EC_DRBG in SP 800-90A; the development of the  SP 800-38 series of block cipher modes; and the selection  and status of the recommended elliptic curves in FIPS 186- 4, the Digital Signature Standard. As part of the review, the  COV provided recommendations for process improvement,  as well as some specific technical considerations and criteria  for NIST’s cryptographic standards and processes.  Based on the COV’s recommendations, the VCAT  produced a report detailing recommendations for  NIST’s cryptographic standards program. The VCAT  recommendations called for NIST to increase its staff  of cryptography experts and implement more explicit  processes for ensuring openness and transparency to  strengthen its cryptography efforts.  NIST has posted the full VCAT report, including  the individual recommendations from the COV, on the  NIST website, as well as the briefing documents provided to  assist in the review.  NIST CSD is working to implement the recommendations  of the VCAT. In response to comments received from the  public, and the recommendations from the VCAT and  COV, NIST CSD is working on a revision to NISTIR 7977  that will provide more detailed processes and procedures.  These additions will ensure that there is a clear record of  the contributions to NIST standards and guidelines, and  will establish a maintenance process that ensures that  publications remain current.  Additionally, NIST will continue  to strengthen capabilities with new hires, guest researchers,  contracts and external collaborations with researchers,  industry and standards organizations. Finally, NIST CSD will  work with the cryptographic community to evaluate other  technical concerns raised by the VCAT’s review and take  appropriate remediating actions.  http://www.nist.gov/director/vcat/index.cfm  http://www.nist.gov/director/vcat/cryptographic-standards- guidelines-process.cfm  CONTACT: Mr. Andrew Regenscheid  (301) 975-5155  andrew.regenscheid@nist.gov  http://www.nist.gov/director/vcat/cryptographic-standards-guidelines-process.cfm http://www.nist.gov/director/vcat/cryptographic-standards-guidelines-process.cfm  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  3 8  N E W  R E S E A R C H  A R E A S  I N  C R Y P T O G R A P H I C  T E C H - N I Q U E S  F O R  E M E R G I N G  A P P L I C AT I O N S  Circuit  Complexity Research  Cryptographic functions, such as encryption, digital  signatures, and hashing, are implemented as electronic  circuits for a wide class of applications. In practice, it  is important to be able to minimize the size of these  circuits. This problem is closely related to designing small  combinational circuits. These circuits use only binary AND,  XOR and NEGATION gates, i.e. multiplication, addition,  and “+1” in arithmetic modulo 2. A combinational circuit  on four variables is depicted below. The project team has  shown that finding optimal combinational circuits is MAX- SNP Complete. In practice, this means that it is necessary to  settle for heuristics that design “good” circuits, as opposed  to provably optimal circuits. The CSD’s CTG has developed  and implemented new heuristics for the circuit minimization  problem. Two patents have been granted related to this  work, the last one in FY 2014. These are held jointly between  NIST and the University of Southern Denmark.  CSD’s CTG is also researching circuit-based security  metrics for cryptographic functions. For a function to be  secure (one-way), it must be the case that any circuit that  implements it is sufficiently complex. In particular, a function  is insecure if it can be implemented by a circuit containing  too few Boolean AND gates. This security metric, namely the  number of AND gates necessary and sufficient to implement  a function, is referred to as its multiplicative complexity.  Unfortunately, determining multiplicative complexity is  extremely hard. Mathematicians attempted this in the 1970s,  but the effort had been largely abandoned by the 1980s. CTG  has been able to compute tight bounds for the multiplicative  complexity of an important class of functions: the symmetric  functions. In the process, the CTG research team developed  tools that have wide applicability for both theoretical and  applied research in security and cryptography.  Multiparty computation is a technique that allows  a group of people to compute a function of their inputs  without revealing the inputs themselves. Examples of this  are: i) holding an election; ii) conducting closed-bid auctions  in which only the winning bid is determined; iii) proving to a  third party that an entity’s encrypted attributes satisfy some  requirement, such as “over 21 and (US citizen or Canadian  citizen)”. The protocols  that  solve  multiparty  computation  problems often encrypt bits using arithmetic modulo 2.  The complexity of such protocols largely depends on the  number of multiplications required − hence, the importance  of expressing functions as circuit computations with few  multiplication (AND) gates. Some of the published circuits  are now the standard reference for benchmarking tools in  multiparty computation.  A partial list of new results consists of:  •  The construction of the smallest known circuits for  multiplication in several small finite fields;  •  The construction of the smallest known circuits for the  multiplication of polynomials of degree n over the Ga- lois Field with two elements (for small values of n); and  •  The construction of optimal circuits - with respect to  the multiplicative complexity - for all predicates on four  bits. There are 65 536 such predicates. Surprisingly, the  multiplicative complexity of all these functions turned  out to be at most three.  Additionally, our circuits use no more than seven non- linear gates (XOR, XNOR). This is quite hard. Consider the  following predicate (arithmetic is modulo 2):  f = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x1x2 + x1x3 + x1x4 + x2x3 +x2x4 + x1x2x3 +  x1x2x4 + x1x2x3x4.  Computing the last term requires three multiplications.  So it is quite surprising that the full expression can be  computed using only three multiplications; however, this  has been shown to be the case for f and all other predicates  on four bits. The circuit depicted below computes f using 3  multiplications and 6 additions.  •  A proof that the maximum multiplicative complexity  of predicates on five bits (there are more than 4 billion  such predicates) is four. The proof is constructive,  meaning the circuits can actually be built. This result  appears in the proceedings of the Third International  Workshop on Lightweight Cryptography for Security &  Privacy (Springer-Verlag).

CONTACT: Dr. René Peralta  (301) 975-8702  rene.peralta@nist.gov  Cryptography for  Constrained  Environments  There are several emerging areas in which highly  constrained devices are interconnected, typically  communicating wirelessly with one another, and working in  concert to accomplish some task. Examples of these areas  include: sensor networks, healthcare, distributed control  systems, the Internet of Things, cyber physical systems, and  the smart grid. Security and privacy can be very important  in all of these areas. Because the majority of current  cryptographic algorithms were designed for desktop/server  environments, many of these algorithms do not fit into the  constrained resources. If current algorithms can be made to  fit into the limited resources of constrained environments,  their performance is typically not acceptable.  CSD’s Cryptographic Technology Group (CTG) is  studying the use of the NIST-approved symmetric- key algorithms in constrained environments. CTG has  developed microcontroller implementations of the  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to provide both  confidentiality and the AES-based message authentication  code, Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC),  for authentication. Additionally, CTG has implemented the  256-bit version of the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-256)  to provide a Hash-based Message Authentication Code  (HMAC) for authentication. SHA-3, as specified in Draft  FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based Hash and  Extendable-Output Functions, and a variant of KeccaK  using an 800-bit permutation has also been implemented.  CTG has demonstrated that SHA-3 allows a more efficient  construction for computing Message authentication codes  (MACs) than the HMAC construction, which is required when  using SHA-256. CTG has also investigated other, non-NIST- approved algorithms for constrained environments.  CTG has also begun to examine applications in  constrained environments to determine whether NIST  should develop a lightweight encryption standard. CTG  has talked with industry experts to understand challenges,  limitations, and work from other standardization bodies in  this area. Also, CTG has had internal discussions on additional  considerations for a lightweight standard, as restrictions on  its use would be necessary in order to prevent the adoption  of a lightweight cipher where the strong protection of AES  is required.  CTG is preparing a report that describes the current  state and challenges in target application areas, and  provides a survey of lightweight primitives, including  block and stream ciphers that have been proposed for  constrained environments. CTG researchers also studied  efficient implementations of the Boolean functions used in  lightweight primitives and published Multiplicative  Complexity of Boolean Functions on Four and Five Variables  at the Third International Workshop on Lightweight  Cryptography for Security & Privacy (LightSec 2014).  In FY 2015, CTG will continue to analyze the resource  requirements and performance characteristics of  lightweight primitives, and study their use as building blocks  to perform various cryptographic objectives. Additionally,  CTG will investigate specific application areas in order to  determine functionality and resource requirements in the  area of cryptography for constrained environments.

The prototype, called the Beacon, uses two independent,  commercially available sources of randomness, each with an  independent hardware entropy source.   The Beacon is designed to provide unpredictability,  autonomy, and consistency. Unpredictability means that  users cannot algorithmically predict bits before they are  made available by the source. Autonomy means that the  source is resistant to attempts by outside parties to alter the  distribution of the random bits. Consistency means that a  set of users can access the source in such a way that they  are confident that they all receive the same random string.  The Beacon posts bit-strings in blocks of 512 bits every  60 seconds. Each such value is time-stamped and signed  by NIST, and includes the hash of the previous value to  chain the sequence of values together. This prevents all,  even the Beacon itself, from retroactively changing an  http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/~peralta/CircuitStuff/CMT.html http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/~peralta/CircuitStuff/CMT.html  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  4 0  output packet without being detected. The Beacon keeps  all output packets and makes them available online at  https://beacon.nist.gov/home.   Tables of random numbers have probably been used for  multiple purposes, at least since the Industrial Revolution.  In the digital age, algorithmic random number generators  have largely replaced these tables. The NIST Randomness  Beacon expands the use of public randomness to multiple  scenarios in which the latter methods cannot be used. The  extra functionalities stem mainly from three features. First,  the Beacon-generated numbers cannot be predicted before  they are published. Second, the public, time-bound, and  authenticated nature of the Beacon allows a user application  to prove to anybody that it used truly random numbers not  known before a certain point in time. Third, this proof can be  presented offline and at any point in the future. For example,  the proof could be mailed to a trusted third party, encrypted  and signed by an application, only to be opened if needed  and authorized.  Although commercially available physical sources of  randomness are adequate as entropy sources for currently  envisioned applications of the Beacon, NIST is working on  developing a source of verifiably random sequences. Given  that it is impossible to construct such sequences in any  classical physical context, CSD is collaborating with the NIST  Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML) to build a quantum  source. The aim is to use quantum effects to generate  sequences that are guaranteed to be unpredictable, even  if an attacker has access to the random source. For more  information on this collaboration, see  http://www.nist.gov/ pml/div684/random_numbers_bell_test.cfm.

NIST encourages  the community-at-large to research and publish novel  ways in which this tool can be used. Some examples of  applications are unpredictable sampling, new authentication  mechanisms, and secure multi-party computation.

In such a heterogeneous network, a mobile  device may switch its connection between different wireless  technologies. The procedure for conducting such a switch is  called a “handover.” Media-independent handover (MIH) is a  set of services specified in IEEE 802.21 to assist the handover.  When the services provided by the pervasive hetero- geneous networks are extended to other applications, such  as Smart Grid applications, the MIH needs to be processed  by a group of wireless nodes, such as smart meters, for  balancing the network load and for reliability. In this case,  the information may need to be delivered to a group of  smart meters using a multicast message, which is used to  deliver the information. That is, the message is sent from one  point-of-service (PoS) to multiple wireless nodes. In some of  the application environments, such as sensor networks, the  groups are formed dynamically. That is, new nodes can be  added to the group, and some nodes in the group may need  to be removed. Such groups are managed through multicast  signals.  Amendment 2 of IEEE 802.21 provides protection  mechanisms for unicast messages, that is, mechanisms  that protect messages between a PoS and a single mobile  node. However, the protection for multicast messages and  group management signals is critical. In FY 2014, CSD has  worked with IEEE 802.21 to develop security solutions for  group management in Task Group D of IEEE 802.21. The  solutions, specified in IEEE 802.21 Amendment 4, include  the mechanisms to distribute group keys and for the  protection of multicast messages. A draft of Amendment 4  has been approved through sponsor ballot. In FY 2015, CSD  will continue to contribute to a broader scope of IEEE 802  wireless standards.  CONTACT: Dr. Lily Chen  (301) 975-6974  lily.chen@nist.gov  VA L I D AT I O N  P R O G R A M S  Federal agencies, industry, and the public rely on many  of the standards and specifications supported by NIST’s CSD.  Poor implementations of these standards or specifications  may render a particular product insecure, potentially placing  sensitive information at risk. CSD operates several validation  programs that help provide a level of assurance that products  meet established security requirements and conform to  published specifications. To that end, the Security Testing,  Validation, and Measurement Group (STVMG) develops test  suites and test methods; provides implementation guidance  and technical support to industry forums; and conducts  education, training, and outreach programs.  STVMG’s validation programs work together with  independent laboratories that are accredited by the NIST  National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program  (NVLAP). Based on the independent laboratory test report  and test evidence, the validation programs described  below validate the implementation under test. The CSD  subsequently publishes lists of the validations awarded on  public websites.  Cryptographic System Val idation Current validation programs focus on providing a known  level of assurance for cryptographic algorithms and modules.  These modules are used within the context of a larger system  to provide cryptographic services as a method of protecting  the data within the system. As information systems continue  to become more complex, the methods used to implement  cryptographic services have also increased in complexity.  Problems with the use of cryptography are often introduced  through the interaction of cryptographic components with  the operating environment. This program seeks to specify  how cryptographic components are used as part of a defined  cryptographic system to solve problems with a measureable  level of assurance, and to introduce automated methods of  quantifying the level of assurance that has been provided.  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  4 2  This program will begin the research required to  define a reference cryptographic systems architecture and  example use cases where cryptographic systems are built  from known cryptographic components that cooperate  through trust relationships to provide a measureable level of  assurance. The architecture should begin at the lowest level  with a hardware-based root of trust, and each cryptographic  component should be added in successive layers to  provide assurance in a systematic way. This should allow  the development of tests that would measure the correct  implementation of cryptographic components as part of a  larger system.  This program will perform research and experimentation  in applicable technologies and techniques that will enable  the efficient testing of the cryptographic capabilities of  each layer, and continuous monitoring capabilities of  each cryptographic component, providing the necessary  interfaces to establish trust relationships with other  cryptographic components. Techniques could include such  items as:  •  Embedding SCAP-like data elements and standard  interfaces to query those data elements during the de- sign and implementation of cryptographic components  that would enable automated testing capabilities;  •  Using cryptographic techniques to embed values into  the module that would increase the verifiability and  assurance that the module provides; and  •  Using industry-based secure development techniques  to increase the level of trust inherent in software mod- ules starting with design and implementation.  Research into this area of cryptographic system  validation holds the promise of automating the validation of  all cryptographic components, providing a higher assurance  with less manual effort by using SCAP-based ideas to embed  data elements that instrument the test harnesses used to  validate cryptographic systems. This would also provide the  instrumentation that could be leveraged to enable a greater  level of situational awareness and security measurement,  and potentially, to enable continuous monitoring of  cryptographic systems.

Through these  programs, NIST and CSE work with international government,  public and private sectors as a part of the cryptographic  community to achieve standards-based security and  assurance of correct implementation. The goal of these  programs is to provide federal agencies with a security  metric to use in procuring and deploying cryptographic  modules and promote the use of validated algorithms and  modules by industry and the public. The testing carried out  by independent third-party laboratories accredited by the  NIST National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program  (NVLAP), and the validations performed by the CAVP and  CMVP programs provide this metric. Federal agencies,  industry, and the public can choose cryptographic modules  and/or products containing cryptographic modules from  the CMVP Validated Modules List and have confidence  in the claimed level of security and assurance of correct  implementation.  Cryptographic algorithm and cryptographic module  testing and validation are based on published NIST  standards. As federal agencies are required to use validated  cryptographic modules for the protection of sensitive  non-classified information, the validated modules and the  validated algorithms that the modules contain represent the  culmination and delivery of the CSD’s cryptography-based  work to the end user.  The CAVP and the CMVP are separate collaborative  programs. The CAVP and the CMVP validate algorithms  and modules, respectively, that are used in a wide variety of  products, including Internet browsers, radios, smart cards,  space-based communications, munitions, security tokens,  mobile phones, network and storage devices, and products  supporting the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and electronic  commerce. A module may be a standalone product, such  as a virtual private network (VPN) or smart card, or it  could be a module embedded in many products, such as a  cryptographic-based toolkit. As a result, a small number of  modules may be incorporated within hundreds of products.  The CAVP validates cryptographic algorithms that may be  integrated in one or more cryptographic modules.  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  4 3  The CAVP and CMVP validation programs provide  documented methodologies for conformance testing  through defined sets of security requirements. For the  CAVP, the validation system documents are designed for  each FIPS-approved and NIST-recommended cryptographic  algorithm. See the website for a listing (see http://csrc.nist. gov/groups/STM/cavp/). Security requirements for the  CMVP are found in FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements for  Cryptographic Modules, and the associated test metrics  and methods in Derived Test Requirements for FIPS 140-2,  Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules (DTR).  The four Annexes to FIPS 140-2 reference the underlying  cryptographic algorithm standards or methods. The CMVP- developed Implementation Guidance for FIPS PUB 140-2  and the Cryptographic Validation Program (IG) provides  programmatic and implementation guidance across all of  the referenced documents. The information provided in the  DTR and IG documents ensures the repeatability of tests and  the equivalency in results across the testing laboratories.  The Implementation Guidance provides clarity, consistency  of interpretation, and insight for successful conformance  testing, validation, and revalidation.  The unique position of the validation programs gives the  CAVP and CMVP the opportunity to acquire insight during  the validation review activities and results in practical, timely,  and up-to-date guidance that is needed by the testing  laboratories and vendors to move their modules out to the  user community in a timely and cost-effective manner and  with the assurance of third-party conformance testing. This  knowledge and insight provide a foundation for current and  future standards and tools development.  The CMVP reviews the cryptographic module validation  requests from the testing laboratories and, as a byproduct  of the review, is attentive to emerging and/or changing  technologies. These insights into the evolution of operating  environments and complex systems allow, the CMVP to  perform research and development on evolving test metrics  and methods and future requirements for cryptographic  modules. This research is used to assist developers of  cryptographic modules, testing laboratories, and the user  community when developing new standards.

The latest set of statistics,  which are collected quarterly from each of the testing  laboratories, shows that 5 % (dropped from 7 % in FY 2013)  of the cryptographic algorithms and 54 % (increased from  35 % in FY 2013) of the cryptographic modules brought in  for voluntary testing had security flaws that were corrected  during testing. By the end of FY 2014, the CMVP had  validated and issued a total of 2258 cryptographic module  validation certificates that represent 5785 modules. These  modules have been developed by more than 475 domestic  and international vendors. Likewise, to date, the CAVP  has issued approximately 15 963 validations, representing  the algorithm validations of approximately 17 approved  algorithms. The CAVP issued approximately 2200 algorithm  validations in FY 2014. Included in this total, is the 3000th  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) validation, a  significant milestone for the CAVP. The CMVP issued 191  module validation certificates in FY 2014. The number of  algorithms and modules submitted for validation continues  to grow, representing significant growth in the number of  validations expected to be available in the future.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM  CONTACTS: CMVP Contact:  CAVP Contact:  Dr. Apostol Vassilev  Ms. Sharon Keller  (301) 975-3221  (301) 975-2910  apostol.vassilev@nist.gov  sharon.keller@nist.gov  Figure 10: FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 140-2  Validated Modules by Calendar Year and Level  Figure 11: FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 140-2  Validation Certificates by Fiscal Year and Level  Figure 12: CAVP Validation Status by FYs  Figure 13: CAVP Validation Status for FY 2014  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  4 5  Automated Security Testing and Test  Suite Development  The Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program  (CAVP), a collaborative program between NIST and the  Communications Security Establishment (CSE) of Canada,  utilizes the requirements and specifications of NIST  standards (i.e., FIPS and Special Publications), to develop  algorithm validation test suites and automated security  testing. The CAVP is responsible for providing assurance that  the cryptographic algorithm implementations contained in  cryptographic modules are implemented according to the  specifications in the standards. The CAVP accomplishes this  by designing and developing conformance testing specific  to each cryptographic algorithm.  The conformance testing consists of a suite of validation  tests for each approved cryptographic algorithm. These  validation tests exercise the algorithmic requirements and  mathematical formulas detailed in the algorithm to assure  that the detailed specifications are implemented correctly  and completely. If the implementer deviates from the  specifications in the standard or excludes any part of these  specifications or requirements, the validation test will detect  the deviations and fail. The validation testing will indicate that  the algorithm implementation does not function properly or  is incomplete.  The cryptographic algorithm validation tests designed  and developed by the CAVP are performed by independent  third-party laboratories accredited by the NIST National  Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP). The  laboratory works with vendors to validate their cryptographic  algorithm implementations. The suite of validation tests for  each algorithm ensures the repeatability of tests and the  equivalency in results across the testing laboratories.  There are several types of validation tests, all designed  to satisfy the testing requirements of the cryptographic  algorithms and their specifications. These include, but are  not limited to, Known-Answer Tests, Monte Carlo Tests,  and Multi-Block Message Tests. The Known-Answer Tests  are designed to examine the individual components of  the algorithm by supplying known values to the variables  and verifying the expected result. Negative testing is also  performed by supplying known incorrect values to assure  that the implementation recognizes values that are not  allowed. The Monte Carlo Test is designed to exercise the  entire implementation under test (IUT). This test is designed  to detect the presence of implementation flaws that are not  Figure 14: CAVP Validated Implementation Actual Numbers  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  4 6  detected with the controlled input of the Known-Answer  Tests. The types of implementation flaws detected by  this validation test include pointer problems, insufficient  allocation of space, improper error handling, and incorrect  behavior of the IUT. The Multi-Block Message Test (MMT)  is designed to test the ability of the implementation to  process multi-block messages, which require the chaining of  information from one block to the next.  During the last few years, the CTG has expanded  its publications to not only contain the algorithm’s  specifications, but also to include requirements on an  algorithm’s use. Many of these usage requirements do not  fall within the scope of the CAVP because the CAVP focuses  on the correctness of the instructions within the algorithm’s  boundary. If these additional algorithm usage requirements  are not considered applicable to the algorithm’s  implementation, they cannot be tested at the algorithm  level by the CAVP, but may be tested by the Cryptographic  Module Validation Program (CMVP) if the requirements are  considered applicable to the cryptographic module. However,  some of these usage requirements may be considered to be  outside the scope of both the algorithm implementation  and cryptographic module. In this latter case, the fulfillment  of the requirements is the responsibility of entities using,  installing, or configuring applications or protocols that use  the cryptographic algorithms. For example, depending on  the design of a cryptographic module, it may not be possible  for the module to determine whether a specific key is used for  multiple purposes, a situation that is strongly discouraged.  The CAVP currently has algorithm validation testing for  the following cryptographic algorithms:  CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHM/COMPONENT SPECIAL PUBLICATION OR FIPS  Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES)  SP 800-67, Recommendation for the Triple Data  Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) Block Cipher, and  SP 800-38A, Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of  Operation–Methods and Techniques  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) FIPS 197, Advanced Encryption Standard, and  SP 800-38A, Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of  Operation–Methods and Techniques  Digital Signature Standard (DSS)  FIPS 186-2, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), with change  notice 1  FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature Standard (DSS)  Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)  FIPS 186-2, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), with change  notice 1 and ANS X9.62  FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), and ANS  X9.62  RSA algorithm  ANSI X9.31 and Public Key Cryptography Standards  (PKCS) #1 v2.1: RSA Cryptography Standard-2002  FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), and ANSI  X9.31 and Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #1  v2.1: RSA Cryptography Standard-2002  Hashing algorithms SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384,  SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256  FIPS 180-4, Secure Hash Standard (SHS)  Random number generator (RNG) algorithms FIPS 186-2 Appendix 3.1 and 3.2; ANS X9.62 Appendix A.4  Deterministic Random Bit Generators (DRBG) SP 800-90A, Recommendation for Random Number  Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  4 7  Key Agreement Schemes and Key Confirmation SP 800-56A, Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key  Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm  Cryptography, dated March 2007  All of SP 800-56A except KDF SP 800-56A, Key Derivation Functions for Key Agreement  Schemes: All sections except Section 5.8  SP 800-56A Section 5.7.1.2 ECC CDH function SP 800-56A, Section 5.7.1.2 Elliptic Curve Cryptography  Cofactor Diffie-Hellman (ECC CDH) Primitive Testing  Key-Based Key Derivation functions (KBKDF) SP 800-108, Recommendation for Key Derivation using  Pseudorandom Functions  Application-Specific Key Derivation functions (ASKDF)  (includes KDFs used by IKEv1, IKEv2, TLS, ANS X9.63- 2001, SSH, SRTP, SNMP, and TPM)  SP 800-135 (Revision 1) Recommendation for Existing  Application Specific key Derivation Functions  Component test – ECDSA Signature Generation of hash  value (This component test verifies the signing of a hash- sized input.

These efforts bring consistent testing of cryptographic  modules to the global community by providing ISO- equivalent standards representing NIST FIPS 140-2, Security  Requirements for Cryptographic Modules and Derived  Test Requirements [DTR] for FIPS PUB 140-2, Security  Requirements for Cryptographic Modules.  ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 WG 3 completed and published  revisions of ISO/IEC 19790:2006 and ISO/IEC 24759:2008,  for which Randall J. Easter of NIST’s CSD was the principal  editor. The revision of ISO/IEC 19790 was published  on August 15, 2012. The revision of ISO/IEC 24759 was  published on January 31, 2014. Both ISO/IEC standards were  also adopted by the American National Standards Institute  (ANSI). The two ISO/IEC revisions were developed with  international support and the collaboration of governments,  industry and academia. The NIST CMVP and the NVLAP- accredited testing laboratories worked closely with ISO in  the standards revision.  ISO/IEC 19790:2012 specifies the security requirements  for a cryptographic module utilized within a security  system protecting sensitive information in computer and  telecommunication systems. This international standard  defines four security levels for cryptographic modules to  provide for a wide spectrum of data sensitivity (e.g. low  value administrative data, million dollar funds transfers, life- protecting data, personal identity information, and sensitive  information used by a government) and a diversity of  application environments (e.g. a guarded facility, an office,  Figure 15: Cryptographic Module Testing – ISO Standards  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  4 9  removable media, and a completely unprotected location).  The overall security rating of a cryptographic module must  be chosen to provide a level of security appropriate for the  security requirements of the application and environment  in which the module is to be utilized and for the security  services that the module is to provide.  The security requirements cover areas relative to the  design and implementation of a cryptographic module.  These areas include cryptographic module specification;  cryptographic module interfaces; roles, services, and  authentication; software/firmware security; the operational  environment; physical security; non-invasive security;  sensitive security parameter management; self-tests; life- cycle assurance; and mitigation of other attacks.  CSD’s Randall J. Easter is the principal editor of the  following draft ISO/IEC documents:  •  ISO/IEC 17825, Testing methods for the mitigation  of non-invasive attack classes against cryptographic  modules;  •  ISO/IEC 18367, Cryptographic algorithms and security  mechanisms conformance testing; and  •  ISO/IEC TS 30104, Physical Security Attacks, Mitigation  Techniques and Security Requirements.  CSD’s contributions to the development of these  international standards create a strong foundation for the  adoption of and migration from currently used national  standards. In particular, this adoption will promote the  international harmonization for the implementation and  testing of cryptographic algorithms and modules, while  accommodating individual country preferences in the choice  of approved security functions.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/  CONTACT: Mr. Randy Easter  (301) 975-4641  randall.easter@nist.gov  Security Content  Automation Protocol  (SCAP) Val idation Program  The SCAP Validation Program performs conformance  testing to ensure that products correctly implement  SCAP, as defined in SP 800-126 Revision 2, The Technical  Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol  (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2. Conformance testing is necessary  because SCAP is a complex collection of eleven individual  specifications that work together to support various use  Figure 16: SCAP 1.2 Validation Process  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  5 0  cases. A single error in product implementation could result  in undetected vulnerabilities or policy noncompliance within  an organization’s networks.  The test requirements for SCAP 1.2 are defined in NISTIR  7511 Revision 3, Security Content Automation Protocol  (SCAP) Version 1.2 Validation Program Test Requirements.  In general, vendors may opt for product validation for one  or more SCAP capabilities or operating systems. Currently,  the program offers testing on Microsoft Windows and Red  Hat Enterprise Linux platforms. The validation process  starts when a vendor voluntarily submits an SCAP-enabled  product to a NVLAP-accredited laboratory. Once the lab  completes product testing, and all validation requirements  are met, the lab submits a test report to the SCAP Validation  Program for review. NIST reviews the test report and will  award a validation if all requirements have been met. Once  a validation is awarded, the SCAP Validation Record is sent  to the lab, and the newly validated product is posted on the  SCAP Validated Products web page.  The SCAP Validation Program resources web page  (http://scap.nist.gov/validation) was introduced in FY 2013,  and was updated in FY 2014 to provide the public with a  centralized location for all resources and information  necessary for preparing products for SCAP 1.2 validation.  Resources include documentation, a list of Frequently  Asked Questions (FAQ), the SCAP validation-test content,  and tools for validating and processing SCAP data streams.  The SCAP validation-test content should be used by vendors  for quality assurance testing prior to entering formal SCAP  testing with an NVLAP accredited laboratory. The open- source tools that are available for download may be used by  SCAP content authors for testing SCAP source content. The  SCAP Content Validation Tool (SCAPVal) may be used to  determine if the content conforms to the SCAP specification.  Open-source SCAP reference implementation tools, such as  the SCAP Reference Implementation Tool, may be used to  process SCAP data streams.  End users may use information on the SCAP Validation  web page to learn about SCAP validation and find products  that have been awarded validations. The validation records  that are posted on the SCAP Validated Products page  state the product version that was tested in the laboratory,  along with details about the validation, such as the tested  platforms, SCAP capabilities, the validation test suite version,  and the lab that performed the product test.  In FY 2014, five products successfully completed testing  and were awarded validations. Several products are in  various stages of validation testing and are expected to be  awarded validations in FY 2015. The current list of SCAP 1.2  validated products may be found on the SCAP Validated  Products list at https://nvd.nist.gov/SCAP-Validated-Tools/.  In FY 2015, the SCAP Validation Program plans to provide  enhanced testing support and will focus on validation test  content for new operating systems. Expansion plans also  include improvements in automated testing capabilities.  http://scap.nist.gov/validation  CONTACT: Ms. Melanie Cook  (301) 975-5259  melanie.cook@nist.gov  I D E N T I T Y  M A N A G E M E N T  Personal  Identity Verif ication (PIV)  and FIPS 201 Revision Efforts  Figure 17: Government Employees  Use PIV Cards for Facility Access  In response to Homeland Security Presidential  Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Policy for a Common Identification  Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, FIPS 201,  Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees  and Contractors, was developed and was approved by the  Secretary of Commerce in February 2005.

CSD activities in FY 2014 directly  supported the recently revised FIPS 201-2 by updating  the relevant publications associated with FIPS 201-2 and  by developing two new publications. CSD performed the  following activities during FY 2014 in support of HSPD-12:  •  Published Draft NISTIR 7863, Cardholder Authentica- tion for the PIV Digital Signature Key. The document  provides clarification for the requirement in FIPS 201-2  that a PIV cardholder perform an explicit user action  prior to each use of the digital signature key stored on  the card.  •  Published two new draft documents to accommodate  e-authentication with mobile devices:  −  Draft SP 800-157, Guidelines for Derived Personal  Identity Verification (PIV) Credentials, defines the  technical details for implementing and deploying  derived PIV credentials on mobile devices, such  as smart phones and tablets. As intended by FIPS  201-2, a derived PIV credential is a PIV credential  that can be provisioned directly to a mobile device  to enable remote enterprise access from the  device.  −  Draft NISTIR 7981, Mobile, PIV, and Authentication,  analyzes and summarizes various current and  near-term options for remote authentication with  mobile devices that leverage both the investment  in the PIV infrastructure and the unique security  capabilities of mobile devices.  •  Completed the comment resolution of Draft SP 800- 73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification, and  published a revised draft. The three-part SP details the  new PIV Card capabilities introduced in FIPS 201-2,  including  a Virtual Contact Interface (VCI), a secure  channel protocol, an on-card biometric comparison  mechanism and an enforcement of a minimum PIN  length of six digits.  •  Completed the comment resolution of Draft SP 800- 78-4, Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for  Personal Identity Verification, and published a revised  draft. The document has been modified to align with  Draft SP 800-73-4, and includes the addition of new  algorithms and key sizes for the secure messaging  protocol and the addition of test requirements with the  Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP)  validation.  •  Published Draft SP 800-79, Guidelines for the Accredi- tation of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card Issu- ers (PCIs). The draft document incorporates changes  required by FIPS 201-2, including a new set of issuer  controls for Derived PIV Credentials Issuers.  •  Prepared Draft SP 800-85A-4, PIV Card Applica- tion and Middleware Interface Test Guidelines, and  published Draft SP 800-85B-4, PIV Data Model Test  Guidelines, in order to align these documents with FIPS  201-2, SP 800-73-4, and SP 800-78-4.  •  As the NIST PIV Validation Authority, completed the  transition phase from FIPS 201-1 to FIPS 201-2 for vali- dated PIV Card Applications and PIV Middleware.  •  Created additional sets of test cards for the inventory  of PIV test cards. These test cards are available for  purchase and facilitate the development of applications  and middleware that support the PIV card (see  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/testcards.html).  In FY 2015, CSD will continue to focus on updating  the relevant publications associated with FIPS 201-2,  including developing two new publications: SP 800-156,  Representation of PIV Chain-of-Trust for Import and Export,  and SP 800-166,  Guidelines for Testing Derived Personal  Identity Verification (PIV) Credentials. CSD will also continue  to provide technical and strategic inputs to the PIV-related  initiatives.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/  CONTACTS: Ms. Hildegard Ferraiolo  Dr. David Cooper  (301) 975-6972  (301) 975-3194  hildegard.ferraiolo@nist.gov david.cooper@nist.gov  Mr. Salvatore Francomacaro Mr. Ketan Mehta  (301) 975-6414  (301) 975-8405  salvatore.francomacaro@nist.gov ketan.mehta@nist.gov  NIST Personal  Identity Verif ication  Program (NPIVP) & Revisions to FIPS  201-2 Companion Documents  The objective of the NIST Personal Identity Verification  Program (NPIVP) is to validate PIV components for  conformance to the specifications in FIPS 201, Personal  Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and  Contractors, and its companion documents. The two PIV  components that come under the scope of NPIVP are the  PIV Smart Card Application and the PIV Middleware. NPIVP  test facilities that perform the two types of tests are the  Cryptographic and Security Testing (CST) Laboratories  that have been accredited by the NIST National Voluntary  Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP). As of  September 2014, there were nine such facilities.  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/nistir-7981/nistir7981_draft.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/testcards.html  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  5 2  The interface specifications for the PIV Smart Card  Application and PIV Middleware are found in a FIPS  201-associated document, namely, SP 800-73 (the latest  published version SP 800-73-3) - Interfaces for Personal  Identity Verification. The conformance tests for these  specifications are detailed in SP 800-85A (the latest  published version is SP 800-85A-2) - PIV Card Application  and Middleware Interface Test Guidelines. To implement  these tests and to generate conformance test reports, CSD  also developed an integrated toolkit called “PIV Interface Test  Runner,” which conducts tests on both PIV Card Application  and PIV Middleware products, and provides the toolkit to  accredited NPIVP test facilities.  In 2014, CSD’s activity focused on the transitioning of PIV  Card Application and PIV Middleware products from FIPS  201-1 to FIPS 201-2 compliance. Coordinating with the test  facilities, FIPS 201-1 products were identified and placed on  the Removed Products List (RPL). Nine PIV card application  products and fifteen PIV middleware products were  affected. With this change, there are 27 NPIVP validated PIV  card application products, and five PIV Middleware products  listed.  In addition, NPIVP is closely involved in ensuring that all  changes in PIV companion documents, such as SP 800-73-4,  SP 800-76-2, Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity  Verification, and SP 800-78-4, Cryptographic Algorithms  and Key Sizes for Personal Identity Verification, are fully  reflected in the updated versions of the conformance test  documents, SP 800-85A and SP 800-85B, as well as in the  “PIV Interface Test Runner” toolkit. Currently, the NPIVP  team is guiding the development of the “PIV Interface Test  Runner” toolkit for validating PIV Card application and PIV  Middleware products for conformance to the specifications  in SP 800-73-4, SP 800-76-2 and SP 800-78-4.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/npivp  CONTACTS: Dr. Ramaswamy Chandramouli Ms. Hildegard Ferraiolo  (301) 975-5013  (301) 975-6972  mouli@nist.gov  hildegard.ferraiolo@nist.gov  R E S E A R C H  I N  E M E R G I N G  T E C H N O L O G I E S  Cloud Computing and Virtual ization The model for Cloud Computing is defined in SP 800-145,  The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing. The foundational  technology that facilitates the use of a computing  infrastructure for cloud-computing services is virtualization.  At the core of a virtualized infrastructure is the virtualized  host that provides an abstraction of the hardware (e.g., CPU,  memory) that enables multiple computing stacks (comprised  of the operating system, middleware, and applications) to be  run on a single physical machine. The efficiency of such a  dynamic and distributed processing environment is counter- balanced by the interoperability, portability, and security  challenges inherent to this computing environment. NIST’s  CSD is working in parallel on several projects (introduced  below) that aim to accelerate the Federal Government’s  adoption of secure cloud computing by collaborating  with standards bodies, and public and private sectors  in developing security, interoperability and portability  standards and guidance.  CSD Role in  the NIST Cloud Computing  Program  During FY 2013, the NIST Cloud Computing Team  continued to promote the development of publications,  national and international standards, and specifications in  support of the United States Government’s (USG) effective  and secure use of cloud computing, as well as providing  technical guidance to USG agencies for secure and effective  cloud-computing adoption. CSD supports many of the  technical standards activities supported by the NIST Cloud  Computing Program, with a particular focus on cloud- computing security. Activities included the following:  •  Led the development of the draft SP 500-299, NIST  Cloud Computing Security Reference Architecture  (SRA). SP 500-299 defines a modular framework that  provides a formal model and a methodology for the  secure adoption of cloud computing by applying a  Cloud-adapted Risk Management Framework (CRMF).  The SRA is a security overlay to SP 500-292, NIST  Cloud Computing Reference Architecture. During FY  2014, the draft document was completed, posted for  public comments, and the received comments were  addressed.  •  Co-led the development of the NISTIR 8006, Cloud  Forensics Challenges.  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  5 3  •  Led the development of an internal draft document,  Cloud-adapted Risk Management Framework: Guide  for Applying the Risk Management Framework to  Cloud-based Federal Information Systems. The docu- ment introduces a cloud customer-centric approach to  applying the risk management framework to cloud- based information systems. This internal draft has not  yet been released for public comment; it is currently  planned for future publication in the NIST SP 800  series.  •  Led the research and development of the data that  constitutes the foundation of an internal draft docu- ment, Security and Privacy Controls for Cloud-based  Federal Information Systems. The document will  provide a cloud overlay of NIST SP 800-53 Revision  4 security controls for cloud-based ecosystems. This  internal draft has not yet been released for public  comment; it is currently planned for future publication  in the NIST SP 800 series.  CSD staff members:  •  Organized and contributed to the seventh NIST Cloud  Computing Forum and Workshop: The Intersection of  Cloud and Mobility Forum, March 25-27, 2014; and,  •  Organized and contributed to the first NIST Cloud  Computing Forensic Science Workshop, March 24,  2014.  In support of USG cloud-computing mandates, CSD  staff members provided leadership for several public cloud  working groups operating under the NIST Cloud Computing  Program. These working groups focus on meeting the  high priority requirements contained in SP 500-293, U.S.  Government Cloud Computing Technology Roadmap.  CSD staff chaired or co-chaired several significant cloud  computing efforts in 2014:  •  Co-Chaired the NIST Cloud Computing Security Work- ing Group. Led the group on the development of the  SP 500-299, NIST Cloud Computing Security Reference  Architecture; SP 800-163, Cloud-adapted Risk Manage- ment Framework: Guide for Applying the Risk Manage- ment Framework to Cloud-based Federal Information  Systems; SP 800-174, Security and Privacy Controls for  Cloud-based Federal Information Systems  (all three  described above); and on researching cryptographic  key-management challenges in cloud ecosystems.  •  Co-Chaired the NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Sci- ence Working Group. Led the development of NISTIR  8006, NIST Cloud Computing Forensics Challenges.  •  Co-Chaired the NIST Cloud Computing Interoperabil- ity and Portability Working Group.  Addressed issues  facing cloud computing with respect to interoperability  and portability, standards, and common and functional  terminologies. The goal is to develop guidance and  best practices for cloud-computing interoperability and  portability that best enable business necessities, such  as the ability to exchange, use and reuse information/ data in a cloud environment.  •  Co-editor for ISO/IEC AWI 19941 Information technolo- gy – Cloud computing – Interoperability and Portability.  This is an effort to develop a standard that focuses on  defining the types of cloud-computing interoperabil- ity and portability; the relationship and interactions  between interoperability and portability; the contexts  where interoperability and portability are relevant in  cloud computing, with respect to the cloud-computing  reference architecture; and the common terminology  and concepts used to describe interoperability and  portability, particularly as they relate to cloud services.  •  Chair and Vice-Chair of INCITS CS1 (Cybersecurity) −  U.S. Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to the ISO/IEC  international committee JTC1/SC27 (IT Security Tech- niques). This group is concerned with the development  of cloud-computing taxonomy-related standards and  cloud computing security standards.  CSD staff members participated in various standards  development organizations, two of which are ISO/IEC JTC  1 Sub Committee 38 – Distributed Application Platforms  and Services (SC 38) and ISO/IEC JTC 1 Sub Committee  27 – IT Security Techniques (SC 27). In SC 38, CSD acts as  the co-convener for a collaborative ISO/ITU-T initiative on  cloud computing taxonomy that includes publication of  ISO/IEC 17788 – Information Technology – Cloud computing  – Overview and Vocabulary, and ISO/IEC 17789 Information  technology – Cloud computing – Reference Architecture.  These standards are a joint collaborative work between ITU-T  and ISO, and they are approved to be available at no charge.  Notably, the genesis for this international body of work is the  widely accepted and used cloud-computing definition found  in SP 800-145, NIST Definition of Cloud Computing.  There are three new standards under development:  •  ISO/IEC 19086 Information Technology - Cloud Com- puting - Service Level Agreement (SLA) Framework.  This international standard has three parts, where Part 1  specifies an overview of SLAs for cloud services, identi- fication of the relationship between the master service  agreement and the SLA, SLA concepts and require- ments that can be used to build SLAs, and terms  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  5 4  and metrics commonly used in SLAs for cloud services.  This standard is for the benefit and use of both the  provider and customer. Part 2 specifies a model and  metrics for describing and measuring properties of the  concepts and components in 19086. This standard is for  the benefit and use of both the provider and customer,  and Part 3 specifies core conformance requirements for  SLAs for cloud services for ISO/IEC 19086.  •  ISO/IEC 19941 Information Technology - Cloud Comput- ing – Interoperability and Portability. This international  standard specifies cloud-computing interoperability  and portability types; the relationship and interactions  between these two aspects; and common terminology  and concepts used to discuss interoperability and por- tability, particularly relating to cloud services.  •  ISO/IEC 19944 Information Technology - Cloud Com- puting - Data and their Flow across Devices and Cloud  Services. This International Standard defines the  reference architecture for mobile-to-cloud ecosystems,  while providing the necessary structure that allows for  data-flow transparency between portable devices and  the cloud services ecosystem.  CSD staff members are also actively participating in  the development of cloud-computing security standards,  primarily through INCITS CS1, SC 27, which is responsible  for cloud-computing security standards for ISO. CSD has  provided technical contributions based on SP 500-299  and continues to advocate for secure, non-proprietary  solutions. There is a continued contribution to a number of  cloud-related standards, including the recently approved  international standard, ISO/IEC 27018, Information  technology – Security techniques – Code of practice for  protection of personal identifiable information (PII) in public  clouds acting as PII processors, ISO/IEC WD 27036-4,  Information technology – Information security for supplier  relationships – Part 4: Guidelines for security of Cloud  services, and the commencement of a study period on cloud  components, controls and capabilities.  In FY 2014, the CSD members of the NIST cloud- computing team continued research in key areas of cloud  security, cloud interoperability and portability, cloud metrics,  cloud services, and cloud SLAs. They also presented the  results of cloud-computing research and development,  introduced the standards and specifications under  development, and provided the status of the NIST Cloud- Computing Program in a variety of domestic and international  conferences and workshops. CSD staff continues to engage  industry and federal agencies for inputs and collaborative  work through working groups, publications, and networking.

This included the publication of a detailed  Policy Machine specification as NISTIR 7987, Policy Machine:  Features, Architecture, and Specification, in May 2014.  The team also published a description of the benefits and  an approach of the Policy Machine’s integration of Access  Control and Data Services as a conference paper, On the  Unification of Access Control and Data Service, in the  proceedings of the IEEE 15th International Conference of  Information Reuse and Integration, August 2014. In addition,  CSD released its reference implementation of the Policy  Machine as open source (available at GitHub).  NIST and other members of an Ad Hoc INCITS working  group are developing a three-part Policy Machine standard,  under the title of Next Generation Access Control (NGAC),  under three sub-projects:  •  Project 2193–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Implementation Requirements, Protocols and API  Definitions;  •  Project 2194–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Functional Architecture; and  •  Project 2195–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Generic Operations & Abstract Data Structures.  The Policy Machine’s architecture was the basis for  the NGAC work within INCITS. An initial standard from this  work was published in 2013 and is now available from the  ANSI e-standards store as INCITS 499 – NGAC Functional  Architecture (NGAC–FA). The standard resulting from  Project 2195–D: NGAC Generic Operations & Abstract Data  Structures (NGAC-GOADS), has begun the approval process,  and is expected to reach the second Public Review stage in  the summer of 2015.  In FY 2015, CSD plans to issue a new version of its open- source distribution to reflect new features and enhanced  performance, and publish a NISTIR 7987 revision to reflect  greater consistence with NGAC’s suite of standards.  http://csrc.nist.gov/pm/  CONTACTS: Mr. David Ferraiolo  Mr. Serban Gavrila  (301) 975-3046  (301) 975-4242  david.ferraiolo@nist.gov  serban.gavrila@nist.gov  Virtual ization Security & Leveraging  Virtual ization for  Security  In FY 2014, CSD continued its research in key areas  of cloud and virtualization security by producing two  conference papers and one SP:  •  Conference Papers: “Analysis of Protection Options for  Virtualized Infrastructures in Infrastructure as a Service  Cloud ” and “Deployment-driven Security Configura- tion for Virtual Networks;” and  •  Special Publication: SP 800-125A, Security Recom- mendations for Hypervisor Deployment (submitted for  public comment).  The focus of research for FY 2015 in the area of Virtualized  Infrastructures is two-pronged. The first approach will focus  on identifying the security requirements for various use  cases involved in offering cloud services using virtualized  infrastructures and analyzing the protection options to  meet those security requirements in terms of their features,  security strengths and architectural foundation. The second  approach will focus on deriving secure configuration  operations in a specific area of virtualized infrastructure – the  Virtual Network – leveraging state-of-the-art architectural  paradigms, such as the Software-defined network (SDN).  The security recommendations for Hypervisor deployment  will cover two areas: one based on architectural choices, and  the other based on configuration parameters. For developing  the configuration parameters that form the basis of security  recommendations, the following approach will be adopted:  •  The baseline functions of the hypervisor will be iden- tified along with their associated interfaces and threat  sources; and  http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2014/NIST.IR.7987.pdf http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2014/NIST.IR.7987.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/pm/documents/ir2014_ferraiolo_final.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/pm/documents/ir2014_ferraiolo_final.pdf  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  5 6  •  The protection measures against those threats will then  form the security recommendations for hypervisor de- ployment. The security recommendations will cover all  known implementations of baseline functions, making  them applicable across multiple hypervisor designs.

Although these devices are relatively small and inexpensive,  they can be used for voice calls, simple text messages,  sending and receiving emails, browsing the web, online  banking and e-commerce, social networking, and many  functions once limited to laptop and desktop computers.  Smart phones and tablet devices have specialized built-in  hardware, such as photographic cameras, video cameras,  accelerometers, Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers,  and removable media readers. They also employ a wide range  of wireless interfaces, including infrared, Wireless Fidelity  (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, Near Field Communications (NFC), and  one or more types of cellular interfaces that provide network  connectivity across the globe. Naturally, just as consumers  and businesses can realize productivity gains from these  technologies, so can government agencies.  Like any new technology, smart phones present new  capabilities, but also a number of new security and privacy  challenges. As the pace of the technology life cycles  continues to increase, current Information Assurance  (IA) standards and processes must be updated and new  technologies adopted to allow government users to employ  the latest technologies that consumers can use without  sacrificing privacy and security.  NIST is conducting research in software-assurance  methodologies for smart phone software (i.e., applications,  commonly referred to as “apps”) and is working with other  government agencies and industry to bridge the security  gaps present with today’s smart phones. For example,  NIST developed an app-vetting system and framework  for managing an organization’s app-vetting process with  respect to the organization’s security and privacy policies  and requirements. This system was used by the Defense  Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to vet apps  prior to being deployed on thousands of military mobile  devices for use in the current U.S. war theater, the 2013  Presidential Inauguration, and the 2014 Boston Marathon.  NIST’s work in mobile security has earned the 2014  Government Computer News (GCN) award for Information  Technology Excellence and the 2013 U.S. Department  of Commerce Gold Medal Award. For FY 2015, NIST will  continue to develop and transition mobile security-related  technologies, publish guidance on issues of mobile security,  and provide mobile security expertise to industry and other  government agencies.

The primary  motivations for the development of IPv6 were to increase  the number of unique IP addresses available for use and to  handle the needs of new Internet applications and devices.  In addition, IPv6 was designed with the following goals:  increased ease of network management and configuration,  expandable IP headers, improved mobility and security, and  the quality of service controls. IPv6 has been, and continues  to be, developed and defined by the Internet Engineering  Task Force (IETF).  FY 2012 was a significant year for the deployment  of IPv6 in the United States Government (USG). OMB’s  Memo of September 10, 2010, Transition to IPv6, required  all government agencies to “upgrade public/external  facing servers and services (e.g., web, email, Domain Name  System (DNS), Internet Service Provider (ISP) services) to  operationally use IPv6 by the end of FY 2012.” NIST worked  with the USGv6 Task Force and with individual government  agencies to achieve this goal. NIST developed an online  monitor to demonstrate which high-level government  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  5 7  domains have met this goal with respect to DNS services,  email, web servers, and Domain Name System Security  Extensions (DNSSEC). In FY 2013, NIST and OMB continued  to use this monitor to measure USGv6 compliance with  OMB’s requirement.  Additional OMB IPv6 requirements were mandated  for FY 2014. Agencies were required to “upgrade internal  client applications that communicate with public Internet  servers and supporting enterprise networks to operationally  use IPv6 by the end of FY 2014.” NIST developed online  diagnostic tools to help agencies verify compliance to this  requirement.  The NIST IPv6 Test Program, whose goal is to  provide assurance on IPv6 product conformance and  interoperability, continues to operate. In FY 2015, NIST will  continue to manage and evolve the USGv6 Test Program  and to help federal agencies fulfill OMB mandates and  monitor compliance to those mandates. The NIST program is  a collaboration between CSD and the Advanced Networking  Technology Division.  http://www.antd.nist.gov/usgv6  CONTACTS: Ms. Sheila Frankel  Mr. Douglas Montgomery  (301) 975-3297  (301) 975-3630  sheila.frankel@nist.gov  dougm@nist.gov  A C C E S S  C O N T R O L  A N D  P R I V I L E G E  M A N A G E M E N T  Access Control  and Privi lege  Management Research  With the advance of current computing technologies  and the diverse environments in which these technologies  are used, security issues, such as situational awareness, trust  management, preservation of privacy in access control, and  privilege-management systems, are becoming increasingly  complex. Practical and conceptual guidance for these topics  is needed.  In FY 2014, the following research was accomplished for  this project:  •  Enhanced the unified enforcement mechanism of data  services for use by a Policy Machine (PM) for an enter- prise computing environment;  •  Enhanced the capabilities of the Access Control Policy  Tool (ACPT);  •  Implemented a fault-detection method for an access  control rule using Simulated Logic Circuit algorithms;  •  Studied formal Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)  models;  •  Published the SP 800-162, Guide to Attribute Based  Access Control (ABAC) Definition and Considerations,  which provides information for function components,  as well as an enterprise consideration of ABAC;  •  Studied an Access Control scheme for Big Data Pro- cessing; and  •  Studied an assurance mechanism for ABAC attributes.  In FY 2015, CSD will continue the above research, and  present the most updated results in CSD’s CSRC website.  CSD expects that this project will:  •  Promote (or accelerate) the adoption of community  computing that utilizes the power of shared resources  and common trust-management schemes;  •  Provide guidance for implementing access control  models and mechanisms for standalone or enterprise  systems;  •  Increase the security and safety of static (connected)  distributed systems by applying the testing and verifi- cation tool for the access control policies;  •  Assist system architects, security administrators, and  security managers whose expertise is related to access  control or privilege policy in managing their systems  and in learning the limitations and practical approaches  for their applications; and  •  Provide accurate and efficient fault detection and  correction technology for implementing access control  rules and policies.

Thus, an access- control model provides unambiguous and precise expression,  as well as a reference for design and implementation of  security requirements. Techniques are required for verifying  whether an access-control model is correctly expressed in  the access-control policies and whether the properties are  satisfied in the model.  Most research on AC model or policy verification  techniques are focused on one particular model, and almost  all of the research is in applied methods, which require the  completed AC policies as the input for verification or test  processes to generate fault reports. Even though correct  verification is achieved, and counterexamples may be  generated when faults were found, those methods provide  no information about the source of faults that might allow  conflicts in privilege assignment, leakage of privileges, or  conflict of interest permissions. The difficulty in finding the  source of faults is increased, especially when the AC rules  are intricately covering duplicated variables to a degree of  complexity. The complexity is due to the fact that a fault  might not be caused by one particular rule. Thus, it requires  manually analyzing each rule in the policy in order to find the  correct solution for the fault.  To address the issue, CSD researched the AC Rule Logic  Circuit Simulation (ACRLCS) technique, which enables the  AC authors to detect a fault when the fault-causing AC rule  is added to the policy, so the fix can be implemented in  real time before adding other rules that further complicate  the detecting effort. Rather than checking by retracing the  interrelations between rules after the policy is completed,  the policy author needs to only check the newly added  rule against previous “correct” ones. In ACRLCS, AC rules  are represented in a Simulated Logic Circuit (SLC). The  use of simulation may restrict ACRLCS implementation on  a physical electronic circuit; however, the concept can be  implemented and computed through simulated software. In  FY 2014, CSD accomplished the following:  •  Researched the ACRLCS, and implemented a prototype  access control rule composing system - the Access  Control Rule Logic Circuit Simulation System;  •  Worked with industrial and academic organizations in  exploring new capabilities that helped to improve the  usability of the AC tools (ACPT and ACRLCS);  •  Enhanced the capability of ACPT by improving user in- terfaces and adding privilege inheritance and multiple  policy combination algorithms;  •  Performed prototype testing; and  •  ACPT was downloaded by 277 users and organizations.  In FY 2015, CSD is planning to conduct further research  on the new capabilities and enhance performance of the  ACPT and ACRLCS.

ABAC  represents a point on the spectrum of logical access control,  from simple access control lists to more capable role-based  access (RBAC), and finally, to a highly flexible method for  providing access based on the evaluation of attributes.  There has not been a comprehensive effort to formally  define or guide the implementation of ABAC within the  Federal Government. This research provides considerations  for using ABAC to improve information sharing within and  among organizations, while maintaining control of that  information. The research serves a two-fold purpose. First,  it aims to provide federal agencies with a definition of ABAC  and a description of the functional components of ABAC.  Second, it provides planning, design, implementation, and  operational considerations for employing ABAC within a  large enterprise with the goal of improving information  sharing while maintaining control of that information.  In addition to the core concept (i.e. definition and  consideration), ABAC research includes technologies such  as attribute assurance, attribute engineering/management,  identity system integration, attribute federation, situational  awareness (real time or contextual) mechanism, policy  management, and natural-language policy translation to  digital policy.  In FY 2014, CSD published SP 800-162, Guide to  Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Definition and  Considerations. SP 800-162 includes terminology and basic  understanding of ABAC; ABAC enterprise-employment  considerations during the initiation, acquisition/development,  implementation/assessment, and operations and  maintenance phases; and an example to demonstrate how  ABAC is implemented in a Web Information Portal. CSD also  researched ABAC formal models; the result will be presented  in a NISTIR that will describe a variety of characteristics  and applications of ABAC formal models. CSD also started  research on the Attribute Assurance of ABAC in partnership  with the National Security Agency (NSA), the National  Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), and  the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE);  CSD developed a white paper based on the mechanism for  defining the levels of assurance of ABAC attributes, as well  as collecting use cases, current standards, and engineering  experiences through a Request for Information (RFI) and  working with ABAC user/commercial product communities.  In FY 2015, CSD will continue the research of ABAC  formal models, as well as details and extended topics of  ABAC capabilities, such as Attribute Assurance, ABAC  implementation examples, and ABAC standards. The ABAC  project will pursue the following objectives:  •  Provide readers with the terminology and a basic un- derstanding of ABAC;  •  Provide readers with an overview of the current state  of logical access control, a working definition of ABAC,  and an explanation of the core and enterprise ABAC  concepts;  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  6 0  •  Assist security policy makers in establishing a busi- ness case for ABAC implementation, and acquiring an  interoperable set of capabilities;  •  Assist ABAC developers in developing the operational  requirements and overall enterprise architecture;  •  Assist ABAC administrators in establishing or refining  business processes to support ABAC; and  •  Promote the adoption of ABAC for a more secure and  flexible method for information sharing in a standalone  or enterprise environment.  http://csrc.nist.gov/projects/abac/  CONTACTS: Dr. Vincent Hu  Mr. David Ferraiolo  (301) 975-4975  (301) 975-3046  vhu@nist.gov  david.ferraiolo@nist.gov  Mr. Rick Kuhn  (301) 975-3337  kuhn@nist.gov  Figure 21: ABAC Access Control Mechanism Chart  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  6 1  A D VA N C E D  S E C U R I T Y  T E S T- I N G  A N D  M E A S U R E M E N T S  Security Automation and Continuous  Monitoring  IT organizations operate a diverse set of computing  assets that access, route, store, and process information that  is critical to the operations of businesses and the missions  of government agencies. These IT environments are  frequently reconfigured, and are under constant threat of  attack. The wide variety of computing products, the speed  of configuration change, and the diversity of threats require  organizations to maintain situational awareness over their  IT assets and to utilize this information to make risk-based  decisions.  Security automation utilizes standardized data formats  and transport protocols to enable data to be exchanged  between business, operational, and security systems that  support security processes by:  • Identifying IT assets;  •  Providing awareness over the operational state of com- puting devices;  •  Enabling security reference data to be collected from  internal and external sources; and  •  Supporting analysis processes that measure the effec- tiveness of security controls and provide visibility into  security risks, enabling risk-based decision making.  Commercial solutions built using security-automation  specifications enable the collection and harmonization of  vast amounts of operational and security data into coherent,  comparable information streams to achieve situational  awareness that allows timely and active management of  diverse IT systems. Through the creation of reference data  and guidance, and the international recognition of flexible,  open standards, the NIST security-automation program  works to improve the interoperability, broad acceptance,  and adoption of security-automation solutions to  address current and future security challenges, creating  opportunities for innovation.  Specif ication,  Standards,  and Guidance  Development  To support the overarching security automation vision, it  is necessary to have specifications that describe the required  interactions between systems, standards that document  international consensus approaches, and guidance that  informs product developers and implementers. Through  close work with partners in government, industry, and  academia, NIST CSD continues to facilitate the definition  and development of security automation approaches that  enable organizations to understand and manage IT security  risks.  During FY 2014, CSD worked to build on previous  security automation work by:  •  Participating in working groups in standards develop- ment organizations to promote international consensus  around standardized approaches;  •  Identifying and addressing gaps in the current specifi- cations;  •  Evolving existing approaches to achieve greater scal- ability and impact;  •  Providing additional guidance on architectural, design,  and analysis concerns; and  •  The development and maintenance of tools and refer- ence implementations.  CSD is currently working with its partners in various  standards-development organizations, including the  International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the  Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Forum of Incident  Response and Security Teams (FIRST), and the Trusted  Computing Group (TCG), to further mature and broaden the  adoption of security-automation specifications, reference  data, and techniques. This area of work is focused on evolving  security-automation specifications to integrate with existing  transport protocols to provide for the secure, interoperable  exchange of security-automation data. Additional work  is focused on evolving security metrics and providing  consensus guidance on security-automation approaches.  Through the definition and adoption of security-automation  standards and guidelines, IT vendors will be able to provide  standardized security solutions to their customers. These  solutions support continuous monitoring and automated,  dynamic network defense capabilities based on the analysis  of data from operational and security data sources and the  collective action of security components.  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  6 2  Security-automation work has been focused in two  areas: the evolution and international adoption of the  Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP), and the  development of a Continuous Monitoring building block  focused on secure software asset management capabilities.  The following sections detail this work.  Security Content  Automation Protocol  (SCAP)  SCAP is a multipurpose protocol that provides an  automated means to collect and assess the state of devices.  SCAP supports automated vulnerability checking, verifying  the installation of patches, checking-security configuration  settings, verifying technical-control compliance, measuring  security, and examining systems for indicators of a  compromise. SCAP uses the Extensible Markup Language  (XML) to standardize the format and nomenclature by which  security software products communicate information about  software flaws, security configurations, and other aspects  of device state. SCAP enables security-automation content,  also known as “SCAP content,” to be expressed using  standardized formats, identifiers, and scoring models. This  content can be used by any tool that is conformant to the  specifications, to collect and evaluate the state of software  installed on a device.  SCAP has been widely adopted by major software  and hardware manufacturers and has become a significant  component of information-security-management and  governance programs. SCAP-enabled tools are currently  being used by the U.S. Government, critical-infrastructure  companies, academia, and other businesses, both  domestically and internationally. Currently, CSD is leveraging  SCAP in multiple areas, both to support its own mission  and to enable other agencies and private-sector entities  to meet their goals. For CSD, SCAP is a critical component  of the SCAP Validation Program, the National Vulnerability  Database (NVD), and the National Checklist Program (NCP).  In September 2012, CSD published SP 800-126  Revision 2, The Technical Specification for the Security  Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2.  That document describes the 11 component specifications  composing SCAP.  See Table on next page.  Since the release of SCAP 1.2, CSD has worked to improve  guidance around the SCAP specifications by promoting a  broader international adoption of SCAP, encouraging the  integration of SCAP into other standards, and by adapting  SCAP to address specific gaps and challenges. The sections  describe work activities performed during FY 2014.  CSD has continued its collaboration with industry  partners in the IETF Security Automation and Continuous  Monitoring (SACM) working group. This working group  provides a venue for advancing appropriate SCAP  specifications into international standards and addressing  identified gap areas. The current scope of work for SACM  includes identifying and/or defining the transport protocols  and data formats needed to support the collection and  evaluation of a device state against the expected values  and standards for interacting with repositories of security- automation content. Over the past twelve months, the SACM  working group has been working on identifying use cases,  requirements, and architectural models to inform decisions  about existing specifications and standards that can be  referenced, required modifications or extensions to existing  specifications and standards, and any gaps that need to be  addressed.  The working group has been developing the following  Internet drafts:  INTERNET DRAFT PURPOSE  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm- terminology/  Definition of the common terminology used within a  number of working-group documents.  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-use-cases/ Description of use cases and related capabilities to guide  the development of requirements, architecture, and  specifications for data models and transports.  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm- requirements/  Listing architectural and specification requirements for  SACM specifications.  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-terminology/ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-terminology/ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-use-cases/ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-requirements/ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-requirements/  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  6 3  For more information, please refer to:  http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/sacm/charter/  Additionally, CSD collaborated with industry partners  to revise the ISO/IEC 19770-2:2009 standard, Information  technology—Software asset management—Part 2: Software  identification tag, which establishes a specification for  tagging software to support identification and management.  This software-identification (SWID) data model defines a  mechanism for software publishers to provide authoritative  identification, categorization, software relationship (e.g.,  dependency, bundling, and patch), executable and library  footprint details, and other metadata for software that they  publish. This information enhances the SCAP use cases  by providing authoritative information for the creation of  Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) names, the targeting  of checklists, and associating software flaws to products  based on a defect in a software library or executable.  CSD also worked with government and industry partners  in the TCG to define a number of specifications related to  the Trusted Network Connect (TNC) protocols.

The second is the TNC Enterprise Compliance  Profile (ECP) and related specifications that support the  exchange of SWID data over the TNC protocols. The ECP  enables the collection of SWID data from a device for use  by external tools to provide software inventory information.  SCAP and SWID data collected using these mechanisms  may be optionally used for network access-control decision  making, allowing the device state to be evaluated when  devices connect and on an ongoing basis thereafter.  For more information on these specifications, please  visit: http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/ tnc_scap_messages_for_ifm, and  http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_ endpoint_compliance_profile_specification.  Finally, CSD has worked with the Forum of Incident  Response and Security Teams (FIRST) by participating in  two Special Interest Groups (SIG). The CVSS SIG (CVSS-SIG)  focused on defining CVSS Revision 3, which is intended to  implement improvements to the scoring model, based on  community feedback. The CVSS-SIG is currently working  on the CVSS revision, which will be released in FY 2015. The  second SIG, the Vulnerability Reporting and Data eXchange  SIG (VRDX-SIG), researches and recommends methods for  identifying and exchanging vulnerability information across  disparate vulnerability databases.  For more information, please visit:  http://www.first.org/global/sigs.  Through work with international SDOs, SCAP and  related security-automation capabilities are expected  to evolve and expand in support of the growing need to  define and measure effective security controls, assess and  monitor ongoing aspects of information security, remediate  noncompliance, and successfully manage systems in  accordance with the Risk Management Framework  described in SP 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying  the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information  Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach. Standards that are  developed and published by these SDOs will be considered  for inclusion in future revisions of SCAP.  http://scap.nist.gov/  CONTACT: Mr. David Waltermire  (301) 975-3390  david.waltermire@nist.gov  Continuous Monitoring In September 2010, the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) released the Continuous Asset Evaluation,  Situational Awareness and Risk Scoring (CAESARS)  Reference Architecture Report. This report identifies  commonality and strengths in the custom approaches used  by civilian agencies to provide solutions that enable the  continuous monitoring of IT systems. This report identifies  “essential functional components of a security risk-scoring  system, independent of specific technologies, products,  or vendors.” It describes the use of security-automation  specifications, such as the SCAP, to enable continuous  monitoring solutions.  In October 2010, the Federal Chief Information  Officer Council’s Information Security and Identity  Management Committee’s (ISIMC) subcommittee on  Continuous Monitoring and Risk Scoring saw the need to  create a technical initiative to expand upon the CAESARS  architecture to better scale it to large enterprises (e.g., the  entire U.S. Government). A team of researchers from the  NSA Information Assurance Directorate (IAD), the DHS  Federal Network Security CAESARS team, and CSD worked  together to respond to this need. The draft CAESARS  Framework Extension (CAESARS-FE) described by Draft  NISTIR 7756, CAESARS Framework Extension: An Enterprise  Continuous Monitoring Technical Reference Architecture, is  the output of this collaboration.  Draft NISTIR 7756 presents an enterprise continuous- monitoring (ConMon) technical reference architecture that  extends the framework provided by the DHS’s CAESARS  architecture. The primary goal of this effort is to enable  enterprise ConMon by supporting the development and  deployment of capabilities that support automated,  enterprise-wide ConMon functions. The concepts,  workflows, and subsystems presented in this document  can be used by organizations seeking to establish federated  queries, an orchestration of data-collection tasks, data  analytics, and presentation and reporting capabilities  across a diverse portfolio of security and IT products.  CAESARS-FE supports IT operations and network-defense  capabilities, with compliance reporting as a byproduct of  actual security monitoring and improvement. CAESARS- FE enables organizations to design, develop, and deploy  ConMon capabilities by leveraging their existing security and  IT tools, while minimizing custom tool-integration efforts.  CAESARS-FE defines the requisite functionality needed  to ensure the interoperability of vendor products, while  continuing to encourage security-tool-vendor participation  and innovation.  http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_scap_messages_for_ifm http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_scap_messages_for_ifm http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_endpoint_compliance_profile_specification http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_endpoint_compliance_profile_specification http://www.first.org/global/sigs  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  6 5  To advance the state-of-the-art in continuous- monitoring capabilities and to further interoperability within  commercially available tools, CSD is working with the IETF  SACM working group to develop data-model and transport  standards to support enterprise continuous monitoring. The  CAESARS-FE reference architecture will evolve as consensus  is developed within SACM around interoperable, standards- based approaches that enable continuous monitoring of IT  systems. CSD is working to complete an update to NISTIR  7756 that provides additional guidance for the development  of ConMon architectures and solutions based on ongoing  standards activities and feedback.  The NIST National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence  (NCCoE) is also working to develop a series of ConMon  building blocks that demonstrate cybersecurity solutions  that apply across multiple industry sectors. The first building  block, currently under development, proposes a standardized  approach to software-asset management, providing an  organization with an integrated view of software throughout  its lifecycle. The building block will support:  •  Authorization and verification of software installation  media—The ability to verify that software media is from  a trusted publisher and that the integrity of the installa- tion media has been maintained;  •  Software-execution whitelisting—The execution envi- ronment verifies that the software to be executed, is  authorized for execution, and that the executable file(s)  and any associated shared libraries have not been  tampered with;  •  Publication of an installed software inventory—When  connected to an authorized network, a device’s full  or updated software inventory is securely reported to  an external configuration-management database that  aggregates the software inventory of multiple devices  for further analysis; and  •  Software inventory-based network access control—  Control access to network resources at the time of  a connect operation, based on the published, in- stalled-software inventory. Access to network resourc- es can be limited if software is outdated or patches are  not installed in accordance with digital policies.  When used together, these capabilities enable the  enterprise-wide management of the software that is allowed  to be installed and executed. The collected information  will also provide software-version information to support  license, vulnerability and patch management needs. If  historic software-inventory information is maintained,  retroactive analysis techniques can be applied on this data  to determine historic vulnerable conditions in support of  incident-response and recovery processes. Finally, using  the collected software inventory, network access can  be controlled, enabling the device to be connected to a  remediation network, if necessary, so that the appropriate  software changes can be made before allowing the device  full access to the operational network.  The building-block document, Continuous Monitoring  Building Block: Software Asset Management, can be viewed  at http://nccoe.nist.gov/content/continuous-monitoring. In  early FY 2015, the team will publish an update to the  building-block document and will begin work with vendors  to develop a solutions demonstration. Through this process,  CSD provides publicly available descriptions of the practical  steps needed to implement the technical approaches  defined by the building block.

SCAP, and  the programs that leverage it, are moving the information  assurance industry towards being able to standardize  communications and the collection and storage of relevant  data in standardized formats, and to provide an automated  means for the assessment and remediation of systems for  both vulnerabilities and configuration compliance.  National  Vulnerabi l i ty  Database (NVD) Security automation reference data is currently  housed within the NVD. The NVD is the U.S. Government  repository of security automation data based on security  automation specifications. This data provides a standards- based foundation for the automation of software asset,  vulnerability, and security configuration management;  security measurement; and compliance activities. This data  supports security automation efforts based on the SCAP. The  NVD includes databases of security configuration checklists  for the NCP, listings of publicly known software flaws,  product names, and impact metrics. A formal validation  program tests the ability of vendor products to use some  forms of security automation data, based on a product’s  conformance in support of specific enterprise capabilities.  http://nccoe.nist.gov/content/continuous-monitoring  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  6 6  SCAP defines the structure of standardized software  flaws and security configuration reference data, also known  as SCAP content. This reference data is provided by the NVD  (http://nvd.nist.gov/).  As of October 2014, the NVD contained the following  resources:  •  Over 65 000 vulnerability advisories, with an average  of 40 new vulnerabilities added daily;  •  56 SCAP-expressed checklists containing thousands  of low-level security configuration checks that can be  used by SCAP-validated security products to perform  automated evaluations of the system state;  •  197 non-SCAP security checklists (e.g., English prose  guidance and configuration scripts);  •  248 U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US- CERT) alerts; 3690 US-CERT vulnerability summaries;  and 10 286 SCAP machine-readable software flaw  checks;  •  A product dictionary with over 97 000 operating sys- tem, application, and hardware name entries; and  •  50 038 vulnerability advisories translated into Spanish.  NVD is hosted and maintained by NIST and is sponsored  by the Department of Homeland  Security’s US-CERT.  The use of SCAP data by commercial security products,  deployed in thousands of organizations worldwide, has  extended NVD’s effective reach. Increasing demand for NVD  XML data feeds (i.e., mechanisms that provide updated data  from data sources) and SCAP-expressed content from the  NVD website demonstrates an increased adoption of SCAP.  The NVD continues to play a pivotal role in the Payment  Card Industry (PCI) efforts to mitigate vulnerabilities in credit  card systems. PCI mandates the use of NVD vulnerability  severity scores in measuring the risk to payment card  servers worldwide and for prioritizing vulnerability patching.  PCI’s use of NVD severity scores helps enhance credit card  transaction security and protects consumers’ personal  information.  During FY 2014, the NVD infrastructure has been  significantly changed to improve responsiveness and  availability and to position the NVD for future improvements,  which will be coming soon. NVD now hosts the SP 800-53  Revision 4 security controls content and will host the SP  800-53A Revision 4 content when that publication becomes  final. NVD data is substantially increasing the security of  networks worldwide, and it is a fundamental component of  CSD’s security automation infrastructure. CSD plans for the  NVD in FY 2015 include improvements in the organization  and layout of the NVD to assist new users in locating  content, the addition of visualization options of the NVD  data for security researchers, and an implementation of the  forthcoming release of the Common Vulnerability Scoring  System (CVSS) version 3 specifications from FIRST.  http://nvd.nist.gov  CONTACT: Mr. Harold Booth  (301) 975-8441  harold.booth@nist.gov  Computer  Security Incident  Coordination  Recognizing that even well-engineered and administered  computing systems are sometimes successfully attacked,  it is important to establish and maintain processes and  procedures for responding to and recovering from attacks.  SP 800-61 Revision 2, Computer Security Incident Handling  Guide, provides guidance that helps organizations establish  and operate a Computer Security Incident Response  Team (CSIRT). When an attack has the potential to affect  computing systems in multiple organizations, information  sharing and coordination among organizations can make it  possible to reduce the impact of the attack, speed recovery  operations, and maintain a higher level of operational  security.  CSD is working with the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) to develop guidance on Computer Security  Incident Coordination (CSIC). The goal of CSIC is to help  diverse collections of organizations to effectively collaborate  in the handling of computer security incidents. Effective  collaboration raises numerous issues on how and when to  share information between organizations, and in what form  information should be shared. Because each organization  may have substantially different capabilities for responding  to attacks, diagnosing causes, and handling sensitive  incident-related information, guidance is needed to help  organizations interoperate despite these organizational  differences.  The CSIC initiative is focused on the development  of a Special Publication (SP) that provides guidance on  how organizations can establish information sharing and  coordination capabilities in advance of incidents in order  to be prepared to operate swiftly and with coordination  during incidents. The guidance covers information sharing  architectures; risk-informed incident response capabilities;  data privacy and sensitivity; data collection and retention  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  6 7  practices; and the use of open standards for information  exchange, redaction, and guidance on how an organization  can establish, participate in, and maintain coordination and  information-sharing relationships.  The CSIC guidance will help incident responders,  network defenders, and operations personnel consider  what information could be shared, the circumstances under  which sharing is permitted, whom it can be shared with,  and how the information should be protected. One of the  key objectives of information sharing and coordination is to  enable organizations to harness the collective knowledge  and experience of their sharing partners to enhance  protective measures, speed incident detection, augment  analysis capabilities, and enhance containment, eradication,  and recovery processes.  In early FY 2015, CSD plans to release a Draft SP  that provides guidance for Computer Security Incident  Coordination. After the public comment period for the  draft, a final version of the publication will be prepared and  released later in the fiscal year.  CONTACTS: Mr. Lee Badger  Mr. David Waltermire  (301) 975-3176  (301) 975-3390  lee.badger@nist.gov david.waltermire@nist.gov  Mr. Christopher Johnson  (301) 975-3247  christopher.johnson@nist.gov  National  Checkl ist  Program (NCP) There are many threats to information technology (IT),  ranging from remotely launched network service exploits to  malicious code spread through infected emails, websites,  and downloaded files. Vulnerabilities in IT products are  discovered daily, and many ready-to-use exploitation  techniques are widely available on the Internet. Because IT  products are often intended for a wide variety of audiences,  restrictive security configuration controls are usually not  enabled by default. As a result, many out-of-the box IT  products are immediately vulnerable. In addition, identifying  a reasonable set of security settings that achieve balanced  risk management is a complicated, arduous, and time- consuming task, even for experienced system administrators.  To facilitate the development of security configuration  checklists for IT products and to make checklists more  organized and usable, NIST’s CSD established the National  Checklist Program (NCP) in furtherance of its statutory  responsibilities under the Federal Information Security  Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347, and  also under the Cybersecurity Research and Development  Act, which tasks NIST to “develop, and revise as necessary,  a checklist setting forth settings and option selections that  minimize the security risks associated with each computer  hardware or software system that is, or is likely to become,  widely used within the Federal Government.” In February  2008, revised Part 39 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR) was published. Paragraph (d) of section 39.101 states,  “In acquiring information technology, agencies shall include  the appropriate IT security policies and requirements,  including use of common security configurations available  from the NIST website at http://checklists.nist.gov. Agency  contracting officers should consult with the requiring official  to ensure the appropriate standards are incorporated.”  In Memorandum M-08-22, the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) mandated the use of SCAP-validated  products for continuous monitoring of Federal Desktop  Core Configuration (FDCC) compliance. The NCP strives to  encourage and assist federal agencies with these mandates.  The goals of the NCP are to:  •  Facilitate the development and sharing of checklists by  providing a formal framework for checklist developers  to submit checklists to NIST;  •  Provide guidance to developers to help them create  standardized, high-quality checklists that conform to  common operation environments;  •  Help developers and users by providing guidelines for  making checklists better documented and more usable;  •  Encourage software vendors and other parties to de- velop checklists;  •  Provide a managed process for the review, update, and  maintenance of checklists;  •  Provide an easy-to-use repository of checklists; and  •  Encourage the use of automation technologies (e.g.,  SCAP) for checklist application.  There are 253 checklists posted on the website  (http://checklists.nist.gov); 120 of the checklists, addressing  48 platforms, are SCAP-expressed and can be used with  SCAP-validated products. The majority of the SCAP- expressed checklists have been posted in the past three  years, demonstrating continual use and adoption of this  automated means of expressing checklist content.  Organizations can use checklists obtained from the  NCP website for automated security configuration patch  assessment. The NCP currently hosts SCAP checklists for  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  6 8  Internet Explorer 9.0, Internet Explorer 10.0, Office 2010,  Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows  Server 2012, and other products.  To assist users in identifying automated checklist  content, NCP groups these checklists into tiers, from Tier I to  Tier IV. The NCP uses the tiers to rank checklists according  to their automation capability. Tier III and IV checklists  include SCAP content and have been validated by the SCAP  content validation tool as conforming to the requirements  outlined in SP 800-126, The Technical Specification for  the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). Tier IV  checklists are considered production-ready and have been  validated by NIST or a NIST recognized authoritative entity  to ensure interoperability with SCAP-validated products to  the maximum extent possible.  Tier III checklists use SCAP content to document security  settings and should be compatible with SCAP-validated  products. Tier II checklists document recommended security  settings in a machine-readable, nonstandard format, such  as a proprietary format or a product-specific configuration  script. Tier I checklists are prose-based and contain no  machine-readable content. Users can browse the checklists,  based on the checklist tier, IT product, IT product category,  or authority, and through a keyword search that searches the  checklist name and summary for user specified terms. The  search results show the detailed checklist metadata and a  link to any SCAP content for the checklist, as well as links to  any supporting resources associated with the checklist.  To assist checklist developers, the NCP provides both  manual and automated interfaces to facilitate submission  and maintenance processes. The manual interface consists  of a web application that guides the submitter through  the data entry process to ensure that all of the required  information is submitted. The submission is validated  upon review, and a report is returned to the submitting  organization, verifying either acceptance or rejection, based  on the criteria requirements.

The project evolved from the  Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) mandate  originally described in a March 2007 memorandum  from the U.S. White House Office of Management and  Budget (Memorandum M-07-11). USGCB helps to improve  information security and reduce overall IT operating costs  by providing commonly accepted security configurations for  major operating systems.  Through the National Checklist Program described in  SP 800-70 Revision 2, National Checklist Program for IT  Products: Guidelines for Checklist Users and Developers,  a baseline submitter may express interest in submitting a  candidate for use in the USGCB program.  CSD provides ongoing support for the USGCB  automation content, including periodic updates, assisting  USGCB users in continuously monitoring and assessing  security compliance of information systems. This ongoing  monitoring element supports the Risk Management  Framework described in SP 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for  Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal  Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach. It also  supports the Core functions of the Cybersecurity Framework,  providing USGCB users with settings that protect digital  assets and enable detection of suspicious activity.  During FY 2015, the USGCB Program will continue to  provide ongoing maintenance of the baseline artifacts and  to consider additional applicable platforms.  The USGCB’s team email address is: usgcb@nist.gov.

The configurations will be based on a collection of  resources, including the existing NIST OS X configuration  guidance, the OS X security configuration guide, the  Department of Defense (DOD) OS X Recommended Settings,  and the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) OS X  Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG). The project  team is aggregating 400 initial settings, determining which  settings will be included in the configuration baseline, and  determining appropriate values for each included setting.  As the desired configuration items are established, the team  is developing shell scripts that apply the settings to an OS  X 10.8 system. The settings are organized into three key  baselines, which are appropriate for different environments:  •  The Enterprise baseline is appropriate for centrally  managed, networked systems.  •  The Small Office Home Office baseline is appropriate  for systems that are deployed remotely, but need to  connect to enterprise networks.  •  The Special Security Limited Functionality baseline is  appropriate for systems where security requirements  are more stringent and where the implementation of  security safeguards is likely to reduce functionality.  SCAP, defined and discussed in other sections of this  report, is used to express configuration settings and check  system configuration compliance.  During FY 2013, CSD provided a block of initial settings  to Apple and these settings were posted for the Apple  community on a periodic basis for public review, discussion,  correction and agreement. Each setting has a designated  Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) number, which  aids in long-term tracking of the setting. Once these settings  are vetted by Apple, the settings will then be tested and  included in the configuration baselines. In addition, CSD is  producing a draft guideline, Guide to Securing Apple OS X  10.8 Systems for IT Professionals. This guidance, similar in  structure to the SP 800-68, Windows XP Security Guide, will  provide detailed information about the security of Apple OS  X 10.8, and will provide security configuration guidelines for  all users of the Apple OS X 10.8 operating system.  During FY 2014, a majority of all proposed settings were  scripted. The corresponding spreadsheet batches have been  sent to Apple for feedback; approximately 230 settings are  now completed. Settings have also been implemented on OS  X 10.9, when possible. Work on the draft guideline, Guide to  Securing Apple OS X 10.8 Systems for IT Professionals, was  temporarily suspended while configuration setting research  was performed, but will be resumed in FY 2015.  In FY 2015, CSD plans to finish scripting the few  remaining OS X settings. The draft publication, Guide to  Securing Apple OS X 10.8 Systems for IT Professionals will  also be completed and made available for public comment.  One of the script’s three profiles will be deployed on select  CSD systems to test the extended use of a system with a  specific profile applied. CSD plans to continue improving the  script after all settings are implemented.

Vulnerabilities are regularly discovered in software  applications that are exploited to stage cyber attacks.  System administrators need objective metrics to guide  and justify decision making as they manage the security  risk of enterprise networks. The objective of this research  is to develop a standard model for security risk analysis of  computer networks. A standard model will enable NIST to  answer questions such as “Are we more secure now than  yesterday?” or “How does the security of one network  configuration compare with another one?” Also, having a  standard model to measure network security will allow users,  vendors, and researchers to evaluate methodologies and  products for network security in a coherent and consistent  manner.  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  7 0  CSD has approached the challenge of network security  analysis by capturing vulnerability interdependencies  and measuring security, based on how real attackers have  penetrated networks. CSD’s methodology for security risk  analysis is based on attack graphs. CSD analyzes attack  paths through a network, providing a probabilistic metric of  the overall system risk. Through this metric, CSD analyzes  trade-offs between security costs and security benefits.  Computer systems are vulnerable to both known  and zero-day attacks. Handling zero-day vulnerabilities  is inherently difficult, due to their unpredictable nature.  In FY 2014, CSD attempted to model network diversity  for evaluating the resilience of networks against zero- day attacks. CSD developed a formal model for network  diversity as a security metric for evaluating the robustness of  networks against potential zero-day attacks. CSD has  proposed a new metric based on the least and average  attacking effort. CSD has authored a paper, “Modeling  Network Diversity for Evaluating the Robustness of Networks  against Zero- Day Attacks,” that was presented at the 19th  European Symposium on Research in Computer Security  (ESORICS), Wroclaw, Poland, September 7-11, 2014.  In FY 2015, CSD plans to develop new techniques and  metrics to detect stealthy attacks on Cloud Computing using  Bayesian Networks. CSD also plans to publish the results as a  NIST report and as white papers in conferences and journals.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/security-risk-analysis- enterprise-networks/  CONTACT: Dr. Anoop Singhal  (301) 975-4432  anoop.singhal@nist.gov  Algorithms for  Intrusion Measurement The Algorithms for Intrusion Measurement (AIM) project  furthers measurement science in the area of the algorithms  used in the field of intrusion detection. The team focuses on  both new detection metrics and measurements of scalability  (more formally called algorithmic complexity). This analysis  is applied to different phases of the detection lifecycle  to include preemptive vulnerability analysis, initial attack  detection, alert impact, alert aggregation/correlation, and  compact log storage. In performing this work, the AIM project  seeks to enhance the nation’s ability to defend itself from  network-borne attacks. This scientific research is conducted  in partnership with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and  the University of Maryland. ARL’s participation helps focus  the work on solving immediately critical problems facing  U.S. Government networks. However, research solutions are  made publicly available and are designed to be generally  applicable to as many environments as possible.  In FY 2014, the AIM project completed research  pertaining to several stages of the detection lifecycle through  the application of graph theoretic approaches: security  log compression, alert aggregation, and network threat  propagation. The project team accomplished the following:  •  The research team enabled significantly tighter com- pression for security logs, compared to using standard  compression algorithms alone, and accomplished it  using less processing time. The invention was a light- weight packing process that takes advantage of the  restricted semantics and regular format of certain kinds  of log files to render them substantially more amenable  to compression with standard algorithms (research  published by the Military Communications Conference,  2014). The team achieved a reduction of compressed  file sizes to as little as 21 % of that of maximally com- pressed files without packing, and reduced overall  compression times up to 64 %.  •  To aid in the human analysis of such intrusion and se- curity logs, the team designed an efficient approach to  visually compress groups of related logs (as opposed  to the previous work that reduced the actual size on a  disk). The team designed a user-adjustable log aggre- gation approach using varying Hamming distances to  quickly and losslessly aggregate alerts (research pub- lished by the International Journal of Network Security  and its Applications). The result is a reduction in the  cognitive load on analysts by minimizing the overall  number of alerts and the number of data elements that  need to be reviewed in order for an analyst to evaluate  the set of original alerts.  •  The research team addressed the problem of deter- mining how far an attack may have spread in a net- work when a perimeter incursion has been detected.  To accomplish this, the team created metrics and an  algorithm for bounding the scope of network ingress  attacks using the network tainting invention (research  published by IEEE Conference on Software Security  and Reliability, 2014). This approach provides an effi- cient means by which to stage and prioritize network  forensics examinations.  In FY 2015, the AIM project will work on measuring  Internet resilience to attacks by colluding countries, the  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/security-risk-analysis-enterprise-networks/ http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/security-risk-analysis-enterprise-networks/  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  7 1  detection of persistent and stealthy network scanning, and  efficient representations and algorithms for modeling and  defending attack paths within a network.

NIST  research has shown that most failures are triggered by one  or two parameters, and progressively fewer by three, four, or  more parameters (see the graph below), a relationship that  is called the Interaction Rule. These results have important  implications for testing. If all faults in a system can be  triggered by a combination of n or fewer parameters, then  testing all n-way combinations of parameters can provide  very strong fault detection efficiency. These methods are  being applied to software and hardware testing for reliability,  safety, and security. CSD’s focus is on empirical results and  real-world problems.  Project highlights for FY 2014 included the publication  of a report on a two-year Cooperative Research and  Development Agreement (CRADA) with Lockheed Martin  Corporation, showing approximately a 20 % reduction in  software test development cost across a variety of projects,  with a 20 % to 50 % improvement in test coverage; the  development of a parallel algorithm for fault location,  demonstrated on 22 000 variables; nine invited lectures  at conferences and research labs; leading (jointly with IBM  personnel) the IEEE Third International Conference on  Combinatorial Testing, held with the International Conference  on Software Testing; and a joint project with Carnegie Mellon  University developing an advanced test environment that  incorporates combinatorial methods.  Figure 22: Interaction Rule  Technology transfer activities included the publication  of several technical papers; a presentation of the results  of the work with Lockheed Martin; a release of enhanced  covering array, test prioritization, and fault location tools; plus  seminars and lectures at several conferences, universities,  and federal agencies.  Plans for FY 2015 include a follow-up project with  the NASA IV&V Facility to investigate the integration of  combinatorial coverage measurement methods in NASA  Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) practices;  the release of test a development environment as an open  source project (jointly with Carnegie Mellon University);  lectures at conferences and research labs; and a joint  development of enhanced fault location tools with Johns  Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acts/  CONTACTS: Mr. Rick Kuhn  Dr. Raghu Kacker  (301) 975-3337  (301) 975-2109  kuhn@nist.gov  raghu.kacker@nist.gov  Roots of  Trust Modern computing devices consist of various hardware,  firmware, and software components at multiple layers of  abstraction. Many security and protection mechanisms are  currently rooted in software that, along with all underlying  components, must be trusted and not tampered with. A  vulnerability in any of those components could compromise  the trustworthiness of the security mechanisms that rely  upon those components. Stronger security assurances may  be possible by grounding security mechanisms in roots of  trust.  Roots of trust are highly reliable and secure hardware,  firmware, and software components that perform specific,  critical security functions. Because roots of trust are  inherently trusted, they must be secure by their design. As  such, many roots of trust are implemented in hardware or  protected firmware so that malware cannot tamper with  the functions they provide. Roots of trust provide a firm  foundation from which to build security and trust.  NIST CSD’s work aims to encourage the use of roots of  trust in computers to provide stronger security assurances.  A focus area for this work has been securing mobile devices,  using roots of trust to provide device integrity, data and  application isolation, and protected storage. As part of this  work, CSD is revising SP 800-164, Guidelines on Hardware- Rooted Security in Mobile Devices, based on the public  comments that were received on the draft. A revised draft  will be released in FY 2015.  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  7 2  Meanwhile, the draft guideline is being used as the  basis for an effort with the National Cybersecurity Center of  Excellence (NCCoE) to encourage the adoption of stronger  security technologies in mobile devices. Using draft SP  800-164 as a foundational document, the NCCoE and  CSD developed the Mobile Device Security for Enterprises  building block, which will demonstrate commercially  available technologies that provide protection to both  organization-issued and personally owned mobile platforms.  The NCCoE will invite mobile device, operating system,  and management software vendors, as well as application  developers, to participate in this building block activity and  demonstrate how their technologies could be used together  to meet existing security requirements.  The CSD also continued its work to protect platform  firmware in FY 2014. Boot firmware, commonly known as  the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS), is a critical firmware  component, due to its unique and privileged position within  modern computing architectures. CSD has been working  with key members of the computer industry on the use of  roots of trust to improve the security of BIOS. In order to  encourage the continued adoption of BIOS protections,  The CSD submitted SP 800-147, BIOS Protection Guidelines,  to ISO for international standardization. CSD will continue  these standards efforts in FY 2015, and conduct research on  protections for other critical platform firmware.

In the NIST technical series, CSD solicited public  comments on forty draft publications, including one FIPS, 28  SPs and 11 NISTIRs. The FIPS had a 90-day comment period,  while the other publications averaged 45 days. In particular,  Draft NISTIR 7977, NIST Cryptographic Standards and  Guidelines Development Process (discussed in this annual  report in the Cryptographic Standards and Guidelines  Process Review section), sought feedback on the NIST  mechanisms used to engage experts in industry, academia  and government to develop cryptographic standards.  Nine SPs and four NISTIRs were issued as final  publications, including new documents, revisions or updated  revisions. CSD also continued to have its work published  monthly in ITL Bulletins, which summarize the various  publications and projects occurring across CSD. Those  interested in being notified of new and draft publications  may visit http://csrc.nist.gov and subscribe to email alerts.  Seeking to expand the availability of its publications in  formats besides PDFs, CSD began converting some of its  newer and most-downloaded publications into the .EPUB  format, which is commonly used by e-book readers on  mobile platforms. More than 28 e-books were posted during  FY 2014 on the Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC)  publications pages, http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/.

These  publications are available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications.  FIPS  DRAFT FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based  Hash and Extendable-Output Functions  This standard specifies the Secure Hash Algorithm-3  (SHA-3) family of functions on binary data. Each of the SHA- 3 functions is based on an instance of the KeccaK algorithm  that NIST selected as the winner of the SHA-3 Cryptographic  Hash Algorithm Competition. This Standard also specifies  the KeccaK-p family of mathematical permutations,  including the permutation that underlies KeccaK, in order to  facilitate the development of additional permutation-based  cryptographic functions.  The SHA-3 family consists of four cryptographic hash  functions, called SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and  SHA3-512, and two extendable-output functions (XOFs),  called SHAKE128 and SHAKE256.  Hash functions are components for many important  information security applications, including 1) the generation  and verification of digital signatures, 2) key derivation, and 3)  pseudorandom bit generation. The hash functions specified  in this Standard supplement the SHA-1 hash function and  the SHA-2 family of hash functions that are specified in FIPS  180-4, The Secure Hash Standard.  Extendable-output functions are different from hash  functions, but it is possible to use them in similar ways, with  the flexibility to be adapted directly to the requirements  of individual applications, subject to additional security  considerations.

The primary goal of the Computer Security Division (CSD),  a component of NIST s Information Technology Laboratory  (ITL), is to provide standards and technology that protects  information systems against threats to the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of information and services.  During FY 2013, CSD successfully responded to numerous  challenges and opportunities in fulfilling that mission.  Through CSD’s diverse research agenda and engagement  in many national priority initiatives, high-quality, cost- effective security and privacy mechanisms were developed  and applied that improved information security across the  Federal Government and the greater information security  community. This annual report highlights the research  agenda and activities in which CSD was engaged during FY  2013.

Application whitelisting technologies  use whitelists to control which applications are permitted  to execute on a host. This helps to stop the execution of  malware, unlicensed software, and other unauthorized  software. This publication is intended to assist organizations  in understanding the basics of application whitelisting. It  also explains planning and implementation for whitelisting  technologies throughout the security deployment lifecycle.  CONTACTS: Mr. Adam Sedgewick  adam.sedgewick@nist.gov  Mr. Murugiah Souppaya  murugiah.souppaya@nist.gov  DRAFT SP 800-163, Technical Considerations for Vetting  3rd Party Mobile Applications  Today’s commercially available mobile devices (e.g.,  smart phones, tablets) are handheld computing platforms  with wireless capabilities, geographic localization, cameras,  and microphones. Similar to computing platforms such as  desktops and laptops, the user experience with a mobile  device is tied to the software apps and the tools and utilities  available. The purpose of this document is to provide  guidance for vetting 3rd party software applications (apps)  for mobile devices. Mobile app vetting is intended to assess  a mobile app’s operational characteristics of secure behavior  and reliability (including performance) so that organizations  can determine if the app is acceptable for use in their  expected environment.  CONTACTS: Dr. Jeff Voas  Dr. Stephen Quirolgico  jeff.voas@nist.gov stephen.quirolgico@nist.gov  SP 800-162, Guide to Attribute Based Access Control  (ABAC) Definition and Considerations  This document provides federal agencies with a definition  of attribute based access control (ABAC). ABAC is a logical  access control methodology where authorization to perform  a set of operations is determined by evaluating attributes  associated with the subject, object, requested operations,  and, in some cases, environment conditions against policy,  rules, or relationships that describe the allowable operations  for a given set of attributes. This document also provides  considerations for using ABAC to improve information  sharing within organizations and between organizations  while maintaining control of that information.

These risks are associated with the  federal agencies decreased visibility into, understanding  of, and control over how the technology that they acquire  is developed, integrated and deployed, as well as the  processes, procedures, and practices used to assure the  integrity, security, resilience, and quality of the products and  services.  This publication provides guidance to federal agencies  on identifying, assessing, and mitigating ICT supply chain  risks at all levels of their organizations. This publication  integrates ICT supply chain risk management (SCRM) into  federal agency risk management activities by applying a  multitiered, SCRM-specific approach, including guidance on  supply chain risk assessment and mitigation activities.

CONTACT: Ms. Elaine Barker  elaine.barker@nist.gov  SP 800-147B, BIOS Protection Guidelines for Servers  Modern computers rely on fundamental system  firmware, commonly known as the Basic Input/Output  System (BIOS), to facilitate the hardware initialization  process and transition control to the hypervisor or operating  system. Unauthorized modification of BIOS firmware by  malicious software constitutes a significant threat because  of the BIOS’s unique and privileged position within the  PC architecture. The guidelines in this document include  requirements on servers to mitigate the execution of  malicious or corrupt BIOS code. They apply to BIOS  firmware stored in the BIOS flash, including the BIOS code,  the cryptographic keys that are part of the Root of Trust  for Update, and static BIOS data. This guide is intended to  provide server platform vendors with recommendations and  guidelines for a secure BIOS update process.  CONTACT: Mr. Andy Regenscheid  andy.regenscheid@nist.gov  SP 800-101 Revision 1, Guidelines on Mobile Device  Forensics  Mobile device forensics is the science of recovering  digital evidence from a mobile device under forensically  sound conditions using accepted methods. Mobile device  forensics is an evolving specialty in the field of digital  forensics. This guide attempts to bridge the gap by providing  an in-depth look into mobile devices and explaining the  technologies involved and their relationship to forensic  procedures. This document covers mobile devices with  features beyond simple voice communication and text  messaging capabilities. This guide also discusses procedures  for the validation, preservation, acquisition, examination,  analysis, and reporting of digital information.

CONTACTS: Ms. Elaine Barker  Dr. John Kelsey  elaine.barker@nist.gov john.kelsey@nist.gov  DRAFT SP 800-85B-4, PIV Data Model Test Guidelines  FIPS 201, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal  Employees and Contractors, describes a variety of data  model components as a part of the PIV logical credentials.  Such components include biometric elements in the  form of fingerprint information and facial imagery and  security elements such as electronic keys, certificates, and  signatures. FIPS 201 incorporates by reference NIST SP  800-73-4 Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification, which  specifies elements related to the PIV card interface, NIST  SP 800-76 Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity  Verification, which specifies the biometric requirements, and  NIST SP 800-78 Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes  for Personal Identity Verification, which specifies acceptable  cryptographic algorithms and key sizes for PIV systems.  A robust testing framework and guidelines to provide  assurance that a particular component or system is compliant  with FIPS 201 and supporting standards should exist to  build the necessary PIV infrastructure to support common  unified processes and systems for government-wide use.  NIST developed test guidelines in two parts. The first part  addresses test requirements for the interface to the PIV card,  which are provided in NIST SP 800-85A PIV Card Application  and Middleware Interface Test Guidelines (SP 800-73-3  Compliance). The second part provides test requirements  for the PIV data model and is provided in this document. This  document specifies the derived test requirements, and the  detailed test assertions and conformance tests for testing  the PIV data model.

The document provides an  overview of ICS and typical system topologies, identifies  typical threats and vulnerabilities to these systems, and  provides recommended security countermeasures to  mitigate the associated risks.  CONTACTS: Mr. Keith Stouffer Ms. Suzanne Lightman  keith.stouffer@nist.go suzanne.lightman@nist.gov  Ms. Vicky Pillitteri  victoria.pillitteri@nist.gov  DRAFT SP 800-79-2, Guidelines for the Authorization  of Personal Identity Verification Card Issuers (PCI) and  Derived PIV Credential Issuers (DPCI)  The purpose of this SP is to provide appropriate and  useful guidelines for assessing the reliability of issuers  of PIV Cards and Derived PIV Credentials. These issuers  store personal information and issue credentials based on  OMB policies and on the standards published in response  to HSPD-12 and therefore are the primary target of the  assessment and authorization under this guideline. The  reliability of an issuer is of utmost importance when one  organization (e.g., a federal agency) is required to trust the  identity credentials of individuals that were created and  issued by another federal agency. This trust will only exist  if organizations relying on the credentials issued by a given  organization have the necessary level of assurance that the  reliability of the issuing organization has been established  through a formal authorization process.

FIPS 201 also specifies that this identity credential must be  stored on a smart card. This document, SP 800-73, contains  the technical specifications to interface with the smart  card to retrieve and use the PIV identity credentials. The  specifications reflect the design goals of interoperability and  PIV Card functions. The goals are addressed by specifying  a PIV data model, card edge interface, and application  programming interface. Moreover, this document enumerates  requirements where the international integrated circuit card  standards include options and branches. The specifications  go further by constraining implementers’ interpretations of  the normative standards. Such restrictions are designed to  ease implementation, facilitate interoperability, and ensure  performance, in a manner tailored for PIV applications.

The assessment procedures, executed at  various phases of the system development life cycle, are  consistent with the security and privacy controls in NIST  SP 800-53 Revision 4. The procedures are customizable  and can be easily tailored to provide organizations with the  needed flexibility to conduct security control assessments  and privacy control assessments that support organizational  risk management processes and that are aligned with the  stated risk tolerance of the organization. Information on  building effective security assessment plans and privacy  assessment plans is also provided along with guidance on  analyzing assessment results.  CONTACT: NIST FISMA Team  Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative  sec-cert@nist.gov  SP 800-53 Revision 4 (Updated), Security and  Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and  Organizations  This publication provides a catalog of security and  privacy controls for federal information systems and  organizations and a process for selecting controls to protect  organizational operations (including mission, functions,  image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals,  other organizations, and the Nation from a diverse set of  threats including hostile cyber attacks, natural disasters,  structural failures, and human errors (both intentional  and unintentional). The security and privacy controls are  customizable and implemented as part of an organization- wide process that manages information security and privacy  risk. The controls address a diverse set of security and  privacy requirements across the Federal Government and  critical infrastructure, derived from legislation, Executive  Orders, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and/ or mission/business needs. The publication also describes  how to develop specialized sets of controls, or overlays,  tailored for specific types of missions/business functions,  technologies, or environments of operation. Finally, the  catalog of security controls addresses security from both a  functionality perspective (the strength of security functions  and mechanisms provided) and an assurance perspective  (the measures of confidence in the implemented security  capability). Addressing both security functionality and  assurance helps to ensure that information technology  component products and the information systems built from  those products using sound system and security engineering  principles are sufficiently trustworthy.

In addition to  considering the new content in ISO/IEC 27001 for the  mapping tables, new mapping criteria were employed in  conducting the mapping analysis. The new criteria are  intended to produce more accurate results—that is, to  successfully meet the mapping criteria, the implementation  of the mapped controls should result in an equivalent  information security posture. While mapping exercises may  by their very nature, include a degree of subjectivity, the  new criteria attempts to minimize that subjectivity to the  greatest extent possible.

Each  individual that owns, uses, relies on, or manages information  and information technology (IT) systems must fully understand  their specific security responsibilities. This includes ownership  of the information and the role individuals have in protecting  information. Information that requires protection includes  information they own, information provided to them as part of  their work and information they may come into contact with.

Despite over four decades of security  research, the limited ability for existing access control  mechanisms to enforce a comprehensive range of policy  persists. While researchers, practitioners and policy makers  have specified a large variety of access control policies to  address real-world security issues, only a relatively small  subset of these policies can be enforced through off-the- shelf technology, and even a smaller subset can be enforced  by any one mechanism. This report describes an access  control framework, referred to as the Policy Machine (PM),  which fundamentally changes the way policy is expressed  and enforced. The report gives an overview of the PM and  the range of policies that can be specified and enacted. The  report also describes the architecture of the PM and the  properties of the PM model in detail.

This is often accomplished  using the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. The SSH protocol  supports several mechanisms for authentication, with public  key authentication being recommended for automated  access with SSH. Management of automated access requires  proper provisioning, termination, and monitoring processes,  just as interactive access by normal users does. However, the  security of SSH-based automated access has been largely  ignored to date. This publication assists organizations  in understanding the basics of SSH automated access  management in an enterprise, focusing on the management  of SSH access tokens.

Depending upon the sensitivity of the  resources and the risk of wrong identification, different  authentication use cases are being deployed. Assignment  of authentication strength for each of the use cases is often  based on: (a) the total number of three common orthogonal  authentication factors – What You Know, What You Have and  What You are, and (b) the entropy associated with each factor  chosen. The objective of this paper is to analyze the limitation  of this approach and present a methodology for assigning  authentication strengths based on the strength of pair wise  bindings between the five entities involved in smart card  based authentications – the card (token), the token secret,  the card holder, the card issuer, and the person identifier  stored in the card. The rationale for the methodology is based  on the following three observations: (a) The form factor of  the smart identity token introduces some threats of misuse;  (b) the common set of credentials objects provisioned to a  smart card embody bindings to address those threats and (c)  the strength of an authentication use case should therefore  be based on the number and type of binding verifications  that are performed in the constituent authentication  mechanisms. The use of the methodology for developing  an authentication assurance level taxonomy for two real  world smart identity token deployments is also illustrated.

Organizations in the diverse community of Smart Grid  stakeholders—from utilities to providers of energy  management services to manufacturers of electric vehicles  and charging stations—can use the methods and supporting  information presented in this report as guidance for  assessing risk and identifying and applying appropriate  security requirements. This approach recognizes that the  electric grid is changing from a relatively closed system  to a complex, highly interconnected environment. Each  organization’s cybersecurity requirements should evolve  as technology advances and as threats to grid security  inevitably multiply and diversify.

Approximately 100 IT professionals participated in  the 2014 IT Pro Conference on Information Systems  Governance, held at NIST on May 22, 2014 (www. computer.org/itproconf). Information systems  governance focuses on properly managing IT resources  to achieve organizational goals. The conference was  designed to bring together IT professionals from  industry, government, and academia to discuss new  challenges in information systems and share ways of  overcoming such challenges. Sponsored by IEEE, NIST,  and Noblis, the conference featured three keynotes  and 12 presentations, focusing on the following key  questions: 1) How can we get the most value from IT  while still delivering successful projects and reliable  information systems and infrastructure? 2) How can  we secure critical systems while keeping pace with  advances in technology? and 3)What changes are on  the horizon for technology and business leaders?

A Brahmagupta quadrilateral is a cyclic  quadrilateral whose sides, diagonals, and area are  all integer values. In this article, we characterize  the notions of Brahmagupta, introduced by  K. R. S. Sastry, by means of elliptic curves. Motivated  by these characterizations, we use Brahmagupta  quadrilaterals to construct infinite families of elliptic  curves with torsion group /2  x /2  having ranks  (at least) 4, 5, and 6. Furthermore, by specializing we  give examples from these families of specific curves  with rank 9.  R.

When enabling handover between different radio  interfaces (e.g., handover from 3G to Wi-Fi), reducing  network access authentication latency and securing  handover related signaling messages are major  challenging problems, amongst many others.

The  mechanisms introduced in this standard are aimed  to protect the IEEE standard 802.21-2008 messages  and services and to reduce handover latency by  introducing the concept of proactive authentication.  We provide a comprehensive survey of this standard  and describe how the defined mechanisms can be  used to reduce the overall latency during handover  between access networks using heterogeneous radio  interfaces.

Previous work introduced the idea of grouping  alerts at a Hamming distance of 1 to achieve alert  aggregation; such aggregated meta-alerts were  shown to increase alert interpret-ability. However,  a mean of 84 023 daily Snort alerts were reduced  to a still formidable 14 099 meta-alerts. In this work,  we address this limitation by investigating several  approaches that all contribute towards reducing the  burden on the analyst and providing timely analysis.  We explore minimizing the number of both alerts and  data fields by aggregating at Hamming distances  greater than 1. We show how increasing bin sizes can  improve aggregation rates. And we provide a new  aggregation algorithm that operates up to an order  of magnitude faster at Hamming distance 1. Lastly, we  demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach  through empirical analysis of Windows security alerts,  Snort alerts, netflow records, and DNS logs.  V.Y. Pillitteri, “NIST Cybersecurity Framework Addresses  Risks to Critical Infrastructure,” ei Magazine 19 (6), 20-21  (June 2014).  On February 12, 2014, President Obama issued a  statement that, “[c]yber threats pose one the gravest  national security dangers that the United States faces.  To better defend our nation against this systemic  challenge, one year ago I signed an Executive Order  directing the Administration to take steps to improve  information sharing with the private sector, raise the  level of cybersecurity across our critical infrastructure,  and enhance privacy and civil liberties.” That Executive  Order, E.O. 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure  Cybersecurity, directed the National Institute of  Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop a  voluntary, risk-based Cybersecurity Framework  (“Framework”)—based on existing industry standards  and best practices—to help organizations manage  cybersecurity risk. The resulting Framework was  created through a yearlong collaboration between  government and industry.  A.L. Roginsky, K. Christensen and M.

On-off scheduling of systems that have the ability  to sleep can be used to extend system idle periods  and enable greater opportunities for energy savings  from sleeping. In this paper, we achieve a theoretical  understanding of the delay behavior of on-off  scheduling as it may apply to communications links  and other systems capable of sleeping. We consider  a single-server coalescing queue with a scheduler  that schedules on-off periods for the server in order  to extend idle periods of the downstream link. At the  start of an off period (duration Toff) the server stops  serving jobs immediately if idle, or after processing  a job already in service. Service of any queued and  arriving jobs begins at the start of the next on period  (duration Ton). On and off periods are fixed. We solve  for the scheduling queue behavior as a function of  Toff, Ton, interarrival time t, service time x, and time  of first arrival g for periodic job arrivals. Results are  closed form and have both theoretical and practical  significance.  A.T. Vassilev and T.A.

The strength of cryptographic keys is an active  challenge in academic research and industrial practice.  In this paper, we discuss the entropy as fundamentally  important concept for generating hard-to-guess, i.e.,  strong, cryptographic keys and outline the difficulties  in generating and estimating the available entropy  for cryptographic needs. We consider traditional  entropy estimation in cryptographic applications and  motivate the development of new spectral techniques  for estimation.

Noel, “k-Zero  Day Safety: A Network Security Metric for Measuring the  Risk of Unknown Vulnerabilities,” IEEE Transactions on  Dependable and Secure Computing 11(1), 30-44 (January- February 2014). doi: 10.1109/TDSC.2013.24.  By enabling a direct comparison of different security  solutions with respect to their relative effectiveness,  a network security metric may provide quantifiable  evidences to assist security practitioners in securing  computer networks. However, research on security  metrics has been hindered by difficulties in handling  zero day attacks exploiting unknown vulnerabilities.  In fact, the security risk of unknown vulnerabilities  has been considered as something unmeasurable due  to the less predictable nature of software flaws. This  causes a major difficulty to security metrics, because  a more secure configuration would be of little value  if it were equally susceptible to zero day attacks. In  this paper, we propose a novel security metric, k-zero  day safety, to address this issue. Instead of attempting  to rank unknown vulnerabilities, the described metric  counts how many such vulnerabilities would be  required for compromising network assets; a larger  count implies more security since the likelihood  of having more unknown vulnerabilities available,  applicable, and exploitable all at the same time will  be significantly lower. We formally define the metric,  analyze the complexity of computing the metric,  devise heuristic algorithms for intractable cases, and  finally demonstrate through case studies that applying  the metric to existing network security practices may  generate actionable knowledge.

Risk management is a common phrase when managing  information, from the Chief Information Security  Officer (CISO)  to the programmer. We acknowledge  that risk management is the identification, assessment  and prioritization of risks and reflects how we manage  uncertainty. These are some areas of risk that we  have come to accept, their mitigation strategies are  part of our development, part of our everyday work.  Most IT professionals would agree that IT is good at  identifying and managing the risks. But is that really  the case or has risk management/mitigation become  a buzz word for us?

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is one of the three  main cloud service types where the cloud consumer  consumes a great variety of resources such as  computing (Virtual Machines or VMs), virtual network,  storage and utility programs (DBMS). Any large-scale  offering of this service is feasible only through a  virtualized infrastructure at the service provider. At the  minimum, this infrastructure is made up of resources  such as Virtualized hosts together with associated  virtual network and hardware/software for data  storage An IaaS’s consumer’s total set of interactions  with these resources constitute the set of use cases for  IaaS cloud service. These use cases have associated  security requirements and these requirements are  met by protection options enabled by available  security solutions/technologies. The purpose of this  paper is to analyze these protection options from  the viewpoint of: (a) Security functionality they can  provide and (b) the architecture that governs their  deployment, so that IaaS consumers can decide on  the most appropriate security configuration for their  VM instances depending upon the profile of the  applications running in them.

A primary objective of enterprise computing (via a  data center, cloud, etc.) is the controlled delivery of  data services (DS). Typical DSs include applications  such as email, workflow, and records management, as  well as system level features, such as file and access  C S D  P U B L I C AT I O N S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  9 7  control management. Although access control (AC)  currently plays an important role in imposing control  over the execution of DS capabilities, AC can be more  fundamental to computing than one might expect.  That is, if properly designed, a single AC mechanism  can simultaneously implement, control, and deliver  capabilities of multiple DSs. The Policy Machine  (PM) is an AC framework that has been designed  with this objective in mind. This paper describes the  PM features that provide a generic AC mechanism  to implement DS capabilities, and comprehensively  enforces mission tailored access control policies  across DSs.  L.

Some conflicting results have been reported on the  comparison between t-way combinatorial testing and  random testing. In this paper, we report a new study  that applies t-way and random testing to the Siemens  suite. In particular, we investigate the stability of the  two techniques. We measure both code coverage  and fault detection effectiveness. Each program in  the Siemens suite has a number of faulty versions. In  addition, mutation faults are used to better evaluate  fault detection effectiveness in terms of both number  and diversity of faults. The experimental results  show that in most cases, t-way testing performed  as good as or better than random testing. There are  few cases where random testing performed better,  but with a very small margin. Overall, the differences  between the two techniques are not as significant as  one would have probably expected. We discuss the  practical implications of the results. We believe that  more studies are needed to better understand the  comparison of the two techniques.  J. Hagar, D.R. Kuhn, R.N. Kacker and T.

A t-way covering array can detect t-way faults;  however, they generally include other combinations  beyond t-way as well. For example, a particular test  set of all 5-way combinations is shown capable of  detecting all seeded faults in a test program, despite  the fact that it contains up to 9-way faults. This  poster gives an overview of methods for estimating  fault detection effectiveness of a test set based  on combinatorial coverage for a class of software.  Detection effectiveness depends on the distribution  of t-way faults, which is not known. However based  on past experience one could say for example the  fraction of 1-way faults is F1 = 60 %, 2-way faults F2 =  25 % F3 = 10 % and F4 = 5 %. Such information could  be used in determining the required strength t. It is  shown that the fault detection effectiveness of a test  set may be affected significantly by the t-way fault  distribution, overall, simple coverage at each level of  t, number of values per variable, and minimum t-way  coverage. Using these results, we develop practical  guidance for testers.  C. Liu, A. Singhal and D. Wijesekera, “A Model Towards Using  Evidence from Security Events for Network Attack Analysis,”  11th International Workshop on Security in Information  Systems (WOSIS 2014), Lisbon, Portugal, April 27, 2014. doi:  10.5220/0004980300830095.  Constructing an efficient and accurate model from  security events to determine an attack scenario for  an enterprise network is challenging. In this paper,  we discuss how to use evidence obtained from  security events to construct an attack scenario and  build an evidence graph. To achieve the accuracy  and completeness of the evidence graph, we use  Prolog inductive and abductive reasoning to correlate  evidence by reasoning the causality, and use an anti- forensics database and a corresponding attack graph  to find the missing evidence. In addition, because the  constructed scenario and supplied evidence might  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  9 8  need to stand up in the court of law, the federal rules of  evidence are also taken into account to predetermine  the admissibility of the evidence.

This paper discusses limitations in one of the most  widely cited single source scan detection algorithms:  threshold random walk (TRW). If an attacker knows  that TRW is being employed, these limitations  enable full circumvention allowing undetectable high  speed full horizontal and vertical scanning of target  networks from a single Internet Protocol address. To  mitigate the discovered limitations, we provide three  enhancements to TRW and analyze the increased  cost in computational complexity and memory. Even  with these mitigations in place, circumvention is still  possible but only through collaborative scanning  (something TRW was not designed to detect) with a  significant increase in the required level of effort and  usage of resources.

This research describes a novel security metric,  network taint, which is related to software taint  analysis. We use it here to bound the possible  malicious influence of a known compromised node  through monitoring and evaluating network flows.  The result is a dynamically changing defense-in-depth  map that shows threat level indicators gleaned from  monotonically decreasing threat chains. We augment  this analysis with concepts from the complex networks  research area in forming dynamically changing  security perimeters and measuring the cardinality of  the set of threatened nodes within them. In providing  this, we hope to advance network incident response  activities by providing a rapid automated initial triage  service that can guide and prioritize investigative  activities.  M.

Peralta, “The Multiplicative Complexity  of Boolean Functions on Four and Five Variables,” Third  International Workshop on Lightweight Cryptography  for Security & Privacy (LightSec 2014), Istanbul, Turkey,  September 1-2, 2014. In Lecture Notes in Computer Science  8898, Lightweight Cryptography for Security and Privacy, T.  Eisenbarth and E. Öztürk, eds., Berlin: Springer, 2015, pp. 21- 33. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-16363-5_2.  A generic way to design lightweight cryptographic  primitives is to construct simple rounds using small  nonlinear components such as 4x4 S-boxes and use  these iteratively (e.g., PRESENT and SPONGENT).  In order to efficiently implement the primitive,  efficient implementations of its internal components  are needed. Multiplicative complexity of a function  is the minimum number of AND gates required to  implement it by a circuit over the basis (AND, XOR,  NOT). It is known that multiplicative complexity is  exponential in the number of input bits n. Thus it came  as a surprise that circuits for all 65 536 functions on  four bits were found which used at most three AND  gates. In this paper, we verify this result and extend it  to five-variable Boolean functions. We show that the  multiplicative complexity of a Boolean function with  five variables is at most four.  L.

Albanese,  “Modeling Network Diversity for Evaluating the Robustness  of Networks against Zero-Day Attacks,” 19th European  Symposium on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS  2014), Wroclaw, Poland, September 7-11, 2014. In Lecture  Notes in Computer Science 8713, Computer Security –  ESORICS 2014, M. Kutyłowski and J. Vaidya, eds., Berlin:  Springer, 2014, pp. 494-511. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-11212-1_28.  The interest in diversity as a security mechanism has  recently been revived in various applications, such  as Moving Target Defense (MTD), resisting worms  in sensor networks, and improving the robustness  of network routing. However, most existing efforts  on formally modeling diversity have focused on a  single system running diverse software replicas or  variants. At a higher abstraction level, as a global  property of the entire network, diversity and its  impact on security have received limited attention.  In this paper, we take the first step towards formally  modeling network diversity as a security metric  for evaluating the robustness of networks against  potential zero day attacks. Specifically, we first devise  a biodiversity-inspired metric based on the effective  number of distinct resources. We then propose two  complementary diversity metrics, based on the least  and the average attacking efforts, respectively. Finally,  we evaluate algorithm and metrics through simulation.

Erbacher  (Advances in Information Security 62), Berlin: Springer, 2014,  pp. 263-295. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-11391-3_13.  Discussion of challenges and ways of improving  Cyber Situational Awareness dominated our previous  chapters. However, we have not yet touched on how to  quantify any improvement we might achieve. Indeed,  to get an accurate assessment of network security  and provide sufficient Cyber Situational Awareness  (CSA), simple but meaningful metrics—the focus of  the Metrics of Security chapter—are necessary. The  adage, “what can’t be measured can’t be effectively  managed,” applies here. Without good metrics and the  corresponding evaluation methods, security analysts  and network operators cannot accurately evaluate  and measure the security status of their networks  and the success of their operations. In particular,  this chapter explores two distinct issues: (i) how to  define and use metrics as quantitative characteristics  to represent the security state of a network, and (ii)  how to define and use metrics to measure CSA from a  defender’s point of view.

Cybersecurity threats take advantage  of the increased complexity and connectivity of critical  infrastructure systems, placing the Nation’s security  at risk. To better protect these systems, the President  issued Executive Order 13636, Improving Critical  Infrastructure Cybersecurity, on February 12, 2013. The  Executive Order established that “[i]t is the Policy of  the United States to enhance the security and resilience  of the Nation’s critical infrastructure and to maintain  a cyber environment that encourages efficiency,  innovation, and economic prosperity while promoting  safety, security, business confidentiality, privacy, and  civil liberties.” In enacting this policy, the Executive  Order calls for the development of a voluntary risk- based Cybersecurity Framework—a set of industry  standards and best practices to help organizations  manage cybersecurity risks. The resulting Framework,  created through collaboration between government  and the private sector, uses a common language to  address and manage cybersecurity risk in a cost- effective way based on business needs without  placing additional regulatory requirements on  businesses. The Framework enables organizations— regardless of size, degree of cybersecurity risk, or  cybersecurity sophistication—to apply the principles  and best practices of risk management to improving  the security and resilience of critical infrastructure.  The Framework provides organization and structure  to today’s multiple approaches to cybersecurity by  assembling standards, guidelines, and practices that  are working effectively in industry today. Moreover,  because it references globally recognized standards  for cybersecurity, the Framework can also be used by  organizations located outside the United States and  can serve as a model for international cooperation on  strengthening critical infrastructure cybersecurity.

 |  F Y  2 0 1 4  1  C Y E R S E C U R I T Y  O F  C Y B E R - P H Y S I C A L  S Y S T E M S  | C P S  The Computer Security Division (CSD), a component of the Information Technology Laboratory at the  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is responsible for developing standards, guidelines,  tests, and metrics for protection of non-national security federal information systems. NIST standards and  guidelines are developed in an open, transparent, and collaborative manner that enlists broad expertise  from around the world. While developed for federal agency use, these resources are voluntarily adopted by  other organizations because they are effective and accepted globally.  The need for cybersecurity standards and best practices that address interoperability, usability and  privacy continues to be critical for the Nation. CSD continues to align its resources to enable greater  development and application of practical, innovative security technologies and methodologies that  enhance our ability to address current and future computer and information security challenges. Our foundational research and  applied cybersecurity programs continue to advance in many areas including cryptography, roots of trust, identity and access  management, advanced security testing and measurement, cyber-physical systems, and public safety networks.  Trust is crucial to the broad adoption of our standards and guidelines, including our cryptographic standards and  guidelines. To ensure that our cryptography resources have been developed according the highest standard of inclusiveness,  transparency and security, NIST initiated a formal review of our cryptographic standards development efforts in 2014. We  documented and solicited public comment on the principles and rigorous processes we use to engage stakeholders and experts  in industry, academia, and government to develop and revise these standards. We anticipate a final report in 2015 that will serve  as a basis for our future standards development and revision efforts.  Increasing the trustworthiness and resilience of the IT infrastructure is a significant undertaking that requires a  substantial investment in the architectural design and development of our systems and networks. A disciplined and structured  set of systems security engineering processes that starts with and builds on well-established international standards provides an  important starting point. Draft Special Publication 800-160, Systems Security Engineering: An Integrated Approach to Building  Trustworthy Resilient Systems, issued in May 2014, helps organizations to develop a more defensible and survivable information  technology infrastructure. This resource, coupled with other NIST standards and guidelines, contributes to systems that are  more resilient in the face of cyber attacks and other threats.  Strong partnerships with diverse stakeholders are vital to the success of our technical programs. In February 2014,  NIST issued the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity as directed in Executive Order 13636. The  Framework, created through collaboration between industry and government, consists of standards, guidelines, and practices  to promote the protection of critical infrastructure. Its approach helps owners and operators of critical infrastructure to manage  cybersecurity-related risk. Collaborations continue as NIST works with stakeholders from across the country and around  the world. Working closely with standards developing organizations, industry and interagency partners, we are evolving  and expanding security automation capabilities to help organizations manage and measure the security of systems and  technologies.  Active engagement with diverse stakeholders continues to be critical to our success. In the federal space, this  interaction is most prominent in our strengthened collaborations with the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community,  and the Committee on National Security Systems to establish a common foundation for information security across the federal  government. Our cybersecurity awareness, training, and education programs also exemplify the importance of engagements  with academic institutions, federal agencies, small and medium businesses and others to increase awareness and enhance the  overall cybersecurity posture of the Nation.  For many years, CSD, in collaboration with our global partners across industry, academia, and government, has made  great contributions to help secure the nation’s critical information and infrastructure. We look forward to strengthening these  relationships as we lead the development and practical application of scalable and sustainable information security standards  and practices.

OVERVIEW: The Cryptographic Technology Group’s (CTG) work in  the field of cryptography includes researching, analyzing  and standardizing cryptographic technology, such as hash  algorithms, symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic  techniques, key management, authentication, and random  number generation. The CTG’s goal is to identify and  promote methods to enhance trust in communications, data,  and storage through cryptographic technology, encouraging  innovative development and helping technology users to  manage risk.  In FY 2014, the CTG continued to make an impact  in the field of cryptography, both within and outside the  Federal Government, by collaborating with national and  international agencies, academic and research organizations,  and standards bodies to develop interoperable security  standards and guidelines. In addition, the CTG worked with  industry partners to promote the use of NIST-approved  cryptographic methods.  The NIST cryptographic standards’ program  standardizes cryptographic primitives, algorithms,  schemes, and guidelines in Federal Information Processing  Standards (FIPSs), NIST Special Publications (SPs), and  NIST Interagency or Internal Reports (NISTIRs). The NIST  standardized cryptographic tools have been adopted as  standards by standards-setting organizations, such as the  Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Institute of  Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the Trusted  Computing Group (TCG), and have been implemented on a  variety of platforms.  In FY 2014, in response to public concerns about  NIST cryptographic standards -in particular, the DUAL_ EC_DRBG, a deterministic random number generator  specified in SP 800-90A, Recommendation for Random  Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit  Generators—NIST initiated a review of the cryptographic  standards development process. The CTG summarized the  development process for each cryptographic standard and  provided materials and presentations to the NIST Visiting  Committee on Advanced Technology (VCAT) and a NIST  Committee of Visitors (COV), consisting of experts invited by  the VCAT, to conduct the review. A summary for this review  is provided in the Cryptographic Standards and Guidelines  Process Review section of this annual report.  CTG researchers were highly engaged and productive in  several critical cryptographic areas, such as post-quantum  cryptography, elliptic curve cryptography, privacy-enhancing  cryptography, and lightweight cryptographic schemes  for constrained environments. The CTG has collaborated  with many universities internationally, and research results  were published in the major cryptography conferences and  journals. The CTG also held workshops and conferences, as  well as hosted guest researchers.  Several guidelines on cryptographic applications were  published in various areas, such as key management, Internet  protocols, and trusted platforms. The CTG contributed  to other CSD cybersecurity projects, such as the Smart  Grid and Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standards.  The CTG also worked closely with the Security Testing,  Validation, and Measurement Group of the CSD on FIPS 140- 2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, the  Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP), and  the Cryptographic Module Validation Programs (CMVP).

OVERVIEW: The SCMG’s security research focuses on the  development and management of foundational building- block security mechanisms and techniques that can be  integrated into a wide variety of mission-critical U.S.  information systems. The group’s work spans the spectrum  from near-term hardening and improvement of systems, to the  design and analysis of next-generation, leap-ahead security  capabilities. Computer security depends fundamentally on  the level of trust of computer software and systems. This  work, therefore, focuses strongly on assurance-building  activities ranging from the analysis of software configuration  settings, to advanced trust architectures, and to testing  mailto:lily.chen@nist.gov  I N T R O D U C T I O N  T O  C S D ’ S  5  G R O U P S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  5  tools that identify flaws in software modules. This work also  focuses significantly on increasing the applicability and  effectiveness of automated techniques, wherever feasible.  The SCMG conducts collaborative research with government,  industry, and academia. Outputs of this research consist  of prototype systems, software tools, demonstrations,  guidelines, and other documentary resources.  Collaborating extensively with government, academia,  and the private sector, SCMG works on a variety of topics,  such as:  •  Specifications for the automated exchange of security  information between systems;  • Computer-security incident-handling guidelines;  •  Formulation of high-assurance software configuration  settings;  • Hardware roots-of-trust for mobile devices;  • Secure Basic Input Output System (BIOS) layers;  • Combinatorial testing techniques;  •  Conformity assessment of software implementing  biometric standards; and  •  Adoption of Internet Protocol Version 6 and Internet  Protocol security extensions.  In FY 2014, collaborators and the associated  collaborations have included Carnegie Mellon University  (test development environment), Johns Hopkins Applied  Physics Lab (practical application of combinatorial coverage  measurement tool), the University of Texas at Arlington  (covering array generation algorithm), Mexico’s Centro  Nacional de Metrología (constraints for a testing coverage  tool), National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA) (practical application for combinatorial coverage  measurement), U.S. Air Force Test and Evaluation (a new  event sequence testing method), the University of Texas  Dallas and East Carolina University (safety-critical systems  testing), the National Science Foundation (cybersecurity  metrics and assurance building), the National Security  Agency (secure software tool chain competition  development), and the Department of Homeland Security  (incident coordination).  SCMG accomplishments include updates to the  Advanced Combinatorial Testing System (ACTS) software  and documentation, and the NIST Biometrics Conformance  Test Software (BioCTS) 2014 biometric conformance testing  tool and test assertions.

OVERVIEW: SSAG’s security research focuses on identifying  emerging and high-priority technologies, and on developing  security solutions that will have a high impact on the U.S.  critical infrastructures. The group conducted research and  development on behalf of government and industry from the  earliest stages of technology development through proof- of-concept, reference and prototype implementations and  demonstrations. In addition, the group worked to transfer  new technologies to industry; to produce new standards and  guidance for federal agencies and industry; and to develop  tests, test methodologies, and assurance methods.  SSAG investigated the security concerns associated  with such areas as mobile devices, cloud computing and  virtualization, identity management, access control and  authorization management, and software assurance.  SSAG’s research helps to meet federal information security  requirements that may not be fully addressed by existing  technology. The group collaborated extensively with  government, academia, and private sector entities.  Example successes from this work include:  • Tools for access control policy testing;  •  New concepts in access control and policy enforce- ment;  •  Published several Personal Identity Verification docu- ments;  •  Methods for achieving comprehensive policy enforce- ment and data interoperability across enterprise data  services; and  •  Test methods for mobile device (smart phone) applica- tion security.  In particular, the SSAG released an open-source  reference implementation of ANSI/INCITS 499, Next  Generation Access Control. The group also published SP  800-162, Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Definition  and Considerations, providing the first authoritative  definition of ABAC. In support of the Federal Government’s  mobile security initiatives, the group published SP 800- 163, Vetting the Security of Mobile Applications, to provide  mailto:lee.badger@nist.gov  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  6  agencies with guidelines on how to test mobile applications  for government use. In support of the Federal Government’s  cloud computing initiatives, the group led the NIST Security  Working Group that published the NIST Cloud Computing -  Security Reference Architecture. In support of the recently  revised FIPS 201-2, Personal Identity Verification (PIV)  of Federal Employees and Contractors, six PIV-related  800-series SPs were revised. In addition to these, draft SP  800-157, Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity Verification  (PIV) Credentials, was published to guide the implementation  and deployment of PIV credentials for mobile devices.  To improve access to new technologies, the group also  chaired, edited, and participated in the development of a  wide variety of national and international security standards.

OVERVIEW: The U.S. economy, citizens, and government rely on  information technology (IT), so the protection of the IT and  information infrastructure is critical. SOIG leverages broad  cybersecurity and risk-management expertise to develop,  integrate, and promote security standards, guidelines, tools,  technologies, methodologies, tests, and measurements to  address cybersecurity needs in many areas of national and  international importance.  The SOIG collaborates with stakeholders to address  cybersecurity considerations in many diverse program areas,  including the Information and Communications Technologies  (ICT) supply chain, Smart Grid, Electronic Voting, Cyber  Physical and Industrial Control Systems, Health Information  Technology, and the National Public Safety Broadband  Network. The group produces standards and guidelines  through the Federal Information Security Management Act  (FISMA) implementation program to help federal agencies  build strong cybersecurity risk-management programs. In  each of these program areas, the group extends outreach  to stakeholders across federal, state, and local governments;  industry; academia; small businesses; and the public. The  SOIG also leads several broad cybersecurity awareness,  training, education, and outreach efforts, including the  National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE),  the Federal Computer Security Managers’ Forum, and the  Federal Information Systems Security Educators’ Association  (FISSEA).  Key to the group’s success is the ability to interact  with a broad constituency to ensure that SOIG’s program is  consistent with national objectives related to or impacted  by information security. Through open and transparent  public engagement, collaboration, and cooperation, the  group works to address critical cybersecurity challenges,  enable greater U.S. industrial competitiveness, and facilitate  the practical implementation of scalable and sustainable  information security standards and practices.

OVERVIEW: Federal agencies, industry, and the public rely on  cryptography for the protection of information and  communications used in electronic commerce, critical  infrastructures, and other application areas. The STVMG  supports the testing and validation of cryptographic  modules and the cryptographic algorithms specified in NIST  standards. These cryptographic modules and algorithms  enable products and systems to provide security services,  such as confidentiality, integrity authentication, and source  authentication. Although cryptography provides security,  poor designs or weak algorithms can render a product  insecure and place highly sensitive information at risk. When  protecting sensitive data, Federal Government agencies  require a minimum level of assurance that cryptographic  mailto:david.ferraiolo@nist.gov mailto:kevin.stine@nist.gov  I N T R O D U C T I O N  T O  C S D ’ S  5  G R O U P S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  7  products meet established security requirements and  use only tested and validated cryptographic modules and  algorithms.  STVMG’s testing-focused activities include validating  cryptographic algorithm implementations, cryptographic  modules, and Security Content Automation Protocol  (SCAP)-compliant products; developing test suites and test  methods; providing implementation guidance and technical  support to industry forums; and conducting education,  training, and outreach programs.  STVMG’s validation programs work together with  independent Cryptographic and Security Testing  laboratories that are accredited by the NIST National  Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP).  Based on the independent laboratory test report and  test evidence, the Validation Program then validates the  implementation under test. NIST publishes, through public  websites, lists of the validations awarded.

Title III of the E-Government Act,  entitled the Federal Information Security Management Act  (FISMA) of 2002, included duties and responsibilities for the  National Institute of Standards and Technology, Information  Technology Laboratory, Computer Security Division (CSD). In  2014, the CSD addressed its FISMA responsibilities through  the following activities:  •  Issued a draft Federal Information Processing Standard  (FIPS): FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based  Hash and Extendable-Output Functions, which spec- ifies the Secure Hash Algorithm-3 (SHA-3) family of  functions on binary data. Each of the SHA-3 functions  is based on an instance of the KeccaK algorithm that  NIST selected as the winner of the SHA-3 Cryptograph- ic Hash Algorithm Competition.  •  Issued 23 draft and final NIST Special Publications  (SPs) that provide management, operational, and tech- nical security guidelines in areas such as application  whitelisting, attribute-based access control, person- al identity verification and derived credentials, key  management, BIOS protection, mobile device forensics,  secure communications protocol implementations,  third-party mobile application vetting, supply chain  risk management practices, role-based cybersecurity  training, industrial control systems security, systems  security engineering, and security and privacy controls  assessments.  •  Issued 13 draft and final NIST Interagency or Internal  Reports (NISTIRs) on a variety of topics, including  smart grid cybersecurity, personal identity verification,  Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) imple- mentation, cloud computing forensics; identity man- agement in Public Safety mobile networks, replication  device cybersecurity, automated access management  using Secure Shell, and the development process for  NIST cryptographic standards and guidelines.  •  Performed research and conducted outreach on stan- dards, practices, and technologies to enable prompt  and effective computer security incident handling and  coordination.  •  Continued the successful collaboration with the Office  of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the  Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS),  and the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish a  common foundation for information security across the  Federal Government, including a structured, yet flexible  approach for managing information security risk across  an organization. In 2014, this collaboration produced  updated guidelines for assessing security and privacy  controls employed in federal information systems and  organizations.  •  Provided assistance to agencies and the private sector  through many outreach programs, including the Na- tional Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), the  Federal Information Systems Security Educators’ As- sociation (FISSEA), and the Federal Computer Security  Managers’ Forum.  •  Conducted workshops, awareness briefings, and out- reach to CSD customers to ensure the comprehension  of standards and guidelines, to share ongoing and  planned activities, and to aid in scoping guidelines in  a collaborative, open, and transparent manner. CSD  public workshops addressed a diverse range of in- formation security and technology topics, including  cloud and mobile technologies; cyber physical systems;  cryptographic key management; safeguarding health  information; secure hash algorithms; supply-chain risk  management; improving critical infrastructure cyber- security; broad computer security awareness, training,  education, and outreach events; and cybersecurity  innovation forums.  •  Engaged with international standards bodies in a  variety of areas, including promoting a broader inter- national adoption of security automation specifica- tions. Additionally, NIST’s CSD continued to lead, the  Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP), in  conjunction with the Government of Canada’s Commu- nications Security Establishment. The Common Criteria  Evaluation and Validation Scheme (CCEVS) and CMVP  facilitate security testing of IT products usable by the  Federal Government.  •  Solicited recommendations of the Information Security  and Privacy Advisory Board (ISPAB) on draft standards  and guidelines, and on information security and privacy  issues.  •  Produced the CSD 2014 annual report and released it  as a NIST SP. CSD annual reports from fiscal years 2003  through 2014 are available on the Computer Security  Resource Center (CSRC) at http://csrc.nist.gov/  publications/PubsTC.html#AnnualReports.  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsTC.html#AnnualReports http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsTC.html#AnnualReports  1 0  PROGRAM AND PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS  FOR FISCAL YEAR 2014  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  1 1  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  F O R  F Y  2 0 1 4  In FY 2014, CSD continued to research and develop  guidance for a broad array of technical areas, including  supply-chain risk management; security analytics; cloud,  mobile, and privacy-enhancing technologies; hardware- enabled security; and cyber-physical and embedded  systems. The staff and guest researchers within CSD  have collaborated with global partners from government,  industry, and academia, making significant contributions  to help secure critical information and infrastructures.  The following sections describe the CSD’s programs and  project achievements that include extensive research and  development for high-quality, cost-effective security and  privacy mechanisms, standards, guidelines, tests, and  metrics that address current and future computer and  information security challenges.

This EO directed NIST to work with  stakeholders to develop a voluntary framework – based on  existing standards, guidelines, and practices − for reducing  cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructures.  The Cybersecurity Framework provides a prioritized,  flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective  approach to help owners and operators of critical  infrastructures and other interested entities identify, assess,  and manage cybersecurity-related risk, while protecting  business confidentiality, individual privacy, and civil liberties.  In FY 2014, NIST continued to work with a diverse  stakeholder community to develop the Framework through  an open public process. This process included:  •  Preparing a Preliminary Cybersecurity Framework for  official public review and comment;  •  Hosting a workshop at the North Carolina State Univer-  sity in Raleigh, North Carolina to gather input on the  Preliminary Cybersecurity Framework;  •  Issuing the Cybersecurity Framework in February 2014  as directed in the Executive Order;  •  Publishing a companion Cybersecurity Framework  Roadmap detailing high-priority areas that should be  addressed in order to improve future versions of the  Framework; and  •  The release of a formal Request for Information (RFI),  seeking feedback on awareness, experiences with the  Framework, and related activities to support the use of  the Framework.  Since the release of the Framework, NIST’s primary goal  has been to raise awareness of the Framework and encourage  its use as a tool to help industry sectors and organizations  manage cybersecurity risks. NIST has strengthened its  collaboration with critical-infrastructure owners and  operators, industry leaders, government partners, and  other stakeholders, building on interactions over the  previous year that were crucial to the Framework’s  development.  In FY 2015, NIST will continue to conduct stakeholder  outreach and will work collaboratively with them to further  understand stakeholder needs regarding tools and resources  to enable a more effective use of the Framework. NIST will  conduct additional public workshops, including a forum  hosted by the Florida Center for Cybersecurity (FC2) located  at the University of South Florida in Tampa on October 29- 30, 2014. Periodic updates will be provided and additional  events announced through the Framework website.  http://www.nist.gov/cyberframework  CONTACTS: Mr. Kevin Stine  Mr. Adam Sedgewick  (301) 975-4483  (301) 367-4678  kevin.stine@nist.gov  adam.sedgewick@nist.gov  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  1 2  C S D  W O R K  I N  N AT I O N A L  A N D  I N T E R N AT I O N A L  S TA N D A R D S  CSD’s Part  in  National  and  International  ISO Security Standards  Processes  Figure 1 (below) shows many of the national and  international standards-developing organizations (SDOs)  involved in cybersecurity standardization. CSD participates  in many cybersecurity standards’ activities in many of these  organizations, either in leadership positions or as editors  and contributors, including the BioAPI Consortium;  the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG): Bluetooth  Security Expert Group (BT-SEG); the International  Telecommunications Union - Telecommunication Standardi- zation Sector (ITU-T); various groups within the Institute of  Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Internet  Engineering Task Force (IETF); the North American Security  Products Organization (NASPO); the Trusted Computing  Group (TCG); and Accredited Standards Committee  X9, Inc. (X9) (e.g. Financial Industry Standards X9F). Many of  CSD’s publications have been the basis for both national and  international standards projects.  The following write-ups discuss the CSD’s standards  activities in conjunction with the InterNational Committee  for Information Technology Standards (INCITS) Technical  Committee Cyber Security (CS1), where CSD’s Dan  Benigni served as the Chair and U.S. Head of Delegation to  subcommittee SC 27, and CSD’s Sal Francomacaro served  as the CS1 Vice Chair.  The International  Organization for  Standardization (ISO)  The International Organization for Standardization  (ISO) is a network of the national standards institutes of 148  countries, with representation by one member per country.  The scope of ISO covers the standardization in all fields  except electrical and electronic engineering standards, which  are the responsibility of the International Electrotechnical  Commission (IEC).  Figure 1: SDOs involved in Cybersecurity  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  1 3  The IEC prepares and publishes international  standards for all electrical, electronic, and related  technologies,including electronics, magnetics and  electromagnetics, electroacoustics, multimedia, tele- communication, and energy production and distribution,  as well as associated general disciplines, such as  terminology and symbols, electromagnetic compatibility,  measurement and performance, dependability, design and  development, safety, and the environment.  (http://www.iec.ch/about/)  Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) was formed by ISO  and IEC to be responsible for international standardization  in the field of Information Technology (http://www.iso.org/ iso/jtc1_home.html). It develops, maintains, promotes, and  facilitates the IT standards required by global markets,  meeting business and user requirements concerning:  • Design and development of IT systems and tools;  •  Performance and quality of IT products and systems;  • Security of IT systems and information;  • Portability of application programs;  • Interoperability of IT products and systems;  • Unified tools and environments;  • Harmonized IT vocabulary; and  •  User-friendly and ergonomically designed user inter- faces.  JTC 1 consists of a number of subcommittees (SCs) and  working groups that address specific technologies. SCs that  produce standards relating to IT security include:  •  SC 06 - Telecommunications and Information Exchange  Between Systems;  • SC 17 - Cards and Personal Identification;  • SC 27 - IT Security Techniques; and  •  SC 37 – Biometrics (Note: Fernando Podio, NIST CSD,  served as Chair).  JTC 1 also has:  • Technical Committee 68 – Financial Services;  •  SC 2 - Operations and Procedures, including Security;  • SC 4 – Securities;  •  SC 6 - Financial Transaction Cards, Related Media and  Operations;  • SC 7 – Software and Systems Engineering, and  •  SC 38 – Distributed application platforms and services  (DAPS).  The American National  Standards  Institute (ANSI)  ANSI is a private, nonprofit (501(c)(3)) organization  that administers and coordinates the U.S. voluntary  standardization and conformity assessment system, and  facilitates the development of American National Standards  (ANSs) by accrediting the procedures of SDOs.  ANSI promotes the use of U.S. standards internationally,  advocates U.S. policy and technical positions in international  and regional standards organizations, and encourages the  adoption of international standards as national standards  where they meet the needs of the U.S. user community.  ANSI is the sole U.S. representative and dues-paying  member of the two major non-treaty international  standards organizations: ISO and, via the United States  National Committee (USNC), the IEC.  INCITS is accredited by ANSI, and serves as the ANSI  Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for ISO/IEC Joint Technical  Committee 1. INCITS is sponsored by the Information  Technology Industry (ITI) Council, a trade association  representing the leading U.S. providers of information  technology products and services.  INCITS is organized into Technical Committees that  focus on the creation of standards for different technology  areas. Technical committees that focus on IT security and IT  security-related technologies or that may require separate  security standards include:  • B10 – Identification Cards and Related Devices;  •  CS1 – Cyber Security (Dan Benigni, NIST CSD, Chair, Sal  Francomacaro, NIST CSD, Vice Chair, and NIST Principal  Voting Member);  • E22 – Item Authentication;  • M1 – Biometrics (Fernando Podio, NIST CSD, Chair);  • T3 – Open Distributed Processing (ODP);  • T6 – Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Technology;  • GIT1 – Governance of IT; and  •  DAPS38 – Distributed Application Platforms and  Services.  As a technical committee of INCITS, CS1 develops United  States, national, ANSI-accredited standards in the area of  cybersecurity. Its scope encompasses:  • Management of information security and systems;  •  Management of third-party information security service  providers;  • Intrusion detection;  • Network security;  http://www.iso.org/iso/jtc1_home.html http://www.iso.org/iso/jtc1_home.html  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  1 4  • Cloud computing security;  • Supply-chain risk management;  • Incident handling;  • IT security evaluation and assurance;  • Security assessment of operational systems;  • Security requirements for cryptographic modules;  • Protection profiles;  • Role-based access control;  • Security checklists;  • Security metrics;  •  Cryptographic and non-cryptographic techniques and  mechanisms, including confidentiality, entity authen- tication, non-repudiation, key management, data  integrity, message authentication, hash functions, and  digital signatures;  •  Future service and applications standards supporting  the implementation of control objectives and controls  as defined in ISO 27001, in the areas of business conti- nuity, and outsourcing;  •  Identity management, including an identity manage- ment framework, role-based access control, and single  sign-on; and  •  Privacy technologies, including a privacy framework,  privacy reference architecture, privacy infrastructure,  anonymity and credentials, and specific privacy-en- hancing technologies.  The scope of CS1 explicitly excludes the areas of  cybersecurity standardization, which is presently under  development in INCITS B10, M1, T3, T10, and T11, as  well as other standard groups, such as the Alliance for  Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), the IEEE,  the IETF, the Travel Industry Association of America (TIAA),  and Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X9. The CS1  scope of work includes standardization in most of the same  cybersecurity areas as are covered in the NIST CSD.  As the U.S. TAG to ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27, CS1 contributes  to the SC 27 program of work on IT Security Techniques  in terms of U.S. comments and contributions on SC 27  standards projects; U.S. votes on SC 27 standards documents  at various stages of development; and nominates U.S.  experts to work on various SC 27 projects as editors,  co-editors, or in other SC 27 leadership positions. Currently,  over a dozen CS1 members are serving as SC 27  document editors or co-editors on various standards  projects.  All input from CS1 is processed through INCITS to ANSI,  then to SC 27. It is also a conduit for getting U.S.-based new  work item proposals and U.S.-developed national standards  into the international SC 27 standards development process.  In its international efforts, CS1 responded to all calls for U.S.  contributions and/or voting positions on all international  security standards projects in ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 27 in a  consistent, efficient, and timely manner.  NIST’s CSD contributes to many of CS1’s national  and international IT security standards efforts through  its membership on CS1, where Dan Benigni served as  the nonvoting chair and Sal Francomacaro as the NIST  Principal voting member. Internationally, there are over 100  published standards, and almost all have been adopted as  U.S. national standards. There are more than 100 current  international standards projects. During FY 2014, eighteen  new standards were published in SC 27, and all of them have  been recommended by CS1 for adoption as U.S. national  standards.  CSD’s Role in  Cybersecurity  Standardization  CSD’s cybersecurity research also plays a direct role  in the Cybersecurity Standardization efforts of CS1 at the  national level. The following is a description of the national- level progress achieved during FY 2014 by CSD and CS1.  The NIST Policy Machine research and development has  resulted in three ongoing national standards projects in CS1  in the early stages of development. They include:  •  Next Generation Access Control –Functional Architec- ture (NGAC-FA), project number INCITS 499-2013, was  published in FY 2013 and is recently beginning an early  revision;  •  Next Generation Access Control – Generic Operations  & Abstract Data Structures (NGAC-GOADS). Serban  Gavrila, NIST CSD, is the editor. The project is assigned  project number 2195-D, and the document (planned for  publication in FY 2015) is out for second public review;  and  •  Next Generation Access Control -Implementation  Requirements, Protocols and API Definitions (NGAC-IR- PADS). Project number is 2193-D has been assigned.  Dan Benigni also served as cybersecurity standards  coordinator in CSD.

Identity  Management Standards within  INCITS B10 and ISO JTC1/SC17  CSD supports identity management standardization  activities through participation in national and international  standards bodies and organizations. CSD actively  participates in the INCITS B10 committee, which is focused  on the interoperability of Identification Cards and Related  Devices. CSD has contributed and provided valuable  feedback to many INCITS B10 standards in the development  process.  In addition, CSD also participates in the B10.12  committee. The B10.12 committee develops interoperable  standards for Integrated Circuit Cards with Contacts, and it is  the US TAG (Technical Advisory Group) for the international  ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 17 Working Groups 4 and 11. During FY 2014,  Mr. Salvatore Francomacaro, a CSD staff member; served as  the U.S. Head of delegation to ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 17 WG4 and  WG11.  CSD provides technical and editorial support in the  development of national and international standards.  Specifically, a CSD staff member serves as the technical  editor of ANSI 504-1, Generic Identity Command Set (GICS).  GICS enables PIV, PIV-Interoperable (PIV-I) and Common  Access Card (CAC) card applications, and others, to be built  from a single platform. GICS defines an open platform where  identity applications can be instantiated, deployed, and used  in an interoperable way between the credential issuers and  credential users. During FY 2014, INCITS 504 Parts 1 and 2  have started an amendment process to better align them  with the new NIST SP 800-73-4 (PIV) specifications.  CSD staff also provided significant input to standards of  major interest to U.S. government agencies and U.S. markets.  CSD played a role in the development and revision of:  •  ISO/IEC 7816 (Identification Cards, Integrated Circuit  Cards);  •  ISO/IEC 24727 (Identification Cards, Integrated Circuit  Card Programming Interfaces); and  •  ISO/IEC 24787 (Biometrics “Match On Card” Compari- son).  During FY 2015, the INCITS B10 committee, along with  the active collaboration of CSD staff, plans to:  • Publish Part 3 of INCITS 504;  •  Complete the amendment process for INCITS 504 Part  1 and 2; and  •  Contribute to the publication of several revisions of the  ISO/IEC 7816 family of standards (all relevant to FIPS  201 specifications).  CSD staff will continue to actively support relevant ID  management standard initiatives, such as ISO/IEC  19286  (Integrated Circuit Card (ICC) protocols and services ensuring  privacy) and ISO/IEC 18328 (ICC managed Devices).  CSD’s investment in these activities is motivated by new  technical ideas that emerge from these ISO standards. For  example, INCITS 504 is an ID platform that leverages the  FIPS 201 infrastructure to support a larger number of  government and enterprise initiatives. In particular, INCITS  504 aims to support initiatives such as the National  Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC).  ISO/IEC 24727 aims to create an interoperability framework  that increases the resilience and scalability of identity  management solutions and to foster domestic and  international interoperability.

During FY 2014, CSD continued to strengthen its  collaboration with the Department of Defense (DOD), the  Intelligence Community, and the Committee on National  Security Systems (CNSS), in partnership with the Joint  Task Force (JTF) Transformation Initiative. The JTF partners  continue to develop and update key cybersecurity guidelines  for protecting federal information and information systems  as part of the Unified Information Security Framework.  Previously, the Joint Task Force developed common  security guidance in the critical areas of security controls for  information systems and organizations, security assessment  procedures to demonstrate security control effectiveness,  security authorizations for risk acceptance decisions, and  continuous monitoring activities to ensure that decision  makers receive the most up-to-date information on the  security state of their information systems. In addition, CSD  began work with the General Services Administration (GSA)  Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program  (FedRAMP) to develop a high-impact security control  baseline overlay for FedRAMP cloud systems in accordance  with NIST standards and guidelines.  In FY 2014, CSD worked on the following three initiatives:  •  Risk Management Guidelines: SP 800-53 Revision 4,  Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information  Systems and Organizations, provides organizations  with the security controls necessary to appropriately  strengthen their information systems and the envi- ronments in which those systems operate, and with a  process for selecting the appropriate controls, which  contributes to systems that are resilient in the face of  attacks and other threats. This “Build It Right” strategy  is reinforced with the May 2014 publication of the Initial  Public Draft (IPD) of SP 800-160, Systems Security  Engineering: An Integrated Approach to Building Trust- worthy Resilient Systems. The implementation of SPs  800-53 and 800-160, combined with the implementa- tion of SP 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Manage- ment Framework to Federal Information Systems, and  SP 800-137, Information Security Continuous Monitor- ing for Federal Information Systems and Organizations,  provide organizations with near real-time information  that is essential for senior leaders making ongoing  risk-based decisions affecting their critical missions and  business functions.  •  Guidelines for a Role-Based Information Security  Training Model: SP 800-16, A Role-Based Model for  Federal Information Technology/Cybersecurity Train- ing, describes a process for developing information  technology/cybersecurity role-based training. Its pri- mary focus is to provide a comprehensive, yet flexible,  methodology for the development of training courses  or modules for personnel who have been identified as  having significant information technology/cybersecu- rity responsibilities within agencies.  Agencies can use  SP 800-16 to tailor the Role-Based Security Training to  meet the needs of their own organization.  •  FISMA Outreach Activity to Public and Private Sector  Organizations: CSD conducted cybersecurity outreach  briefings and provided support to state and local gov- ernments, as well as private sector organizations, on  topics of interest, such as an effective implementation  of the NIST RMF. In addition, CSD conducted outreach  activities with academic institutions, providing infor- mation on NIST’s security standards and guidelines,  exploring new areas of cybersecurity research and  development, and serving on cybersecurity advisory  panels.  In FY 2014, CSD completed the following activities:  •  Published the IPD of SP 800-53A Revision 4,  Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  1 7  Information Systems and Organizations, and began  public comment adjudication;  •  Published errata versions of SPs 800-37 Revision 1 and  800-53 Revision 4 to make necessary clarifications  and ensure consistency with subsequently published/ revised NIST SPs and new/updated federal policy  requirements;  •  Published Supplemental Guidance on Ongoing Autho- rization to assist federal agencies in transitioning from  the static point-in-time information system security  assessment and authorization model to the dynamic,  near real-time ongoing assessment and authorization  model;  •  Collaborated with the Department of Homeland Securi- ty (DHS) to develop a multiple-volume Interagency Re- port on Automation Support for Ongoing Assessments,  which is based on NIST standards and guidelines; and  •  Continued the development of a preliminary draft of SP  800-18 Revision 2, Guide for Developing Security Plans  for Federal Information Systems and Organizations.  In FY 2015, CSD intends to:  •  Finalize SP 800-53A Revision 4, Assessing Security and  Privacy Controls in Federal Information Systems and  Organizations;  • P ublish an errata update to SP 800-53 Revision 4;  •  Begin the automation of the SP 800-53 revision and  public comment process in support of more timely  updates to counter threats and keep up with techno- logical advancements;  •  Finalize SP 800-16, A Role-Based Model for Federal  Information Technology / CyberSecurity Training;  •  Finalize SP 800-160, Systems Security Engineering: An  Integrated Approach to Building Trustworthy Resilient  Systems;  •  Publish the IPD of SP 800-171, Protecting Controlled  Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information  Systems and Organizations;  •  Begin the development of SP 800-60 Revision 2, Guide  for Mapping Types of Information and Information  Systems to Security Categories;  •  Finalize SP 800-18 Revision 2, Guide for Developing  Security Plans for Federal Information Systems and  Organizations;  •  Expand cybersecurity outreach to include additional  state, local, and tribal governments, as well as private  sector organizations and academic institutions; and  •  Continue to support federal agencies in the effective  implementation of the NIST RMF.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fisma  CONTACTS: Dr. Ron Ross  Ms. Pat Toth  (301) 975-5390  (301) 975-5140  ron.ross@nist.gov  patricia.toth@nist.gov  Ms. Kelley Dempsey  Ms. Peggy Himes  (301) 975-2827  (301) 975-2489  kelley.dempsey@nist.gov  peggy.himes@nist.gov  B I O M E T R I C  S TA N D A R D S  A N D  A S S O C I AT E D  C O N F O R M I T Y  A S S E S S M E N T  T E S T I N G  T O O L S  NIST’s CSD supports the development of biometric  conformance-testing methodology standards and other  conformity-assessment efforts through active technical  participation in the development of these standards and the  development of associated conformance-test architectures  and test suites. These test tools are developed to promote  the adoption of these standards and to support users that  require conformance to selected biometric standards,  product developers and testing labs. CSD’s project team  contributes to the development of biometric standards  and leads the InterNational Committee for Information  Technology Standards (INCITS) Technical Committee  M1 – Biometrics and International Organization for  Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical  Commission (IEC) Joint Technical Committee (JTC) 1  Subcommittee (SC) 37 – Biometrics standards bodies. The  CSD plans to continue this work in FY 2015.  The development of the two versions of the Biometric  Conformance Test Software (BioCTS) continued. “BioCTS  for ANSI/NIST” (which targets biometric transactions  based on the NIST SP 500-290, and SP 500-290 Revision  1 - Data Format for the Interchange of Fingerprint, Facial  & Other Biometric Information) received enhanced testing  features for XML files, as well as updates to begin supporting  the revision of SP 500-290; for more information see:  http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/ansi_standard.cfm. “BioCTS  for ISO/IEC” (which targets several ISO/IEC biometric data  interchange formats and profiles) received updates to add  additional conformance test suites (CTSs) for selected  PIV Profiles of biometric data formats (as specified in  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fisma http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/ansi_standard.cfm  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  1 8  SP 800-76-2), as well as support for ISO/IEC 19794-4:2011  Amendment 2, which is an XML encoding for the finger  image data format. The latest versions of BioCTS were  released in September 2014, together with documentation  and sample data.  Intensive research was performed to study the  feasibility of implementing the existing conformance- testing tools within a cloud-computing setting. This  research was conducted on an Apache Hadoop platform,  investigating implementation requirements, benefits and  potential applications for biometric conformance testing.  To progress the work beyond the original goal of research,  the development of a solution was performed, resulting  in a working implementation of an existing CSD BioCTS  CTS (developed in Microsoft C#) being incorporated into  a Linux and Java-based Apache Hadoop MapReduce  job. This work successfully overcame several initial  implementation problems, and resulted in a release package  and methodology for using BioCTS software in Apache  Hadoop (for more information on Apache Hadoop see:  https://hadoop.apache.org/). The process, problems,  and methods used to overcome them were presented  at Global Identity Summit 2014. BioCTS Web, an  ASP.NET Web application that runs existing BioCTS  CTSs, was updated to support more testing suites.  For more information on BioCTS in the Cloud, see:  http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/biometrics/biocts_cloud.cfm.  Figure 2: BioCTS in the Cloud  In addition to the conformance test tools, additional  supporting tools were developed and released to benefit  users of the test tools.  They include a Data Extractor, which  allows users to extract data from an ANSI/NIST-ITL formatted  file; a Directory Hash Summary program, which allows users  to generate a SHA-256 hash value for every file within the a  given directory recursively; and enhanced statistical features  within BioCTS for both versions of BioCTS.  In addition,  advanced editing features were incorporated in BioCTS for  ANSI/NIST.  Figure 3: Biometric Conformance  Test Software by CSD  The BioCTS software installer files, as well the ancillary  tools and sample data can be downloaded from: http://www. nist.gov/itl/csd/biometrics/biocta_download.cfm.  A number of technical contributions towards the  development of ANSI/NIST and international standards  were submitted. They included technical contributions on  international biometric data interchange formats and their  associated conformance testing methodologies, as well  as on the SP 500-290 Revision 1 and the associated NIEM  XML Schema. A member of the project team, Dylan Yaga,  CSD, received the INCITS Standards Service Award for his  technical excellence, performance and dedication towards  supporting the development of biometric standards.  (Further details of Dylan’s award is located in the Honors  and Awards section of this annual report - page 77.)  Outreach efforts in FY 2014 in support of biometric  standards development and conformity assessment  included contributions on the test tools to the standards  developers (in support of ongoing development projects),  and presentations on ANSI/NIST and international biometric  standards and related conformity assessment activities.  The  work included the development of technical publications,  https://hadoop.apache.org/ http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/biometrics/biocts_cloud.cfm http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/biometrics/biocta_download.cfm http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/biometrics/biocta_download.cfm  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  1 9  the review of research papers for external publications, and  participation in conference program committees.  This effort  included participation in the program development of the  Global Identity Summit conference (previously the Biometric  Consortium Conferences), which was held September 16- 18, 2014, in Tampa, Florida. The conference included nearly  1500 attendees from 30 countries representing government,  industry, and academia.  NIST’s CSD supported a booth at  the conference’s technical exposition and a member of the  project team (Dylan Yaga) presented material regarding  the conformance test tool development project.

CSD remained committed to the value of  communicating its R&D efforts to other federal colleagues  and identifying the opportunities to support R&D efforts  throughout the Federal Government.  In FY 2014, the NITRD Cyber Security and Information  Assurance (CSIA) Interagency Working Group (IWG)  monthly meetings provided an opportunity to learn and  share information about ongoing research related to the  themes and thrusts expressed in the Strategic Plan for the  Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development. NIST’s  CSD briefed the IWG on initiatives in privacy engineering,  combinatorial testing, android application testing, cyber- physical systems, big data, the National Initiative for  Cybersecurity Education (NICE), and usability.  With the NITRD CSIA Senior Steering Group, CSD  participated in the dialogue and planning that resulted  in the creation of the National Privacy Research Forum to  address concerns about privacy that were voiced in recent  President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology  (PCAST) reports and to develop a strategic plan for privacy  R&D in FY 2015.  CSD is also a regular participant in the coordination  activities of the federal Special Cyber Operations  Research and Engineering (SCORE) Committee. SCORE  enables technology transfer through the sharing of NIST  cybersecurity expertise and output. The SCORE committee  interacts with federal leaders and reports to the National  Science & Technology Council’s Committee on Homeland &  National Security.

HAVA established the Election  Assistance Commission (EAC) and the Technical Guidelines  Development Committee (TGDC), chaired by the Director of  NIST. HAVA directs NIST to provide technical support to the  EAC and TGDC in efforts related to human factors, security,  and laboratory accreditation. As part of NIST’s efforts,  CSD supports the activities of the EAC related to voting  equipment security.  In the past year, NIST continued to support the EAC in  finalizing changes to the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines  (VVSG) 1.1. The security guidelines were updated in FY 2012  to improve the auditability of voting systems, to provide  greater software integrity protections, to expand and  improve access-control requirements, and to help ensure  http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/biometrics/biocta_download.cfm  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  2 0  that cryptographic security mechanisms are implemented  properly.

The team worked with the TDCG’s  UOCAVA Working Group to develop a risk analysis on the  technologies used in current UOCAVA voting processes,  including vote-by-mail, online voter registration, electronic  ballot delivery, and online ballot marking.  Finally, CSD began working with NIST’s Systems and  Software Division (SSD) to explore applying software  assurance concepts to electronic voting systems. The  initial work in this area applies the Common Weakness  Enumeration (CWE) list of software weaknesses to voting  systems. The CWE was used to assist in the categorization  of reported vulnerabilities within voting voting-system  security security-analysis reports. Additionally, the  vulnerabilities within the CWE are being mapped to the  Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG)—both the  current and upcoming standard.  Proposed plans for FY 2015, NIST will continue  researching the applicability of software assurance concepts  to electronic voting systems and continue to support  efforts to improve the voting process for UOCAVA voters.  Additionally, CSD will continue security research efforts to  support future standards development efforts, particularly  in the areas of risks to voting systems and innovative  voting system architectures.  http://vote.nist.gov  CONTACTS: Mr. Andrew Regenscheid  Mr. Joshua Franklin  (301) 975-5155  (301) 975-8463  andrew.regenscheid@nist.gov joshua.franklin@nist.gov  H E A LT H  I N F O R M AT I O N  T E C H N O L O G Y  S E C U R I T Y  Health Information Technology (HIT) enables better  patient care through the secure use and sharing of health  information. HIT leads to improvements in healthcare  quality, reduced medical errors, increased efficiencies in care  delivery and administration, and improved  population health. Central to reaching these goals  is the assurance of the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of health information. CSD works with  government, industry, academia, and others to provide  security tools, technologies, and methodologies that provide  for the security and privacy of health information.  NIST CSD continued its HIT security outreach efforts in  FY 2014. NIST and the Department of Health and Human  Services’ (DHHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) co-hosted  the seventh annual HIPAA Security Rule conference,  Safeguarding Health Information: Building Assurance  through HIPAA Security, in September 2014 in Washington,  D.C. The conference offered important sessions that  focused on broad topics of interest to the healthcare  and health IT security community. Over 600 in-person  and virtual attendees from federal, state, and local  governments, academia, HIPAA-covered entities and  business associates, industry groups, and vendors heard  from, and interacted with, healthcare, security, and  privacy experts on technologies and methodologies  for safeguarding health information and for implementing  the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule. Presentations  and panel discussions covered a variety of security  management and technical assurance topics, including:  •  Updates on the OCR audit and enforcement programs;  •  Use of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework in the  healthcare sector;  •  Safeguarding data using cryptographic technologies  and strong identity and access management;  •  Strategies for engaging the executive leadership to  privacy and security risks; and  •  Case studies on safeguarding patient information, and  lessons learned for health data breaches.  Keynote addresses were delivered by Darren Dworkin,  Senior Vice President of Enterprise Information Systems  and Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Cedars-Sinai Health  System, and Daniel Solove, the John Marshall Harlan Research  Professor of Law at the George Washington University Law  School.  In FY 2015, NIST CSD will continue to work with diverse  healthcare stakeholders, including partners in government  and industry, to identify opportunities to strengthen  the sector’s cybersecurity risk management efforts by  using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. As part of its  continued outreach efforts, NIST CSD also plans to co- host the eighth annual Safeguarding Health Information  conference with OCR.  http://www.nist.gov/healthcare/security/  CONTACT: Mr. Kevin Stine  (301) 975-4483  kevin.stine@nist.gov  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  2 1  S U P P LY- C H A I N  R I S K  M A N A G E M E N T  ( S C R M )  F O R  I N F O R M AT I O N  A N D  C O M M U N I C AT I O N S  T E C H N O L O G Y  ( I C T )  Information and communication technologies (ICT)  rely on a complex, globally distributed, and interconnected  supply-chain ecosystem that is long, has geographically  diverse routes, and consists of multiple tiers of outsourcing.  In addition, Federal Government information systems have  rapidly expanded in terms of capability and number, with  an increased reliance on outsourcing and commercially  available products.  These trends have caused federal departments and  agencies to have a lack of visibility and understanding  throughout the supply chain of how the technology being  acquired is developed, integrated and deployed, as well as  the processes, procedures, and practices used to assure the  integrity, security, resilience, and quality of the products and  services. This lack of visibility and understanding, in turn,  has decreased the control that federal departments and  agencies have with regard to the decisions impacting the  inherited risks traversing the supply chain and the ability  to effectively manage those risks. Figure 4 (below) shows  how ICT supply-chain risk may be derived from adversarial  or non-adversarial threats, as well as external or internal  vulnerabilities. The likelihood of an event and the potential  impact of an event are also key factors.  This project seeks to provide federal agencies with a  standardized, repeatable, and feasible toolkit of technical  and intelligence resources to strategically manage supply- chain risk throughout the entire lifecycle of systems,  products and services.  In FY 2014, CSD reviewed and addressed comments  from the initial public draft of SP 800-161, Supply Chain Risk  Management Practices for Federal Information Systems  and Organizations. This document provides guidance to  federal departments and agencies on identifying, assessing,  and mitigating ICT supply-chain risks at all levels in their  organizations and utilizes and builds on existing guidance in  Figure 4: ICT Supply Chain Risk  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  2 2  the unified information security framework. A second public  draft of the document was published in June 2014.  In June 2014, the University of Maryland Supply Chain  Management Center of the R. H. Smith School of Business  completed the fourth phase of a multi-year research project  through a NIST grant awarded in 2013. Previous phases of  the project resulted in the development of a Cyber Risk  Portal where users can conduct ICT supply-chain risk self- assessments and gain access to a number of resources. This  phase of the project deployed wide-scale testing of the  portal and made improvements to the security infrastructure  and applications.  NIST awarded the University of Maryland Supply Chain  Management Center an additional grant in 2014 to define an  effective engagement model that will enable representatives  of stakeholder organizations to come together in person  and online to learn how to map and manage their critical  ICT supply-chain risks using the portal-based tool set. The  project will be completed in April 2015.  In FY 2015, CSD will:  • Publish SP 800-161;  •  Research and develop tools and guidance to help  agencies effectively conduct criticality analysis and  other aspects needed to manage supply-chain risk;  •  Continue to co-chair Working Group 2 of the White  House’s Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initia- tive (CNCI) 11, Develop a Multi-Pronged Approach for  Global Supply Chain Risk Management; and  •  Begin researching best practices and developing an  organizational strategy for supply-chain risk manage- ment in response to the NIST Roadmap for Improving  Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.

One portion of this  legislation calls for the establishment of a nationwide,  interoperable public-safety broadband network based on  the 3rd Generation Partnership Project’s (3GPP) Long-Term  Evolution (LTE) technology. The network will be deployed  and operated by the First Responder Network Authority  (FirstNet). The planned National Public Safety Broadband  Network (NPSBN) will “create a much needed nationwide  interoperable broadband network that will help police,  firefighters, emergency medical service professionals  and other public safety officials stay safe and do their  jobs.”(http://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/public-safety).  NIST is directed to establish a list of certified devices and  required components to be used by public safety officials,  vendors, and other interested parties for interacting with  the nationwide network. NIST is also directed to conduct  research and development that supports the acceleration  and advancement of the nationwide network.  In FY 2014, CSD supported the joint National  Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)  and NIST Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR)  program (http://www.pscr.gov) with efforts in public-safety  mobile-application security, identity management, and  enabling cybersecurity capabilities on the PSCR 700 MHz  LTE demonstration network located in Boulder, Colorado.  In February 2014, CSD, in cooperation with the Association  of Public-Safety Communications Officials (APCO)  International and FirstNet, held a half-day workshop  titled “Public Safety Mobile Application Security  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  2 3  Requirements”. The outcome of that workshop is captured  in Draft NISTIR 8018, Public Safety Mobile Application  Security Requirements Workshop Summary. At PSRC’s  Annual Public Safety Broadband Stakeholder Conference  in June 2014, CSD organized and moderated a panel titled  “Mobile Applications Security for Public Safety”.  CSD developed Draft NISTIR 8014, Considerations for  Identity Management in Public Safety Mobile Networks,  that provides a brief introduction to identity management,  summarizes existing guidance (including OMB-04- 04, E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies;  Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD12):  Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal  Employees and Contractors; and NIST SP 800-63-2,  Electronic Authentication Guideline), and describes possible  identity tokens/credentials that could be supported by  mobile devices.  CSD participated in the standards development process  for LTE technology within the 3rd Generation Partnership  Project (3GPP) supporting security requirements for public  safety that are related to Proximity Services (ProSe), Group  Communication System Enablers (GCSE), and Mission  Critical Push-To-Talk (MCPTT). In addition, CSD broadened  its scope within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)  to include efforts related to public safety.  In FY 2015, CSD will continue representing public safety  in international standardization efforts, such as the IETF  and 3GPP. CSD will work to implement and exercise  cybersecurity capabilities in the PSCR 700 MHz LTE  demonstration network, conduct research into mobile  authentication solutions to support the different public- safety disciplines, and investigate mobile application- security services to support the security requirements of  public-safety mobile applications. CSD will continue to  engage the public-safety communications community by  organizing workshops and conferences; and participating  in events such as APCO’s Annual Meeting, PSRC’s Annual  Public Safety Broadband Stakeholder Conference, and the  International Wireless Communications Expo (IWCE).

CPS is commonly used in the nation’s critical  infrastructure and includes systems in the electric grid,  manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation sectors.  Composed of heterogeneous, potentially distributed  components and systems, CPS provides a promise of  increased efficiency and interaction between the digital  and physical worlds. However, assuring that these emerging  and evolving systems are reliable, robust, resilient,  trustworthy, secure, and that they protect the privacy of  information poses a unique cybersecurity challenge.  CPS present unique challenges, including the need  for integration with legacy components and allowance for  emerging technologies, and real-time response in support  of extremely high availability, predictability, and reliability.  Cybersecurity is an important crosscutting discipline that  is critical to the safe and resilient design, development  and operation of CPS. Addressing the opportunities  and challenges of CPS requires a broad collaboration to  develop a common foundation to work from, including a  consensus definition, vocabulary, reference architecture,  and a shared understanding of the essential roles of timing,  cybersecurity and data interoperability. CSD is researching  the cybersecurity needs of the broader landscape of CPS,  by leveraging CSD’s expertise in cybersecurity in different  domains and applications of CPS (such as industrial control  systems, smart grid, hardware-enabled security, and  embedded systems).  In June 2014, NIST established the CPS Public Working  Group (PWG), which is open to all, to foster and capture  inputs from those involved in CPS, both nationally and  globally. CSD is working in collaboration with NIST’s  Engineering Laboratory (EL) Smart Grid and Cyber-Physical  Systems Program Office, NIST’s Physical Measurement  Laboratory Time and Frequency Division, ITL’s Software  and Systems Division and ITL’s Advanced Networking  Technologies Division to lead a public-private working group  of government, academia, and industry stakeholders. The  CPS PWG consists of five technical subgroups:  • Definition, Vocabulary, and Reference Architecture;  • Use Cases;  • Cybersecurity and Privacy;  • Data Interoperability; and  • Timing and Synchronization.  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  2 4  Each subgroup consists of co-leads from academia,  industry and NIST. CSD co-leads the Cybersecurity and  Privacy subgroup focused on identifying strategies  for cybersecurity and privacy in CPS, and will work  collaboratively with the other subgroups to ensure that  cybersecurity is included as a design principle during  development.  In 2015, the CPS PWG will publish an integrated  Framework that includes the work of the five technical  subgroups and begin work on a CPS Technology Roadmap,  which will identify opportunities for a coordinated effort  on key technical challenges. The CPS PWG deliverables will  be technology and business-model neutral, and freely  available online and intended for open use by all stakeholders.  Additionally, in 2015, CSD, in conjunction with NIST’s  Engineering Laboratory, Intelligent Systems Division, will  finalize SP 800-82 Revision 2, Guide to Industrial Control  Systems Security. CSD will also continue to participate in the  International Society of Automation (ISA) 99 Committee,  which develops and establishes standards, recommended  practices, technical reports, and related information that  define procedures for implementing electronically secure  industrial automation and control systems and security  practices, and for assessing electronic security performance.  http://www.nist.gov/cps/ http://www.nist.gov/cps/cpspwg.cfm  CONTACTS: Ms. Victoria Yan Pillitteri  Ms. Suzanne Lightman  (301) 975-8542  (301) 975-6442  victoria.pillitteri@nist.gov  suzanne.lightman@nist.gov  S M A R T  G R I D  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  Figure 5: Smart Meter  The major elements of the smart grid are: information  technology, industrial control systems/operational  technology, and the communications infrastructure. The  infrastructure is used to send command information across  the electric grid from generation to distribution systems, and  to exchange usage and billing information between utilities  and their customers. Key to the successful deployment  of the smart grid infrastructure is the development of the  cybersecurity strategy that includes cybersecurity as a  design consideration for new and emerging systems, and  an approach to adding cybersecurity into existing systems.  The electric grid is critical to the economic and physical well- being of the nation, and emerging cyber threats targeting  power systems highlight the need to integrate advanced  security to protect critical assets.  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  2 5  The Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP) became a  membership-supported organization in January 2013. The  SGIP Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG) was renamed  the Smart Grid Cybersecurity Committee (SGCC), and  continues to be led by a NIST representative in support of  responsibilities identified in the Energy Independence and  Security Act of 2007. The SGCC chair is a voting member of  the SGIP Technical Committee, and serves as an ex-officio  Director of the Board. In addition, the SGIP SGCC continues  to include additional leadership by a management team  comprised of three volunteer vice-chairs (representing the  Department of Energy (DOE), an electric utility, and a smart  grid vendor) and a volunteer secretariat.  In 2014, the SGCC contributed to the update of NISTIR  7628 Revision 1, Guidelines for Smart Grid Cybersecurity,  which was published in September, following a public  comment period and comment resolution by the  SGCC members. The revision updates and expands the  development strategy, cryptography and key management,  privacy, vulnerability classes, research and development  topics, standards review, and key power-system use cases  to reflect changes in the smart grid environment since  2010. In addition to the revision of NISTIR 7628, the SGCC  have focused on developing documents to be published  through SGIP on cybersecurity risk management, a User’s  Guide for NISTIR 7628, cloud computing for the smart grid,  and a mapping between NISTIR 7628 and the Framework  for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. Work in  these areas is completed through SGCC subgroups, which  are created and disbanded on an as-needed basis.  The SGCC also continues to support the SGIP Catalog  of Standards (CoS), a compendium of standards, practices,  guidelines and other technical documents considered  relevant for the development of a robust, secure, and  interoperable smart grid. Through the ongoing efforts of the  SGCC, these documents are reviewed for cybersecurity, and  recommendations are made for including cybersecurity in  future revisions and in the implementation of the standards.  CSD supports the SGCC in assessing the security of the  cryptographic methods used in these standards, practices,  guidelines, and other technical documents. In many cases,  the standards bodies have taken the results of the reviews  and modified the standards or documents to address NIST  recommendations. The SGCC has worked closely with some  of the standards bodies to ensure that the recommendations  are interpreted correctly and that the mitigation strategies  selected meet the intent of the NISTIR 7628 high-level  security requirements. The result is cybersecurity “baked-in”  to the standards, rather than “bolted-on” after the standard  is implemented.  Future activities include working with the SGIP  Committees, Domain Expert Working Groups, and Priority  Action Plans to integrate cybersecurity into their work  efforts. Additionally, the SGIP SGCC will continue to  collaborate with industry, academia, other working groups,  and government agencies to address the cybersecurity  needs for the smart grid.  In FY 2015, CSD will continue to support the SGCC  in the evaluation of the cryptographic methods used  in standards, practices, guidelines, and other technical  documents for inclusion in the SGIP CoS. In addition to the  SGIP SGCC activities, CSD will also coordinate with NIST’s  Engineering Laboratory (EL) and Smart Grid Program Office  on the development of a Cybersecurity Smart Grid Test  Lab, part of the NIST Smart Grid Testbed Facility now under  construction. CSD will also collaborate with ITL’s Software  and Systems Division on cybersecurity research in relation  to the IEEE 1588, Precision Time Protocol, a standard on time  synchronization that is used for the electric grid and other  special-purpose industrial automation and measurement  networks.  http://www.nist.gov/smartgrid  http://www.sgip.org  CONTACTS: Ms. Victoria Yan Pillitteri  Ms. Tanya Brewer  (301) 975-8542  (301) 975-4534  victoria.pillitteri@nist.gov  tbrewer@nist.gov  Mr. Quynh Dang  (301) 975-3610  qdang@nist.gov  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  AWA R E N E S S ,  T R A I N I N G ,  E D U C AT I O N ,  A N D  O U T R E A C H  National  Init iat ive for  Cybersecurity  Education (NICE)  NIST has been the lead for the National Initiative for  Cybersecurity Education (NICE) since its inception in 2010.  NICE is responsive to President Obama’s declaration that  the “cyber threat is one of the most serious economic  and national security challenges we face as a nation” and  “America’s economic prosperity in the 21st century will  depend on cybersecurity.”  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  2 6  NICE is an initiative that enhances the overall  cybersecurity posture of the United States by accelerating  the availability of educational and training resources  designed to improve the cybersecurity skills, and knowledge  of our nation’s students and workforce.  NIST’s CSD is leading the NICE initiative working from  the strengths and energy of more than 20 federal  departments and agencies leveraging each of their  relationships with academia and industry sectors to ensure  coordination, cooperation, focus, public engagement,  technology transfer and sustainability. NIST will highlight  these activities, engage various stakeholder groups and  create forums for sharing information and leveraging best  practices.  CSD is home to the NIST NICE Leadership Team that  focuses on the following activities:  •  Developing planning documents and building consen- sus on the strategy and implementation activities of  NICE;  •  Utilizing a newly established public-private working  group to make progress towards NICE’s goals;  •  Promoting the use of data-driven initiatives within  NICE;  •  Facilitating cross-functional cooperation among federal  departments and agencies by coordinating meetings,  facilitating discussions, and disseminating information;  •  Promoting the initiative and its efforts by representing  NICE and speaking at cybersecurity events nationwide;  •  Planning and hosting an annual workshop to promote  and support the evolving issues in cybersecurity work- force and education; and  •  Coordinating with other federal initiatives and efforts  related to NICE.  The NICE leadership team attended many events,  symposia, forums, competitions, educational outreach  meetings, and workshops to promote the activities within  NICE. The team continued its leadership of the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM) Cross-Agency Priority  Goal: “Closing Skills Gap” for IT/Cybersecurity focused on  reducing cybersecurity workforce gaps and supported the  goals of the White House’s Ready to Work initiative.  In FY 2015, CSD will continue to promote the  coordination of existing and future cybersecurity education,  training, and workforce activities. The Fifth annual NICE  Workshop will take place on November 5-6, 2014 in  Columbia, Maryland (http://csrc.nist.gov/nice/events.html).  The CSD will also identify opportunities to extend and  integrate the NICE  focus on cybersecurity workforce,  education, and training within NIST Special Publications  and informational reports while promoting the value of  the National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NCWF)  and the forthcoming Department of Defense Cyberspace  Workforce Strategy as resources that address cybersecurity  workforce needs.  http://www.nist.gov/nice/  CONTACTS: Mr. Bill Newhouse  Dr. Ernest McDuffie (retired)  NICE Program Manager  FY 2014 NICE Lead  (301) 975-2869  william.newhouse@nist.gov  Computer  Security Resource Center  (CSRC)  The CSRC, CSD’s website, is one of the most visited  websites at NIST. CSRC encourages the broad sharing  of information security tools and practices, provides a  resource for information security standards and guidelines,  and identifies and links key security web resources to  support industry and government users. CSRC is an  integral component of all of the work that CSD conducts  and produces. It is CSD’s repository for anyone wanting to  access these documents and other valuable security-related  information. During FY 2014, CSRC had more than 54 million  page views and downloads.

Publications  are organized to help users locate relevant information  quickly and are arranged by topic, relevant security control  family, and legal requirements.  In addition to CSRC, CSD maintains a publication  announcement mailing list. This free e-mail list notifies  subscribers about publications that have been posted to the  CSRC website, along with announcing new CSD-sponsored  events and important news or announcements. The e-mail  list is a valuable tool for more than 56 000 subscribers from  the Federal Government, industry, academia, and individuals  with a personal interest in IT security worldwide. Individuals  who are interested in subscribing to this list should visit  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/subscribe.html for more  information.  During FY 2014, the CSRC underwent what the CSD  terms as “Quick Fixes” to the CSRC website. These “Quick  Fixes” will improve the overall navigation experience on  CSRC. The CSRC homepage was streamlined by providing  hot topics (these hot topics are the most popular projects/ programs that have webpages), updated references in  the Useful Resources section, and an improved News and  Events section. The homepage was condensed to reduce  the amount of scrolling on the page. Another improvement  made to the CSRC website was the dropdown menus,  which appear on all pages. In previous years, the division’s  projects/programs listings were placed under the division’s  group layout. Now, the projects/programs listings are under  their own category (Ex. Education & Outreach category, a  project falling under this category: Small and Medium-Sized  Business (SMB) Outreach). The CSRC team created an A to  Z listing of the webpages for all of CSD’s projects/programs  in order to ease the finding of a particular area.  Plans for FY 2015 for the CSRC website will include  moving the CSRC website to a content management system  (CMS). Moving to a CMS is expected to improve the website’s  functionality.  Questions on the website can be sent to the CSRC  Webmaster at: webmaster-csrc@nist.gov.

The  Forum, which serves more than 1100 members, strives to  provide an ongoing opportunity for managers of federal  information security programs to exchange information  security materials in a timely manner, build upon the  experiences of other programs, and reduce possible  duplication of effort. It provides a mechanism for NIST to  share information directly with federal agency information  security program managers in fulfillment of NIST’s  leadership mandate under FISMA. It assists NIST in  establishing and maintaining relationships with other  individuals or organizations that are actively addressing  information security issues within the Federal Government.  NIST’s CSD serves as the Secretariat of the Forum, providing  necessary administrative and logistical support. Patricia Toth  serves as the Chairperson.  The Forum maintains an extensive email subscription  service. Participation in the service is only open to Federal  Government employees who participate in the management  of their organization’s information system security  program. The Forum also holds bimonthly meetings and an  annual two-day conference to discuss current issues and  developments of interest to those responsible for protecting  sensitive (unclassified) federal systems.  Topics of discussion at Forum meetings in FY 2014  included briefings from various federal agencies on  Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Implementation  Activities, Cross Agency Priority (CAP) Goals, Automated  Assessment Practicals, Automated Assessment Concepts  Supporting Information Security Continuous Monitoring  (ISCM), NIST’s Role in Ongoing Assessments, Ongoing  Authorization Clarifying and Amplifying Guidance, and the  National Cybersecurity Framework.  This year’s annual two-day offsite meeting featured  updates on the computer security activities of the  Government Accountability Office (GAO), General Services  Administration (GSA), Bureau of the Fiscal Service,  Department of State, National Security Council, Department  of Homeland Security (DHS), and NIST. Technical sessions  included briefings on updates from NIST Computer Security  Division (CSD), FedRAMP Overview and Security Processes,  Supply Chain Risk Management, Ongoing Authorization,  Fiscal Service’s Risk-Based ISCM Strategy, Derived PIV  Credentials, Cybersecurity Training, Incident Response,  White House Initiatives, FY 2015 FISMA Metrics and recent  updates to the FISMA publications.  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/subscribe.html  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  2 8  The Forum plays a valuable role in helping NIST and  other federal agencies to develop and maintain a strong,  proactive stance in the identification and resolution of new  strategic and tactical IT security issues as they emerge.

FISSEA strives to elevate the general level of information  system security knowledge for the Federal Government and  the federal workforce. It also seeks to assist the professional  development of its members.  FISSEA membership is open to information system  security professionals, professional trainers and educators,  and managers responsible for information system security  training programs in federal agencies, as well as contractors  of these agencies and faculty members of accredited  educational institutions who are involved in information  security training and education. To become a FISSEA  member; all that is required is a willingness to share  products, information, and experiences. A working group  meets monthly to administer business activities.  FISSEA maintains a website, a mailing list, and  participates in a social networking site as a means of  communication for its members. NIST’s CSD assists FISSEA  with its operations by providing staff support for several of  its activities and by being FISSEA’s host agency.  FISSEA membership in 2014 spanned federal agencies,  industry, military, contractors, state governments, academia,  the press, and foreign organizations in a total of ten countries.  The 700 federal agency members represent 89 agencies  from the executive and legislative branches of government.  The 27th Annual FISSEA Conference occurred March  18-20, 2014, at NIST. Approximately 180 information system  security professionals and trainers attended from federal  agencies, academia, and industry.  This year’s theme was, “Partners in Performance:  Shaping the Future of Cybersecurity Awareness, Education,  and Training.” The program team solicited presentations that  reflected current projects, trends, and future initiatives in  federal security programs. Attendees gained new techniques  for developing/conducting training, cost-effective practices,  workforce development, free resources and contacts, as  well as an update on National Initiative for Cybersecurity  Education (NICE) activities.  Keynote presentations were given by: Dr. Ron Ross,  NIST Fellow, CSD; Ambassador  Karen Kornbluh, Executive  Vice President of External Affairs for Nielsen, former U.S.  Ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development (OECD); and Ms. Linda Cureton, Chief  Executive Officer and Founder of Muse Technologies, Inc.  (former NASA CIO).  Presenters represented NIST, DHS, DOS, NSA, NASA,  IRS, private industry and academia. Attendees had an  opportunity to visit fifteen vendors on the second day. A  Government Best Practice Poster and Demonstration session  was held on the third day, which provided an opportunity for  agencies to share and tell about their specific awareness and  2014 FISSEA Educator of the Year Award:  Sam Maroon, FITSI Foundation / Wounded Warrior  Cyber Combat Academy  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  2 9  training programs. In addition, there was a panel discussion  of former FISSEA Educator of the Year recipients - influential  leaders who have demonstrated a superior level of expertise,  effectiveness, and dedication to the advancement of  the information system security awareness, training and  education profession. They discussed their best and worst  ideas for improving cybersecurity programs, shared  significant activities, and answered questions.  The FISSEA Educator of the Year Award was  established to recognize and honor a contemporary who is  making special efforts to create, build, manage, or inspire  an information system security awareness, training, or  education program. This year’s Educator of the Year award  was presented to Sam Maroon, Federal IT Security Institute  (FITSI) Foundation/ Wounded Warrior Cyber Combat  Academy. The nomination letter recommending him for this  award made the following statements: “Mr. Maroon deserves  this award for his unflagging work supporting this country’s  injured servicemen and women in transitioning them to  the cyber battlefield through the Wounded Warrior Cyber  Combat Academy. … He has donated at least 300 hours  of his own personal time…” The full nomination letters are  posted on the FISSEA website.  FISSEA conference events also included announcing the  winners of FISSEA contests and awarding prize drawings.  The FISSEA Security Awareness, Training & Education  Contest includes five categories from one of FISSEA’s  three key areas of Awareness, Training, and Education.  The winner is selected from each category and awarded a  certificate. The categories include: (1) awareness poster, (2)  motivational item (e.g., pens, stress relief items, t-shirts), (3)  awareness website, (4) awareness newsletter, and (5) role- based training & education.

Attendee networking is a valuable benefit of attending  the FISSEA conference. The conference continues to be  a valuable forum in which individuals from government,  industry, and academia who are involved with information  systems/cybersecurity workforce development (awareness,  training, education, certification, and professionalization)  learn of ongoing and planned training and education  programs and initiatives. It provides NIST the opportunity  to provide assistance to departments and agencies as they  work to meet their FISMA responsibilities.  The 2015 FISSEA conference is planned for March 24-25,  2015, at NIST.  http://csrc.nist.gov/fissea  fisseamembership@nist.gov  CONTACTS: Ms. Patricia Toth  Ms. Peggy Himes  (301) 975-5140  (301) 975-2489  patricia.toth@nist.gov peggy.himes@nist.gov  Information Security and Privacy  Advisory Board (ISPAB)  The Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board  (ISPAB) is a federal advisory committee with specific  statutory objectives to identify emerging managerial,  technical, administrative, and physical safeguard issues  related to information security and privacy.  The Board  was originally created by the Computer Security Act of  1987 (P.L. 100-235) as the Computer System Security and  Privacy Advisory Board (CSSPAB) within the Department  of Commerce. The CSSPAB was chartered in May 1988 in  accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act,  as amended, 5 U.S.C., App. In December 2002, Public  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  3 0  Law 107-347, The E-Government Act of 2002, Title III, The  Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of  2002, Section 21 of the National Institute of Standards and  Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278g-4) amended the statutory  authority of the Board and renamed it the Information  Security and Privacy Advisory Board.  Since the inception of this Advisory Board in 1987, ISPAB  successfully renewed its charter with proper authority every  two years. The legislative history for Public Law 100-235 and  Public Law 107-347 underscores that Congress intended that  the Board be a continuing body. The Board plays a central  and unique role in providing the government with expert  advice concerning information security and privacy issues  that may affect federal information systems. No other similar  group of experts meets regularly to review information  security issues involved in unclassified Federal Government  computer systems and networks. Also, Title III of the  E-Government Act of 2002 reaffirmed the need for this  Board by giving it additional responsibilities: to thoroughly  review all of the proposed information technology standards  and guidelines developed under Section 20 of the National  Institute of Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278g-3),  as amended.  Congress indicated the long-term need for the Board by  setting the term of Board members at a minimum of four  years. The charter (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/ documents/ispab_charter_2014-2016.pdf) requires that the  NIST Director appoint the Chairman and all twelve members  of the Board. They are selected for their preeminence in the  information technology industry or related disciplines.  The Charter also stipulates that Board members be  selected from three main categories, with each category  providing four members. Category 1 includes members  from outside the Federal Government who are eminent in  the information technology industry, at least one of whom  is representative of small or medium-sized companies in  such industries. Category 2 also includes members from  outside the Federal Government and not employed by or  representative of a producer of information, but who are  eminent in the field of information technology, or related  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/documents/ispab_charter_2014-2016.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/documents/ispab_charter_2014-2016.pdf  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  3 1  disciplines. Category 3 includes experienced information  system managers from the Federal Government, including  those with experience in information security and privacy,  at least one of whom should be from the National Security  Agency. The categorization of Board members is intended  to meet ISPAB’s statutory objectives. Federal members  bring a detailed understanding of the federal processing  environment; industry brings concerns and experiences  regarding product development and market formation,  while private computer security experts are able to bring  their experiences of commercial cost-effective security  measures into Board discussion.  Presently, the ISPAB Chairperson is Matt Thomlinson,  Senior Vice President, Microsoft Security, who assumed  the chair in October 2012. He is supported by the following  Board members:  •  Julie Boughn, (formerly from Center for Medicare &  Medicaid,  Innovation Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS));  • Christopher Boyer, AT&T;  • John Centafont, National Security Agency (NSA);  • David Cullinane, Security Starfish, LLC;  • Kevin Fu, The University of Michigan;  •  Gregory Garcia, Financial Services Sector Coordinating  Council (FSSCC);  •  Toby Levin, Retired (formerly from U.S. Department of  Homeland Security);  • Edward Roback, U.S. Department of Treasury;  • Gale Stone, Social Security Administration; and  • Peter Weinberger, Google, Inc.  During FY 2014, ISPAB held three meetings, all in  Washington D.C:  •  December 19-20, 2013 – this meeting was to replace  the meeting scheduled for October 10-12, 2013 that was  cancelled due to a government shutdown;  • March 12-14, 2014; and  • June 11-13, 2014.  During the December 2013 meeting, the Board  developed a FY 2014 work plan. The resulting plan included  the following areas of focus:  •  Coordination with Office of Management and Budget  (OMB), and other federal agencies, such as National  Security Agency (NSA) and U.S. Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), on all matters relating to  information security and privacy;  •  Cybersecurity technical transfer and implementation  interests, considering items of particular note to indi- vidual industry sectors;  •  Updates from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight  Board (PCLOB);  •  Updates from NIST’s CSD regarding cybersecurity and  cryptographic work;  •  Updates regarding embedded software security, in- cluding medical device security;  •  Considerations surrounding Trusted Internet Connec- tions, DHS Enhanced Cybersecurity Services (ECS) and  special needs for critical infrastructures;  •  Procurement and requirements to reduce supply-chain  risk;  •  Cross-Agency Priority Goals (CAP Goals) for cyberse- curity;  •  Information sharing with a focus on information securi- ty and privacy;  •  Updates regarding FISMA, the related security controls  (SP 800-53), and FedRAMP; and  • Updates of other critical NIST publications.  In addition to the work-plan focus areas, the Board also  considered the following topics during FY 2014:  • Internet of Things (IOT);  • Cryptography and NIST Cryptography processes;  •  Transportation Sector and Vehicle-to-Vehicle Commu- nication;  •  GAO reports relating to information security and priva- cy;  • Big Data and Privacy;  • Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Program;  •  Federal Cloud Credential Exchange (FCCX) and the  NSTIC; and  •  National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE)  Updates.  The presenters at each Board meeting were leaders  and experts representing private industry; academia;  federal agency CIOs, IGs and CISOs.

A computer failure or system  breach could jeopardize the company’s reputation and may  result in significant damage and recovery cost or going  out of business. The small business owner who recognizes  the threat of computer crime and takes steps to deter  inappropriate activities is less likely to become a victim.  The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) reports  that over 27 million U.S. companies - more than 99 percent  of all U.S. businesses - are SMBs of 500 employees or fewer  (http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/allprofiles12.pdf).  While the threats to individual small and medium-size  businesses (SMBs) may not be significantly different from  those facing larger organizations, a SMB frequently has  fewer resources available to protect systems, detect attacks,  or respond to security issues. A vulnerability common to a  large percentage of SMBs could pose a threat to the nation’s  information infrastructure and economic base.  To help address information security risk, these  businesses require assistance with the identification of  security mechanisms and with practical, cost-effective  training. Training helps SMB’s use their limited resources  most effectively to address relevant and serious threats. In  response to this need, NIST, the SBA, and the Federal Bureau  of Investigation (FBI) co-sponsor a series of cybersecurity  training workshops for small businesses. These workshops  provide an overview of cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities,  and corresponding protective tools and techniques, with  a special emphasis on information that small business  personnel can apply directly.  In FY 2014, NIST, in collaboration with the FBI and the  SBA, focused on implementing a three-year renewal of the  co-sponsorship agreement that governs this cybersecurity  workshop outreach program.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/sbc/  CONTACT: Ms. Patricia Toth  301-975-5140  patricia.toth@nist.gov  (Editor Note: Mr. Richard Kissel led this program until his  recent retirement.)  C R Y P T O G R A P H I C  S TA N D A R D S  P R O G R A M  Hash Algorithms and the Secure Hash  Algorithm-3 (SHA-3) Standard (Draft  FIPS 202)  NIST opened a public competition in 2007 to develop a  new cryptographic hash algorithm, SHA-3, to augment the  hash algorithms specified in the Secure Hash Standard, FIPS  180-4. The competition ended on October 2, 2012 when NIST  announced the selection of KeccaK as the winning algorithm  for standardization as the new SHA-3 Standard. NIST  consulted with the KeccaK designers and the cryptographic  community, and then developed a SHA-3 standardization  plan, which was presented at numerous cryptography  conferences in 2013, and posted at the NIST hash website,  indicated below, for public feedback.  On May 28, 2014, NIST CSD announced Draft FIPS  202, SHA-3 Standard:  Permutation-Based Hash and  Extendable-Output Functions, in the Federal Register (79  FR 30549) and requested comments. The announcement  also proposed a revision of the Applicability Clause (#6)  of the Announcement Section of FIPS 180-4, Secure Hash  Standard, to allow the use of hash algorithms specified in  either FIPS 180-4 or FIPS 202 for federal applications that  require a cryptographic hash algorithm. The revision was  necessary because the original text in FIPS 180-4 mandates  the use of hash algorithms specified in FIPS 180-4 only. The  other sections of FIPS 180-4 remain unchanged. The ninety- day public comment period for Draft FIPS 202 and the  revision in FIPS 180-4 ended on August 26, 2014.  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  3 3  The CSD also hosted a SHA-3 workshop at the  University of California, Santa Barbara, on August 22, 2014  to obtain feedback on the proposed SHA-3 Standard, and  on additional modes of operation based on SHA-3 that are  being considered for standardization. Approximately 75  participants from around the world attended the workshop.  The CSD received much feedback throughout the  year, especially during the week of the workshop. Official  comments received on Draft FIPS 202 and on the revision  of the Applicability Clause of FIPS 180-4 are posted at  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/fips-202-public- comments-aug2014.html. CSD is in the process of addressing  these comments, and incorporating them, as appropriate, in  the final versions of FIPS 202 and FIPS 180-4, to be approved  by the Secretary of Commerce. NIST will announce the final  approval by the Secretary in the Federal Register.  Information about the SHA-3 standardization effort is  available at:  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/sha-3_ standardization.html.  CONTACT: Ms. Shu-jen Chang  (301) 975-2940  shu-jen.chang@nist.gov  Random Number Generation (RNG) Random numbers are required for the security for many  cryptographic algorithms. For example, random numbers  are used to generate the keys needed for encryption and  digital signature applications.  In the late 1990s, a project to develop more rigorous  requirements and specifications for random number  generation (RNG) was initiated in coordination with the  American National Standards Institute’s (ANSI) Accredited  Standards Committee (ASC) X9. The resulting standard  (American National Standard (ANS) X9.82) contains four  parts: Part 1 provides general information; Part 2, which is  nearing completion, will provide requirements for entropy  sources; Part 3 provides specifications for deterministic  random bit generator (DRBG) mechanisms; and Part 4  provides guidance on constructing random bit generators  (RBGs) from entropy sources and DRBG mechanisms.  In March 2007, CSD published SP 800-90,  Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using  Deterministic Random Bit Generators, which contained the  DRBG mechanisms in Part 3 of ANS X9.82, plus an additional  DRBG mechanism. This recommendation was revised as SP  800-90A in January 2012 to include additional capabilities  identified during the development of Part 4 of ANS X9.82.  In September 2013, articles from major news  organizations, based on leaked classified documents,  raised public concern that one of the DRBGs specified in  SP 800-90A could contain a backdoor, namely, the Dual_ EC_DRBG, which is based on the use of elliptic curves. This  weakness could allow attackers to successfully predict the  secret cryptographic keys that form the foundation for the  assurances provided by security products. CSD immediately  published an ITL Bulletin (September 2013, visit the CSRC ITL  Bulletins page http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsITLSB. html) that provided a high-level discussion of the issues,  reopened the SP 800-90 series of publications for public  comment, and recommended that the Dual_EC_DRBG no  longer be used, pending the resolution of the comments. In  April 2014, another public comment period was held on a  revision of SP 800-90A that removed the Dual_EC_DRBG  from the document. An additional public comment period  was held in late 2014 that included additional changes  suggested during the April 2014 comment period.  Two additional documents (SP 800-90B,  Recommendation for the Entropy Sources Used for  Random Bit Generation, and SP 800-90C, Recommendation  for Random Bit Generator (RBG) Constructions) are under  development, and the initial drafts were made available  for public comment in 2012. SP 800-90B addresses the  development and testing of entropy sources, including  descriptions of the validation tests for NIST’s Cryptographic  Algorithm Validation Program to validate candidate  entropy sources. SP 800-90C provides basic guidance on  the construction of RBGs from entropy sources and DRBG  mechanisms. These documents have undergone further  changes as a result of the public comments and discussions  with industry representatives. Updated drafts will be  provided for another public comment period in early FY  2015.

A block cipher  transforms some fixed-length binary data (i.e., a “block”)  into seemingly random data of the same length. The  transformation is determined by the choice of some secret  data called the “key.” The same key is used to reverse the  transformation and recover the original block of data. A  cryptographic technique that is constructed from a block  cipher is called a mode of operation.  NIST’s CSD is developing AES modes of operation for  format-preserving encryption (FPE), based on proposals  that were submitted from the private sector. A format  can be a sequence of decimal digits, such as a credit card  number or a social security number (SSN); formats can  also be defined for other sets of characters besides decimal  digits. FPE produces ciphertext with the same format as the  corresponding plaintext, so that, for example, an encrypted  SSN still looks like a valid SSN. FPE is expected to facilitate  the retrofitting of encryption to existing applications. For  example, FPE could be applied to database systems, so that  the sensitive data could be targeted for encryption without  disrupting the underlying data fields/pathways.  Draft SP 800-38G, Recommendation for Block Cipher  Modes of Operation: Methods for Format-Preserving  Encryption, which was released for public comment in July  2013, included three methods for FPE called FF1, FF2, and  FF3. These methods are modes of operation of the AES that  are intended to support a security strength of 128 bits or  more.  As part of the public review of Draft SP 800-38G and  as part of its routine consultation with other agencies, NIST  was advised by the National Security Agency that the FF2  mode in the draft could not support 128 bits of security  strength for some use cases. NIST independently confirmed  this assessment, and in June 2014, NIST’s CSD announced its  intention to remove FF2 from the document.  The FF2 mode was designed for the payment card  industry and submitted for NIST’s consideration in 2011 by  VeriFone Systems, Inc. NIST’s analysis does not imply any  practical vulnerability for the implementations of FF2 in  the payment card industry. Nevertheless, in order for FF2  to meet NIST’s security requirements for other potential  applications, VeriFone Systems, Inc. has indicated that it will  submit a revised proposal for NIST CSD to review. Meanwhile,  CSD expects to finalize SP 800-38G with FF1 and FF3 in FY  2015.

SP 800-56B, Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key  Establishment Schemes Using Integer Factorization  Cryptography, was first published in August 2009. This  publication specifies approved methods for automated  key establishment using Rivest, Shamir, Adleman (RSA)  key-transport and key-agreement schemes. In an RSA key- transport scheme, one party (called the sender) generates  a key to be used in subsequent communications and sends  it to another party (called the receiver), encrypted using  the receiver’s public key. In a key-agreement scheme, two  parties contribute information that is used by each party  to compute a shared secret, which is then used to derive  a key that is known by both parties. The 2009 version  approved the use of 1024- and 2048-bit keys for both key- transport and key-agreement schemes, and in the case  of the key-agreement schemes, specified two approved  methods for key derivation, both using an approved hash  function. SP 800-56B has been revised to remove the use  of 1024-bit keys because they no longer provide adequate  protection for federal information, and to approve the use  of 3072-bit keys. This revision also includes the approval of  additional key-derivation methods specified in SP 800-56C,  Recommendation for Key Derivation through Extraction- then-Expansion, and SP 800-135, Recommendation for  Existing Application-Specific Key Derivation Functions,  and the use of Hash-based Message Authentication Code  (HMAC), as well as a hash function, during the key-derivation  process. HMAC is specified in FIPS 198-1, The Keyed-Hash  Message Authentication Code (HMAC). The revision of SP  800-56B was published in September 2014.  SP 800-57, Recommendation for Key Management,  Part 3: Application-Specific Key Management Guidance,  was first published in 2009. This document addresses the  key-management issues of currently available cryptographic  mechanisms, including the use of Public Key Infrastructures  (PKI) and several commonly used security protocols. A  revision of this document was provided for public comment  in May 2014 that updated the guidance provided in the 2009  version, included an additional section on the Secure Shell  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  3 5  (SSH) protocol and removed the TLS section, which is now  being addressed in SP 800-52 Revision 1, Guidelines for the  Selection, Configuration, and Use of Transport Layer Security  (TLS) Implementations. The final version of SP 800-57, Part  3 will be published in early 2015.  SP 800-152, A Profile for U.S. Federal Cryptographic  Key Management Systems (CKMS), is under development  to provide guidance on the CKMSs to be used by the  Federal Government. This document provides refinements  of the requirements for CKMS designers that are specified  in SP 800-130, A Framework for Designing Cryptographic  Key Management Systems. SP 800-152 also provides  requirements and recommendations for the service providers  of CKMSs used by federal agencies and their contractors,  as well as guidance for the federal agencies in selecting a  CKMS that supports the security and management policies  of those agencies. A draft of this document was provided  for public comment in FY 2013, and a workshop was held  in March 2013 to discuss the draft. A second draft has been  under development throughout FY 2014 to address the  received comments and issues raised at the workshop. This  draft will be available for public comment in December 2014.  A new NIST publication is under development  that provides guidance on the security strength of a  cryptographic key that is used to protect data (i.e., a  data-protection key), given the manner in which the key  was generated and handled prior to its use to protect the  target data. This document, SP 800-158, Key Management:  Obtaining a Targeted Security Strength, involves a  considerable amount of new research, since it is an area that  has not been fully addressed to date. This publication will be  available for public comment in FY 2015.  Additional key-management work to be conducted in  FY 2015 includes revisions to the following publications:  •  SP 800-56A, Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key-Es- tablishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm  Cryptography: This revision will align SP 800-56A  more closely with SP 800-56B, including the addition  of 3072-bit keys for the finite-field Diffie-Hellman  key-agreement schemes.  •  SP 800-57 Part 1, Recommendation for Key Man- agement: Part 1: General: The revision will include an  update of the approved key sizes for cryptographic  algorithms, and reference the new SHA-3 hash func- tions specified in FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permuta- tion-Based Hash and Extendable-Output Functions.  •  SP 800-131A, Transitions: Recommendation for Tran- sitioning the Use of Cryptographic Algorithms and  Key Lengths: This document will be revised to include  references to the SHA-3 hash functions and to update  guidance on the continued use of cryptographic algo- rithms and key sizes by the Federal government.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/key_mgmt  CONTACTS: Ms. Elaine Barker  Dr. Dustin Moody  (301) 975-2911  (301) 975-8136  elaine.barker@nist.gov  dustin.moody@nist.gov  Dr. Lily Chen  Mr. Ray Perlner  (301) 975-6974  (301) 975-3357  lily.chen@nist.gov  ray.perlner@nist.gov  Mr. Quynh Dang  (301) 975-3610  quynh.dang@nist.gov  Transport  Layer  Security SP 800-52 Revision 1, Guidelines for the Selection,  Configuration, and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS)  Implementations, provides recommendations regarding  TLS server and client implementations. TLS is a widely  used cryptographic protocol that provides communication  security for a variety of network applications, such as email,  e-commerce, and healthcare.  The first version of SP 800-52, published in 2005,  was withdrawn in March 2013. In September 2013, CSD  announced Draft SP 800-52 Revision 1. Changes to the  document were made based on comments received during  the public comment period, which ended in mid-December  2013. The final version of SP 800-52 Revision 1 was published  in April 2014.  SP 800-52 Revision 1 is a significant update to the  original guidance and includes recommendations providing  higher levels of security. New recommendations include the  support of TLS versions 1.1 and 1.2, guidance on certificate  profiles and validation methods, TLS extensions, and support  for a greater variety of cryptographic algorithms.  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is actively  developing extensions that can be used to add functionality  to TLS. The CSD’s Cryptographic Technology Group (CTG)  will review updates and additions to the TLS protocol in the  second half of FY 2015. If there are changes that should be  incorporated into SP 800-52, the development of a new  revision will begin.

If large- scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to  break the existing infrastructure of public-key cryptography.  The focus of the Post Quantum Cryptography project is  to identify candidate quantum-resistant systems that are  secure against both quantum and classical computers, as  well as the impact that such post-quantum algorithms will  have on current protocols and security infrastructures.  In FY 2014, CSD researchers internally presented status  reports in the areas of quantum computation, coding-based  cryptography, lattice-based cryptography, and multivariate  cryptography, which included detailed surveys of the  respective fields, as well as security overviews and specific  results. The project members also created evaluation criteria  to compare proposed post quantum cryptosystems with the  end goal of standardization.  CSD staff also engaged the international cryptographic  community with presentations and publications.  Presentations were made at the 2014 Conference on Theory of  Quantum Computation, Communication, and Cryptography,  CRYPTO 2014, and PQCrypto 2014 Conference. CSD staff  were invited to give talks at QCrypt 2014, and at  the  PQCrypto 2014 Conference. A CSD staff member gave a  course on quantum algorithms.  CSD staff helped organize  the joint NIST-University of Maryland Workshop on Quantum  Information and Computer Science. CSD also contributed  to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute  whitepaper on quantum-safe cryptography. The CSD also  hosted two leading experts in the field, Dr. Jintai Ding and  Dr. Vadim Lyubashevsky, for extended visits.  In FY 2015, the CSD will continue to explore the security  capacity of purported quantum-resistant technologies  with the ultimate goal of uncovering the fundamental  mechanisms necessary for efficient, trustworthy, and cost- effective information assurance in the post-quantum market.  Upon the successful completion of this phase of the project,  CSD will be prepared for possible standardization efforts in  this area. The CSD will hold a workshop on cybersecurity in a  post-quantum world in March of 2015.

There are many technical challenges in doing this, as  it is typically hard to separate private data from general data  (e.g. to convert a third-party-signed date-of-birth certificate  into a certificate indicating that a person is of voting age).  Zero-knowledge (ZK) proof techniques and their variants  can be used to accomplish this for a large class of assertions.  These techniques allow one party to prove to another  party that a given statement is true, without conveying  any additional information apart from the fact that the  statement is indeed true. However, even though many such  ZK protocols are practical, adoption by industry is slow. CSD’s  CTG is also following the progress of emerging technologies,  such as fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). FHE could  potentially solve a large class of problems by allowing  computation on encrypted data without decryption. CTG has  also shown that the NIST Randomness Beacon (discussed  below) can be used as a primitive in secure multi-party  computation, such as sealed-bid online auctions, in which  losing bids are never opened.  Team members continue to work in collaboration with  the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace  (NSTIC) program and the Federal Cloud Credential  Exchange (FCCX) project. In this context, CTG has served as  evaluators and in technical support roles. Information about  NSTIC and FCCX is available at http://www.nist.gov/nstic/.  Current communication security standards are primarily  designed for two-party communication. CTG believes that  future protocols, such as those for identification, commercial  transactions, and social media, will necessitate standards  for three-party communications (e.g., two parties involved  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  3 7  in a commercial transaction and a third party that serves  as an enabler of some aspects of the transaction). This is  particularly important if standards are to provide privacy  protection. CTG has developed some basic protocols for this  purpose. One such protocol allows for privacy-preserving  identification with the aid of a mediator. In this protocol, the  issuer of an assertion, such as “John Smith is an employee  of the Department of Commerce,” does not need to know  who the consumer of the assertion is, yet it can encrypt the  assertion with a key only known to that consumer (i.e. the  mediator cannot see the unencrypted assertion).  CONTACT: Dr. René Peralta  (301) 975-8702  rene.peralta@nist.gov  Cryptographic Standards and  Guidel ines Process Review  In September 2013, news reports about leaked classified  documents raised concerns over the trustworthiness of the  Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator  (Dual_EC_DRBG), which is included in SP 800-90A,  Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using  Deterministic Random Bit Generators. In response to these  concerns, NIST initiated an internal review, reopened public  comment on SP 800-90A, and invited an independent  review of its standards development processes.  As a first step, NIST’s CSD solicited public comments  to obtain feedback on the following: the processes used to  develop standards, and the mechanisms used to engage  experts in industry, academia and government to develop  them. As part of this process, the team compiled information  about the principles, processes and procedures that drive  NIST cryptographic standards development efforts. This  supports guidance to help the public understand how such  standards are developed. This information was published  in draft NISTIR 7977,  NIST Cryptographic Standards and  Guidelines Development Process.  NIST’s federal advisory committee, the  Visiting  Committee on Advanced Technology (VCAT), was asked  to review NIST’s cryptographic standards program. The  VCAT formed a Committee of Visitors (COV) with invited  experts from standards organizations, industry, and the  cryptographic research community to assist in this review.  During three meetings in April and May 2014, the COV  reviewed NIST’s cryptographic standards development  process, including the events that led up to the inclusion of  the Dual_EC_DRBG in SP 800-90A; the development of the  SP 800-38 series of block cipher modes; and the selection  and status of the recommended elliptic curves in FIPS 186- 4, the Digital Signature Standard. As part of the review, the  COV provided recommendations for process improvement,  as well as some specific technical considerations and criteria  for NIST’s cryptographic standards and processes.  Based on the COV’s recommendations, the VCAT  produced a report detailing recommendations for  NIST’s cryptographic standards program. The VCAT  recommendations called for NIST to increase its staff  of cryptography experts and implement more explicit  processes for ensuring openness and transparency to  strengthen its cryptography efforts.  NIST has posted the full VCAT report, including  the individual recommendations from the COV, on the  NIST website, as well as the briefing documents provided to  assist in the review.  NIST CSD is working to implement the recommendations  of the VCAT. In response to comments received from the  public, and the recommendations from the VCAT and  COV, NIST CSD is working on a revision to NISTIR 7977  that will provide more detailed processes and procedures.  These additions will ensure that there is a clear record of  the contributions to NIST standards and guidelines, and  will establish a maintenance process that ensures that  publications remain current.  Additionally, NIST will continue  to strengthen capabilities with new hires, guest researchers,  contracts and external collaborations with researchers,  industry and standards organizations. Finally, NIST CSD will  work with the cryptographic community to evaluate other  technical concerns raised by the VCAT’s review and take  appropriate remediating actions.  http://www.nist.gov/director/vcat/index.cfm  http://www.nist.gov/director/vcat/cryptographic-standards- guidelines-process.cfm  CONTACT: Mr. Andrew Regenscheid  (301) 975-5155  andrew.regenscheid@nist.gov  http://www.nist.gov/director/vcat/cryptographic-standards-guidelines-process.cfm http://www.nist.gov/director/vcat/cryptographic-standards-guidelines-process.cfm  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  3 8  N E W  R E S E A R C H  A R E A S  I N  C R Y P T O G R A P H I C  T E C H - N I Q U E S  F O R  E M E R G I N G  A P P L I C AT I O N S  Circuit  Complexity Research  Cryptographic functions, such as encryption, digital  signatures, and hashing, are implemented as electronic  circuits for a wide class of applications. In practice, it  is important to be able to minimize the size of these  circuits. This problem is closely related to designing small  combinational circuits. These circuits use only binary AND,  XOR and NEGATION gates, i.e. multiplication, addition,  and “+1” in arithmetic modulo 2. A combinational circuit  on four variables is depicted below. The project team has  shown that finding optimal combinational circuits is MAX- SNP Complete. In practice, this means that it is necessary to  settle for heuristics that design “good” circuits, as opposed  to provably optimal circuits. The CSD’s CTG has developed  and implemented new heuristics for the circuit minimization  problem. Two patents have been granted related to this  work, the last one in FY 2014. These are held jointly between  NIST and the University of Southern Denmark.  CSD’s CTG is also researching circuit-based security  metrics for cryptographic functions. For a function to be  secure (one-way), it must be the case that any circuit that  implements it is sufficiently complex. In particular, a function  is insecure if it can be implemented by a circuit containing  too few Boolean AND gates. This security metric, namely the  number of AND gates necessary and sufficient to implement  a function, is referred to as its multiplicative complexity.  Unfortunately, determining multiplicative complexity is  extremely hard. Mathematicians attempted this in the 1970s,  but the effort had been largely abandoned by the 1980s. CTG  has been able to compute tight bounds for the multiplicative  complexity of an important class of functions: the symmetric  functions. In the process, the CTG research team developed  tools that have wide applicability for both theoretical and  applied research in security and cryptography.  Multiparty computation is a technique that allows  a group of people to compute a function of their inputs  without revealing the inputs themselves. Examples of this  are: i) holding an election; ii) conducting closed-bid auctions  in which only the winning bid is determined; iii) proving to a  third party that an entity’s encrypted attributes satisfy some  requirement, such as “over 21 and (US citizen or Canadian  citizen)”. The protocols  that  solve  multiparty  computation  problems often encrypt bits using arithmetic modulo 2.  The complexity of such protocols largely depends on the  number of multiplications required − hence, the importance  of expressing functions as circuit computations with few  multiplication (AND) gates. Some of the published circuits  are now the standard reference for benchmarking tools in  multiparty computation.  A partial list of new results consists of:  •  The construction of the smallest known circuits for  multiplication in several small finite fields;  •  The construction of the smallest known circuits for the  multiplication of polynomials of degree n over the Ga- lois Field with two elements (for small values of n); and  •  The construction of optimal circuits - with respect to  the multiplicative complexity - for all predicates on four  bits. There are 65 536 such predicates. Surprisingly, the  multiplicative complexity of all these functions turned  out to be at most three.  Additionally, our circuits use no more than seven non- linear gates (XOR, XNOR). This is quite hard. Consider the  following predicate (arithmetic is modulo 2):  f = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x1x2 + x1x3 + x1x4 + x2x3 +x2x4 + x1x2x3 +  x1x2x4 + x1x2x3x4.  Computing the last term requires three multiplications.  So it is quite surprising that the full expression can be  computed using only three multiplications; however, this  has been shown to be the case for f and all other predicates  on four bits. The circuit depicted below computes f using 3  multiplications and 6 additions.  •  A proof that the maximum multiplicative complexity  of predicates on five bits (there are more than 4 billion  such predicates) is four. The proof is constructive,  meaning the circuits can actually be built. This result  appears in the proceedings of the Third International  Workshop on Lightweight Cryptography for Security &  Privacy (Springer-Verlag).

CONTACT: Dr. René Peralta  (301) 975-8702  rene.peralta@nist.gov  Cryptography for  Constrained  Environments  There are several emerging areas in which highly  constrained devices are interconnected, typically  communicating wirelessly with one another, and working in  concert to accomplish some task. Examples of these areas  include: sensor networks, healthcare, distributed control  systems, the Internet of Things, cyber physical systems, and  the smart grid. Security and privacy can be very important  in all of these areas. Because the majority of current  cryptographic algorithms were designed for desktop/server  environments, many of these algorithms do not fit into the  constrained resources. If current algorithms can be made to  fit into the limited resources of constrained environments,  their performance is typically not acceptable.  CSD’s Cryptographic Technology Group (CTG) is  studying the use of the NIST-approved symmetric- key algorithms in constrained environments. CTG has  developed microcontroller implementations of the  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to provide both  confidentiality and the AES-based message authentication  code, Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC),  for authentication. Additionally, CTG has implemented the  256-bit version of the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-256)  to provide a Hash-based Message Authentication Code  (HMAC) for authentication. SHA-3, as specified in Draft  FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based Hash and  Extendable-Output Functions, and a variant of KeccaK  using an 800-bit permutation has also been implemented.  CTG has demonstrated that SHA-3 allows a more efficient  construction for computing Message authentication codes  (MACs) than the HMAC construction, which is required when  using SHA-256. CTG has also investigated other, non-NIST- approved algorithms for constrained environments.  CTG has also begun to examine applications in  constrained environments to determine whether NIST  should develop a lightweight encryption standard. CTG  has talked with industry experts to understand challenges,  limitations, and work from other standardization bodies in  this area. Also, CTG has had internal discussions on additional  considerations for a lightweight standard, as restrictions on  its use would be necessary in order to prevent the adoption  of a lightweight cipher where the strong protection of AES  is required.  CTG is preparing a report that describes the current  state and challenges in target application areas, and  provides a survey of lightweight primitives, including  block and stream ciphers that have been proposed for  constrained environments. CTG researchers also studied  efficient implementations of the Boolean functions used in  lightweight primitives and published Multiplicative  Complexity of Boolean Functions on Four and Five Variables  at the Third International Workshop on Lightweight  Cryptography for Security & Privacy (LightSec 2014).  In FY 2015, CTG will continue to analyze the resource  requirements and performance characteristics of  lightweight primitives, and study their use as building blocks  to perform various cryptographic objectives. Additionally,  CTG will investigate specific application areas in order to  determine functionality and resource requirements in the  area of cryptography for constrained environments.

The prototype, called the Beacon, uses two independent,  commercially available sources of randomness, each with an  independent hardware entropy source.   The Beacon is designed to provide unpredictability,  autonomy, and consistency. Unpredictability means that  users cannot algorithmically predict bits before they are  made available by the source. Autonomy means that the  source is resistant to attempts by outside parties to alter the  distribution of the random bits. Consistency means that a  set of users can access the source in such a way that they  are confident that they all receive the same random string.  The Beacon posts bit-strings in blocks of 512 bits every  60 seconds. Each such value is time-stamped and signed  by NIST, and includes the hash of the previous value to  chain the sequence of values together. This prevents all,  even the Beacon itself, from retroactively changing an  http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/~peralta/CircuitStuff/CMT.html http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/~peralta/CircuitStuff/CMT.html  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  4 0  output packet without being detected. The Beacon keeps  all output packets and makes them available online at  https://beacon.nist.gov/home.   Tables of random numbers have probably been used for  multiple purposes, at least since the Industrial Revolution.  In the digital age, algorithmic random number generators  have largely replaced these tables. The NIST Randomness  Beacon expands the use of public randomness to multiple  scenarios in which the latter methods cannot be used. The  extra functionalities stem mainly from three features. First,  the Beacon-generated numbers cannot be predicted before  they are published. Second, the public, time-bound, and  authenticated nature of the Beacon allows a user application  to prove to anybody that it used truly random numbers not  known before a certain point in time. Third, this proof can be  presented offline and at any point in the future. For example,  the proof could be mailed to a trusted third party, encrypted  and signed by an application, only to be opened if needed  and authorized.  Although commercially available physical sources of  randomness are adequate as entropy sources for currently  envisioned applications of the Beacon, NIST is working on  developing a source of verifiably random sequences. Given  that it is impossible to construct such sequences in any  classical physical context, CSD is collaborating with the NIST  Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML) to build a quantum  source. The aim is to use quantum effects to generate  sequences that are guaranteed to be unpredictable, even  if an attacker has access to the random source. For more  information on this collaboration, see  http://www.nist.gov/ pml/div684/random_numbers_bell_test.cfm.

NIST encourages  the community-at-large to research and publish novel  ways in which this tool can be used. Some examples of  applications are unpredictable sampling, new authentication  mechanisms, and secure multi-party computation.

In such a heterogeneous network, a mobile  device may switch its connection between different wireless  technologies. The procedure for conducting such a switch is  called a “handover.” Media-independent handover (MIH) is a  set of services specified in IEEE 802.21 to assist the handover.  When the services provided by the pervasive hetero- geneous networks are extended to other applications, such  as Smart Grid applications, the MIH needs to be processed  by a group of wireless nodes, such as smart meters, for  balancing the network load and for reliability. In this case,  the information may need to be delivered to a group of  smart meters using a multicast message, which is used to  deliver the information. That is, the message is sent from one  point-of-service (PoS) to multiple wireless nodes. In some of  the application environments, such as sensor networks, the  groups are formed dynamically. That is, new nodes can be  added to the group, and some nodes in the group may need  to be removed. Such groups are managed through multicast  signals.  Amendment 2 of IEEE 802.21 provides protection  mechanisms for unicast messages, that is, mechanisms  that protect messages between a PoS and a single mobile  node. However, the protection for multicast messages and  group management signals is critical. In FY 2014, CSD has  worked with IEEE 802.21 to develop security solutions for  group management in Task Group D of IEEE 802.21. The  solutions, specified in IEEE 802.21 Amendment 4, include  the mechanisms to distribute group keys and for the  protection of multicast messages. A draft of Amendment 4  has been approved through sponsor ballot. In FY 2015, CSD  will continue to contribute to a broader scope of IEEE 802  wireless standards.  CONTACT: Dr. Lily Chen  (301) 975-6974  lily.chen@nist.gov  VA L I D AT I O N  P R O G R A M S  Federal agencies, industry, and the public rely on many  of the standards and specifications supported by NIST’s CSD.  Poor implementations of these standards or specifications  may render a particular product insecure, potentially placing  sensitive information at risk. CSD operates several validation  programs that help provide a level of assurance that products  meet established security requirements and conform to  published specifications. To that end, the Security Testing,  Validation, and Measurement Group (STVMG) develops test  suites and test methods; provides implementation guidance  and technical support to industry forums; and conducts  education, training, and outreach programs.  STVMG’s validation programs work together with  independent laboratories that are accredited by the NIST  National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program  (NVLAP). Based on the independent laboratory test report  and test evidence, the validation programs described  below validate the implementation under test. The CSD  subsequently publishes lists of the validations awarded on  public websites.  Cryptographic System Val idation Current validation programs focus on providing a known  level of assurance for cryptographic algorithms and modules.  These modules are used within the context of a larger system  to provide cryptographic services as a method of protecting  the data within the system. As information systems continue  to become more complex, the methods used to implement  cryptographic services have also increased in complexity.  Problems with the use of cryptography are often introduced  through the interaction of cryptographic components with  the operating environment. This program seeks to specify  how cryptographic components are used as part of a defined  cryptographic system to solve problems with a measureable  level of assurance, and to introduce automated methods of  quantifying the level of assurance that has been provided.  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  4 2  This program will begin the research required to  define a reference cryptographic systems architecture and  example use cases where cryptographic systems are built  from known cryptographic components that cooperate  through trust relationships to provide a measureable level of  assurance. The architecture should begin at the lowest level  with a hardware-based root of trust, and each cryptographic  component should be added in successive layers to  provide assurance in a systematic way. This should allow  the development of tests that would measure the correct  implementation of cryptographic components as part of a  larger system.  This program will perform research and experimentation  in applicable technologies and techniques that will enable  the efficient testing of the cryptographic capabilities of  each layer, and continuous monitoring capabilities of  each cryptographic component, providing the necessary  interfaces to establish trust relationships with other  cryptographic components. Techniques could include such  items as:  •  Embedding SCAP-like data elements and standard  interfaces to query those data elements during the de- sign and implementation of cryptographic components  that would enable automated testing capabilities;  •  Using cryptographic techniques to embed values into  the module that would increase the verifiability and  assurance that the module provides; and  •  Using industry-based secure development techniques  to increase the level of trust inherent in software mod- ules starting with design and implementation.  Research into this area of cryptographic system  validation holds the promise of automating the validation of  all cryptographic components, providing a higher assurance  with less manual effort by using SCAP-based ideas to embed  data elements that instrument the test harnesses used to  validate cryptographic systems. This would also provide the  instrumentation that could be leveraged to enable a greater  level of situational awareness and security measurement,  and potentially, to enable continuous monitoring of  cryptographic systems.  CONTACT: Mr. Michael Cooper  (301) 975-8077  michael.cooper@nist.gov  Cryptographic Programs and  Laboratory Accreditation  The Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program  (CAVP) and the Cryptographic Module Validation Program  (CMVP) were developed in collaboration between NIST  and the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) of  Canada to support the respective federal user communities  for strong, independently tested, and commercially available  cryptographic algorithms and modules. Through these  programs, NIST and CSE work with international government,  public and private sectors as a part of the cryptographic  community to achieve standards-based security and  assurance of correct implementation. The goal of these  programs is to provide federal agencies with a security  metric to use in procuring and deploying cryptographic  modules and promote the use of validated algorithms and  modules by industry and the public. The testing carried out  by independent third-party laboratories accredited by the  NIST National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program  (NVLAP), and the validations performed by the CAVP and  CMVP programs provide this metric. Federal agencies,  industry, and the public can choose cryptographic modules  and/or products containing cryptographic modules from  the CMVP Validated Modules List and have confidence  in the claimed level of security and assurance of correct  implementation.  Cryptographic algorithm and cryptographic module  testing and validation are based on published NIST  standards. As federal agencies are required to use validated  cryptographic modules for the protection of sensitive  non-classified information, the validated modules and the  validated algorithms that the modules contain represent the  culmination and delivery of the CSD’s cryptography-based  work to the end user.  The CAVP and the CMVP are separate collaborative  programs. The CAVP and the CMVP validate algorithms  and modules, respectively, that are used in a wide variety of  products, including Internet browsers, radios, smart cards,  space-based communications, munitions, security tokens,  mobile phones, network and storage devices, and products  supporting the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and electronic  commerce. A module may be a standalone product, such  as a virtual private network (VPN) or smart card, or it  could be a module embedded in many products, such as a  cryptographic-based toolkit. As a result, a small number of  modules may be incorporated within hundreds of products.  The CAVP validates cryptographic algorithms that may be  integrated in one or more cryptographic modules.  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  4 3  The CAVP and CMVP validation programs provide  documented methodologies for conformance testing  through defined sets of security requirements. For the  CAVP, the validation system documents are designed for  each FIPS-approved and NIST-recommended cryptographic  algorithm. See the website for a listing (see http://csrc.nist. gov/groups/STM/cavp/). Security requirements for the  CMVP are found in FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements for  Cryptographic Modules, and the associated test metrics  and methods in Derived Test Requirements for FIPS 140-2,  Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules (DTR).  The four Annexes to FIPS 140-2 reference the underlying  cryptographic algorithm standards or methods. The CMVP- developed Implementation Guidance for FIPS PUB 140-2  and the Cryptographic Validation Program (IG) provides  programmatic and implementation guidance across all of  the referenced documents. The information provided in the  DTR and IG documents ensures the repeatability of tests and  the equivalency in results across the testing laboratories.  The Implementation Guidance provides clarity, consistency  of interpretation, and insight for successful conformance  testing, validation, and revalidation.  The unique position of the validation programs gives the  CAVP and CMVP the opportunity to acquire insight during  the validation review activities and results in practical, timely,  and up-to-date guidance that is needed by the testing  laboratories and vendors to move their modules out to the  user community in a timely and cost-effective manner and  with the assurance of third-party conformance testing. This  knowledge and insight provide a foundation for current and  future standards and tools development.  The CMVP reviews the cryptographic module validation  requests from the testing laboratories and, as a byproduct  of the review, is attentive to emerging and/or changing  technologies. These insights into the evolution of operating  environments and complex systems allow, the CMVP to  perform research and development on evolving test metrics  and methods and future requirements for cryptographic  modules. This research is used to assist developers of  cryptographic modules, testing laboratories, and the user  community when developing new standards.

The latest set of statistics,  which are collected quarterly from each of the testing  laboratories, shows that 5 % (dropped from 7 % in FY 2013)  of the cryptographic algorithms and 54 % (increased from  35 % in FY 2013) of the cryptographic modules brought in  for voluntary testing had security flaws that were corrected  during testing. By the end of FY 2014, the CMVP had  validated and issued a total of 2258 cryptographic module  validation certificates that represent 5785 modules. These  modules have been developed by more than 475 domestic  and international vendors. Likewise, to date, the CAVP  has issued approximately 15 963 validations, representing  the algorithm validations of approximately 17 approved  algorithms. The CAVP issued approximately 2200 algorithm  validations in FY 2014. Included in this total, is the 3000th  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) validation, a  significant milestone for the CAVP. The CMVP issued 191  module validation certificates in FY 2014. The number of  algorithms and modules submitted for validation continues  to grow, representing significant growth in the number of  validations expected to be available in the future.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM  CONTACTS: CMVP Contact:  CAVP Contact:  Dr. Apostol Vassilev  Ms. Sharon Keller  (301) 975-3221  (301) 975-2910  apostol.vassilev@nist.gov  sharon.keller@nist.gov  Figure 10: FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 140-2  Validated Modules by Calendar Year and Level  Figure 11: FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 140-2  Validation Certificates by Fiscal Year and Level  Figure 12: CAVP Validation Status by FYs  Figure 13: CAVP Validation Status for FY 2014  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  4 5  Automated Security Testing and Test  Suite Development  The Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program  (CAVP), a collaborative program between NIST and the  Communications Security Establishment (CSE) of Canada,  utilizes the requirements and specifications of NIST  standards (i.e., FIPS and Special Publications), to develop  algorithm validation test suites and automated security  testing. The CAVP is responsible for providing assurance that  the cryptographic algorithm implementations contained in  cryptographic modules are implemented according to the  specifications in the standards. The CAVP accomplishes this  by designing and developing conformance testing specific  to each cryptographic algorithm.  The conformance testing consists of a suite of validation  tests for each approved cryptographic algorithm. These  validation tests exercise the algorithmic requirements and  mathematical formulas detailed in the algorithm to assure  that the detailed specifications are implemented correctly  and completely. If the implementer deviates from the  specifications in the standard or excludes any part of these  specifications or requirements, the validation test will detect  the deviations and fail. The validation testing will indicate that  the algorithm implementation does not function properly or  is incomplete.  The cryptographic algorithm validation tests designed  and developed by the CAVP are performed by independent  third-party laboratories accredited by the NIST National  Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP). The  laboratory works with vendors to validate their cryptographic  algorithm implementations. The suite of validation tests for  each algorithm ensures the repeatability of tests and the  equivalency in results across the testing laboratories.  There are several types of validation tests, all designed  to satisfy the testing requirements of the cryptographic  algorithms and their specifications. These include, but are  not limited to, Known-Answer Tests, Monte Carlo Tests,  and Multi-Block Message Tests. The Known-Answer Tests  are designed to examine the individual components of  the algorithm by supplying known values to the variables  and verifying the expected result. Negative testing is also  performed by supplying known incorrect values to assure  that the implementation recognizes values that are not  allowed. The Monte Carlo Test is designed to exercise the  entire implementation under test (IUT). This test is designed  to detect the presence of implementation flaws that are not  Figure 14: CAVP Validated Implementation Actual Numbers  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  4 6  detected with the controlled input of the Known-Answer  Tests. The types of implementation flaws detected by  this validation test include pointer problems, insufficient  allocation of space, improper error handling, and incorrect  behavior of the IUT. The Multi-Block Message Test (MMT)  is designed to test the ability of the implementation to  process multi-block messages, which require the chaining of  information from one block to the next.  During the last few years, the CTG has expanded  its publications to not only contain the algorithm’s  specifications, but also to include requirements on an  algorithm’s use. Many of these usage requirements do not  fall within the scope of the CAVP because the CAVP focuses  on the correctness of the instructions within the algorithm’s  boundary. If these additional algorithm usage requirements  are not considered applicable to the algorithm’s  implementation, they cannot be tested at the algorithm  level by the CAVP, but may be tested by the Cryptographic  Module Validation Program (CMVP) if the requirements are  considered applicable to the cryptographic module. However,  some of these usage requirements may be considered to be  outside the scope of both the algorithm implementation  and cryptographic module. In this latter case, the fulfillment  of the requirements is the responsibility of entities using,  installing, or configuring applications or protocols that use  the cryptographic algorithms. For example, depending on  the design of a cryptographic module, it may not be possible  for the module to determine whether a specific key is used for  multiple purposes, a situation that is strongly discouraged.  The CAVP currently has algorithm validation testing for  the following cryptographic algorithms:  CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHM/COMPONENT SPECIAL PUBLICATION OR FIPS  Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES)  SP 800-67, Recommendation for the Triple Data  Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) Block Cipher, and  SP 800-38A, Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of  Operation–Methods and Techniques  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) FIPS 197, Advanced Encryption Standard, and  SP 800-38A, Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of  Operation–Methods and Techniques  Digital Signature Standard (DSS)  FIPS 186-2, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), with change  notice 1  FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature Standard (DSS)  Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)  FIPS 186-2, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), with change  notice 1 and ANS X9.62  FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), and ANS  X9.62  RSA algorithm  ANSI X9.31 and Public Key Cryptography Standards  (PKCS) #1 v2.1: RSA Cryptography Standard-2002  FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), and ANSI  X9.31 and Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #1  v2.1: RSA Cryptography Standard-2002  Hashing algorithms SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384,  SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256  FIPS 180-4, Secure Hash Standard (SHS)  Random number generator (RNG) algorithms FIPS 186-2 Appendix 3.1 and 3.2; ANS X9.62 Appendix A.4  Deterministic Random Bit Generators (DRBG) SP 800-90A, Recommendation for Random Number  Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  4 7  Key Agreement Schemes and Key Confirmation SP 800-56A, Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key  Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm  Cryptography, dated March 2007  All of SP 800-56A except KDF SP 800-56A, Key Derivation Functions for Key Agreement  Schemes: All sections except Section 5.8  SP 800-56A Section 5.7.1.2 ECC CDH function SP 800-56A, Section 5.7.1.2 Elliptic Curve Cryptography  Cofactor Diffie-Hellman (ECC CDH) Primitive Testing  Key-Based Key Derivation functions (KBKDF) SP 800-108, Recommendation for Key Derivation using  Pseudorandom Functions  Application-Specific Key Derivation functions (ASKDF)  (includes KDFs used by IKEv1, IKEv2, TLS, ANS X9.63- 2001, SSH, SRTP, SNMP, and TPM)  SP 800-135 (Revision 1) Recommendation for Existing  Application Specific key Derivation Functions  Component test – ECDSA Signature Generation of hash  value (This component test verifies the signing of a hash- sized input.

These efforts bring consistent testing of cryptographic  modules to the global community by providing ISO- equivalent standards representing NIST FIPS 140-2, Security  Requirements for Cryptographic Modules and Derived  Test Requirements [DTR] for FIPS PUB 140-2, Security  Requirements for Cryptographic Modules.  ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 WG 3 completed and published  revisions of ISO/IEC 19790:2006 and ISO/IEC 24759:2008,  for which Randall J. Easter of NIST’s CSD was the principal  editor. The revision of ISO/IEC 19790 was published  on August 15, 2012. The revision of ISO/IEC 24759 was  published on January 31, 2014. Both ISO/IEC standards were  also adopted by the American National Standards Institute  (ANSI). The two ISO/IEC revisions were developed with  international support and the collaboration of governments,  industry and academia. The NIST CMVP and the NVLAP- accredited testing laboratories worked closely with ISO in  the standards revision.  ISO/IEC 19790:2012 specifies the security requirements  for a cryptographic module utilized within a security  system protecting sensitive information in computer and  telecommunication systems. This international standard  defines four security levels for cryptographic modules to  provide for a wide spectrum of data sensitivity (e.g. low  value administrative data, million dollar funds transfers, life- protecting data, personal identity information, and sensitive  information used by a government) and a diversity of  application environments (e.g. a guarded facility, an office,  Figure 15: Cryptographic Module Testing – ISO Standards  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  4 9  removable media, and a completely unprotected location).  The overall security rating of a cryptographic module must  be chosen to provide a level of security appropriate for the  security requirements of the application and environment  in which the module is to be utilized and for the security  services that the module is to provide.  The security requirements cover areas relative to the  design and implementation of a cryptographic module.  These areas include cryptographic module specification;  cryptographic module interfaces; roles, services, and  authentication; software/firmware security; the operational  environment; physical security; non-invasive security;  sensitive security parameter management; self-tests; life- cycle assurance; and mitigation of other attacks.  CSD’s Randall J. Easter is the principal editor of the  following draft ISO/IEC documents:  •  ISO/IEC 17825, Testing methods for the mitigation  of non-invasive attack classes against cryptographic  modules;  •  ISO/IEC 18367, Cryptographic algorithms and security  mechanisms conformance testing; and  •  ISO/IEC TS 30104, Physical Security Attacks, Mitigation  Techniques and Security Requirements.  CSD’s contributions to the development of these  international standards create a strong foundation for the  adoption of and migration from currently used national  standards. In particular, this adoption will promote the  international harmonization for the implementation and  testing of cryptographic algorithms and modules, while  accommodating individual country preferences in the choice  of approved security functions.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/  CONTACT: Mr. Randy Easter  (301) 975-4641  randall.easter@nist.gov  Security Content  Automation Protocol  (SCAP) Val idation Program  The SCAP Validation Program performs conformance  testing to ensure that products correctly implement  SCAP, as defined in SP 800-126 Revision 2, The Technical  Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol  (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2. Conformance testing is necessary  because SCAP is a complex collection of eleven individual  specifications that work together to support various use  Figure 16: SCAP 1.2 Validation Process  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  5 0  cases. A single error in product implementation could result  in undetected vulnerabilities or policy noncompliance within  an organization’s networks.  The test requirements for SCAP 1.2 are defined in NISTIR  7511 Revision 3, Security Content Automation Protocol  (SCAP) Version 1.2 Validation Program Test Requirements.  In general, vendors may opt for product validation for one  or more SCAP capabilities or operating systems. Currently,  the program offers testing on Microsoft Windows and Red  Hat Enterprise Linux platforms. The validation process  starts when a vendor voluntarily submits an SCAP-enabled  product to a NVLAP-accredited laboratory. Once the lab  completes product testing, and all validation requirements  are met, the lab submits a test report to the SCAP Validation  Program for review. NIST reviews the test report and will  award a validation if all requirements have been met. Once  a validation is awarded, the SCAP Validation Record is sent  to the lab, and the newly validated product is posted on the  SCAP Validated Products web page.  The SCAP Validation Program resources web page  (http://scap.nist.gov/validation) was introduced in FY 2013,  and was updated in FY 2014 to provide the public with a  centralized location for all resources and information  necessary for preparing products for SCAP 1.2 validation.  Resources include documentation, a list of Frequently  Asked Questions (FAQ), the SCAP validation-test content,  and tools for validating and processing SCAP data streams.  The SCAP validation-test content should be used by vendors  for quality assurance testing prior to entering formal SCAP  testing with an NVLAP accredited laboratory. The open- source tools that are available for download may be used by  SCAP content authors for testing SCAP source content. The  SCAP Content Validation Tool (SCAPVal) may be used to  determine if the content conforms to the SCAP specification.  Open-source SCAP reference implementation tools, such as  the SCAP Reference Implementation Tool, may be used to  process SCAP data streams.  End users may use information on the SCAP Validation  web page to learn about SCAP validation and find products  that have been awarded validations. The validation records  that are posted on the SCAP Validated Products page  state the product version that was tested in the laboratory,  along with details about the validation, such as the tested  platforms, SCAP capabilities, the validation test suite version,  and the lab that performed the product test.  In FY 2014, five products successfully completed testing  and were awarded validations. Several products are in  various stages of validation testing and are expected to be  awarded validations in FY 2015. The current list of SCAP 1.2  validated products may be found on the SCAP Validated  Products list at https://nvd.nist.gov/SCAP-Validated-Tools/.  In FY 2015, the SCAP Validation Program plans to provide  enhanced testing support and will focus on validation test  content for new operating systems. Expansion plans also  include improvements in automated testing capabilities.  http://scap.nist.gov/validation  CONTACT: Ms. Melanie Cook  (301) 975-5259  melanie.cook@nist.gov  I D E N T I T Y  M A N A G E M E N T  Personal  Identity Verif ication (PIV)  and FIPS 201 Revision Efforts  Figure 17: Government Employees  Use PIV Cards for Facility Access  In response to Homeland Security Presidential  Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Policy for a Common Identification  Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, FIPS 201,  Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees  and Contractors, was developed and was approved by the  Secretary of Commerce in February 2005. HSPD-12 called  for the creation of a new identity credential for federal  employees and contractors.

CSD activities in FY 2014 directly  supported the recently revised FIPS 201-2 by updating  the relevant publications associated with FIPS 201-2 and  by developing two new publications. CSD performed the  following activities during FY 2014 in support of HSPD-12:  •  Published Draft NISTIR 7863, Cardholder Authentica- tion for the PIV Digital Signature Key. The document  provides clarification for the requirement in FIPS 201-2  that a PIV cardholder perform an explicit user action  prior to each use of the digital signature key stored on  the card.  •  Published two new draft documents to accommodate  e-authentication with mobile devices:  −  Draft SP 800-157, Guidelines for Derived Personal  Identity Verification (PIV) Credentials, defines the  technical details for implementing and deploying  derived PIV credentials on mobile devices, such  as smart phones and tablets. As intended by FIPS  201-2, a derived PIV credential is a PIV credential  that can be provisioned directly to a mobile device  to enable remote enterprise access from the  device.  −  Draft NISTIR 7981, Mobile, PIV, and Authentication,  analyzes and summarizes various current and  near-term options for remote authentication with  mobile devices that leverage both the investment  in the PIV infrastructure and the unique security  capabilities of mobile devices.  •  Completed the comment resolution of Draft SP 800- 73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification, and  published a revised draft. The three-part SP details the  new PIV Card capabilities introduced in FIPS 201-2,  including  a Virtual Contact Interface (VCI), a secure  channel protocol, an on-card biometric comparison  mechanism and an enforcement of a minimum PIN  length of six digits.  •  Completed the comment resolution of Draft SP 800- 78-4, Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for  Personal Identity Verification, and published a revised  draft. The document has been modified to align with  Draft SP 800-73-4, and includes the addition of new  algorithms and key sizes for the secure messaging  protocol and the addition of test requirements with the  Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP)  validation.  •  Published Draft SP 800-79, Guidelines for the Accredi- tation of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card Issu- ers (PCIs). The draft document incorporates changes  required by FIPS 201-2, including a new set of issuer  controls for Derived PIV Credentials Issuers.  •  Prepared Draft SP 800-85A-4, PIV Card Applica- tion and Middleware Interface Test Guidelines, and  published Draft SP 800-85B-4, PIV Data Model Test  Guidelines, in order to align these documents with FIPS  201-2, SP 800-73-4, and SP 800-78-4.  •  As the NIST PIV Validation Authority, completed the  transition phase from FIPS 201-1 to FIPS 201-2 for vali- dated PIV Card Applications and PIV Middleware.  •  Created additional sets of test cards for the inventory  of PIV test cards. These test cards are available for  purchase and facilitate the development of applications  and middleware that support the PIV card (see  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/testcards.html).  In FY 2015, CSD will continue to focus on updating  the relevant publications associated with FIPS 201-2,  including developing two new publications: SP 800-156,  Representation of PIV Chain-of-Trust for Import and Export,  and SP 800-166,  Guidelines for Testing Derived Personal  Identity Verification (PIV) Credentials. CSD will also continue  to provide technical and strategic inputs to the PIV-related  initiatives.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/  CONTACTS: Ms. Hildegard Ferraiolo  Dr. David Cooper  (301) 975-6972  (301) 975-3194  hildegard.ferraiolo@nist.gov david.cooper@nist.gov  Mr. Salvatore Francomacaro Mr. Ketan Mehta  (301) 975-6414  (301) 975-8405  salvatore.francomacaro@nist.gov ketan.mehta@nist.gov  NIST Personal  Identity Verif ication  Program (NPIVP) & Revisions to FIPS  201-2 Companion Documents  The objective of the NIST Personal Identity Verification  Program (NPIVP) is to validate PIV components for  conformance to the specifications in FIPS 201, Personal  Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and  Contractors, and its companion documents. The two PIV  components that come under the scope of NPIVP are the  PIV Smart Card Application and the PIV Middleware. NPIVP  test facilities that perform the two types of tests are the  Cryptographic and Security Testing (CST) Laboratories  that have been accredited by the NIST National Voluntary  Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP). As of  September 2014, there were nine such facilities.  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/nistir-7981/nistir7981_draft.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/testcards.html  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  5 2  The interface specifications for the PIV Smart Card  Application and PIV Middleware are found in a FIPS  201-associated document, namely, SP 800-73 (the latest  published version SP 800-73-3) - Interfaces for Personal  Identity Verification. The conformance tests for these  specifications are detailed in SP 800-85A (the latest  published version is SP 800-85A-2) - PIV Card Application  and Middleware Interface Test Guidelines. To implement  these tests and to generate conformance test reports, CSD  also developed an integrated toolkit called “PIV Interface Test  Runner,” which conducts tests on both PIV Card Application  and PIV Middleware products, and provides the toolkit to  accredited NPIVP test facilities.  In 2014, CSD’s activity focused on the transitioning of PIV  Card Application and PIV Middleware products from FIPS  201-1 to FIPS 201-2 compliance. Coordinating with the test  facilities, FIPS 201-1 products were identified and placed on  the Removed Products List (RPL). Nine PIV card application  products and fifteen PIV middleware products were  affected. With this change, there are 27 NPIVP validated PIV  card application products, and five PIV Middleware products  listed.  In addition, NPIVP is closely involved in ensuring that all  changes in PIV companion documents, such as SP 800-73-4,  SP 800-76-2, Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity  Verification, and SP 800-78-4, Cryptographic Algorithms  and Key Sizes for Personal Identity Verification, are fully  reflected in the updated versions of the conformance test  documents, SP 800-85A and SP 800-85B, as well as in the  “PIV Interface Test Runner” toolkit. Currently, the NPIVP  team is guiding the development of the “PIV Interface Test  Runner” toolkit for validating PIV Card application and PIV  Middleware products for conformance to the specifications  in SP 800-73-4, SP 800-76-2 and SP 800-78-4.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/npivp  CONTACTS: Dr. Ramaswamy Chandramouli Ms. Hildegard Ferraiolo  (301) 975-5013  (301) 975-6972  mouli@nist.gov  hildegard.ferraiolo@nist.gov  R E S E A R C H  I N  E M E R G I N G  T E C H N O L O G I E S  Cloud Computing and Virtual ization The model for Cloud Computing is defined in SP 800-145,  The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing. The foundational  technology that facilitates the use of a computing  infrastructure for cloud-computing services is virtualization.  At the core of a virtualized infrastructure is the virtualized  host that provides an abstraction of the hardware (e.g., CPU,  memory) that enables multiple computing stacks (comprised  of the operating system, middleware, and applications) to be  run on a single physical machine. The efficiency of such a  dynamic and distributed processing environment is counter- balanced by the interoperability, portability, and security  challenges inherent to this computing environment. NIST’s  CSD is working in parallel on several projects (introduced  below) that aim to accelerate the Federal Government’s  adoption of secure cloud computing by collaborating  with standards bodies, and public and private sectors  in developing security, interoperability and portability  standards and guidance.  CSD Role in  the NIST Cloud Computing  Program  During FY 2013, the NIST Cloud Computing Team  continued to promote the development of publications,  national and international standards, and specifications in  support of the United States Government’s (USG) effective  and secure use of cloud computing, as well as providing  technical guidance to USG agencies for secure and effective  cloud-computing adoption. CSD supports many of the  technical standards activities supported by the NIST Cloud  Computing Program, with a particular focus on cloud- computing security. Activities included the following:  •  Led the development of the draft SP 500-299, NIST  Cloud Computing Security Reference Architecture  (SRA). SP 500-299 defines a modular framework that  provides a formal model and a methodology for the  secure adoption of cloud computing by applying a  Cloud-adapted Risk Management Framework (CRMF).  The SRA is a security overlay to SP 500-292, NIST  Cloud Computing Reference Architecture. During FY  2014, the draft document was completed, posted for  public comments, and the received comments were  addressed.  •  Co-led the development of the NISTIR 8006, Cloud  Forensics Challenges.  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  5 3  •  Led the development of an internal draft document,  Cloud-adapted Risk Management Framework: Guide  for Applying the Risk Management Framework to  Cloud-based Federal Information Systems. The docu- ment introduces a cloud customer-centric approach to  applying the risk management framework to cloud- based information systems. This internal draft has not  yet been released for public comment; it is currently  planned for future publication in the NIST SP 800  series.  •  Led the research and development of the data that  constitutes the foundation of an internal draft docu- ment, Security and Privacy Controls for Cloud-based  Federal Information Systems. The document will  provide a cloud overlay of NIST SP 800-53 Revision  4 security controls for cloud-based ecosystems. This  internal draft has not yet been released for public  comment; it is currently planned for future publication  in the NIST SP 800 series.  CSD staff members:  •  Organized and contributed to the seventh NIST Cloud  Computing Forum and Workshop: The Intersection of  Cloud and Mobility Forum, March 25-27, 2014; and,  •  Organized and contributed to the first NIST Cloud  Computing Forensic Science Workshop, March 24,  2014.  In support of USG cloud-computing mandates, CSD  staff members provided leadership for several public cloud  working groups operating under the NIST Cloud Computing  Program. These working groups focus on meeting the  high priority requirements contained in SP 500-293, U.S.  Government Cloud Computing Technology Roadmap.  CSD staff chaired or co-chaired several significant cloud  computing efforts in 2014:  •  Co-Chaired the NIST Cloud Computing Security Work- ing Group. Led the group on the development of the  SP 500-299, NIST Cloud Computing Security Reference  Architecture; SP 800-163, Cloud-adapted Risk Manage- ment Framework: Guide for Applying the Risk Manage- ment Framework to Cloud-based Federal Information  Systems; SP 800-174, Security and Privacy Controls for  Cloud-based Federal Information Systems  (all three  described above); and on researching cryptographic  key-management challenges in cloud ecosystems.  •  Co-Chaired the NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Sci- ence Working Group.

Addressed issues  facing cloud computing with respect to interoperability  and portability, standards, and common and functional  terminologies. The goal is to develop guidance and  best practices for cloud-computing interoperability and  portability that best enable business necessities, such  as the ability to exchange, use and reuse information/ data in a cloud environment.  •  Co-editor for ISO/IEC AWI 19941 Information technolo- gy – Cloud computing – Interoperability and Portability.  This is an effort to develop a standard that focuses on  defining the types of cloud-computing interoperabil- ity and portability; the relationship and interactions  between interoperability and portability; the contexts  where interoperability and portability are relevant in  cloud computing, with respect to the cloud-computing  reference architecture; and the common terminology  and concepts used to describe interoperability and  portability, particularly as they relate to cloud services.  •  Chair and Vice-Chair of INCITS CS1 (Cybersecurity) −  U.S. Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to the ISO/IEC  international committee JTC1/SC27 (IT Security Tech- niques). This group is concerned with the development  of cloud-computing taxonomy-related standards and  cloud computing security standards.  CSD staff members participated in various standards  development organizations, two of which are ISO/IEC JTC  1 Sub Committee 38 – Distributed Application Platforms  and Services (SC 38) and ISO/IEC JTC 1 Sub Committee  27 – IT Security Techniques (SC 27). In SC 38, CSD acts as  the co-convener for a collaborative ISO/ITU-T initiative on  cloud computing taxonomy that includes publication of  ISO/IEC 17788 – Information Technology – Cloud computing  – Overview and Vocabulary, and ISO/IEC 17789 Information  technology – Cloud computing – Reference Architecture.  These standards are a joint collaborative work between ITU-T  and ISO, and they are approved to be available at no charge.  Notably, the genesis for this international body of work is the  widely accepted and used cloud-computing definition found  in SP 800-145, NIST Definition of Cloud Computing.  There are three new standards under development:  •  ISO/IEC 19086 Information Technology - Cloud Com- puting - Service Level Agreement (SLA) Framework.  This international standard has three parts, where Part 1  specifies an overview of SLAs for cloud services, identi- fication of the relationship between the master service  agreement and the SLA, SLA concepts and require- ments that can be used to build SLAs, and terms  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  5 4  and metrics commonly used in SLAs for cloud services.  This standard is for the benefit and use of both the  provider and customer. Part 2 specifies a model and  metrics for describing and measuring properties of the  concepts and components in 19086. This standard is for  the benefit and use of both the provider and customer,  and Part 3 specifies core conformance requirements for  SLAs for cloud services for ISO/IEC 19086.  •  ISO/IEC 19941 Information Technology - Cloud Comput- ing – Interoperability and Portability. This international  standard specifies cloud-computing interoperability  and portability types; the relationship and interactions  between these two aspects; and common terminology  and concepts used to discuss interoperability and por- tability, particularly relating to cloud services.  •  ISO/IEC 19944 Information Technology - Cloud Com- puting - Data and their Flow across Devices and Cloud  Services. This International Standard defines the  reference architecture for mobile-to-cloud ecosystems,  while providing the necessary structure that allows for  data-flow transparency between portable devices and  the cloud services ecosystem.  CSD staff members are also actively participating in  the development of cloud-computing security standards,  primarily through INCITS CS1, SC 27, which is responsible  for cloud-computing security standards for ISO. CSD has  provided technical contributions based on SP 500-299  and continues to advocate for secure, non-proprietary  solutions. There is a continued contribution to a number of  cloud-related standards, including the recently approved  international standard, ISO/IEC 27018, Information  technology – Security techniques – Code of practice for  protection of personal identifiable information (PII) in public  clouds acting as PII processors, ISO/IEC WD 27036-4,  Information technology – Information security for supplier  relationships – Part 4: Guidelines for security of Cloud  services, and the commencement of a study period on cloud  components, controls and capabilities.  In FY 2014, the CSD members of the NIST cloud- computing team continued research in key areas of cloud  security, cloud interoperability and portability, cloud metrics,  cloud services, and cloud SLAs. They also presented the  results of cloud-computing research and development,  introduced the standards and specifications under  development, and provided the status of the NIST Cloud- Computing Program in a variety of domestic and international  conferences and workshops. CSD staff continues to engage  industry and federal agencies for inputs and collaborative  work through working groups, publications, and networking.

This included the publication of a detailed  Policy Machine specification as NISTIR 7987, Policy Machine:  Features, Architecture, and Specification, in May 2014.  The team also published a description of the benefits and  an approach of the Policy Machine’s integration of Access  Control and Data Services as a conference paper, On the  Unification of Access Control and Data Service, in the  proceedings of the IEEE 15th International Conference of  Information Reuse and Integration, August 2014. In addition,  CSD released its reference implementation of the Policy  Machine as open source (available at GitHub).  NIST and other members of an Ad Hoc INCITS working  group are developing a three-part Policy Machine standard,  under the title of Next Generation Access Control (NGAC),  under three sub-projects:  •  Project 2193–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Implementation Requirements, Protocols and API  Definitions;  •  Project 2194–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Functional Architecture; and  •  Project 2195–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Generic Operations & Abstract Data Structures.  The Policy Machine’s architecture was the basis for  the NGAC work within INCITS. An initial standard from this  work was published in 2013 and is now available from the  ANSI e-standards store as INCITS 499 – NGAC Functional  Architecture (NGAC–FA). The standard resulting from  Project 2195–D: NGAC Generic Operations & Abstract Data  Structures (NGAC-GOADS), has begun the approval process,  and is expected to reach the second Public Review stage in  the summer of 2015.  In FY 2015, CSD plans to issue a new version of its open- source distribution to reflect new features and enhanced  performance, and publish a NISTIR 7987 revision to reflect  greater consistence with NGAC’s suite of standards.  http://csrc.nist.gov/pm/  CONTACTS: Mr. David Ferraiolo  Mr. Serban Gavrila  (301) 975-3046  (301) 975-4242  david.ferraiolo@nist.gov  serban.gavrila@nist.gov  Virtual ization Security & Leveraging  Virtual ization for  Security  In FY 2014, CSD continued its research in key areas  of cloud and virtualization security by producing two  conference papers and one SP:  •  Conference Papers: “Analysis of Protection Options for  Virtualized Infrastructures in Infrastructure as a Service  Cloud ” and “Deployment-driven Security Configura- tion for Virtual Networks;” and  •  Special Publication: SP 800-125A, Security Recom- mendations for Hypervisor Deployment (submitted for  public comment).  The focus of research for FY 2015 in the area of Virtualized  Infrastructures is two-pronged. The first approach will focus  on identifying the security requirements for various use  cases involved in offering cloud services using virtualized  infrastructures and analyzing the protection options to  meet those security requirements in terms of their features,  security strengths and architectural foundation. The second  approach will focus on deriving secure configuration  operations in a specific area of virtualized infrastructure – the  Virtual Network – leveraging state-of-the-art architectural  paradigms, such as the Software-defined network (SDN).  The security recommendations for Hypervisor deployment  will cover two areas: one based on architectural choices, and  the other based on configuration parameters. For developing  the configuration parameters that form the basis of security  recommendations, the following approach will be adopted:  •  The baseline functions of the hypervisor will be iden- tified along with their associated interfaces and threat  sources; and  http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2014/NIST.IR.7987.pdf http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2014/NIST.IR.7987.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/pm/documents/ir2014_ferraiolo_final.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/pm/documents/ir2014_ferraiolo_final.pdf  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  5 6  •  The protection measures against those threats will then  form the security recommendations for hypervisor de- ployment. The security recommendations will cover all  known implementations of baseline functions, making  them applicable across multiple hypervisor designs.

Although these devices are relatively small and inexpensive,  they can be used for voice calls, simple text messages,  sending and receiving emails, browsing the web, online  banking and e-commerce, social networking, and many  functions once limited to laptop and desktop computers.  Smart phones and tablet devices have specialized built-in  hardware, such as photographic cameras, video cameras,  accelerometers, Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers,  and removable media readers. They also employ a wide range  of wireless interfaces, including infrared, Wireless Fidelity  (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, Near Field Communications (NFC), and  one or more types of cellular interfaces that provide network  connectivity across the globe. Naturally, just as consumers  and businesses can realize productivity gains from these  technologies, so can government agencies.  Like any new technology, smart phones present new  capabilities, but also a number of new security and privacy  challenges. As the pace of the technology life cycles  continues to increase, current Information Assurance  (IA) standards and processes must be updated and new  technologies adopted to allow government users to employ  the latest technologies that consumers can use without  sacrificing privacy and security.  NIST is conducting research in software-assurance  methodologies for smart phone software (i.e., applications,  commonly referred to as “apps”) and is working with other  government agencies and industry to bridge the security  gaps present with today’s smart phones. For example,  NIST developed an app-vetting system and framework  for managing an organization’s app-vetting process with  respect to the organization’s security and privacy policies  and requirements. This system was used by the Defense  Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to vet apps  prior to being deployed on thousands of military mobile  devices for use in the current U.S. war theater, the 2013  Presidential Inauguration, and the 2014 Boston Marathon.  NIST’s work in mobile security has earned the 2014  Government Computer News (GCN) award for Information  Technology Excellence and the 2013 U.S. Department  of Commerce Gold Medal Award. For FY 2015, NIST will  continue to develop and transition mobile security-related  technologies, publish guidance on issues of mobile security,  and provide mobile security expertise to industry and other  government agencies.

The primary  motivations for the development of IPv6 were to increase  the number of unique IP addresses available for use and to  handle the needs of new Internet applications and devices.  In addition, IPv6 was designed with the following goals:  increased ease of network management and configuration,  expandable IP headers, improved mobility and security, and  the quality of service controls. IPv6 has been, and continues  to be, developed and defined by the Internet Engineering  Task Force (IETF).  FY 2012 was a significant year for the deployment  of IPv6 in the United States Government (USG). OMB’s  Memo of September 10, 2010, Transition to IPv6, required  all government agencies to “upgrade public/external  facing servers and services (e.g., web, email, Domain Name  System (DNS), Internet Service Provider (ISP) services) to  operationally use IPv6 by the end of FY 2012.” NIST worked  with the USGv6 Task Force and with individual government  agencies to achieve this goal. NIST developed an online  monitor to demonstrate which high-level government  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  5 7  domains have met this goal with respect to DNS services,  email, web servers, and Domain Name System Security  Extensions (DNSSEC). In FY 2013, NIST and OMB continued  to use this monitor to measure USGv6 compliance with  OMB’s requirement.  Additional OMB IPv6 requirements were mandated  for FY 2014. Agencies were required to “upgrade internal  client applications that communicate with public Internet  servers and supporting enterprise networks to operationally  use IPv6 by the end of FY 2014.” NIST developed online  diagnostic tools to help agencies verify compliance to this  requirement.  The NIST IPv6 Test Program, whose goal is to  provide assurance on IPv6 product conformance and  interoperability, continues to operate. In FY 2015, NIST will  continue to manage and evolve the USGv6 Test Program  and to help federal agencies fulfill OMB mandates and  monitor compliance to those mandates. The NIST program is  a collaboration between CSD and the Advanced Networking  Technology Division.  http://www.antd.nist.gov/usgv6  CONTACTS: Ms. Sheila Frankel  Mr. Douglas Montgomery  (301) 975-3297  (301) 975-3630  sheila.frankel@nist.gov  dougm@nist.gov  A C C E S S  C O N T R O L  A N D  P R I V I L E G E  M A N A G E M E N T  Access Control  and Privi lege  Management Research  With the advance of current computing technologies  and the diverse environments in which these technologies  are used, security issues, such as situational awareness, trust  management, preservation of privacy in access control, and  privilege-management systems, are becoming increasingly  complex. Practical and conceptual guidance for these topics  is needed.  In FY 2014, the following research was accomplished for  this project:  •  Enhanced the unified enforcement mechanism of data  services for use by a Policy Machine (PM) for an enter- prise computing environment;  •  Enhanced the capabilities of the Access Control Policy  Tool (ACPT);  •  Implemented a fault-detection method for an access  control rule using Simulated Logic Circuit algorithms;  •  Studied formal Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)  models;  •  Published the SP 800-162, Guide to Attribute Based  Access Control (ABAC) Definition and Considerations,  which provides information for function components,  as well as an enterprise consideration of ABAC;  •  Studied an Access Control scheme for Big Data Pro- cessing; and  •  Studied an assurance mechanism for ABAC attributes.  In FY 2015, CSD will continue the above research, and  present the most updated results in CSD’s CSRC website.  CSD expects that this project will:  •  Promote (or accelerate) the adoption of community  computing that utilizes the power of shared resources  and common trust-management schemes;  •  Provide guidance for implementing access control  models and mechanisms for standalone or enterprise  systems;  •  Increase the security and safety of static (connected)  distributed systems by applying the testing and verifi- cation tool for the access control policies;  •  Assist system architects, security administrators, and  security managers whose expertise is related to access  control or privilege policy in managing their systems  and in learning the limitations and practical approaches  for their applications; and  •  Provide accurate and efficient fault detection and  correction technology for implementing access control  rules and policies.

Thus, an access- control model provides unambiguous and precise expression,  as well as a reference for design and implementation of  security requirements. Techniques are required for verifying  whether an access-control model is correctly expressed in  the access-control policies and whether the properties are  satisfied in the model.  Most research on AC model or policy verification  techniques are focused on one particular model, and almost  all of the research is in applied methods, which require the  completed AC policies as the input for verification or test  processes to generate fault reports. Even though correct  verification is achieved, and counterexamples may be  generated when faults were found, those methods provide  no information about the source of faults that might allow  conflicts in privilege assignment, leakage of privileges, or  conflict of interest permissions. The difficulty in finding the  source of faults is increased, especially when the AC rules  are intricately covering duplicated variables to a degree of  complexity. The complexity is due to the fact that a fault  might not be caused by one particular rule. Thus, it requires  manually analyzing each rule in the policy in order to find the  correct solution for the fault.  To address the issue, CSD researched the AC Rule Logic  Circuit Simulation (ACRLCS) technique, which enables the  AC authors to detect a fault when the fault-causing AC rule  is added to the policy, so the fix can be implemented in  real time before adding other rules that further complicate  the detecting effort. Rather than checking by retracing the  interrelations between rules after the policy is completed,  the policy author needs to only check the newly added  rule against previous “correct” ones. In ACRLCS, AC rules  are represented in a Simulated Logic Circuit (SLC). The  use of simulation may restrict ACRLCS implementation on  a physical electronic circuit; however, the concept can be  implemented and computed through simulated software. In  FY 2014, CSD accomplished the following:  •  Researched the ACRLCS, and implemented a prototype  access control rule composing system - the Access  Control Rule Logic Circuit Simulation System;  •  Worked with industrial and academic organizations in  exploring new capabilities that helped to improve the  usability of the AC tools (ACPT and ACRLCS);  •  Enhanced the capability of ACPT by improving user in- terfaces and adding privilege inheritance and multiple  policy combination algorithms;  •  Performed prototype testing; and  •  ACPT was downloaded by 277 users and organizations.  In FY 2015, CSD is planning to conduct further research  on the new capabilities and enhance performance of the  ACPT and ACRLCS.

ABAC  represents a point on the spectrum of logical access control,  from simple access control lists to more capable role-based  access (RBAC), and finally, to a highly flexible method for  providing access based on the evaluation of attributes.  There has not been a comprehensive effort to formally  define or guide the implementation of ABAC within the  Federal Government. This research provides considerations  for using ABAC to improve information sharing within and  among organizations, while maintaining control of that  information. The research serves a two-fold purpose. First,  it aims to provide federal agencies with a definition of ABAC  and a description of the functional components of ABAC.  Second, it provides planning, design, implementation, and  operational considerations for employing ABAC within a  large enterprise with the goal of improving information  sharing while maintaining control of that information.  In addition to the core concept (i.e. definition and  consideration), ABAC research includes technologies such  as attribute assurance, attribute engineering/management,  identity system integration, attribute federation, situational  awareness (real time or contextual) mechanism, policy  management, and natural-language policy translation to  digital policy.  In FY 2014, CSD published SP 800-162, Guide to  Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Definition and  Considerations. SP 800-162 includes terminology and basic  understanding of ABAC; ABAC enterprise-employment  considerations during the initiation, acquisition/development,  implementation/assessment, and operations and  maintenance phases; and an example to demonstrate how  ABAC is implemented in a Web Information Portal. CSD also  researched ABAC formal models; the result will be presented  in a NISTIR that will describe a variety of characteristics  and applications of ABAC formal models. CSD also started  research on the Attribute Assurance of ABAC in partnership  with the National Security Agency (NSA), the National  Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), and  the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE);  CSD developed a white paper based on the mechanism for  defining the levels of assurance of ABAC attributes, as well  as collecting use cases, current standards, and engineering  experiences through a Request for Information (RFI) and  working with ABAC user/commercial product communities.  In FY 2015, CSD will continue the research of ABAC  formal models, as well as details and extended topics of  ABAC capabilities, such as Attribute Assurance, ABAC  implementation examples, and ABAC standards. The ABAC  project will pursue the following objectives:  •  Provide readers with the terminology and a basic un- derstanding of ABAC;  •  Provide readers with an overview of the current state  of logical access control, a working definition of ABAC,  and an explanation of the core and enterprise ABAC  concepts;  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  6 0  •  Assist security policy makers in establishing a busi- ness case for ABAC implementation, and acquiring an  interoperable set of capabilities;  •  Assist ABAC developers in developing the operational  requirements and overall enterprise architecture;  •  Assist ABAC administrators in establishing or refining  business processes to support ABAC; and  •  Promote the adoption of ABAC for a more secure and  flexible method for information sharing in a standalone  or enterprise environment.  http://csrc.nist.gov/projects/abac/  CONTACTS: Dr. Vincent Hu  Mr. David Ferraiolo  (301) 975-4975  (301) 975-3046  vhu@nist.gov  david.ferraiolo@nist.gov  Mr. Rick Kuhn  (301) 975-3337  kuhn@nist.gov  Figure 21: ABAC Access Control Mechanism Chart  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  6 1  A D VA N C E D  S E C U R I T Y  T E S T- I N G  A N D  M E A S U R E M E N T S  Security Automation and Continuous  Monitoring  IT organizations operate a diverse set of computing  assets that access, route, store, and process information that  is critical to the operations of businesses and the missions  of government agencies. These IT environments are  frequently reconfigured, and are under constant threat of  attack. The wide variety of computing products, the speed  of configuration change, and the diversity of threats require  organizations to maintain situational awareness over their  IT assets and to utilize this information to make risk-based  decisions.  Security automation utilizes standardized data formats  and transport protocols to enable data to be exchanged  between business, operational, and security systems that  support security processes by:  • Identifying IT assets;  •  Providing awareness over the operational state of com- puting devices;  •  Enabling security reference data to be collected from  internal and external sources; and  •  Supporting analysis processes that measure the effec- tiveness of security controls and provide visibility into  security risks, enabling risk-based decision making.  Commercial solutions built using security-automation  specifications enable the collection and harmonization of  vast amounts of operational and security data into coherent,  comparable information streams to achieve situational  awareness that allows timely and active management of  diverse IT systems. Through the creation of reference data  and guidance, and the international recognition of flexible,  open standards, the NIST security-automation program  works to improve the interoperability, broad acceptance,  and adoption of security-automation solutions to  address current and future security challenges, creating  opportunities for innovation.  Specif ication,  Standards,  and Guidance  Development  To support the overarching security automation vision, it  is necessary to have specifications that describe the required  interactions between systems, standards that document  international consensus approaches, and guidance that  informs product developers and implementers. Through  close work with partners in government, industry, and  academia, NIST CSD continues to facilitate the definition  and development of security automation approaches that  enable organizations to understand and manage IT security  risks.  During FY 2014, CSD worked to build on previous  security automation work by:  •  Participating in working groups in standards develop- ment organizations to promote international consensus  around standardized approaches;  •  Identifying and addressing gaps in the current specifi- cations;  •  Evolving existing approaches to achieve greater scal- ability and impact;  •  Providing additional guidance on architectural, design,  and analysis concerns; and  •  The development and maintenance of tools and refer- ence implementations.  CSD is currently working with its partners in various  standards-development organizations, including the  International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the  Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Forum of Incident  Response and Security Teams (FIRST), and the Trusted  Computing Group (TCG), to further mature and broaden the  adoption of security-automation specifications, reference  data, and techniques. This area of work is focused on evolving  security-automation specifications to integrate with existing  transport protocols to provide for the secure, interoperable  exchange of security-automation data. Additional work  is focused on evolving security metrics and providing  consensus guidance on security-automation approaches.  Through the definition and adoption of security-automation  standards and guidelines, IT vendors will be able to provide  standardized security solutions to their customers. These  solutions support continuous monitoring and automated,  dynamic network defense capabilities based on the analysis  of data from operational and security data sources and the  collective action of security components.

The following sections detail this work.  Security Content  Automation Protocol  (SCAP)  SCAP is a multipurpose protocol that provides an  automated means to collect and assess the state of devices.  SCAP supports automated vulnerability checking, verifying  the installation of patches, checking-security configuration  settings, verifying technical-control compliance, measuring  security, and examining systems for indicators of a  compromise. SCAP uses the Extensible Markup Language  (XML) to standardize the format and nomenclature by which  security software products communicate information about  software flaws, security configurations, and other aspects  of device state. SCAP enables security-automation content,  also known as “SCAP content,” to be expressed using  standardized formats, identifiers, and scoring models. This  content can be used by any tool that is conformant to the  specifications, to collect and evaluate the state of software  installed on a device.  SCAP has been widely adopted by major software  and hardware manufacturers and has become a significant  component of information-security-management and  governance programs. SCAP-enabled tools are currently  being used by the U.S. Government, critical-infrastructure  companies, academia, and other businesses, both  domestically and internationally. Currently, CSD is leveraging  SCAP in multiple areas, both to support its own mission  and to enable other agencies and private-sector entities  to meet their goals. For CSD, SCAP is a critical component  of the SCAP Validation Program, the National Vulnerability  Database (NVD), and the National Checklist Program (NCP).  In September 2012, CSD published SP 800-126  Revision 2, The Technical Specification for the Security  Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2.  That document describes the 11 component specifications  composing SCAP.  See Table on next page.  Since the release of SCAP 1.2, CSD has worked to improve  guidance around the SCAP specifications by promoting a  broader international adoption of SCAP, encouraging the  integration of SCAP into other standards, and by adapting  SCAP to address specific gaps and challenges. The sections  describe work activities performed during FY 2014.  CSD has continued its collaboration with industry  partners in the IETF Security Automation and Continuous  Monitoring (SACM) working group. This working group  provides a venue for advancing appropriate SCAP  specifications into international standards and addressing  identified gap areas. The current scope of work for SACM  includes identifying and/or defining the transport protocols  and data formats needed to support the collection and  evaluation of a device state against the expected values  and standards for interacting with repositories of security- automation content. Over the past twelve months, the SACM  working group has been working on identifying use cases,  requirements, and architectural models to inform decisions  about existing specifications and standards that can be  referenced, required modifications or extensions to existing  specifications and standards, and any gaps that need to be  addressed.  The working group has been developing the following  Internet drafts:  INTERNET DRAFT PURPOSE  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm- terminology/  Definition of the common terminology used within a  number of working-group documents.  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-use-cases/ Description of use cases and related capabilities to guide  the development of requirements, architecture, and  specifications for data models and transports.  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm- requirements/  Listing architectural and specification requirements for  SACM specifications.  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-terminology/ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-terminology/ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-use-cases/ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-requirements/ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-requirements/  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  6 3  For more information, please refer to:  http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/sacm/charter/  Additionally, CSD collaborated with industry partners  to revise the ISO/IEC 19770-2:2009 standard, Information  technology—Software asset management—Part 2: Software  identification tag, which establishes a specification for  tagging software to support identification and management.  This software-identification (SWID) data model defines a  mechanism for software publishers to provide authoritative  identification, categorization, software relationship (e.g.,  dependency, bundling, and patch), executable and library  footprint details, and other metadata for software that they  publish. This information enhances the SCAP use cases  by providing authoritative information for the creation of  Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) names, the targeting  of checklists, and associating software flaws to products  based on a defect in a software library or executable.  CSD also worked with government and industry partners  in the TCG to define a number of specifications related to  the Trusted Network Connect (TNC) protocols.

The second is the TNC Enterprise Compliance  Profile (ECP) and related specifications that support the  exchange of SWID data over the TNC protocols. The ECP  enables the collection of SWID data from a device for use  by external tools to provide software inventory information.  SCAP and SWID data collected using these mechanisms  may be optionally used for network access-control decision  making, allowing the device state to be evaluated when  devices connect and on an ongoing basis thereafter.  For more information on these specifications, please  visit: http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/ tnc_scap_messages_for_ifm, and  http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_ endpoint_compliance_profile_specification.  Finally, CSD has worked with the Forum of Incident  Response and Security Teams (FIRST) by participating in  two Special Interest Groups (SIG). The CVSS SIG (CVSS-SIG)  focused on defining CVSS Revision 3, which is intended to  implement improvements to the scoring model, based on  community feedback. The CVSS-SIG is currently working  on the CVSS revision, which will be released in FY 2015. The  second SIG, the Vulnerability Reporting and Data eXchange  SIG (VRDX-SIG), researches and recommends methods for  identifying and exchanging vulnerability information across  disparate vulnerability databases.  For more information, please visit:  http://www.first.org/global/sigs.  Through work with international SDOs, SCAP and  related security-automation capabilities are expected  to evolve and expand in support of the growing need to  define and measure effective security controls, assess and  monitor ongoing aspects of information security, remediate  noncompliance, and successfully manage systems in  accordance with the Risk Management Framework  described in SP 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying  the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information  Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach. Standards that are  developed and published by these SDOs will be considered  for inclusion in future revisions of SCAP.  http://scap.nist.gov/  CONTACT: Mr. David Waltermire  (301) 975-3390  david.waltermire@nist.gov  Continuous Monitoring In September 2010, the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) released the Continuous Asset Evaluation,  Situational Awareness and Risk Scoring (CAESARS)  Reference Architecture Report. This report identifies  commonality and strengths in the custom approaches used  by civilian agencies to provide solutions that enable the  continuous monitoring of IT systems. This report identifies  “essential functional components of a security risk-scoring  system, independent of specific technologies, products,  or vendors.” It describes the use of security-automation  specifications, such as the SCAP, to enable continuous  monitoring solutions.  In October 2010, the Federal Chief Information  Officer Council’s Information Security and Identity  Management Committee’s (ISIMC) subcommittee on  Continuous Monitoring and Risk Scoring saw the need to  create a technical initiative to expand upon the CAESARS  architecture to better scale it to large enterprises (e.g., the  entire U.S. Government). A team of researchers from the  NSA Information Assurance Directorate (IAD), the DHS  Federal Network Security CAESARS team, and CSD worked  together to respond to this need. The draft CAESARS  Framework Extension (CAESARS-FE) described by Draft  NISTIR 7756, CAESARS Framework Extension: An Enterprise  Continuous Monitoring Technical Reference Architecture, is  the output of this collaboration.  Draft NISTIR 7756 presents an enterprise continuous- monitoring (ConMon) technical reference architecture that  extends the framework provided by the DHS’s CAESARS  architecture. The primary goal of this effort is to enable  enterprise ConMon by supporting the development and  deployment of capabilities that support automated,  enterprise-wide ConMon functions. The concepts,  workflows, and subsystems presented in this document  can be used by organizations seeking to establish federated  queries, an orchestration of data-collection tasks, data  analytics, and presentation and reporting capabilities  across a diverse portfolio of security and IT products.  CAESARS-FE supports IT operations and network-defense  capabilities, with compliance reporting as a byproduct of  actual security monitoring and improvement. CAESARS- FE enables organizations to design, develop, and deploy  ConMon capabilities by leveraging their existing security and  IT tools, while minimizing custom tool-integration efforts.  CAESARS-FE defines the requisite functionality needed  to ensure the interoperability of vendor products, while  continuing to encourage security-tool-vendor participation  and innovation.  http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_scap_messages_for_ifm http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_scap_messages_for_ifm http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_endpoint_compliance_profile_specification http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_endpoint_compliance_profile_specification http://www.first.org/global/sigs  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  6 5  To advance the state-of-the-art in continuous- monitoring capabilities and to further interoperability within  commercially available tools, CSD is working with the IETF  SACM working group to develop data-model and transport  standards to support enterprise continuous monitoring. The  CAESARS-FE reference architecture will evolve as consensus  is developed within SACM around interoperable, standards- based approaches that enable continuous monitoring of IT  systems. CSD is working to complete an update to NISTIR  7756 that provides additional guidance for the development  of ConMon architectures and solutions based on ongoing  standards activities and feedback.  The NIST National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence  (NCCoE) is also working to develop a series of ConMon  building blocks that demonstrate cybersecurity solutions  that apply across multiple industry sectors. The first building  block, currently under development, proposes a standardized  approach to software-asset management, providing an  organization with an integrated view of software throughout  its lifecycle. The building block will support:  •  Authorization and verification of software installation  media—The ability to verify that software media is from  a trusted publisher and that the integrity of the installa- tion media has been maintained;  •  Software-execution whitelisting—The execution envi- ronment verifies that the software to be executed, is  authorized for execution, and that the executable file(s)  and any associated shared libraries have not been  tampered with;  •  Publication of an installed software inventory—When  connected to an authorized network, a device’s full  or updated software inventory is securely reported to  an external configuration-management database that  aggregates the software inventory of multiple devices  for further analysis; and  •  Software inventory-based network access control—  Control access to network resources at the time of  a connect operation, based on the published, in- stalled-software inventory. Access to network resourc- es can be limited if software is outdated or patches are  not installed in accordance with digital policies.  When used together, these capabilities enable the  enterprise-wide management of the software that is allowed  to be installed and executed. The collected information  will also provide software-version information to support  license, vulnerability and patch management needs. If  historic software-inventory information is maintained,  retroactive analysis techniques can be applied on this data  to determine historic vulnerable conditions in support of  incident-response and recovery processes. Finally, using  the collected software inventory, network access can  be controlled, enabling the device to be connected to a  remediation network, if necessary, so that the appropriate  software changes can be made before allowing the device  full access to the operational network.  The building-block document, Continuous Monitoring  Building Block: Software Asset Management, can be viewed  at http://nccoe.nist.gov/content/continuous-monitoring. In  early FY 2015, the team will publish an update to the  building-block document and will begin work with vendors  to develop a solutions demonstration. Through this process,  CSD provides publicly available descriptions of the practical  steps needed to implement the technical approaches  defined by the building block.

SCAP, and  the programs that leverage it, are moving the information  assurance industry towards being able to standardize  communications and the collection and storage of relevant  data in standardized formats, and to provide an automated  means for the assessment and remediation of systems for  both vulnerabilities and configuration compliance.  National  Vulnerabi l i ty  Database (NVD) Security automation reference data is currently  housed within the NVD. The NVD is the U.S. Government  repository of security automation data based on security  automation specifications. This data provides a standards- based foundation for the automation of software asset,  vulnerability, and security configuration management;  security measurement; and compliance activities. This data  supports security automation efforts based on the SCAP. The  NVD includes databases of security configuration checklists  for the NCP, listings of publicly known software flaws,  product names, and impact metrics. A formal validation  program tests the ability of vendor products to use some  forms of security automation data, based on a product’s  conformance in support of specific enterprise capabilities.  http://nccoe.nist.gov/content/continuous-monitoring  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  6 6  SCAP defines the structure of standardized software  flaws and security configuration reference data, also known  as SCAP content. This reference data is provided by the NVD  (http://nvd.nist.gov/).  As of October 2014, the NVD contained the following  resources:  •  Over 65 000 vulnerability advisories, with an average  of 40 new vulnerabilities added daily;  •  56 SCAP-expressed checklists containing thousands  of low-level security configuration checks that can be  used by SCAP-validated security products to perform  automated evaluations of the system state;  •  197 non-SCAP security checklists (e.g., English prose  guidance and configuration scripts);  •  248 U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US- CERT) alerts; 3690 US-CERT vulnerability summaries;  and 10 286 SCAP machine-readable software flaw  checks;  •  A product dictionary with over 97 000 operating sys- tem, application, and hardware name entries; and  •  50 038 vulnerability advisories translated into Spanish.  NVD is hosted and maintained by NIST and is sponsored  by the Department of Homeland  Security’s US-CERT.  The use of SCAP data by commercial security products,  deployed in thousands of organizations worldwide, has  extended NVD’s effective reach. Increasing demand for NVD  XML data feeds (i.e., mechanisms that provide updated data  from data sources) and SCAP-expressed content from the  NVD website demonstrates an increased adoption of SCAP.  The NVD continues to play a pivotal role in the Payment  Card Industry (PCI) efforts to mitigate vulnerabilities in credit  card systems. PCI mandates the use of NVD vulnerability  severity scores in measuring the risk to payment card  servers worldwide and for prioritizing vulnerability patching.  PCI’s use of NVD severity scores helps enhance credit card  transaction security and protects consumers’ personal  information.  During FY 2014, the NVD infrastructure has been  significantly changed to improve responsiveness and  availability and to position the NVD for future improvements,  which will be coming soon. NVD now hosts the SP 800-53  Revision 4 security controls content and will host the SP  800-53A Revision 4 content when that publication becomes  final. NVD data is substantially increasing the security of  networks worldwide, and it is a fundamental component of  CSD’s security automation infrastructure. CSD plans for the  NVD in FY 2015 include improvements in the organization  and layout of the NVD to assist new users in locating  content, the addition of visualization options of the NVD  data for security researchers, and an implementation of the  forthcoming release of the Common Vulnerability Scoring  System (CVSS) version 3 specifications from FIRST.  http://nvd.nist.gov  CONTACT: Mr. Harold Booth  (301) 975-8441  harold.booth@nist.gov  Computer  Security Incident  Coordination  Recognizing that even well-engineered and administered  computing systems are sometimes successfully attacked,  it is important to establish and maintain processes and  procedures for responding to and recovering from attacks.  SP 800-61 Revision 2, Computer Security Incident Handling  Guide, provides guidance that helps organizations establish  and operate a Computer Security Incident Response  Team (CSIRT). When an attack has the potential to affect  computing systems in multiple organizations, information  sharing and coordination among organizations can make it  possible to reduce the impact of the attack, speed recovery  operations, and maintain a higher level of operational  security.  CSD is working with the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) to develop guidance on Computer Security  Incident Coordination (CSIC). The goal of CSIC is to help  diverse collections of organizations to effectively collaborate  in the handling of computer security incidents. Effective  collaboration raises numerous issues on how and when to  share information between organizations, and in what form  information should be shared. Because each organization  may have substantially different capabilities for responding  to attacks, diagnosing causes, and handling sensitive  incident-related information, guidance is needed to help  organizations interoperate despite these organizational  differences.  The CSIC initiative is focused on the development  of a Special Publication (SP) that provides guidance on  how organizations can establish information sharing and  coordination capabilities in advance of incidents in order  to be prepared to operate swiftly and with coordination  during incidents. The guidance covers information sharing  architectures; risk-informed incident response capabilities;  data privacy and sensitivity; data collection and retention  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  6 7  practices; and the use of open standards for information  exchange, redaction, and guidance on how an organization  can establish, participate in, and maintain coordination and  information-sharing relationships.  The CSIC guidance will help incident responders,  network defenders, and operations personnel consider  what information could be shared, the circumstances under  which sharing is permitted, whom it can be shared with,  and how the information should be protected. One of the  key objectives of information sharing and coordination is to  enable organizations to harness the collective knowledge  and experience of their sharing partners to enhance  protective measures, speed incident detection, augment  analysis capabilities, and enhance containment, eradication,  and recovery processes.  In early FY 2015, CSD plans to release a Draft SP  that provides guidance for Computer Security Incident  Coordination. After the public comment period for the  draft, a final version of the publication will be prepared and  released later in the fiscal year.  CONTACTS: Mr. Lee Badger  Mr. David Waltermire  (301) 975-3176  (301) 975-3390  lee.badger@nist.gov david.waltermire@nist.gov  Mr. Christopher Johnson  (301) 975-3247  christopher.johnson@nist.gov  National  Checkl ist  Program (NCP) There are many threats to information technology (IT),  ranging from remotely launched network service exploits to  malicious code spread through infected emails, websites,  and downloaded files. Vulnerabilities in IT products are  discovered daily, and many ready-to-use exploitation  techniques are widely available on the Internet. Because IT  products are often intended for a wide variety of audiences,  restrictive security configuration controls are usually not  enabled by default. As a result, many out-of-the box IT  products are immediately vulnerable. In addition, identifying  a reasonable set of security settings that achieve balanced  risk management is a complicated, arduous, and time- consuming task, even for experienced system administrators.  To facilitate the development of security configuration  checklists for IT products and to make checklists more  organized and usable, NIST’s CSD established the National  Checklist Program (NCP) in furtherance of its statutory  responsibilities under the Federal Information Security  Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347, and  also under the Cybersecurity Research and Development  Act, which tasks NIST to “develop, and revise as necessary,  a checklist setting forth settings and option selections that  minimize the security risks associated with each computer  hardware or software system that is, or is likely to become,  widely used within the Federal Government.” In February  2008, revised Part 39 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR) was published. Paragraph (d) of section 39.101 states,  “In acquiring information technology, agencies shall include  the appropriate IT security policies and requirements,  including use of common security configurations available  from the NIST website at http://checklists.nist.gov. Agency  contracting officers should consult with the requiring official  to ensure the appropriate standards are incorporated.”  In Memorandum M-08-22, the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) mandated the use of SCAP-validated  products for continuous monitoring of Federal Desktop  Core Configuration (FDCC) compliance. The NCP strives to  encourage and assist federal agencies with these mandates.  The goals of the NCP are to:  •  Facilitate the development and sharing of checklists by  providing a formal framework for checklist developers  to submit checklists to NIST;  •  Provide guidance to developers to help them create  standardized, high-quality checklists that conform to  common operation environments;  •  Help developers and users by providing guidelines for  making checklists better documented and more usable;  •  Encourage software vendors and other parties to de- velop checklists;  •  Provide a managed process for the review, update, and  maintenance of checklists;  •  Provide an easy-to-use repository of checklists; and  •  Encourage the use of automation technologies (e.g.,  SCAP) for checklist application.  There are 253 checklists posted on the website  (http://checklists.nist.gov); 120 of the checklists, addressing  48 platforms, are SCAP-expressed and can be used with  SCAP-validated products. The majority of the SCAP- expressed checklists have been posted in the past three  years, demonstrating continual use and adoption of this  automated means of expressing checklist content.  Organizations can use checklists obtained from the  NCP website for automated security configuration patch  assessment. The NCP currently hosts SCAP checklists for  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  6 8  Internet Explorer 9.0, Internet Explorer 10.0, Office 2010,  Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows  Server 2012, and other products.  To assist users in identifying automated checklist  content, NCP groups these checklists into tiers, from Tier I to  Tier IV. The NCP uses the tiers to rank checklists according  to their automation capability. Tier III and IV checklists  include SCAP content and have been validated by the SCAP  content validation tool as conforming to the requirements  outlined in SP 800-126, The Technical Specification for  the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). Tier IV  checklists are considered production-ready and have been  validated by NIST or a NIST recognized authoritative entity  to ensure interoperability with SCAP-validated products to  the maximum extent possible.  Tier III checklists use SCAP content to document security  settings and should be compatible with SCAP-validated  products. Tier II checklists document recommended security  settings in a machine-readable, nonstandard format, such  as a proprietary format or a product-specific configuration  script. Tier I checklists are prose-based and contain no  machine-readable content. Users can browse the checklists,  based on the checklist tier, IT product, IT product category,  or authority, and through a keyword search that searches the  checklist name and summary for user specified terms. The  search results show the detailed checklist metadata and a  link to any SCAP content for the checklist, as well as links to  any supporting resources associated with the checklist.  To assist checklist developers, the NCP provides both  manual and automated interfaces to facilitate submission  and maintenance processes. The manual interface consists  of a web application that guides the submitter through  the data entry process to ensure that all of the required  information is submitted. The submission is validated  upon review, and a report is returned to the submitting  organization, verifying either acceptance or rejection, based  on the criteria requirements. For instance, Tier III and Tier  IV checklists require validation using the SCAP Content  Validation Tool (this tool is available for download via  http://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.2/#tools).  The NCP is defined in SP 800-70 Revision 2, National  Checklist Program for IT Products—Guidelines for  Checklist Users and Developers, which can be found at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.  http://checklists.nist.gov  CCCCONTACT: Mr. Stephen Quinn  (301) 975-6967  stephen.quinn@nist.gov  United States Government  Configuration Basel ine (USGCB) /  FDCC Basel ines  The United States Government Configuration Baseline  (USGCB) initiative creates security configuration baselines  for information technology (IT) products widely deployed  across the federal agencies. The project evolved from the  Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) mandate  originally described in a March 2007 memorandum  from the U.S. White House Office of Management and  Budget (Memorandum M-07-11). USGCB helps to improve  information security and reduce overall IT operating costs  by providing commonly accepted security configurations for  major operating systems.  Through the National Checklist Program described in  SP 800-70 Revision 2, National Checklist Program for IT  Products: Guidelines for Checklist Users and Developers,  a baseline submitter may express interest in submitting a  candidate for use in the USGCB program.  CSD provides ongoing support for the USGCB  automation content, including periodic updates, assisting  USGCB users in continuously monitoring and assessing  security compliance of information systems. This ongoing  monitoring element supports the Risk Management  Framework described in SP 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for  Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal  Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach. It also  supports the Core functions of the Cybersecurity Framework,  providing USGCB users with settings that protect digital  assets and enable detection of suspicious activity.  During FY 2015, the USGCB Program will continue to  provide ongoing maintenance of the baseline artifacts and  to consider additional applicable platforms.

The configurations will be based on a collection of  resources, including the existing NIST OS X configuration  guidance, the OS X security configuration guide, the  Department of Defense (DOD) OS X Recommended Settings,  and the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) OS X  Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG). The project  team is aggregating 400 initial settings, determining which  settings will be included in the configuration baseline, and  determining appropriate values for each included setting.  As the desired configuration items are established, the team  is developing shell scripts that apply the settings to an OS  X 10.8 system. The settings are organized into three key  baselines, which are appropriate for different environments:  •  The Enterprise baseline is appropriate for centrally  managed, networked systems.  •  The Small Office Home Office baseline is appropriate  for systems that are deployed remotely, but need to  connect to enterprise networks.  •  The Special Security Limited Functionality baseline is  appropriate for systems where security requirements  are more stringent and where the implementation of  security safeguards is likely to reduce functionality.  SCAP, defined and discussed in other sections of this  report, is used to express configuration settings and check  system configuration compliance.  During FY 2013, CSD provided a block of initial settings  to Apple and these settings were posted for the Apple  community on a periodic basis for public review, discussion,  correction and agreement. Each setting has a designated  Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) number, which  aids in long-term tracking of the setting. Once these settings  are vetted by Apple, the settings will then be tested and  included in the configuration baselines. In addition, CSD is  producing a draft guideline, Guide to Securing Apple OS X  10.8 Systems for IT Professionals. This guidance, similar in  structure to the SP 800-68, Windows XP Security Guide, will  provide detailed information about the security of Apple OS  X 10.8, and will provide security configuration guidelines for  all users of the Apple OS X 10.8 operating system.  During FY 2014, a majority of all proposed settings were  scripted. The corresponding spreadsheet batches have been  sent to Apple for feedback; approximately 230 settings are  now completed. Settings have also been implemented on OS  X 10.9, when possible. Work on the draft guideline, Guide to  Securing Apple OS X 10.8 Systems for IT Professionals, was  temporarily suspended while configuration setting research  was performed, but will be resumed in FY 2015.  In FY 2015, CSD plans to finish scripting the few  remaining OS X settings. The draft publication, Guide to  Securing Apple OS X 10.8 Systems for IT Professionals will  also be completed and made available for public comment.  One of the script’s three profiles will be deployed on select  CSD systems to test the extended use of a system with a  specific profile applied. CSD plans to continue improving the  script after all settings are implemented.

Vulnerabilities are regularly discovered in software  applications that are exploited to stage cyber attacks.  System administrators need objective metrics to guide  and justify decision making as they manage the security  risk of enterprise networks. The objective of this research  is to develop a standard model for security risk analysis of  computer networks. A standard model will enable NIST to  answer questions such as “Are we more secure now than  yesterday?” or “How does the security of one network  configuration compare with another one?” Also, having a  standard model to measure network security will allow users,  vendors, and researchers to evaluate methodologies and  products for network security in a coherent and consistent  manner.

CSD’s methodology for security risk  analysis is based on attack graphs. CSD analyzes attack  paths through a network, providing a probabilistic metric of  the overall system risk. Through this metric, CSD analyzes  trade-offs between security costs and security benefits.  Computer systems are vulnerable to both known  and zero-day attacks. Handling zero-day vulnerabilities  is inherently difficult, due to their unpredictable nature.  In FY 2014, CSD attempted to model network diversity  for evaluating the resilience of networks against zero- day attacks. CSD developed a formal model for network  diversity as a security metric for evaluating the robustness of  networks against potential zero-day attacks. CSD has  proposed a new metric based on the least and average  attacking effort. CSD has authored a paper, “Modeling  Network Diversity for Evaluating the Robustness of Networks  against Zero- Day Attacks,” that was presented at the 19th  European Symposium on Research in Computer Security  (ESORICS), Wroclaw, Poland, September 7-11, 2014.  In FY 2015, CSD plans to develop new techniques and  metrics to detect stealthy attacks on Cloud Computing using  Bayesian Networks. CSD also plans to publish the results as a  NIST report and as white papers in conferences and journals.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/security-risk-analysis- enterprise-networks/  CONTACT: Dr. Anoop Singhal  (301) 975-4432  anoop.singhal@nist.gov  Algorithms for  Intrusion Measurement The Algorithms for Intrusion Measurement (AIM) project  furthers measurement science in the area of the algorithms  used in the field of intrusion detection. The team focuses on  both new detection metrics and measurements of scalability  (more formally called algorithmic complexity). This analysis  is applied to different phases of the detection lifecycle  to include preemptive vulnerability analysis, initial attack  detection, alert impact, alert aggregation/correlation, and  compact log storage. In performing this work, the AIM project  seeks to enhance the nation’s ability to defend itself from  network-borne attacks. This scientific research is conducted  in partnership with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and  the University of Maryland. ARL’s participation helps focus  the work on solving immediately critical problems facing  U.S. Government networks. However, research solutions are  made publicly available and are designed to be generally  applicable to as many environments as possible.  In FY 2014, the AIM project completed research  pertaining to several stages of the detection lifecycle through  the application of graph theoretic approaches: security  log compression, alert aggregation, and network threat  propagation. The project team accomplished the following:  •  The research team enabled significantly tighter com- pression for security logs, compared to using standard  compression algorithms alone, and accomplished it  using less processing time. The invention was a light- weight packing process that takes advantage of the  restricted semantics and regular format of certain kinds  of log files to render them substantially more amenable  to compression with standard algorithms (research  published by the Military Communications Conference,  2014). The team achieved a reduction of compressed  file sizes to as little as 21 % of that of maximally com- pressed files without packing, and reduced overall  compression times up to 64 %.  •  To aid in the human analysis of such intrusion and se- curity logs, the team designed an efficient approach to  visually compress groups of related logs (as opposed  to the previous work that reduced the actual size on a  disk). The team designed a user-adjustable log aggre- gation approach using varying Hamming distances to  quickly and losslessly aggregate alerts (research pub- lished by the International Journal of Network Security  and its Applications). The result is a reduction in the  cognitive load on analysts by minimizing the overall  number of alerts and the number of data elements that  need to be reviewed in order for an analyst to evaluate  the set of original alerts.  •  The research team addressed the problem of deter- mining how far an attack may have spread in a net- work when a perimeter incursion has been detected.  To accomplish this, the team created metrics and an  algorithm for bounding the scope of network ingress  attacks using the network tainting invention (research  published by IEEE Conference on Software Security  and Reliability, 2014). This approach provides an effi- cient means by which to stage and prioritize network  forensics examinations.  In FY 2015, the AIM project will work on measuring  Internet resilience to attacks by colluding countries, the  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/security-risk-analysis-enterprise-networks/ http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/security-risk-analysis-enterprise-networks/  P R O G R A M  A N D  P R O J E C T  A C H I E V E M E N T S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  7 1  detection of persistent and stealthy network scanning, and  efficient representations and algorithms for modeling and  defending attack paths within a network.

NIST  research has shown that most failures are triggered by one  or two parameters, and progressively fewer by three, four, or  more parameters (see the graph below), a relationship that  is called the Interaction Rule. These results have important  implications for testing. If all faults in a system can be  triggered by a combination of n or fewer parameters, then  testing all n-way combinations of parameters can provide  very strong fault detection efficiency. These methods are  being applied to software and hardware testing for reliability,  safety, and security. CSD’s focus is on empirical results and  real-world problems.  Project highlights for FY 2014 included the publication  of a report on a two-year Cooperative Research and  Development Agreement (CRADA) with Lockheed Martin  Corporation, showing approximately a 20 % reduction in  software test development cost across a variety of projects,  with a 20 % to 50 % improvement in test coverage; the  development of a parallel algorithm for fault location,  demonstrated on 22 000 variables; nine invited lectures  at conferences and research labs; leading (jointly with IBM  personnel) the IEEE Third International Conference on  Combinatorial Testing, held with the International Conference  on Software Testing; and a joint project with Carnegie Mellon  University developing an advanced test environment that  incorporates combinatorial methods.  Figure 22: Interaction Rule  Technology transfer activities included the publication  of several technical papers; a presentation of the results  of the work with Lockheed Martin; a release of enhanced  covering array, test prioritization, and fault location tools; plus  seminars and lectures at several conferences, universities,  and federal agencies.  Plans for FY 2015 include a follow-up project with  the NASA IV&V Facility to investigate the integration of  combinatorial coverage measurement methods in NASA  Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) practices;  the release of test a development environment as an open  source project (jointly with Carnegie Mellon University);  lectures at conferences and research labs; and a joint  development of enhanced fault location tools with Johns  Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acts/  CONTACTS: Mr. Rick Kuhn  Dr. Raghu Kacker  (301) 975-3337  (301) 975-2109  kuhn@nist.gov  raghu.kacker@nist.gov  Roots of  Trust Modern computing devices consist of various hardware,  firmware, and software components at multiple layers of  abstraction. Many security and protection mechanisms are  currently rooted in software that, along with all underlying  components, must be trusted and not tampered with. A  vulnerability in any of those components could compromise  the trustworthiness of the security mechanisms that rely  upon those components. Stronger security assurances may  be possible by grounding security mechanisms in roots of  trust.  Roots of trust are highly reliable and secure hardware,  firmware, and software components that perform specific,  critical security functions. Because roots of trust are  inherently trusted, they must be secure by their design. As  such, many roots of trust are implemented in hardware or  protected firmware so that malware cannot tamper with  the functions they provide. Roots of trust provide a firm  foundation from which to build security and trust.  NIST CSD’s work aims to encourage the use of roots of  trust in computers to provide stronger security assurances.  A focus area for this work has been securing mobile devices,  using roots of trust to provide device integrity, data and  application isolation, and protected storage. As part of this  work, CSD is revising SP 800-164, Guidelines on Hardware- Rooted Security in Mobile Devices, based on the public  comments that were received on the draft. A revised draft  will be released in FY 2015.  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  7 2  Meanwhile, the draft guideline is being used as the  basis for an effort with the National Cybersecurity Center of  Excellence (NCCoE) to encourage the adoption of stronger  security technologies in mobile devices. Using draft SP  800-164 as a foundational document, the NCCoE and  CSD developed the Mobile Device Security for Enterprises  building block, which will demonstrate commercially  available technologies that provide protection to both  organization-issued and personally owned mobile platforms.  The NCCoE will invite mobile device, operating system,  and management software vendors, as well as application  developers, to participate in this building block activity and  demonstrate how their technologies could be used together  to meet existing security requirements.  The CSD also continued its work to protect platform  firmware in FY 2014. Boot firmware, commonly known as  the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS), is a critical firmware  component, due to its unique and privileged position within  modern computing architectures. CSD has been working  with key members of the computer industry on the use of  roots of trust to improve the security of BIOS. In order to  encourage the continued adoption of BIOS protections,  The CSD submitted SP 800-147, BIOS Protection Guidelines,  to ISO for international standardization. CSD will continue  these standards efforts in FY 2015, and conduct research on  protections for other critical platform firmware.

In the NIST technical series, CSD solicited public  comments on forty draft publications, including one FIPS, 28  SPs and 11 NISTIRs. The FIPS had a 90-day comment period,  while the other publications averaged 45 days. In particular,  Draft NISTIR 7977, NIST Cryptographic Standards and  Guidelines Development Process (discussed in this annual  report in the Cryptographic Standards and Guidelines  Process Review section), sought feedback on the NIST  mechanisms used to engage experts in industry, academia  and government to develop cryptographic standards.  Nine SPs and four NISTIRs were issued as final  publications, including new documents, revisions or updated  revisions. CSD also continued to have its work published  monthly in ITL Bulletins, which summarize the various  publications and projects occurring across CSD. Those  interested in being notified of new and draft publications  may visit http://csrc.nist.gov and subscribe to email alerts.  Seeking to expand the availability of its publications in  formats besides PDFs, CSD began converting some of its  newer and most-downloaded publications into the .EPUB  format, which is commonly used by e-book readers on  mobile platforms. More than 28 e-books were posted during  FY 2014 on the Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC)  publications pages, http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/.  Publications are available for download from CSRC  (http://csrc.nist.gov/), and FIPS (http://csrc.nist.gov/ publications/PubsFIPS.html), SPs (http://csrc.nist.gov/ publications/PubsSPs.html) and NISTIRs (http://csrc.nist. gov/publications/PubsNISTIRs.html) issued since mid-2012  have been posted on a server maintained by the NIST Library  and assigned Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).

These  publications are available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications.  FIPS  DRAFT FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based  Hash and Extendable-Output Functions  This standard specifies the Secure Hash Algorithm-3  (SHA-3) family of functions on binary data. Each of the SHA- 3 functions is based on an instance of the KeccaK algorithm  that NIST selected as the winner of the SHA-3 Cryptographic  Hash Algorithm Competition. This Standard also specifies  the KeccaK-p family of mathematical permutations,  including the permutation that underlies KeccaK, in order to  facilitate the development of additional permutation-based  cryptographic functions.  The SHA-3 family consists of four cryptographic hash  functions, called SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and  SHA3-512, and two extendable-output functions (XOFs),  called SHAKE128 and SHAKE256.  Hash functions are components for many important  information security applications, including 1) the generation  and verification of digital signatures, 2) key derivation, and 3)  pseudorandom bit generation. The hash functions specified  in this Standard supplement the SHA-1 hash function and  the SHA-2 family of hash functions that are specified in FIPS  180-4, The Secure Hash Standard.  Extendable-output functions are different from hash  functions, but it is possible to use them in similar ways, with  the flexibility to be adapted directly to the requirements  of individual applications, subject to additional security  considerations.

The primary goal of the Computer Security Division (CSD),  a component of NIST s Information Technology Laboratory  (ITL), is to provide standards and technology that protects  information systems against threats to the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of information and services.  During FY 2013, CSD successfully responded to numerous  challenges and opportunities in fulfilling that mission.  Through CSD’s diverse research agenda and engagement  in many national priority initiatives, high-quality, cost- effective security and privacy mechanisms were developed  and applied that improved information security across the  Federal Government and the greater information security  community. This annual report highlights the research  agenda and activities in which CSD was engaged during FY  2013.

Application whitelisting technologies  use whitelists to control which applications are permitted  to execute on a host. This helps to stop the execution of  malware, unlicensed software, and other unauthorized  software. This publication is intended to assist organizations  in understanding the basics of application whitelisting. It  also explains planning and implementation for whitelisting  technologies throughout the security deployment lifecycle.  CONTACTS: Mr. Adam Sedgewick  adam.sedgewick@nist.gov  Mr. Murugiah Souppaya  murugiah.souppaya@nist.gov  DRAFT SP 800-163, Technical Considerations for Vetting  3rd Party Mobile Applications  Today’s commercially available mobile devices (e.g.,  smart phones, tablets) are handheld computing platforms  with wireless capabilities, geographic localization, cameras,  and microphones. Similar to computing platforms such as  desktops and laptops, the user experience with a mobile  device is tied to the software apps and the tools and utilities  available. The purpose of this document is to provide  guidance for vetting 3rd party software applications (apps)  for mobile devices. Mobile app vetting is intended to assess  a mobile app’s operational characteristics of secure behavior  and reliability (including performance) so that organizations  can determine if the app is acceptable for use in their  expected environment.  CONTACTS: Dr. Jeff Voas  Dr. Stephen Quirolgico  jeff.voas@nist.gov stephen.quirolgico@nist.gov  SP 800-162, Guide to Attribute Based Access Control  (ABAC) Definition and Considerations  This document provides federal agencies with a definition  of attribute based access control (ABAC). ABAC is a logical  access control methodology where authorization to perform  a set of operations is determined by evaluating attributes  associated with the subject, object, requested operations,  and, in some cases, environment conditions against policy,  rules, or relationships that describe the allowable operations  for a given set of attributes. This document also provides  considerations for using ABAC to improve information  sharing within organizations and between organizations  while maintaining control of that information.

These risks are associated with the  federal agencies decreased visibility into, understanding  of, and control over how the technology that they acquire  is developed, integrated and deployed, as well as the  processes, procedures, and practices used to assure the  integrity, security, resilience, and quality of the products and  services.  This publication provides guidance to federal agencies  on identifying, assessing, and mitigating ICT supply chain  risks at all levels of their organizations. This publication  integrates ICT supply chain risk management (SCRM) into  federal agency risk management activities by applying a  multitiered, SCRM-specific approach, including guidance on  supply chain risk assessment and mitigation activities.

CONTACT: Ms. Elaine Barker  elaine.barker@nist.gov  SP 800-147B, BIOS Protection Guidelines for Servers  Modern computers rely on fundamental system  firmware, commonly known as the Basic Input/Output  System (BIOS), to facilitate the hardware initialization  process and transition control to the hypervisor or operating  system. Unauthorized modification of BIOS firmware by  malicious software constitutes a significant threat because  of the BIOS’s unique and privileged position within the  PC architecture. The guidelines in this document include  requirements on servers to mitigate the execution of  malicious or corrupt BIOS code. They apply to BIOS  firmware stored in the BIOS flash, including the BIOS code,  the cryptographic keys that are part of the Root of Trust  for Update, and static BIOS data. This guide is intended to  provide server platform vendors with recommendations and  guidelines for a secure BIOS update process.  CONTACT: Mr. Andy Regenscheid  andy.regenscheid@nist.gov  SP 800-101 Revision 1, Guidelines on Mobile Device  Forensics  Mobile device forensics is the science of recovering  digital evidence from a mobile device under forensically  sound conditions using accepted methods. Mobile device  forensics is an evolving specialty in the field of digital  forensics. This guide attempts to bridge the gap by providing  an in-depth look into mobile devices and explaining the  technologies involved and their relationship to forensic  procedures. This document covers mobile devices with  features beyond simple voice communication and text  messaging capabilities.

CONTACTS: Ms. Elaine Barker  Dr. John Kelsey  elaine.barker@nist.gov john.kelsey@nist.gov  DRAFT SP 800-85B-4, PIV Data Model Test Guidelines  FIPS 201, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal  Employees and Contractors, describes a variety of data  model components as a part of the PIV logical credentials.  Such components include biometric elements in the  form of fingerprint information and facial imagery and  security elements such as electronic keys, certificates, and  signatures. FIPS 201 incorporates by reference NIST SP  800-73-4 Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification, which  specifies elements related to the PIV card interface, NIST  SP 800-76 Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity  Verification, which specifies the biometric requirements, and  NIST SP 800-78 Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes  for Personal Identity Verification, which specifies acceptable  cryptographic algorithms and key sizes for PIV systems.  A robust testing framework and guidelines to provide  assurance that a particular component or system is compliant  with FIPS 201 and supporting standards should exist to  build the necessary PIV infrastructure to support common  unified processes and systems for government-wide use.  NIST developed test guidelines in two parts. The first part  addresses test requirements for the interface to the PIV card,  which are provided in NIST SP 800-85A PIV Card Application  and Middleware Interface Test Guidelines (SP 800-73-3  Compliance). The second part provides test requirements  for the PIV data model and is provided in this document. This  document specifies the derived test requirements, and the  detailed test assertions and conformance tests for testing  the PIV data model.

The document provides an  overview of ICS and typical system topologies, identifies  typical threats and vulnerabilities to these systems, and  provides recommended security countermeasures to  mitigate the associated risks.  CONTACTS: Mr. Keith Stouffer Ms. Suzanne Lightman  keith.stouffer@nist.go suzanne.lightman@nist.gov  Ms. Vicky Pillitteri  victoria.pillitteri@nist.gov  DRAFT SP 800-79-2, Guidelines for the Authorization  of Personal Identity Verification Card Issuers (PCI) and  Derived PIV Credential Issuers (DPCI)  The purpose of this SP is to provide appropriate and  useful guidelines for assessing the reliability of issuers  of PIV Cards and Derived PIV Credentials. These issuers  store personal information and issue credentials based on  OMB policies and on the standards published in response  to HSPD-12 and therefore are the primary target of the  assessment and authorization under this guideline. The  reliability of an issuer is of utmost importance when one  organization (e.g., a federal agency) is required to trust the  identity credentials of individuals that were created and  issued by another federal agency. This trust will only exist  if organizations relying on the credentials issued by a given  organization have the necessary level of assurance that the  reliability of the issuing organization has been established  through a formal authorization process.

FIPS 201 also specifies that this identity credential must be  stored on a smart card. This document, SP 800-73, contains  the technical specifications to interface with the smart  card to retrieve and use the PIV identity credentials. The  specifications reflect the design goals of interoperability and  PIV Card functions. The goals are addressed by specifying  a PIV data model, card edge interface, and application  programming interface. Moreover, this document enumerates  requirements where the international integrated circuit card  standards include options and branches. The specifications  go further by constraining implementers’ interpretations of  the normative standards. Such restrictions are designed to  ease implementation, facilitate interoperability, and ensure  performance, in a manner tailored for PIV applications.

The assessment procedures, executed at  various phases of the system development life cycle, are  consistent with the security and privacy controls in NIST  SP 800-53 Revision 4. The procedures are customizable  and can be easily tailored to provide organizations with the  needed flexibility to conduct security control assessments  and privacy control assessments that support organizational  risk management processes and that are aligned with the  stated risk tolerance of the organization. Information on  building effective security assessment plans and privacy  assessment plans is also provided along with guidance on  analyzing assessment results.  CONTACT: NIST FISMA Team  Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative  sec-cert@nist.gov  SP 800-53 Revision 4 (Updated), Security and  Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and  Organizations  This publication provides a catalog of security and  privacy controls for federal information systems and  organizations and a process for selecting controls to protect  organizational operations (including mission, functions,  image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals,  other organizations, and the Nation from a diverse set of  threats including hostile cyber attacks, natural disasters,  structural failures, and human errors (both intentional  and unintentional). The security and privacy controls are  customizable and implemented as part of an organization- wide process that manages information security and privacy  risk. The controls address a diverse set of security and  privacy requirements across the Federal Government and  critical infrastructure, derived from legislation, Executive  Orders, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and/ or mission/business needs. The publication also describes  how to develop specialized sets of controls, or overlays,  tailored for specific types of missions/business functions,  technologies, or environments of operation. Finally, the  catalog of security controls addresses security from both a  functionality perspective (the strength of security functions  and mechanisms provided) and an assurance perspective  (the measures of confidence in the implemented security  capability). Addressing both security functionality and  assurance helps to ensure that information technology  component products and the information systems built from  those products using sound system and security engineering  principles are sufficiently trustworthy.

In addition to  considering the new content in ISO/IEC 27001 for the  mapping tables, new mapping criteria were employed in  conducting the mapping analysis. The new criteria are  intended to produce more accurate results—that is, to  successfully meet the mapping criteria, the implementation  of the mapped controls should result in an equivalent  information security posture. While mapping exercises may  by their very nature, include a degree of subjectivity, the  new criteria attempts to minimize that subjectivity to the  greatest extent possible.

Each  individual that owns, uses, relies on, or manages information  and information technology (IT) systems must fully understand  their specific security responsibilities. This includes ownership  of the information and the role individuals have in protecting  information. Information that requires protection includes  information they own, information provided to them as part of  their work and information they may come into contact with.  This document describes information technology/ cybersecurity role-based training for the Federal Departments  and Agencies and Organizations (Federal Organizations) and  contractor support in these roles. Its primary focus is to provide  a comprehensive, yet flexible, training methodology for the  development of training courses or modules for personnel  who have been identified as having significant information  technology/cybersecurity responsibilities.

These considerations are scoped into the  context of their applicability to public safety communications  networks with a particular focus on the nationwide public  safety broadband network (NPSBN) based on the Long Term  Evolution (LTE) family of standards. A short background  on identity management is provided alongside a review of  applicable federal and industry guidance. Considerations  are provided for identity proofing, selecting tokens, and the  authentication process. While specific identity management  technologies are analyzed, the document does not preclude  other identity management technologies from being used in  public safety communications networks.

Despite over four decades of security  research, the limited ability for existing access control  mechanisms to enforce a comprehensive range of policy  persists. While researchers, practitioners and policy makers  have specified a large variety of access control policies to  address real-world security issues, only a relatively small  subset of these policies can be enforced through off-the- shelf technology, and even a smaller subset can be enforced  by any one mechanism. This report describes an access  control framework, referred to as the Policy Machine (PM),  which fundamentally changes the way policy is expressed  and enforced. The report gives an overview of the PM and  the range of policies that can be specified and enacted. The  report also describes the architecture of the PM and the  properties of the PM model in detail.

This is often accomplished  using the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. The SSH protocol  supports several mechanisms for authentication, with public  key authentication being recommended for automated  access with SSH. Management of automated access requires  proper provisioning, termination, and monitoring processes,  just as interactive access by normal users does. However, the  security of SSH-based automated access has been largely  ignored to date. This publication assists organizations  in understanding the basics of SSH automated access  management in an enterprise, focusing on the management  of SSH access tokens.

Depending upon the sensitivity of the  resources and the risk of wrong identification, different  authentication use cases are being deployed. Assignment  of authentication strength for each of the use cases is often  based on: (a) the total number of three common orthogonal  authentication factors – What You Know, What You Have and  What You are, and (b) the entropy associated with each factor  chosen. The objective of this paper is to analyze the limitation  of this approach and present a methodology for assigning  authentication strengths based on the strength of pair wise  bindings between the five entities involved in smart card  based authentications – the card (token), the token secret,  the card holder, the card issuer, and the person identifier  stored in the card. The rationale for the methodology is based  on the following three observations: (a) The form factor of  the smart identity token introduces some threats of misuse;  (b) the common set of credentials objects provisioned to a  smart card embody bindings to address those threats and (c)  the strength of an authentication use case should therefore  be based on the number and type of binding verifications  that are performed in the constituent authentication  mechanisms. The use of the methodology for developing  an authentication assurance level taxonomy for two real  world smart identity token deployments is also illustrated.

Organizations in the diverse community of Smart Grid  stakeholders—from utilities to providers of energy  management services to manufacturers of electric vehicles  and charging stations—can use the methods and supporting  information presented in this report as guidance for  assessing risk and identifying and applying appropriate  security requirements. This approach recognizes that the  electric grid is changing from a relatively closed system  to a complex, highly interconnected environment. Each  organization’s cybersecurity requirements should evolve  as technology advances and as threats to grid security  inevitably multiply and diversify.

Approximately 100 IT professionals participated in  the 2014 IT Pro Conference on Information Systems  Governance, held at NIST on May 22, 2014 (www. computer.org/itproconf). Information systems  governance focuses on properly managing IT resources  to achieve organizational goals. The conference was  designed to bring together IT professionals from  industry, government, and academia to discuss new  challenges in information systems and share ways of  overcoming such challenges. Sponsored by IEEE, NIST,  and Noblis, the conference featured three keynotes  and 12 presentations, focusing on the following key  questions: 1) How can we get the most value from IT  while still delivering successful projects and reliable  information systems and infrastructure? 2) How can  we secure critical systems while keeping pace with  advances in technology? and 3)What changes are on  the horizon for technology and business leaders?

A Brahmagupta quadrilateral is a cyclic  quadrilateral whose sides, diagonals, and area are  all integer values. In this article, we characterize  the notions of Brahmagupta, introduced by  K. R. S. Sastry, by means of elliptic curves. Motivated  by these characterizations, we use Brahmagupta  quadrilaterals to construct infinite families of elliptic  curves with torsion group /2  x /2  having ranks  (at least) 4, 5, and 6. Furthermore, by specializing we  give examples from these families of specific curves  with rank 9.  R.

When enabling handover between different radio  interfaces (e.g., handover from 3G to Wi-Fi), reducing  network access authentication latency and securing  handover related signaling messages are major  challenging problems, amongst many others.

The  mechanisms introduced in this standard are aimed  to protect the IEEE standard 802.21-2008 messages  and services and to reduce handover latency by  introducing the concept of proactive authentication.  We provide a comprehensive survey of this standard  and describe how the defined mechanisms can be  used to reduce the overall latency during handover  between access networks using heterogeneous radio  interfaces.

Previous work introduced the idea of grouping  alerts at a Hamming distance of 1 to achieve alert  aggregation; such aggregated meta-alerts were  shown to increase alert interpret-ability. However,  a mean of 84 023 daily Snort alerts were reduced  to a still formidable 14 099 meta-alerts. In this work,  we address this limitation by investigating several  approaches that all contribute towards reducing the  burden on the analyst and providing timely analysis.  We explore minimizing the number of both alerts and  data fields by aggregating at Hamming distances  greater than 1. We show how increasing bin sizes can  improve aggregation rates. And we provide a new  aggregation algorithm that operates up to an order  of magnitude faster at Hamming distance 1. Lastly, we  demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach  through empirical analysis of Windows security alerts,  Snort alerts, netflow records, and DNS logs.  V.Y. Pillitteri, “NIST Cybersecurity Framework Addresses  Risks to Critical Infrastructure,” ei Magazine 19 (6), 20-21  (June 2014).  On February 12, 2014, President Obama issued a  statement that, “[c]yber threats pose one the gravest  national security dangers that the United States faces.  To better defend our nation against this systemic  challenge, one year ago I signed an Executive Order  directing the Administration to take steps to improve  information sharing with the private sector, raise the  level of cybersecurity across our critical infrastructure,  and enhance privacy and civil liberties.” That Executive  Order, E.O. 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure  Cybersecurity, directed the National Institute of  Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop a  voluntary, risk-based Cybersecurity Framework  (“Framework”)—based on existing industry standards  and best practices—to help organizations manage  cybersecurity risk. The resulting Framework was  created through a yearlong collaboration between  government and industry.  A.L. Roginsky, K. Christensen and M.

On-off scheduling of systems that have the ability  to sleep can be used to extend system idle periods  and enable greater opportunities for energy savings  from sleeping. In this paper, we achieve a theoretical  understanding of the delay behavior of on-off  scheduling as it may apply to communications links  and other systems capable of sleeping. We consider  a single-server coalescing queue with a scheduler  that schedules on-off periods for the server in order  to extend idle periods of the downstream link. At the  start of an off period (duration Toff) the server stops  serving jobs immediately if idle, or after processing  a job already in service. Service of any queued and  arriving jobs begins at the start of the next on period  (duration Ton). On and off periods are fixed. We solve  for the scheduling queue behavior as a function of  Toff, Ton, interarrival time t, service time x, and time  of first arrival g for periodic job arrivals. Results are  closed form and have both theoretical and practical  significance.  A.T. Vassilev and T.A.

The strength of cryptographic keys is an active  challenge in academic research and industrial practice.  In this paper, we discuss the entropy as fundamentally  important concept for generating hard-to-guess, i.e.,  strong, cryptographic keys and outline the difficulties  in generating and estimating the available entropy  for cryptographic needs. We consider traditional  entropy estimation in cryptographic applications and  motivate the development of new spectral techniques  for estimation.

Noel, “k-Zero  Day Safety: A Network Security Metric for Measuring the  Risk of Unknown Vulnerabilities,” IEEE Transactions on  Dependable and Secure Computing 11(1), 30-44 (January- February 2014). doi: 10.1109/TDSC.2013.24.  By enabling a direct comparison of different security  solutions with respect to their relative effectiveness,  a network security metric may provide quantifiable  evidences to assist security practitioners in securing  computer networks. However, research on security  metrics has been hindered by difficulties in handling  zero day attacks exploiting unknown vulnerabilities.  In fact, the security risk of unknown vulnerabilities  has been considered as something unmeasurable due  to the less predictable nature of software flaws. This  causes a major difficulty to security metrics, because  a more secure configuration would be of little value  if it were equally susceptible to zero day attacks. In  this paper, we propose a novel security metric, k-zero  day safety, to address this issue. Instead of attempting  to rank unknown vulnerabilities, the described metric  counts how many such vulnerabilities would be  required for compromising network assets; a larger  count implies more security since the likelihood  of having more unknown vulnerabilities available,  applicable, and exploitable all at the same time will  be significantly lower. We formally define the metric,  analyze the complexity of computing the metric,  devise heuristic algorithms for intractable cases, and  finally demonstrate through case studies that applying  the metric to existing network security practices may  generate actionable knowledge.

Risk management is a common phrase when managing  information, from the Chief Information Security  Officer (CISO)  to the programmer. We acknowledge  that risk management is the identification, assessment  and prioritization of risks and reflects how we manage  uncertainty. These are some areas of risk that we  have come to accept, their mitigation strategies are  part of our development, part of our everyday work.  Most IT professionals would agree that IT is good at  identifying and managing the risks. But is that really  the case or has risk management/mitigation become  a buzz word for us?

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is one of the three  main cloud service types where the cloud consumer  consumes a great variety of resources such as  computing (Virtual Machines or VMs), virtual network,  storage and utility programs (DBMS). Any large-scale  offering of this service is feasible only through a  virtualized infrastructure at the service provider. At the  minimum, this infrastructure is made up of resources  such as Virtualized hosts together with associated  virtual network and hardware/software for data  storage An IaaS’s consumer’s total set of interactions  with these resources constitute the set of use cases for  IaaS cloud service. These use cases have associated  security requirements and these requirements are  met by protection options enabled by available  security solutions/technologies. The purpose of this  paper is to analyze these protection options from  the viewpoint of: (a) Security functionality they can  provide and (b) the architecture that governs their  deployment, so that IaaS consumers can decide on  the most appropriate security configuration for their  VM instances depending upon the profile of the  applications running in them.

A primary objective of enterprise computing (via a  data center, cloud, etc.) is the controlled delivery of  data services (DS). Typical DSs include applications  such as email, workflow, and records management, as  well as system level features, such as file and access  C S D  P U B L I C AT I O N S  |  F Y  2 0 1 4  9 7  control management. Although access control (AC)  currently plays an important role in imposing control  over the execution of DS capabilities, AC can be more  fundamental to computing than one might expect.  That is, if properly designed, a single AC mechanism  can simultaneously implement, control, and deliver  capabilities of multiple DSs. The Policy Machine  (PM) is an AC framework that has been designed  with this objective in mind. This paper describes the  PM features that provide a generic AC mechanism  to implement DS capabilities, and comprehensively  enforces mission tailored access control policies  across DSs.  L.

Some conflicting results have been reported on the  comparison between t-way combinatorial testing and  random testing. In this paper, we report a new study  that applies t-way and random testing to the Siemens  suite. In particular, we investigate the stability of the  two techniques. We measure both code coverage  and fault detection effectiveness. Each program in  the Siemens suite has a number of faulty versions. In  addition, mutation faults are used to better evaluate  fault detection effectiveness in terms of both number  and diversity of faults. The experimental results  show that in most cases, t-way testing performed  as good as or better than random testing. There are  few cases where random testing performed better,  but with a very small margin. Overall, the differences  between the two techniques are not as significant as  one would have probably expected. We discuss the  practical implications of the results. We believe that  more studies are needed to better understand the  comparison of the two techniques.  J. Hagar, D.R. Kuhn, R.N. Kacker and T.

A t-way covering array can detect t-way faults;  however, they generally include other combinations  beyond t-way as well. For example, a particular test  set of all 5-way combinations is shown capable of  detecting all seeded faults in a test program, despite  the fact that it contains up to 9-way faults. This  poster gives an overview of methods for estimating  fault detection effectiveness of a test set based  on combinatorial coverage for a class of software.  Detection effectiveness depends on the distribution  of t-way faults, which is not known. However based  on past experience one could say for example the  fraction of 1-way faults is F1 = 60 %, 2-way faults F2 =  25 % F3 = 10 % and F4 = 5 %. Such information could  be used in determining the required strength t. It is  shown that the fault detection effectiveness of a test  set may be affected significantly by the t-way fault  distribution, overall, simple coverage at each level of  t, number of values per variable, and minimum t-way  coverage. Using these results, we develop practical  guidance for testers.  C. Liu, A. Singhal and D.

Constructing an efficient and accurate model from  security events to determine an attack scenario for  an enterprise network is challenging. In this paper,  we discuss how to use evidence obtained from  security events to construct an attack scenario and  build an evidence graph. To achieve the accuracy  and completeness of the evidence graph, we use  Prolog inductive and abductive reasoning to correlate  evidence by reasoning the causality, and use an anti- forensics database and a corresponding attack graph  to find the missing evidence. In addition, because the  constructed scenario and supplied evidence might  C O M P U T E R  S E C U R I T Y  D I V I S I O N  A N N U A L  R E P O R T  |  2 0 1 4  9 8  need to stand up in the court of law, the federal rules of  evidence are also taken into account to predetermine  the admissibility of the evidence.

This paper discusses limitations in one of the most  widely cited single source scan detection algorithms:  threshold random walk (TRW). If an attacker knows  that TRW is being employed, these limitations  enable full circumvention allowing undetectable high  speed full horizontal and vertical scanning of target  networks from a single Internet Protocol address. To  mitigate the discovered limitations, we provide three  enhancements to TRW and analyze the increased  cost in computational complexity and memory. Even  with these mitigations in place, circumvention is still  possible but only through collaborative scanning  (something TRW was not designed to detect) with a  significant increase in the required level of effort and  usage of resources.

This research describes a novel security metric,  network taint, which is related to software taint  analysis. We use it here to bound the possible  malicious influence of a known compromised node  through monitoring and evaluating network flows.  The result is a dynamically changing defense-in-depth  map that shows threat level indicators gleaned from  monotonically decreasing threat chains. We augment  this analysis with concepts from the complex networks  research area in forming dynamically changing  security perimeters and measuring the cardinality of  the set of threatened nodes within them. In providing  this, we hope to advance network incident response  activities by providing a rapid automated initial triage  service that can guide and prioritize investigative  activities.  M.

Peralta, “The Multiplicative Complexity  of Boolean Functions on Four and Five Variables,” Third  International Workshop on Lightweight Cryptography  for Security & Privacy (LightSec 2014), Istanbul, Turkey,  September 1-2, 2014. In Lecture Notes in Computer Science  8898, Lightweight Cryptography for Security and Privacy, T.  Eisenbarth and E. Öztürk, eds., Berlin: Springer, 2015, pp. 21- 33. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-16363-5_2.  A generic way to design lightweight cryptographic  primitives is to construct simple rounds using small  nonlinear components such as 4x4 S-boxes and use  these iteratively (e.g., PRESENT and SPONGENT).  In order to efficiently implement the primitive,  efficient implementations of its internal components  are needed. Multiplicative complexity of a function  is the minimum number of AND gates required to  implement it by a circuit over the basis (AND, XOR,  NOT). It is known that multiplicative complexity is  exponential in the number of input bits n. Thus it came  as a surprise that circuits for all 65 536 functions on  four bits were found which used at most three AND  gates. In this paper, we verify this result and extend it  to five-variable Boolean functions. We show that the  multiplicative complexity of a Boolean function with  five variables is at most four.  L.

Albanese,  “Modeling Network Diversity for Evaluating the Robustness  of Networks against Zero-Day Attacks,” 19th European  Symposium on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS  2014), Wroclaw, Poland, September 7-11, 2014. In Lecture  Notes in Computer Science 8713, Computer Security –  ESORICS 2014, M. Kutyłowski and J. Vaidya, eds., Berlin:  Springer, 2014, pp. 494-511. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-11212-1_28.  The interest in diversity as a security mechanism has  recently been revived in various applications, such  as Moving Target Defense (MTD), resisting worms  in sensor networks, and improving the robustness  of network routing. However, most existing efforts  on formally modeling diversity have focused on a  single system running diverse software replicas or  variants. At a higher abstraction level, as a global  property of the entire network, diversity and its  impact on security have received limited attention.  In this paper, we take the first step towards formally  modeling network diversity as a security metric  for evaluating the robustness of networks against  potential zero day attacks. Specifically, we first devise  a biodiversity-inspired metric based on the effective  number of distinct resources. We then propose two  complementary diversity metrics, based on the least  and the average attacking efforts, respectively. Finally,  we evaluate algorithm and metrics through simulation.

Erbacher  (Advances in Information Security 62), Berlin: Springer, 2014,  pp. 263-295. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-11391-3_13.  Discussion of challenges and ways of improving  Cyber Situational Awareness dominated our previous  chapters. However, we have not yet touched on how to  quantify any improvement we might achieve. Indeed,  to get an accurate assessment of network security  and provide sufficient Cyber Situational Awareness  (CSA), simple but meaningful metrics—the focus of  the Metrics of Security chapter—are necessary. The  adage, “what can’t be measured can’t be effectively  managed,” applies here. Without good metrics and the  corresponding evaluation methods, security analysts  and network operators cannot accurately evaluate  and measure the security status of their networks  and the success of their operations. In particular,  this chapter explores two distinct issues: (i) how to  define and use metrics as quantitative characteristics  to represent the security state of a network, and (ii)  how to define and use metrics to measure CSA from a  defender’s point of view.

Cybersecurity threats take advantage  of the increased complexity and connectivity of critical  infrastructure systems, placing the Nation’s security  at risk. To better protect these systems, the President  issued Executive Order 13636, Improving Critical  Infrastructure Cybersecurity, on February 12, 2013. The  Executive Order established that “[i]t is the Policy of  the United States to enhance the security and resilience  of the Nation’s critical infrastructure and to maintain  a cyber environment that encourages efficiency,  innovation, and economic prosperity while promoting  safety, security, business confidentiality, privacy, and  civil liberties.” In enacting this policy, the Executive  Order calls for the development of a voluntary risk- based Cybersecurity Framework—a set of industry  standards and best practices to help organizations  manage cybersecurity risks. The resulting Framework,  created through collaboration between government  and the private sector, uses a common language to  address and manage cybersecurity risk in a cost- effective way based on business needs without  placing additional regulatory requirements on  businesses. The Framework enables organizations— regardless of size, degree of cybersecurity risk, or  cybersecurity sophistication—to apply the principles  and best practices of risk management to improving  the security and resilience of critical infrastructure.  The Framework provides organization and structure  to today’s multiple approaches to cybersecurity by  assembling standards, guidelines, and practices that  are working effectively in industry today. Moreover,  because it references globally recognized standards  for cybersecurity, the Framework can also be used by  organizations located outside the United States and  can serve as a model for international cooperation on  strengthening critical infrastructure cybersecurity.

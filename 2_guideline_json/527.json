The EU Standard Operational Procedures (EU-SOPs), used to support these cooperation activities,  provide Member States with guidelines which they can use in the face of large-scale cybersecurity incidents.  The main goal of Cyber Europe 2014 was to train Member States to cooperate during a cyber crisis . The  exercise also aimed at providing an opportunity to Member States to test national capabilities, including  the level of cybersecurity expertise and national contingency plans, involving both public and private sector  organisations. In order to address the different layers of cyber crisis management, Cyber Europe 2014 was  divided in three escalating phases, spread over 2014 and early 2015.  The exercise was a success, for it allowed ENISA to draw numerous lessons, recommendations and concrete  actions, which will help to enhance cyber crisis preparedness in Europe. The common ability to mitigate  large scale cybersecurity incidents in Europe has progressed significantly since 2010 when the first Cyber  Europe exercise was organised. In particular, Cyber Europe 2014 has shown how valuable it is to share  information from many different countries in real-time in order to facilitate high-level situation awareness  and swift decision-making. Nevertheless, such processes are unprecedented in real-life and hence requires  primarily capability development and possibly also policy guidance from both the Member States as well  as the EU Institutions and Agencies.  It is crucial that Member States continue to rely upon and improve multilateral cooperation mechanisms,  which complement the bilateral and regional relations they have with trusted partners. The EU-SOPs, which  are meant to support the former, will be further improved to better take into account the evolving cybersecurity  policy context in Europe. In addition, experience gathered throughout this exercise and the previous ones  will strongly guide the development of future EU cyber cooperation instruments and exercises.  The full after action report includes an engaging action plan which ENISA and Member States are committed  to implement.  1 For more information on cyber crises, please refer to the ENISA Report on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Management:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc-management/ ccc-study  PUBLIC VERSIONPUBLIC VERSION 5  ENISA CE2014 After Action Report  6  Contents  Executive Summary  .................................................................................................................................................................. 4  1 Exercise Overview ............................................................................................................................................................ 8  1.1 Objectives and setup ....................................................................................................................................... 8  1.2 Planning ............................................................................................................................................................. 10  1.3 Exercise platform ............................................................................................................................................. 10  2 Participation  ................................................................................................................................................................ 12  2.1 Technical level exercise (TLEx) .................................................................................................................... 13  2.2 Operational level exercise (OLEx) ............................................................................................................... 13  2.3 Strategic level (SLEx) ...................................................................................................................................... 13  3 Scenario Overview ......................................................................................................................................................... 14  4 Key Findings  ................................................................................................................................................................ 16  5 Key Recommendations................................................................................................................................................. 18  7PUBLIC VERSION  ENISA CE2014 After Action Report  8  1. Exercise overview  1.1 Objectives and setup  The goal of this exercise has been to contribute to the training of Member States’ participating organisations  with a view to help them cooperate during a cyber crisis. More specifically, this exercise provided opportunities  to assess the effectiveness of cooperation and escalation procedures in the face of cross-border cyber  incidents which impact the security of vital services and infrastructure.  1. Exercise overview  88  PUBLIC VERSION  CE2014 had the following key objectives:  1.  Test the European alerting, cooperation and information exchange procedures between national- level authorities responsible for cyber incidents.  2.  Provide an opportunity for Member States to test internally their national NIS contingency plans  and capabilities.  3.  Explore the effect of multiple and parallel information exchanges between private-public and  private-private.  4.  Explore the NIS incident response escalation and de-escalation processes (technical-operational- political).  5. Explore the public affairs handling of large-scale cyber incidents.  9  ENISA CE2014 After Action Report  In order to better tackle the challenges of each layer involved in crisis management, the exercise was divided  into three phases: technical, operational and strategic, each phase escalating into the next one.  20 8 h  26847 269 10 h  29 countries  657 individuals  214 organisations 49 h  25 February 2015  OPERATION EXERCISE  STRATEGIC EXERCISE  30 October 2014  TECHNICAL EXERCISE  28-30 April 2014  58  16 scenarios on  Figure 1: Mapping of the phases of  Cyber Europe 2014 to the European  Cyber Crisis Cooperation Framework  (ECCCF) Model.  10  1. Exercise overview  1.2 Planning  The exercise was organised by ENISA and planned jointly with representatives from the participating Member  States. It required six planning conferences which took place in Belgium, Greece (twice), Luxembourg,  Netherlands and Spain.  1.3 Exercise platform  The exercise planning, conduct and evaluation was supported by the ENISA Cyber Exercise Platform (CEP).  Developed by ENISA, CEP allows to:  ● Work on all planning documentation (including Exercise Plan, Scenarios, Incidents/Injects, Policies,  Press Releases, etc.).  ● Facilitate the exercise communication.  ● Support the development of incidents and injects.  ● Conduct the exercise (send injects, monitor progress, reporting, etc.).  ● Simulate the exercise world (news and media, social media, videos, etc.).  ● Evaluate the exercise (polls, surveys, after action report production).  ● Stay up-to-date with the exercise events and logistics.  CEP is currently being further developed by ENISA in order to be leveraged in future cyber exercises. ENISA  accepts requests to contribute to future developments of the platform. In case of interest, please contact the  ENISA Cyber Crisis Cooperation team (c3e@enisa.europa.eu). Any requests received will be evaluated and  requesting parties will be informed accordingly of their expected contribution and role as appropriate.

Participation Nb  Countries 20  Individuals (public sector) 58  3. Scenario overview  3. Scenario overview  14  15PUBLIC VERSION  The scenario of Cyber Europe 2014 revolved around a proposal for an EU regulation related to Member  States’ importing of energy resources. The regulation aimed to introduce a tax to fund the development of  green technologies such as wind farms, solar roads and electric cars. Opponents to the regulation claimed  its objective was merely to increase taxes in the midst of the economic crisis. Several countries around the  world, potentially impacted by such regulation, claimed that it was a geopolitical manoeuver aimed at  undermining their development. Large lobbying and disinformation campaigns were organised to influence  the decision on the EU regulation. Despite these efforts, negotiations moved forward and Member States  and EU Institutions became the target of cyber attacks aimed at exfiltrating information about the regulation  and destabilizing its energy market. The technical phase (TLEx) of Cyber Europe 2014 was organised at this  point in the scenario, with incidents ranging from open source intelligence gathering on social media, mobile  phone malware analysis to denial of service attacks and advanced persistent threats.  The disruptions caused by these attacks did not prevent the regulation from passing. This led to a series of  large-scale cyber attacks, with the goal to instigate fear and prevent the voting of the regulation. Several  0-day vulnerabilities were used to develop advanced exploits, attack various critical infrastructure operators’  networks and numerous online services. The operational phase of Cyber Europe 2014 (OLEx) was organised  at this point in the scenario.  The crisis then escalated further, with several energy infrastructure operators severely impacted in the midst  of a harsh winter, key critical technologies breached and an increasingly worried public opinion. The strategic  phase of Cyber Europe 2014 (SLEx) was organised at this point in the scenario.  ENISA CE2014 After Action Report  4.  Key findings and recommendations  16  4.  Key findings and recommendations  17PUBLIC VERSION  The key findings from Cyber Europe 2014 are the following:  ● Cyber Europe 2014 proved to be an excellent opportunity to explore, understand and evaluate  existing European cyber cooperation mechanisms at the technical, operational and strategic levels.  The exercise strengthened the European cybersecurity community.  ● Participants were fully engaged in cooperation at national and European levels, which led to a  shared understanding of all facets of the crisis within a few hours.  ● During the exercise, many multilateral interactions at the international level took place, highlighting  the importance of regional cooperation.  ● The EU Standard Operational Procedures and communication tools helped to provide higher  situational awareness and structured cooperation activities during the simulated cyber crisis.  ● Increased familiarity with these procedures could allow for a faster response.  ● The large majority of participants recognised the benefits of exercising for the first time a strategic- level cooperation.  ● Cyber Europe 2014 contributed to trust building between Member States as it fostered new  relationships and strengthened existing ones.  ● The participating organisations took the scenario seriously and responded adequately to all  challenges, either mitigating incidents at the technical level or using their respective contingency  and business continuity plans.  ● Participants to the technical phase recognised that it refreshed, if not increased their cybersecurity  capabilities: 98% indicated interest to participate in the next exercise.  ● The Cyber Exercise Platform proved to be a powerful tool to plan, conduct and evaluate the  exercise.  ● The introduction for the first time of the three phases in Cyber Europe was an important step  towards understanding the inner challenges of such large scale crisis management processes.  ● Large scale cyber exercises such as Cyber Europe 2014 are complex projects which require a  long planning phase (over 2 years) and the contribution of scarce expertise, both from ENISA  and the Member States.  ENISA CE2014 After Action Report  1818  5. key recommendations from the exercise  5. key recommendations from the exercise  19PUBLIC VERSION  The following are the key recommendations from the exercise:  1. Cyber Europe exercises, as well as any cooperation activity at European level during real cyber crises,  build upon existing relations between Member States. ENISA and the Member States will continue to  invest in trust building activities to maintain and further develop existing trust.  2. ENISA and the Member States should further develop the operational procedures which drive the  cooperation activities during a cyber crisis, taking into account existing and future cooperation  frameworks, to bring these procedures to a maturity level similar to those found in other sectors such  as civil protection and aviation.  3. ENISA and the Member States will seek further integration with national and regional activities.  4. ENISA will address future Cyber Europe activities as a programme containing both trainings as well  as small and large scale exercises, in order to provide a better experience and achieve greater impact.  5. Lastly, ENISA will further develop the Cyber Exercise Platform to offer a richer experience to both players  and planners, as well as to support the organisation of national and regional exercises, fostering the  development of a cyber exercise community.

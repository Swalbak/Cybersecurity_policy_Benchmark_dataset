    "document(english)": "1  Introduction  Smart places, also known as smart cities, are places designed to provide enhanced services to citizens using a collection  of smart information and communication technology (ICT)-enabled systems and devices that capture, communicate  and analyse data. To achieve this purpose, previously discrete technologies and systems are interconnected to allow for  large-scale coordination, real-time decision making, and increased visibility and situational awareness of the smart  place’s status.  The large-scale deployments of these interconnected systems and devices has the opportunity to improve the lives of  citizens, and increase economic productivity with minimal citizen interaction.  This publication uses smart places as a broad overarching term, which would encompass (but are not limited to): cities,  suburbs or neighbourhoods; mine sites; oil rigs; ports; manufacturing and refinery facilities. Although the  implementation of a smart place can take many forms, it will often include technologies and systems such as the  following:   Internet of Things (IoT) devices   operational technology   sensors   cloud computing services.  Examples of smart places technologies   Smart meters   These are technologies that can remotely measure and collect consumer energy data, be controlled  remotely, and detect power outages and faults faster than traditional methods.   Smart meters and IoT sensors can work together to achieve greater electricity grid efficiency in a smart  place.   Traffic light systems   Sensor networks around a road may use technologies such as cameras, radar, Bluetooth and/or Wi-Fi to  collect real-time data, such as congestion, speed and weather conditions.   Data is then sent to a control system that uses this information accordingly to improve the flow of traffic,  give priority to nearby pedestrians and reduce congestion.  An Introduction to  Securing Smart Places  First published: November 2022  2  Security risks in smart places  The highly-connected nature of a smart place creates efficiencies for users, and provides finer control and oversight of  the place’s operation to its implementers, but also presents an increased risk profile. The interconnection of systems  and devices at scale complicates and amplifies existing security risks in individual technologies, enables pivoting  between previously separate infrastructures and results in an overall larger attack surface. The storage of aggregated or  sensitive data and potential connection to critical systems, including critical infrastructure, make smart places an even  more attractive target for adversaries.  System failures in smart places could have significant consequences, even without the involvement of adversaries, due  to poor requirements gathering, design, engineering or simple misadventure. For a smart place, this could arise from  the connection of legacy equipment, opaque distribution of responsibility and abstract lines of ownership.  Through malicious or non-malicious activity, disruption of a single service may result in cascading effects to other  systems, potentially leading to significant consequences for citizens. The impact of failures in a smart place may range  from reputational embarrassment and financial loss to a threat to life.  Implementers may secure elements of their individual deployments, however they are unlikely to mitigate the full  range of security risks introduced in smart places without using appropriate defence-in-depth and secure-by-design  approaches. Below are some of the key security risks that should be considered by implementers.  Internet of Things  IoT devices are often foundational to the increased functionality introduced by a smart place, however these devices  are generally built with utility as a priority and security is often absent or an afterthought.  Ensuring the procurement and implementation of IoT devices that abide by the Code of Practice listed below can help  form part of building a defence-in-depth approach to securing your smart place.   Voluntary Code of Practice: Securing the Internet of Things for Consumers   IoT Code of Practice – Guidance for Manufacturers.  Supply chain  When technologies that form part of the infrastructure and services of a smart place are procured from third parties,  there is potential for supply chain risk, which is further increased when multiple vendors are involved.  Supply chain risk can result in system compromise and disruption due to security vulnerabilities introduced during the  manufacturing and/or distribution process. It has the potential to have a large scale impact, which is exacerbated by  the interconnectedness of smart places technologies. A holistic understanding of these security risks are required to  adequately evaluate the implications of adopting smart place technologies.  Smart place technologies must be procured with security in mind and implementers must be satisfied that vendors will  implement controls required to satisfy client and stakeholder requirements.  Existing publications and principles to be considered with respect to supply chains include:   Identifying Cyber Supply Chain Risks   Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management   Critical Technology Supply Chain Principles.  https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/reports-and-publications/submissions-and-discussion-papers/code-of-practice https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-hardening/iot-code-practice-guidance-manufacturers https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/outsourcing-and-procurement/cyber-supply-chains/identifying-cyber-supply-chain-risks https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/outsourcing-and-procurement/cyber-supply-chains/cyber-supply-chain-risk-management https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/reports-and-publications/submissions-and-discussion-papers/critical-technology-supply-chain-principles  3  Operational technology  The most fundamental aspects of what makes a smart place, local government area or city function come from its  municipal services and other critical infrastructures, such as water, gas and electricity. The technologies that help  control these infrastructures are forms of operational technology (OT).  OT is used in a wide variety of fields to introduce real-world change, and can be as simple as an automated sprinkler  system at a park to something as complex as a water or sewerage treatment plant. Understanding what OT your smart  place relies on, and appropriately protecting these technologies, is critical for ensuring the ongoing operation of these  fundamental services.  As a part of the technological integration found in smart places, OT and ICT systems are becoming intertwined to  support the rapidly growing demand of citizens, and ensure greater efficiency and cost reduction.  Due to the requirement for OT to have close to zero downtime, these technologies are infrequently upgraded or  replaced, and in some cases they are expected to be operational for 20 to 30 years. The difficulty in updating and  upgrading these systems can mean that they steadily become more vulnerable over time and unsuited for operation in  the current threat environment.  Hybrid approaches for smart places are seeing adoption of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices, such as smart  meters. These are controlled, managed and connected using ICT systems to provide flexible capabilities to OT systems  never designed for the integration of such functionality.  With this merger of technologies, previously strict boundaries between OT and the outside world are weakened.  Existing OT implementations, which did not consider exposure to ICT security risks, may be inappropriately exposed to a  threat environment for which they were not designed. This can provide adversaries with increased opportunities to  attack these systems, raising the probability of cyber security incidents. Incidents impacting OT have the potential to  cause immediate physical effects in a smart place and consequently directly impact those that rely on those services.  Existing publications to be considered with respect to OT include:   Protecting Industrial Control Systems   Industrial Control Systems Remote Access Protocol.  Cloud computing  Cloud computing provides smart places with a mechanism for delivering ICT services that scale, through on-demand  network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. The uses for cloud computing services in a smart  place can vary; such as the implementation of corporate management functions on the cloud, data storage and  processing through to real-time operations for IoT and sensor networks.  The scope of cloud computing can result in large scale compromise or disruption if the environment is affected by a  cyber security incident. An understanding of what type of cloud, ‘as a Service’, or similar externally hosted offerings are  used by, connected to or underlie your smart place are imperative to uplifting its cyber security posture.  The procurement, implementation and management of cloud-based services must be appropriately risk managed to  ensure the overall security of a smart place. The storage of personally identifiable or other sensitive data on these  systems may require further controls be implemented to mitigate the security risks present. In addition, it is important  to consider the availability of the cloud service itself, including the availability requirements for the networks used to  communicate with the cloud service.  Existing publications to be considered with respect to cloud computing include:   Cloud Computing Security Considerations   Cloud Computing Security for Tenants.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/critical-infrastructure/protecting-industrial-control-systems https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/critical-infrastructure/industrial-control-systems-remote-access-protocol https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/cloud-security-guidance/cloud-computing-security-considerations https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/cloud-security-guidance/cloud-computing-security-tenants  4  Mitigating security risk  The implementation of smart places technologies can lead to a range of security risks. Understanding and mitigating  these security risks is key to securely maximising the potential benefits of these technologies.  Mitigations exist for many of the security concerns currently affecting the technical components of smart places.  Exploitation of security vulnerabilities can be prevented by implementing secure-by-design principles. To establish an  effective foundation for security, implementation of good cyber security practices should be considered. This should be  followed by additional environment-specific controls to help achieve a defence-in-depth security posture.  Good cyber security practices for organisations to help better protect their systems and data from cyber threats in a  smart places context include:   Essential Eight Maturity Model   Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents   Information Security Manual.  In addition, devices connecting, configuring or managing smart place technologies should be hardened to the  appropriate standard through existing advice.  Operational redundancy  It is important to consider the interconnectedness and the potential for cascading cyber security incidents in smart  places technologies. Implementers must ensure appropriate contingencies for the manual operation for all critical  functions, and that staff are trained to enact and action these in case of emergency. These contingencies should plan  for the disconnection of smart places technologies from critical services to enable them to operate independently.  In case of a cyber security incident, implementers should have hard copies of both incident response plans and disaster  recovery plans available for all stakeholders. These plans should be easily accessible and practiced by relevant staff,  including executive leaders.  Organisations managing a cyber security incident in a smart place should be prepared to isolate systems with as little  disruption to critical services as possible.  Implementers must backup relevant systems, ensuring that backups are tested, maintained and properly isolated from  outside interference. Backups should be designed to enable offline operation to continually provide the critical service.  Further information  The Information Security Manual is a cyber security framework that organisations can apply to protect their systems  and data from cyber threats. The advice in the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents, along with its Essential  Eight, complements this framework.

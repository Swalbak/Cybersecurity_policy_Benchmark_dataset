The report aims to bring new insights into the reality of the transport  sector by mapping and studying cyber incidents from January 2021 to October 2022. It identifies prime threats, actors  and trends based on the analysis of cyberattacks targeting aviation, maritime, railway and road transport over a  period of almost 2 years.  During this period, the prime threats identified include:  • ransomware attacks (38%),  • data related threats (30%),  • malware (17%),  • denial-of-service (DoS), distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and ransom denial-of-service (RDoS) attacks  (16%),  • phishing / spear phishing (10%),  • supply-chain attacks (10%).  During the reporting period, the threat actors with the biggest impact on the sector were state-sponsored actors,  cybercriminals and hacktivists. We observed the following trends:  • Ransomware attacks became the prominent threat against the sector in 2022. Ransomware has been  steadily increasing1 and the transport sector has been affected similarly to the other sectors.  • Cybercriminals are responsible for the majority of attacks on the transport sector (54%), and they target all  subsectors.  • Threat actors will increasingly conduct ransomware attacks with not only monetary motivations1.  • The increased hacktivist activity targeting the transport sector is likely to continue.  • The increasing rate of DDoS attacks targeting the transport sector is likely to continue.  • The main targets of DDoS attacks by hacktivists are European airports, railways and transport authorities.  • During this reporting period, we did not receive reliable information on a cyberattack affecting the safety of  transport.  • The majority of attacks on the transport sector target information technology (IT) systems. Operational  disruptions can occur as a consequence of these attacks, but the operational technology (OT) systems are  rarely being targeted.  • Ransomware groups will likely target and disrupt OT operations in the foreseeable future1.  The aviation sector is facing multiple threats, with data-related threats being the most prominent, coupled by  ransomware and malware. Customer data of airlines and proprietary information of original equipment manufacturers  (OEM) are the prime targeted assets of the sector. In 2022, there has been a rise in the number of ransomware  attacks affecting airports. Fraudulent websites impersonating airlines have become a significant threat in 2022.  The maritime sector experiences ransomware, malware, and phishing attacks targeted towards port authorities, port  operators, and manufacturers. State-sponsored attackers often carry out politically motivated attacks leading to  operational disruptions at ports and vessels.  The railway sector also experiences ransomware and data-related threats primarily targeting IT systems like  passenger services, ticketing systems, and mobile applications, causing service disruptions. Hacktivist groups have  1 ENISA Threat Landscape 2022 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  5  been conducting DDoS attacks against railway companies with an increasing rate, primarily due to Russia's invasion  of Ukraine.  The road transport sector faces predominantly ransomware attacks, followed by data-related threats and malware.  Automotive industry, especially OEM and tier-X suppliers, has been targeted by ransomware leading to production  disruptions. Data-related threats primarily target IT systems to acquire customer and employee data as well as  proprietary information.  There is a limited number of cyber incidents that cannot be placed in one specific subsector. These include general  campaigns targeting the whole transportation sector in particular countries. These campaigns are often attributed to  hacktivists and state-sponsored actors and are linked to geopolitical tensions.  The report also highlights issues with the reporting of cyber incidents and the fact that we still have limited knowledge  and information regarding such incidents. The analysis in this report indicates that publicly disclosed incidents are just  the tip of the iceberg.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  6  1. INTRODUCTION  This report brings insights into the cyber threat landscape of the transport sector, with a focus on the EU. The four  transport sectors which are considered in scope are aviation, maritime2, rail, and road transport, as these fall under  the scope of the network and information security (NIS) directive3. The report considers a wider scope of the  transport ecosystem, and includes transport manufacturers and suppliers4, and national transport authorities, to  ensure that the threat landscape of the sector is more detailed.  The ENISA Cybersecurity Threat Landscape Methodology5 was applied. ENISA has analysed cyber incidents  targeting the transport sector from January 2021 to October 2022. This time period is referred to as the \"reporting  period\" throughout the report.  It should be noted that the data collection and analysis primarily focus on incidents observed in EU member states  and then in other states around the world. This is by no means the complete list of incidents that occurred during the  reporting period. ENISA gathered a list of major incidents based on open-source intelligence (OSINT)6 and ENISA’s  own cyber threat intelligence capabilities. For the aviation sector specifically, these were complemented by incidents  reported to EASA and the European Centre for Cybersecurity in Aviation7, and by incidents provided by Eurocontrol’s  EATM-CERT for the aviation sector8. The data collected were further analysed by ENISA’s threat landscape team.  These incidents serve as the foundation for identifying the list of prime threats and the source material for several  trends and statistics in the report. The incidents were analysed in detail to identify their core elements, providing  answers to some important questions, such as how the attacks happen, which systems are being targeted and which  transport subsectors are most affected. An in-depth desk research of available literature from open sources, such as  news media articles, expert opinions, intelligence reports, incident analyses and security research reports, were  conducted by ENISA and external experts. Within the report, we differentiate between what has been reported by our  sources and what is our assessment. When conducting an assessment, we convey probability by using words that  express an estimate of probability 9.  The report is structured as follows.  • Chapter 1, Introduction, provides an overview of the scope and the method used to produce this report.  • Chapter 2, Cyber threats to the transport sector, analyses the observed activity observed during the  reporting period. It provides insights on the prime threats, threat actors and their motivation, along with the  assessed impact of these attacks.  • Chapter 3, Sector Analysis, analyses in more detail the prime threats and the targets on each of the four  subsectors covered.  • Chapter 4, Conclusions, discusses the trends derived by the analysis and some considerations on the  availability of data for incidents affecting the sector.  • Annex, Major incidents, gathers a summary of selected notable incidents collected during the reporting  period.  2 While we refer to the maritime sector throughout the report, we have also considered inland waterway transport in the analysis.  3 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-directive  4 In the road sector, original equipment manufacturers (OEM), tier-X suppliers and the whole automotive sector were considered in the analysis.  5 ENISA Cybersecurity Threat Landscape Methodology, July 2022. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-methodology  6 This is a result of work by ENISA in the area of situational awareness in accordance with the EU Cybersecurity Act Article 7, Paragraph 6 https://eur- lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN  7 European Centre for Cybersecurity in Aviation (ECCSA) https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/eccsa  8 European Air Traffic Management Computer Emergency Response Team (EATM-CERT) https://www.eurocontrol.int/service/european-air-traffic- management-computer-emergency-response-team  9 Malware Information Sharing Platform estimative language https://www.misp-project.org/taxonomies.html#_estimative_language  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-methodology https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/eccsa https://www.eurocontrol.int/service/european-air-traffic-management-computer-emergency-response-team https://www.eurocontrol.int/service/european-air-traffic-management-computer-emergency-response-team https://www.misp-project.org/taxonomies.html#_estimative_language  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  7  2. CYBER THREATS TO THE  TRANSPORT SECTOR  2.1  OBSERVED ACTIVITY  From January 2021 until October 2022, we analysed a total of 98 publicly reported incidents10.  In 2022, we observed a 25% increase in the monthly average number of reported incidents affecting the transport  sector compared to 2021 (see quarterly results in Figure 1). The reporting period ends in October 2022 and the  analysis of the incidents was concluded in December 2022. This is why the number of incidents appears lower in Q4  2022 compared with the previous quarters.  We are expecting a further increase of cyber incidents in 2022, especially if we consider that incident handling and  analysis is ongoing and that the reporting of incidents often occurs at a later date. However, an increase in the  number of reported cyber-attacks does not necessarily mean that the number of attacks has actually increased. This  change could be due to the sector maturing in terms of incident detection and reporting. For example, this could be  due to the effect of the legal obligation to report incidents under the NIS directive and/or national regulations.  Alternatively, the attention of the media or the public could be focused on a particular sector for a particular time  period, resulting in more incidents appearing in OSINT sources.  Figure 1: Number of incidents per quarter (January 2021 to October 2022)  10 Incidents targeting the transport sector accounted for 4.8% and 4.3% of the total incidents identified in ENISA threat landscapes 2021 and 2022,  respectively. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021; https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape- 2022  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  8  An important aspect involves the proximity of transport related cyber threats with respect to the European Union. We  classify incidents according to the proposed classification for the EU common security and defence policy11, as  follows.  Near – Affected networks, systems, controlled and assured within EU borders. Affected population within the borders  of the EU.  Mid – Networks and systems considered vital for operational objectives within the scope of the EU digital single  market and the NIS directive sectors, but their control and assurance rely on non-EU institutional authorities or  Member State public or private authorities. Affected population in geographical areas close to EU borders.  Far – Networks and systems that, if influenced, will have a critical impact on operational objectives within the scope  of the EU digital single market and the NIS directive sectors. Control and assurance of those networks and systems  lies beyond EU institutional authorities and Member States’ public or private authorities. Affected population in  geographical areas Far from the EU.  Global – All the aforementioned areas.  The following map gives an overview of the incidents observed in the world for the reporting period, while Figure 3  and Figure 4 show the proximity of incidents to the EU for 2021 and 2022 respectively.  Figure 2: Map of observed incidents (January 2021 to October 2022)  Note: the size of the circle refers to the sum of observed incidents in the country during the reporting period.  11 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/603175/EPRS_STU(2017)603175_EN.pdf  https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/603175/EPRS_STU(2017)603175_EN.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  9  As mentioned above, the data collection process prioritises incidents that occur in the EU. Even with this limitation,  we can safely assess that in 2022 there was a significant increase of incidents that were made public and affected  the EU (category ‘Near’) and areas close to the EU (category ‘Mid’), compared to 2021. This comes as no surprise  considering the current geopolitical situation in which the EU is involved and the significance which was placed on the  transport sector during Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.  Figure 3: Proximity of observed incidents  (January 2021 to December 2021)  Figure 4: Proximity of observed incidents  (January 2022 to October 2022)  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  10  2.2  PRIME THREATS  During the reporting period, we observed the following types of threats (Figure 5) to the transport sector. An incident  can be categorised in more than one threat category, which means that the total percentage of the threats shown in  Figure 5 exceeds 100%. For example, the attack vector for initial access may include a phishing campaign, which is  then followed by a compromise with ransomware. Likewise, incidents which included an attack to a supplier were  categorised both as supply-chain attacks and as the type of attack used for the compromise.  Figure 5: Prime threats to the transport sector (January 2021 to October 2022)  Ransomware  Ransomware is defined as a type of attack where threat actors take control of a target’s assets and demand a  ransom in exchange for the return of the asset’s availability12. Ransomware incidents are presented separately from  malware, as they are significant portion of the identified incidents (38%) during the reporting period, with several high  profile and highly publicised incidents.  Threats against data  Sources of data are being targeted with the aim of unauthorised access and disclosure and manipulating data to  interfere with the behaviour of systems. These threats are also the basis of many other threats, also discussed in this  report. For instance, ransomware, or DDoS attacks aim to deny access to data and possibly collect a payment to  restore this access. Technically speaking, threats against data can mainly be classified as data breaches and data  leaks. A data breach is an intentional attack brought by a cybercriminal with the goal of gaining unauthorised access  and the release of sensitive, confidential or protected data. A data leak is an event that can cause the unintentional  release of sensitive, confidential or protected data due to, for example, misconfigurations, vulnerabilities or human  errors. In this reporting period, around 30% of the observed incidents were a form of threat against the data of  transport organisations.  Malware  Malware is an overarching term used to describe any software or firmware intended to perform an unauthorised  process that will have an adverse impact on the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a system. Traditionally,  12 ENISA Threat Landscape for Ransomware Attacks https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-ransomware-attacks  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-ransomware-attacks  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  11  examples of malicious code types include viruses, worms, trojan horses, spyware, adware or other code-based  entities that infect a host. During this reporting period, 17% of incidents targeting the transport sector involved  malware.  Denial of service  Availability is the target of a plethora of threats and attacks, among which DDoS stands out. DDoS attacks target  system and data availability and, though not a new threat, have a significant role in the cybersecurity threat  landscape of the transport sector. Attacks occur when users of a system or service are not able to access relevant  data, services or other resources. This can be accomplished by exhausting the service and its resources or  overloading the components of the network infrastructure. During the reporting period, geopolitical developments and  hacktivist activity increased the number of DDoS attacks against transport organisations, reaching 16% of total  incidents.  Vulnerability exploitation  Vulnerability exploitation refers to exploitation of known or zero-day vulnerabilities13.  Social engineering  Social engineering encompasses a broad range of activities that attempt to exploit a human error or human behaviour  with the objective of gaining access to information or services. It uses various forms of manipulation to trick victims  into making mistakes or handing over sensitive or secret information. In cybersecurity, social engineering lures users  into opening documents, files or emails, visiting websites or granting unauthorised persons access to systems or  services. This threat canvas consists mainly of the following vectors: phishing, spear-phishing, whaling, smishing,  vishing, business email compromise, fraud, impersonation and counterfeiting. In this reporting period, we primarily  observed phishing and spear phishing attacks targeting transport users (10%) and fraud, impersonation and  counterfeit incidents (6%).  Attacks to suppliers and supply-chain attacks  A supply-chain attack targets the relationship between organisations and their suppliers. For this report we use the  definition as stated in the ENISA Threat Landscape for Supply Chain, where an attack is considered to have a  supply-chain component when it consists of a combination of at least two attacks. For an attack to be classified as a  supply-chain attack, both the supplier and the customer have to be targets. It seems that threat actors are continuing  to feed on this source to conduct their operations and gain a foothold within organisations, in an attempt to benefit  from the widespread impact and potential victim base of such attacks. In this reporting period, we observed both  supply-chain attacks, as defined above, and attacks to suppliers that caused disruptions or losses to entities in the  transport sector (10% of total incidents). This impact was not necessarily the effect of a secondary attack.  Breach/intrusion  Breach/intrusion refers to incidents where an attack to a system has been confirmed or made public and attackers  have gained access to systems, but the details of how the breach or the intrusion took place are not clear. These  types of incidents account for 9% of the total number of incidents.  Other threats include single occasions of credential harvesting and spoofing of geolocation in the maritime  sector.  Finally, there is a small percentage of incidents where even though a cyberattack took place, there is insufficient  information to allow for the incident to be categorised. This accounts for a total of 7% of incidents (unknowns).  13 For more information regarding the common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) that were discovered and used from July 2021 to June 2022, see  ENISA Threat Landscape 2022 (annex C). https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  12  Figure 6: Prime threats to the transport sector: 2021 v 2022  The data on incidents collected until October 2022 indicate an increase in reporting of ransomware attacks during  2022. The number of ransomware attacks reported to the transport sector almost doubled, rising to 25% in 2022 from  13% during 2021. Contrary to ransomware, we observed a decline in malware incidents in 2022 compared to 2021  (from 11% to 6%).  Data related threats (breaches, leaks) declined compared to ransomware, but remain significant. The attacks  observed in 2021 and 2022 targeted credentials, the personal data of employees and passengers, corporate data  and intellectual property.  We also observed an increase in DDoS attacks in 2022, which is mostly linked to recent activity by hacktivists. The  rates of these attacks are focused on specific regions and are affected by current geopolitical tensions. The current  geopolitical situation and its effect on the transport sector can be seen in Figure 7. The map depicts selected  incidents in all transport sectors which were attributed to hacktivism. The motivation was primarily operational  disruption and ideological.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  13  Figure 7: Global map of incidents (hacktivism)  Note: the size of the circle refers to the sum of observed incidents in the country during the reporting period.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  14  2.3  THREAT ACTORS & MOTIVATION  Similarly to the ENISA Threat Landscape 202114 and ENISA Threat Landscape 202215, we considered four  categories of cybersecurity threat actors: state-sponsored actors, cybercriminals, hackers-for-hire, and hacktivists.  • Cybercriminals’ primary motive is financial gain, often stealing data or demanding ransom.  • Hackers-for-hire sell their services to people who do not have the skills or capabilities to do so.  • State-sponsored actors target organisations to compromise, steal, change, or destroy information. These  groups are usually affiliated with a nation state16.  • Hacktivists are politically, socially, or ideologically motivated and target victims for publicity or to effect  change.  For the cases in which one of these types of actors was not identified, we either categorised the incident as an  individual actor or as unknown. During the reporting, we did not have information on hacker-for-hire actors targeting  the transport sector, so they are not included in Figure 8.  Figure 8: Actors  Figure 8 shows the overall activity of actors targeting the sector, while Figure 9 analyses this activity on a monthly  basis.  14 ENISA Threat Landscape 2021 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021  15 ENISA Threat Landscape 2022 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  16 The term has been used interchangeably with Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), however APT refers to a type of activity conducted by a range of  actors.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  15  Figure 9: Actor activity (January 2021 to October 2022)  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  16  For the analysis of the incidents, we have considered the following motivations.  • Espionage, when the aim of the attack is information gathering (either intellectual property or information of  national importance).  • Financial gain, when there is a clear monetary claim behind the attack, such as extortion, selling of stolen  data, etc.  • Ideological, when the attack is linked to hacktivist activity and there are clear declarations on the aim of the  attack by the actor.  • Operational disruption, when the attack is aiming at disrupting services, as opposed to cases where a  disruption of operations is a side effect of an attack.  Figure 10: Motivation  More than half of the incidents observed in the reporting period were linked to cybercriminals (55%). This is also  linked with the motivation behind these attacks which is predominately financial gain (38%). The transport sector is  considered a lucrative business for cybercriminals, with customer data considered a commodity and with highly  valuable proprietary information when transport supply chain is being targeted. One fourth of the attacks are linked to  hacktivist groups (23%), with the motivation of their attacks usually being linked to the geopolitical environment and  aiming at operational disruption (20%) or ideological motivation (6%).  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  17  2.4  IMPACT  When considering the impact of an incident to the sector, we analysed who was the target of the attack (Figure 11)  and which were the affected assets (Figure 12).  As the types of targeted entities differ between subsectors, Figure 11 offers a breakdown of the targets by subsector.  Please note that one incident may be targeting multiple transport entities.  All subsectors had authorities and bodies that were being targeted, in fact 38% of the incidents targeted transport  authorities. In the railway sector, incidents almost exclusively targeted railway undertakings and infrastructure  managers. Similarly, port operators were the most affected entities in the maritime sector. These two sectors had only  a few incidents targeting supply chain or service providers. This was not the case in the road sector, where OEM, tier- X suppliers and service providers were targeted, along with public transport operators. In the aviation sector, airlines  and airport operators are the main targets, followed by service providers, surface transport operators and the supply  chain.  Figure 11: Targets (number of incidents per entity type)  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  18  Figure 12: Affected assets  Detailed and reliable information about the impact of incidents is not readily available in OSINT reports. It can often  be deduced from the description of the incident, but the impact assessment can often include a lower level of  confidence. In particular, reputational, legal and social impacts are particularly difficult to assess. Similarly, financial  impact can be calculated in various ways by the affected party and it can change over time as the effect of an incident  develops and its long-term consequences are assessed. For this reason, we were able to include only reported digital  or physical impact in the analysis.  Figure 13: Digital impact  Digital impact (Figure 13) refers to any effect of the attack on the information and communications technology (ICT)  systems of the affected entity, while physical impact (Figure 14) refers to cases where the incident causes operational  disruption or even destruction of the infrastructure. As we observe, we have more rich information when it comes to  the digital impact of cyberattacks on the transport sector. For physical impact, we could not find information of the  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  19  actual physical impact for the majority of incidents, as either information was not disclosed or physical impact did not  take place.  Figure 14: Physical impact  An alternative dataset which gives a better indication of the impact of attacks are the incidents reported to ENISA by  national authorities under the provisions of the NIS directive17. These refer to incidents that cause significant impact.  At the time of publication data for 2022 were not yet available, data were available only for 2021. In 2021, 34  incidents had a significant impact on transport entities. They account for 6% of the total number of incidents reported  to ENISA in 2021. In fact, 65% of these incidents were the result of malicious actions, 32% were due to system  failures and 3% were due to human error. These data highlight a significant gap in finding information on non- malicious incidents that can cause disruptions to the transport sector, as these are rarely available in OSINT reports.  17 In the EU, critical service providers have to report cybersecurity incidents that have a significant impact to the national authorities in their country. At  the end of each year, the summary reports about these incidents are collected, anonymised, aggregated and analysed by ENISA. The visualisation tool  shows the overall statistics for the EU. https://ciras.enisa.europa.eu/  https://ciras.enisa.europa.eu/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  20  3. SECTOR ANALYSIS  In this section we further analyse the findings for each transport sector. We distinguish between incidents targeting  aviation, maritime, railway and road transport, while we also include a category called ‘all transport’ which refers to  attacks that target either all four sectors or, more commonly, ministries of transport. For the reporting period, we  studied 27 incidents targeting aviation (28%), 18 incidents targeting maritime (18%), 21 incidents targeting railway  (21%) and 24 incidents targeting road transport (24%). We also included 8 incidents (8%) that targeted the transport  sector as a whole, or incidents targeting transport ministries.

We can see here that the focus of the report is  on the incidents that affect EU transport and the neighbouring countries. However, we have included significant  incidents from the world, targeting transport entities primarily in North America and Asia. The map also gives an  indication of the geographical spread of affected subsectors.  Figure 18: Global map of observed incidents  Note: the size of the circle refers to the sum of observed incidents in the country during the reporting period.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  23  In Figure 19 and Figure 20 we depict the motivation and the actors of the observed incidents for each sector.  Figure 19: Motivation in each sector  Figure 20: Actor in each sector  Cybercriminals are the main actors responsible for attacks on the transport sector (54% of the total number of  incidents) and they target all subsectors. They use the ‘follow the money’ philosophy in their modus operandi. Almost  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  24  two fifths of the total number of incidents are incidents attributed to cybercriminals targeting two sectors: aviation and  road transport. During the reporting period, 18% of cybercriminals targeted the aviation sector (primarily airports and  airlines and their customers) and 19% targeted the road sector (primarily the automotive industry). Likewise, the  motivation behind attacks on these two sectors was primarily financial gain (11% and 13% of the total number of  incidents, respectively), as the aviation and automotive industries are considered to be the more lucrative ones for  cybercriminals. The attacks are considered opportunistic in nature, as we have not observed known groups targeting  the transport sector exclusively.  We observe that hacktivists have claimed responsibility for attacks on the railway (8%) and aviation (6%) sectors, and  this has to do mainly with attacks linked to the Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine. In particular, these types  of attacks make up almost one tenth of the total number of incidents that aimed at operational disruption in the  railway sector.  State-sponsored actors were more often attributed to targeting the maritime sector or targeting government  authorities of transport (‘All transport’ category).  Figure 21 presents the sectorial analysis of all observed threats. We observe that there are differences in how these  threats affect specific sectors. These differences are discussed in greater detail in the chapters that follow.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  25  Figure 21: Prime threats in each sector (number of observed incidents)  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  26  3.1  AVIATION SECTOR  According to the data collected through OSINT by ENISA and the EU aviation safety agency (see Figure 22), prime  threats for the aviation sector are data-related threats (45%), ransomware (36%) and malware (23%). In the majority  of ransomware cases in the aviation sector, the attack is followed by data-related threats, such as data exfiltration  and leakage, so there is significant overlap in these two categories. Customer data are one of the prime targeted  assets of the sector, followed by the proprietary information of original equipment manufacturers (OEM).  Figure 22: Aviation - prime threats  In 2022, we observed an increase in the number of ransomware attacks affecting airports (see Figure 23). Out of all  operators (excluding original equipment manufacturers), airport operators are the most affected by ransomware  attacks. Airports, airlines and ultimately the passengers suffer due to other incidents that have an impact on their  data. The most notable events include the following.  • In March 2021 the passenger service system provider SITA was hacked; hundreds of thousands of Star  Alliance passengers’ details were stolen.  • In April 2021 a malware attack on Radixx Res disrupts 20 airlines’ ticket reservation systems18. The service  disruption made it impossible for many of the airline passengers to make, change, delete or confirm  bookings through the airlines’ websites, although flight operations were not affected.  • In May 2021 Air India suffered a data breach. 4.5 million customers were impacted only 2 months after its  passenger service system provider SITA was hacked.  • In August 2021 Bangkok Air confirmed the leak of passenger data after a ransomware attack19. According to  the airline, some of the personal data that may have been included in the stolen files included data fields  such as passenger name, family name, nationality, gender, phone number, email address, home address,  contact information, passport information, historical travel information, partial credit card information and  special meal information.  18 https://www.databreaches.net/malware-attack-on-radixx-res-disrupts-20-airlines-ticket-reservation-systems/  19 https://therecord.media/bangkok-air-confirms-passenger-pii-leak-after-ransomware-attack/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  27  Figure 23: Aviation - prime threats (annually)  • In January 2022 Dassault Falcon Jet was hit by the Ragnar Locker ransomware gang20. The attack may  have led to the exposure of personal information belonging to current and former employees, and their  spouses and dependents.  • In February 2022 Swissport International was hit by a ransomware attack that had a severe impact on its  operations, causing flights to suffer delays. Following the attack, the perpetrators (BlackCat) leaked data  which included business documents, tax declarations, images of passports and ID cards of individuals.  Leaked data also included personal information of job candidates21.  • In May 2022, after a ransomware attack on SpiceJet, hundreds of passengers were stranded at airports  across India, particularly those airports where restrictions on night operations were in effect22.  • In May 2022 a Turkish airline exposed flight and crew information in a 6.5 terabyte leak23.  • In August 2022 Accelya, a technology firm providing services to Delta, British Airways, JetBlue, United,  Virgin Atlantic, American Airlines and many others, confirmed that company data was posted on a  ransomware leak site24.  • In August 2022 TAP Air Portugal was the target of a Ragnar Locker ransomware attack. The attackers  leaked customers’ names, addresses and telephone numbers25.  20 https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dassault-falcon-jet-reports-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/  21 https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/128039/cyber-crime/blackcat-swissport-ransomware-attack.html  22 https://therecord.media/spiceject-ransomware-attack-flights-grounded/  23 https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/turkish-airline-exposes-flight/  24 https://therecord.media/major-airline-technology-provider-accelya-attacked-by-ransomware-group/  25 https://www.portugalresident.com/hackers-share-personal-data-of-1-5-million-tap-passengers/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  28  • In October 2022 ransomware group LockBit 3.0 claimed to have compromised the aeronautical French  defence and technology firm Thales Group26.  • In October 2022 it was claimed on the Black Basta data leak website that the United States (US) aerospace  and defence company Genesys Aerosystems, which mainly produces advanced avionics solutions and  components, was a ransomware victim27.  The data collected and analysed by Eurocontrol’s EATM-CERT28 highlight a threat that often goes underreported in  open sources. The main threat which is being reported to Eurocontrol is fraudulent websites impersonating airlines.  From January 2022 to June 2022, fraudulent websites accounted for 46% of incidents reported to Eurocontrol. This  discrepancy is due to the fact that this information is not often made publicly available. It is linked to the sector’s  victimology, which is mainly airlines and their customers being targeted. The rest of the threats reported to  Eurocontrol for the first semester of 2022 were web application attacks (22%), DDoS attacks (13%), phishing  attempts (12%), ransomware (6%) and malware (1%).  DDoS attacks were primarily observed by ENISA in 2022 and were linked with hacktivist activity against airports and  aviation authorities, such as the following.  • In April 2022 the website of the Israel Airports Authority was temporarily taken offline due to a denial-of- service attack29.  • In May 2022 a pro-Russia hacker group launched an attack on the websites of Italian ministries, including  attacks targeting Italian airports30.  • In June 2022 pro-Russia hacker group NoName057 targeted Lithuanian airports with DDoS attacks31.  • In October 2022 Russian threat actors (e.g. Anonymous Russia) led DDoS attacks on airports in Bratislava  32, Budapest and Bulgaria33, targeting their websites.  • In October 2022 the websites of major US airports34 were disrupted due to a large-scale campaign of DDoS  attacks, in which pro-Russian hacker group Killnet flooded servers with web traffic to take websites offline.  Eurocontrol EATM-CERT collected and shared with ENISA 97 individual cases where pro-Russian hacker group  Killnet targeted airports in the EU and neighbouring countries during 2022 (proximity ‘Near’, Mid’). The map of this  activity is depicted in Figure 24.  Data collected from ENISA and Eurocontrol indicate that airspace users/airlines are the main victims of attacks (see  Figure 25). This is mainly due to the financial motivation behind these attacks, which is predominant in the sector.  Airlines are being targeted directly by attacks to their systems and indirectly by attacks targeting their customers (e.g.  by fraudulent websites). Eurocontrol reports airspace users (80%), airports (12%), OEMs / supply chain (6%), air  navigation service providers (1%) and civil aviation authorities (1%) as the main targets for January 2022 to June  2022.  26 https://cyware.com/news/lockbit-30-gang-allegedly-stole-thales-groups-data-aa676192/  27 https://www.redpacketsecurity.com/black-basta-ransomware-victim-genesys-aerosystems/  28 The incidents which served as a basis for the analyses (January 2021 to June 2022) were: (a) publicly reported incidents/events which EATM-CERT  collected, (b) findings of EATM-CERT (c) non-publicly reported cyber incidents or events, shared with EATM-CERT by aviation stakeholders (air  navigation service providers, airport operators, original equipment manufacturers, civil aviation authorities, airspace users) and the Aviation Information  Sharing and Analysis Centre.  29 https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/airport-websites-hit-by-denial-of-service-attack/  30 https://www.wired.it/article/attacco-cyber-russia-italia-legion-ministero-polizia/  31 https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1728365/major-incidents-contained-after-lithuania-gets-hit-with-massive-cyber-attacks  32 https://www.cyberthreat.report/ddos-attack-against-slovakia-by-russian-hackers/  33 https://sofiaglobe.com/2022/10/16/official-cyber-attack-on-bulgarian-government-websites-traced-to-russia/  34 https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-airports-sites-taken-down-in-ddos-attacks-by-pro-russian-hackers/  https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/airport-websites-hit-by-denial-of-service-attack/ https://www.wired.it/article/attacco-cyber-russia-italia-legion-ministero-polizia/ https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1728365/major-incidents-contained-after-lithuania-gets-hit-with-massive-cyber-attacks https://www.cyberthreat.report/ddos-attack-against-slovakia-by-russian-hackers/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  29  Figure 24: Airports targeted by Killnet in Europe and neighbouring countries during 2022  Note: the size of the circle refers to the sum of observed incidents in the country during the reporting period.

Figure 25: Aviation - targets  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  30  3.2  MARITIME SECTOR  The proliferation of cybersecurity incidents35 in ports over the last few years, such as the cyberattack on Antwerp  port36, the NotPetya ransomware incident and its impact on Maersk37 and the wave of ransomware attacks on the  Port of Barcelona 38 and San Diego39, has led to a change in the sector's cyber risk profile. Figures 26 and 27 show  the threats targeting the maritime sector overall and on an annual basis.  Figure 26: Maritime - prime threats  Attacks in the maritime domain are often politically motivated and perpetrated by state-sponsored attackers. During  2021 and 2022, a few notable cases of activities linked to state actors were reported. These attacks indicate the  interest of state sponsored actors to cause operational disruption by targeting ports and vessels.  In early 2021, it was reported that two Indian sea ports were targeted by Chinese hackers amid geopolitical  tensions40. In August 2021 the Port of Houston Authority was targeted by a cybersecurity attack which is believed to  have originated from a nation-state actor. In October 2021 Microsoft reported that ‘Iran-linked’ hackers targeted US,  EU and Israeli defence and maritime sectors with password spray attacks41. May 2022 Israel was linked to a  disruptive cyberattack on an Iranian port facility42. Computers that regulate the flow of vessels, trucks and goods all  crashed at once, creating massive congestions on waterways and roads leading to the facility. In May 2022 the Port  of London Authority was hit by a DDoS attack, which temporarily took the Port of London’s website offline. The attack  is believed to have been carried out by the Iran-affiliated Altahrea group and politically rather than financially  35 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/port-cybersecurity-good-practices-for-cybersecurity-in-the-maritime-sector/@@download/fullReport  36 https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24539417  37 https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/  38 https://www.securitynewspaper.com/2018/09/26/hacking-attack-in-port-of-barcelona/  39 https://www.darktrace.com/en/blog/troubled-waters-cyber-attacks-on-san-diego-and-barcelonas-ports/  40 https://www.recordedfuture.com/redecho-targeting-indian-power-sector  41 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/10/11/iran-linked-dev-0343-targeting-defense-gis-and-maritime-sectors/  42 https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/officials-israel-linked-to-a-disruptive-cyberattack-on-iranian-port-facility/2020/05/18/9d1da866- 9942-11ea-89fd-28fb313d1886_story.html  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/port-cybersecurity-good-practices-for-cybersecurity-in-the-maritime-sector/@@download/fullReport https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24539417 https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/ https://www.securitynewspaper.com/2018/09/26/hacking-attack-in-port-of-barcelona/ https://www.darktrace.com/en/blog/troubled-waters-cyber-attacks-on-san-diego-and-barcelonas-ports/ https://www.recordedfuture.com/redecho-targeting-indian-power-sector https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/10/11/iran-linked-dev-0343-targeting-defense-gis-and-maritime-sectors/ https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/officials-israel-linked-to-a-disruptive-cyberattack-on-iranian-port-facility/2020/05/18/9d1da866-9942-11ea-89fd-28fb313d1886_story.html https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/officials-israel-linked-to-a-disruptive-cyberattack-on-iranian-port-facility/2020/05/18/9d1da866-9942-11ea-89fd-28fb313d1886_story.html  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  31  motivated43. This group is known for having made multiple DDoS attacks on Israeli targets, including the Israel Ports  Authority, in the past.  Finally, an interesting threat that may affect vessels is the spoofing of the automatic identification system44 by a  hostile state, although we have not seen many occurrences of this threat in the past.  Figure 27: Maritime - prime threats (annually)  When it comes to activity by cybercriminals or individual actors, we primarily observe ransomware, malware and  phishing / spear-phishing attacks targeting the port authorities, port operators or manufacturers (supply chain) (see  Figure 28).  Examples include the following.  • In February 2021 French boat building giant Beneteau announced that it had suffered a malware intrusion  on some of its servers and that it had decided to disconnect all ‘information systems’ to prevent the malware  from spreading. Several production units, notably in France, had to slow down or stop their production  activities for a few days45.  43 https://safety4sea.com/cyber-attack-targets-port-of-london-authority/  44 https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/24/russia_ais_spoofing/  45 https://www.securityweek.com/boat-building-giant-beneteau-says-cyberattack-disrupted-production  https://safety4sea.com/cyber-attack-targets-port-of-london-authority/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  32  • In June 2021 the Massachusetts Steamship Authority was targeted by a ransomware attack which brought  down its website and caused delays for ferry passengers.  • In August 2021 the Compagnie générale de navigation sur le Lac Léman fell victim to a cyberattack on its  website, targeting the ticketing system. The hackers managed to steal the bank details of some customers46.  • In September 2021 French carrier CMA CGM confirmed a data leak, which involved customer information,  including names, employers, positions, email and phone details47.  • In November 2021 a ransomware attack on the maritime IT company Danaos (ICT service provider) affected  several Greek shipping companies who used the Danaos’ communication systems48. Reportedly, the  cyberattack blocked their communication with ships, suppliers, agents, charterers and suppliers, while at the  same time the files with their correspondence were lost.  • In February 2022 a suspected ransomware attack knocked out the management information system at the  Jawaharlal Nehru Port Container Terminal, one of five container terminals in India’s top container gateway,  the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (Nhava Sheva). The Jawaharlal Nehru Port Container Terminal had one of  its scheduled vessels divert to a nearby terminal after it abruptly stopped accepting vessels. At the same  time, the system breakdown left port users no choice but to revert to paper-based cargo processing. This  caused major traffic problems at the gates of the port, also disrupting traffic at the gates of other terminals49.  Moreover, there were major disruptions in other ports where we lack information on what type of attack took place.  For example, in July 2021 four major ports in South Africa (Cape Town, Ngqura, Port Elizabeth and Durban) were  paralysed following a massive attack on the Transnet National Port Authority, the country’s main freight manager50. In  January 2022, several northern European oil hubs in major ports were the target of cyberattacks51. IT systems have  been disrupted at Oiltanking in Germany, SEA-Invest in Belgium and Evos in the Netherlands.

Ransomware  and data-related threats are the two main threats targeting the railway sector (45% and 25%, respectively), followed  by DDoS attacks with an increasing rate. Ransomware and Data-related threats are closely interlinked, as a  ransomware attack is often followed by data leakage or exfiltration.  Figure 29: Railway - prime threats  The majority of the attacks observed targeted the IT systems of railways (passenger services, ticketing systems,  mobile application, display boards, etc.) and caused disruptions due to the unavailability of these services. Examples  include the ransomware attacks targeting Skånetrafiken (August 2021) and Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane (March  2022), which resulted in customers not being able to buy tickets following infections to IT systems. The only cases  were OT systems and networks were affected were either when entire networks were affected or when safety-critical  IT systems were unavailable.  Notable data thefts include the cases of OmniTRAX, MTA, Norfolk Southern Railroads and Lokaltog A/S, where  personnel and medical records were stolen. The case of OmniTRAX represents the first publicly known case of a  double-extortion ransomware attack against a US freight rail operator.  Another interesting case includes the service disruptions to the Danish train operator DSB’s network (October 2022)  due to an attack on one of its ICT service providers after an alleged DDoS attack. The incident reportedly affected the  accessibility of a key safety-critical IT system, thereby disrupting DSB operations for several hours that day.  Finally, an interesting case is the one of hacktivists launching a ransomware attack on the Belarusian state-run train  company in a bid to disrupt Russian troop movements (January 2022). To achieve this, the group deployed modified  ransomware to bring down the railway system and encrypted servers, databases and workstations belonging to the  Belarusian railway service.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  34  Figure 30: Railway - prime threats (annually)  Figure 31: Railway - targets  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  35  DDoS attacks were on the rise in 2022, reaching one fifth of the attacks on the railway sector (20%). This is primarily  due to the increased hacktivist activity which followed Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Hacktivist elements  with pro-Russian/anti-NATO sentiments have been conducting DDoS attacks against railway companies. Examples  include pro-Russia hacker groups claiming responsibility for attacks on railway transport operator CFR Calatori (April  2022), Lithuanian Railways (June 2022), Latvian passenger train company SJSC (June 2022) and Estonian Railways  (August 2022).  When it comes to vulnerabilities (15%), two cases stand out. In December 2021 Canadian transportation agency  Metrolinx temporarily took down their website as a precautionary measure, after being informed by the federal  government about a cyber vulnerability. In January 2022, an anonymous hacker reported a vulnerability impacting the  Swiss national railway system and potentially allowing access to customers’ personal data.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  36  3.4  ROAD SECTOR  Figure 32 and Figure 33 show the threats targeting the road sector overall and on annual basis. Ransomware is the  predominant threat (43%) for the road transport sector, followed by data-related threats (26%) and malware (17%).  Figure 32: Road - prime threats  Ransomware has targeted the automotive industry, in particular OEMs and tier-X suppliers. In some cases, the  production of vehicles or parts had to stop due to an attack. Notable cases include the following.  • In September 2021 Dutch car company Bochane fell victim to a ransomware attack. According to the report,  which was published on the company website, a lot of their computers were blocked for a day52.  • In February 2022 Toyota Motor Corporation suspended factory operations for a day, losing around 13 000  cars of output, after a supplier of plastic parts and electronic components was hit by a suspected  cyberattack53.  • In February 2022 Kia Motors America suffered a ransomware attack by the DoppelPaymer gang, demanding  USD 20 million for a decrypter and to not leak stolen data. The attack was acknowledged in the public  domain after Kia Motors America portals faced major outages and internal disruptions to its customer-facing  systems across the country54.  • In March 2022 Japanese car parts giant Denso55 shut down the network connections of compromised  devices after detecting a breach. The incident has not led to the disruption of production activities, with  plants continuing to operate normally. However, the hacker group Pandora has taken credit for the attack,  claiming to have stolen 1.4 terabytes of data.  52 https://www.omroepflevoland.nl/nieuws/254573/autobedrijf-bochane-gehackt  53 https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-suspends-all-domestic-factory-operations-after-suspected-cyber-attack-2022-02-28/  54 https://aithority.com/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-attack-sinks-a-global-motor-companys-20-million/  55 https://www.securityweek.com/car-parts-giant-denso-targeted-ransomware-group  https://www.omroepflevoland.nl/nieuws/254573/autobedrijf-bochane-gehackt https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-suspends-all-domestic-factory-operations-after-suspected-cyber-attack-2022-02-28/ https://aithority.com/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-attack-sinks-a-global-motor-companys-20-million/ https://www.securityweek.com/car-parts-giant-denso-targeted-ransomware-group  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  37  Figure 33: Road - prime threats (annually)  • In April 2022 Germany’s car rental giant Sixt was hit by cyberattack56. All non-essential services were shut  down. It was assumed that ransomware groups are focusing on an organisation like Sixt because of the  upcoming tourist season.  • In May 2022 AGCO Corporation sites in China, France, Germany and the US suffered a ransomware attack,  making servers inaccessible and halting production for 2 days57.  • In June 2022 a US subsidiary of Nichirin58, a Japanese company that makes hoses for the automotive  industry, was hit by ransomware. The incident forced the company to shut down some production control  systems and switch to manual processes.  56 https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/car-rental-giant-sixt-hit-by/  57 https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/hauts-de-france/oise/beauvais/piratage-informatique-le-site-d-assemblage-de-tracteurs-massey-fergusson- agco-beauvais-victime-d-une-cyber-attaque-2537316.html  58 https://www.securityweek.com/us-subsidiary-automotive-hose-maker-nichirin-hit-ransomware  https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/car-rental-giant-sixt-hit-by/ https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/hauts-de-france/oise/beauvais/piratage-informatique-le-site-d-assemblage-de-tracteurs-massey-fergusson-agco-beauvais-victime-d-une-cyber-attaque-2537316.html https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/hauts-de-france/oise/beauvais/piratage-informatique-le-site-d-assemblage-de-tracteurs-massey-fergusson-agco-beauvais-victime-d-une-cyber-attaque-2537316.html https://www.securityweek.com/us-subsidiary-automotive-hose-maker-nichirin-hit-ransomware  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  38  Figure 34: Road - targets  Data-related threats primarily targeted IT systems in an effort to acquire customer or employee data and proprietary  information. In February 2021, hackers published the data of more than 3.2 million users of DriveSure (US car  dealership service provider focused on employee training programmes and customer retention)59. According to the  sources, hackers published leaked folders with over 22 GB of MySQL databases with not only personal information,  but also 93 063 hashed passwords and emails with clients. In August 2021, Skånetrafiken (Sweden’s regional public  transportation authority and operator) was, for the second time, the subject of cyberattacks. The target was ticketing  machines and the website for buying tickets60. Strætó61 (public transport company which operates city buses in the  Icelandic capital) also fell victim to cyberattacks, where the personal data of employees was stolen.  Notable cases of proprietary information being stolen or leaked include the attacks on Tesla and Volvo. In September  2021 Tesla’s ‘top-secret full self-driving AI car software’62, which enables Tesla cars to drive autonomously, was  leaked, enabling hackers outside the US to use this functionality. In December 2021 Volvo disclosed in a press  release63 that unknown attackers had stolen R & D information by hacking some of their servers, but did not confirm  the nature of the attack, which was allegedly a ransomware attack.  59 https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2021/02/01/personal-data-of-3-million-people-exposed-in-drivesure-hack/  60 https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/skane/skanetrafikens-sajt-och-app-ur-funktion  61 https://straeto.is/en/user-information/cyber-attack-against-straeto  62 https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/elon-musks-top-secret-full-24929177  63 https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/292817/notice-of-cyber-security-breach-by-third-party-1  https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2021/02/01/personal-data-of-3-million-people-exposed-in-drivesure-hack/ https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/skane/skanetrafikens-sajt-och-app-ur-funktion https://straeto.is/en/user-information/cyber-attack-against-straeto https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/elon-musks-top-secret-full-24929177 https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/292817/notice-of-cyber-security-breach-by-third-party-1  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  39  3.5  CROSS SECTOR ATTACKS  Finally, there is a limited number of cyber incidents that cannot be placed in one specific subsector. These include  general campaigns targeting the whole transportation sector in particular countries. These campaigns are often  attributed to hacktivists and state-sponsored actors and are linked to geopolitical tensions.  Moreover, there are also incidents where attackers directly target transport agencies. Examples include incidents of  impersonation, such as in the case of the US Department of Transport, which was the target of phishing attacks both  in September 202164 and in September 202265. For more examples of these types of attacks, please refer to the  Annex.  Figure 35: Threats targeting the transport sector as a whole  The report did not analyse the effect of cyber-attacks which target sectors that transport depends on. Such an  analysis would include energy and telecommunication. This is an interesting aspect to examine in future threat  landscapes.  64 https://threatpost.com/attackers-impersonate-dot-phishing-scam/169484/?web_view=true  65 https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-365-phishing-attacks-impersonate-us-govt-agencies/;  https://cofense.com/blog/credential-phishing-targeting-government-contractors-evolves-over-time  https://threatpost.com/attackers-impersonate-dot-phishing-scam/169484/?web_view=true https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-365-phishing-attacks-impersonate-us-govt-agencies/ https://cofense.com/blog/credential-phishing-targeting-government-contractors-evolves-over-time  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  40  4. CONCLUSIONS  In this report, we have performed a deep dive into the threat landscape of a particular sector, namely the transport  sector. While the annual ENISA threat landscapes include sectorial analysis, the documents do not analyse the  context of each sector in depth. In this report, we have tried to shed more light in the types of incidents, the actor  motivations, the affected assets, the victims and the potential impacts to the transport sector. This information is often  sector specific and can provide more valuable information for risk management to the cybersecurity professionals in  the transport sector.  Ransomware attacks became the most significant threat against the sector during 2022, surpassing data- related threats, which were the most significant threat in 2021  . However, it is still assessed that ransomware groups remain opportunistic and relatively indiscriminate in their  targeting. Recent months do not indicate that there has been any particular focus on the transport sector relative to  other sectors. Ransomware has been steadily increasing66 and the transport sector has been affected similarly to the  other sectors.  Our assessment is that threat actors will increasingly conduct ransomware attacks with not only monetary  motivations66. An example is the ransomware attack by Belarusian hacktivists against the Belarusian state railway in  January 202267. Hacktivists will likely be attracted by the effectiveness and the impact that ransomware attacks can  have and the media attention they attract. The scale and sophistication of hacktivists’ ransomware operations are not  expected to be as high as the ones conducted by cybercriminals. Finally, governmental organisations are very likely  the primary targets of hacktivists’ ransomware operations.  The significant increase in hacktivist activity, which followed Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and  the increasing rate of DDoS attacks are highly likely to continue. Hacktivist elements with pro-Russian/anti- NATO sentiments have been conducting DDoS attacks. These attacks targeted several European nations, perceived  by the groups to be assisting Ukraine in its war effort. This increasing volume of DDoS attacks against the European  transport sector was primarily observed in Q2 and Q3 2022. The main targets were European airports, railways and  transport authorities. Several examples are listed below (see Annex for further information).  • In April 2022 pro-Russia hacker group Killnet claimed to be behind attacks on Romanian government  websites, including railway transport operator CFR Calatori68.  • In May 2022 Czechia’s Directorate of Roads and Highways was targeted with DDoS attacks by Killnet,  resulting in disruption to web-based services69.  • In May 2022 Several Italian transport organisations were targeted with DDoS attacks by Legion - Cyber  Spetsnaz RF70.  • In June 2022 Killnet claimed to have disrupted the website of Lithuanian Railways, preventing passengers  from purchasing train tickets online71.  • In June 2022 Latvian passenger train company SJSC was targeted with DDoS attacks, likely by pro-Russian  hacktivists72.  • In July 2022 NoName057 targeted two Lithuanian airports with DDoS attacks73.  66 ENISA Threat Landscape 2022. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  67 https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/belarus-activists-fire-ransomware/;  https://www.wired.com/story/belarus-railways-ransomware-hack-cyber-partisans/;  https://www.railway-technology.com/news/belarusian-railway-cyber-breach/  68 https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-state-websites-cyberattack-2022  69 https://english.radio.cz/cyber-agency-says-attack-czech-states-road-and-motorway-directorate-encoded-data-8751033  70 https://www.wired.it/article/attacco-cyber-russia-italia-legion-ministero-polizia/  71 https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1728365/major-incidents-contained-after-lithuania-gets-hit-with-massive-cyber-attacks  72 https://www.apollo.lv/7535816/ddos-uzbrukumu-del-trauceta-pasazieru-vilciena-bilesu-tirdznieciba-uznemuma-majaslapa  73 https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1728365/major-incidents-contained-after-lithuania-gets-hit-with-massive-cyber-attacks  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022 https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/belarus-activists-fire-ransomware/ https://www.wired.com/story/belarus-railways-ransomware-hack-cyber-partisans/ https://www.railway-technology.com/news/belarusian-railway-cyber-breach/ https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-state-websites-cyberattack-2022 https://english.radio.cz/cyber-agency-says-attack-czech-states-road-and-motorway-directorate-encoded-data-8751033 https://www.wired.it/article/attacco-cyber-russia-italia-legion-ministero-polizia/ https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1728365/major-incidents-contained-after-lithuania-gets-hit-with-massive-cyber-attacks https://www.apollo.lv/7535816/ddos-uzbrukumu-del-trauceta-pasazieru-vilciena-bilesu-tirdznieciba-uznemuma-majaslapa https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1728365/major-incidents-contained-after-lithuania-gets-hit-with-massive-cyber-attacks  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  41  • In August 2022 Killnet claimed responsibility for attacks to more than 200 state and private Estonian  institutions, including Estonia Railways74.  • In August 2022 a pro-Russia hacker group known as the Cyber Army of Russia targeted the Ukrainian  government’s Department of Transport Safety.  Even though pro-Russian hacktivists continue to target transport organisations in Ukraine and neighbouring  countries, the capabilities of most pro-Russian hacktivists remain low and are largely limited to DDoS and  defacement attacks. On the other hand, hacktivists supporting Ukraine have been conducting DDoS and ‘hack and  leak’ operations. Some examples include the following.  • In March 2022 hacktivist collective Anonymous (presumably) carried out an attack on the Russian Federal  Air Transport Agency, deleting approximately 65 terabytes of data75.  • In April 2022 Anonymous-linked group GhostSec claimed to have accessed an IT system of  Metrospetstekhnika76.  • In August 2022 Anonymous claimed to have hacked Yandex Taxi, causing a massive traffic jam in  Moscow77.  • In September 2022 transport in Novosibirsk was affected as hacker security group Team Onefist disrupted  traffic78.  The majority of attacks to the transport sector target IT systems and can result in operational disruptions.  However, we have not received reliable information on a cyber-attack affecting the safety of transport.  Ransomware groups will likely target and disrupt OT operations in the foreseeable future66. The factors  contributing to this assessment are:  • the ongoing digital transformation in the transport sector and the increased connectivity between IT and OT  networks;  • the increased urgency to pay ransom to avoid any critical business and social impact;  • the ongoing rebranding of ransomware groups, which increases the chances of malware blending and the  development of capabilities to target and disrupt OT networks;  • Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine, as ransomware groups are taking sides and are likely to  conduct retaliatory attacks against critical western infrastructure;  • the increase in the number of newly identified vulnerabilities in OT environments.  The analysis of the ransomware threat landscape from May 2021 to June 2022 resulted in some conclusions that can  be regarded as lessons for the community.  While we have not observed notable attacks on global positioning systems, the potential effect of this type of  threat to the transport sector remains a concern. Jamming and spoofing of geolocation data could affect their  availability and integrity, affecting transport sector operations. This type of attack requires further analysis in the  future.  When it comes to mitigating threats which target the transport sector, readers may consult the recommendations and  security measures included in Annex D of the ENISA Threat Landscape 202279. For each threat type, specific  recommendations are provided and mapped to security measures that are part of international standards used by  entities under the NIS Directive, including transport organizations80.  74 https://www.ohtuleht.ee/1068880/kuberrunnakus-sai-pihta-ka-eesti-raudtee  75 https://www.aviacionline.com/2022/03/cyber-attack-on-russias-aviation-authority-this-is-what-we-know/  76 https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/130409/hacktivism/anonymous-hacked-other-russian-organizations.html  77 https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/135280/hacktivism/anonyomus-hacked-yandex-taxi.html  78 https://www.ibtimes.com/russians-novosibirsk-forced-pound-pavements-team-onefist-paralyzes-traffic-exclusive-3611628  79 ENISA Threat Landscape 2022 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  80 Minimum Security Measures for Operators of Essentials Services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum-security-measures-for- operators-of-essentials-services  https://www.ohtuleht.ee/1068880/kuberrunnakus-sai-pihta-ka-eesti-raudtee https://www.aviacionline.com/2022/03/cyber-attack-on-russias-aviation-authority-this-is-what-we-know/ https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/130409/hacktivism/anonymous-hacked-other-russian-organizations.html https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/135280/hacktivism/anonyomus-hacked-yandex-taxi.html https://www.ibtimes.com/russians-novosibirsk-forced-pound-pavements-team-onefist-paralyzes-traffic-exclusive-3611628 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum-security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum-security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  42  In general, cyberattacks are rarely reported, especially those with non-significant impact or near misses. Most  organisations prefer to deal with the problem internally and avoid bad publicity. Some countries have laws regulating  the mandatory reporting of incidents, but in most cases a security attack is first disclosed by the attacker. In the EU,  the arrival of the revised NIS2 directive81 and the enhanced notification provisions for security incidents is expected to  support a better understanding of relevant incidents.  The lack of reliable data from targeted organisations makes it very hard to fully understand the problem or even know  how many cyberattacks on the transport sector actually occur. Even using the data from the web pages of threat  actors (an undeniably unreliable source), it is very hard to keep track of the actual number of attacks. The most  important information that is missing is the technical explanation as to how the attackers obtained access to the  targets. This is usually private data that describes the security posture of the target, so it is never shared with the  public. As a consequence, our learning as a community of the problems to be solved remains fragmented and  isolated.  Moreover, the effects of cross sector dependencies could be of particular interest to the transport sector. We would  require a more detailed analysis of how cyberattacks targeting the energy and telecommunications sectors could  affect transport or how an attack on one means of transport could cause a disruption to another means of transport.  81 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-welcomes-political-agreement-new-rules-cybersecurity-network-and-information-systems  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-welcomes-political-agreement-new-rules-cybersecurity-network-and-information-systems  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  43  ANNEX: MAJOR INCIDENTS  Table 1: Aviation  Date Proximity Country Incident  January  2021 Near France Dassault Falcon Jet were hit by the Ragnar Locker ransomware gang82.

The report aims to bring new insights into the reality of the transport  sector by mapping and studying cyber incidents from January 2021 to October 2022. It identifies prime threats, actors  and trends based on the analysis of cyberattacks targeting aviation, maritime, railway and road transport over a  period of almost 2 years.  During this period, the prime threats identified include:  • ransomware attacks (38%),  • data related threats (30%),  • malware (17%),  • denial-of-service (DoS), distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and ransom denial-of-service (RDoS) attacks  (16%),  • phishing / spear phishing (10%),  • supply-chain attacks (10%).  During the reporting period, the threat actors with the biggest impact on the sector were state-sponsored actors,  cybercriminals and hacktivists. We observed the following trends:  • Ransomware attacks became the prominent threat against the sector in 2022. Ransomware has been  steadily increasing1 and the transport sector has been affected similarly to the other sectors.  • Cybercriminals are responsible for the majority of attacks on the transport sector (54%), and they target all  subsectors.  • Threat actors will increasingly conduct ransomware attacks with not only monetary motivations1.  • The increased hacktivist activity targeting the transport sector is likely to continue.  • The increasing rate of DDoS attacks targeting the transport sector is likely to continue.  • The main targets of DDoS attacks by hacktivists are European airports, railways and transport authorities.  • During this reporting period, we did not receive reliable information on a cyberattack affecting the safety of  transport.  • The majority of attacks on the transport sector target information technology (IT) systems. Operational  disruptions can occur as a consequence of these attacks, but the operational technology (OT) systems are  rarely being targeted.  • Ransomware groups will likely target and disrupt OT operations in the foreseeable future1.  The aviation sector is facing multiple threats, with data-related threats being the most prominent, coupled by  ransomware and malware. Customer data of airlines and proprietary information of original equipment manufacturers  (OEM) are the prime targeted assets of the sector. In 2022, there has been a rise in the number of ransomware  attacks affecting airports. Fraudulent websites impersonating airlines have become a significant threat in 2022.  The maritime sector experiences ransomware, malware, and phishing attacks targeted towards port authorities, port  operators, and manufacturers. State-sponsored attackers often carry out politically motivated attacks leading to  operational disruptions at ports and vessels.  The railway sector also experiences ransomware and data-related threats primarily targeting IT systems like  passenger services, ticketing systems, and mobile applications, causing service disruptions. Hacktivist groups have  1 ENISA Threat Landscape 2022 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  5  been conducting DDoS attacks against railway companies with an increasing rate, primarily due to Russia's invasion  of Ukraine.  The road transport sector faces predominantly ransomware attacks, followed by data-related threats and malware.  Automotive industry, especially OEM and tier-X suppliers, has been targeted by ransomware leading to production  disruptions. Data-related threats primarily target IT systems to acquire customer and employee data as well as  proprietary information.  There is a limited number of cyber incidents that cannot be placed in one specific subsector. These include general  campaigns targeting the whole transportation sector in particular countries. These campaigns are often attributed to  hacktivists and state-sponsored actors and are linked to geopolitical tensions.  The report also highlights issues with the reporting of cyber incidents and the fact that we still have limited knowledge  and information regarding such incidents. The analysis in this report indicates that publicly disclosed incidents are just  the tip of the iceberg.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  6  1. INTRODUCTION  This report brings insights into the cyber threat landscape of the transport sector, with a focus on the EU. The four  transport sectors which are considered in scope are aviation, maritime2, rail, and road transport, as these fall under  the scope of the network and information security (NIS) directive3. The report considers a wider scope of the  transport ecosystem, and includes transport manufacturers and suppliers4, and national transport authorities, to  ensure that the threat landscape of the sector is more detailed.  The ENISA Cybersecurity Threat Landscape Methodology5 was applied. ENISA has analysed cyber incidents  targeting the transport sector from January 2021 to October 2022. This time period is referred to as the \"reporting  period\" throughout the report.  It should be noted that the data collection and analysis primarily focus on incidents observed in EU member states  and then in other states around the world. This is by no means the complete list of incidents that occurred during the  reporting period. ENISA gathered a list of major incidents based on open-source intelligence (OSINT)6 and ENISA’s  own cyber threat intelligence capabilities. For the aviation sector specifically, these were complemented by incidents  reported to EASA and the European Centre for Cybersecurity in Aviation7, and by incidents provided by Eurocontrol’s  EATM-CERT for the aviation sector8. The data collected were further analysed by ENISA’s threat landscape team.  These incidents serve as the foundation for identifying the list of prime threats and the source material for several  trends and statistics in the report. The incidents were analysed in detail to identify their core elements, providing  answers to some important questions, such as how the attacks happen, which systems are being targeted and which  transport subsectors are most affected. An in-depth desk research of available literature from open sources, such as  news media articles, expert opinions, intelligence reports, incident analyses and security research reports, were  conducted by ENISA and external experts. Within the report, we differentiate between what has been reported by our  sources and what is our assessment. When conducting an assessment, we convey probability by using words that  express an estimate of probability 9.  The report is structured as follows.  • Chapter 1, Introduction, provides an overview of the scope and the method used to produce this report.  • Chapter 2, Cyber threats to the transport sector, analyses the observed activity observed during the  reporting period. It provides insights on the prime threats, threat actors and their motivation, along with the  assessed impact of these attacks.  • Chapter 3, Sector Analysis, analyses in more detail the prime threats and the targets on each of the four  subsectors covered.  • Chapter 4, Conclusions, discusses the trends derived by the analysis and some considerations on the  availability of data for incidents affecting the sector.  • Annex, Major incidents, gathers a summary of selected notable incidents collected during the reporting  period.  2 While we refer to the maritime sector throughout the report, we have also considered inland waterway transport in the analysis.  3 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-directive  4 In the road sector, original equipment manufacturers (OEM), tier-X suppliers and the whole automotive sector were considered in the analysis.  5 ENISA Cybersecurity Threat Landscape Methodology, July 2022. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-methodology  6 This is a result of work by ENISA in the area of situational awareness in accordance with the EU Cybersecurity Act Article 7, Paragraph 6 https://eur- lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN  7 European Centre for Cybersecurity in Aviation (ECCSA) https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/eccsa  8 European Air Traffic Management Computer Emergency Response Team (EATM-CERT) https://www.eurocontrol.int/service/european-air-traffic- management-computer-emergency-response-team  9 Malware Information Sharing Platform estimative language https://www.misp-project.org/taxonomies.html#_estimative_language  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-methodology https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/eccsa https://www.eurocontrol.int/service/european-air-traffic-management-computer-emergency-response-team https://www.eurocontrol.int/service/european-air-traffic-management-computer-emergency-response-team https://www.misp-project.org/taxonomies.html#_estimative_language  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  7  2. CYBER THREATS TO THE  TRANSPORT SECTOR  2.1  OBSERVED ACTIVITY  From January 2021 until October 2022, we analysed a total of 98 publicly reported incidents10.  In 2022, we observed a 25% increase in the monthly average number of reported incidents affecting the transport  sector compared to 2021 (see quarterly results in Figure 1). The reporting period ends in October 2022 and the  analysis of the incidents was concluded in December 2022. This is why the number of incidents appears lower in Q4  2022 compared with the previous quarters.  We are expecting a further increase of cyber incidents in 2022, especially if we consider that incident handling and  analysis is ongoing and that the reporting of incidents often occurs at a later date. However, an increase in the  number of reported cyber-attacks does not necessarily mean that the number of attacks has actually increased. This  change could be due to the sector maturing in terms of incident detection and reporting. For example, this could be  due to the effect of the legal obligation to report incidents under the NIS directive and/or national regulations.  Alternatively, the attention of the media or the public could be focused on a particular sector for a particular time  period, resulting in more incidents appearing in OSINT sources.  Figure 1: Number of incidents per quarter (January 2021 to October 2022)  10 Incidents targeting the transport sector accounted for 4.8% and 4.3% of the total incidents identified in ENISA threat landscapes 2021 and 2022,  respectively. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021; https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape- 2022  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  8  An important aspect involves the proximity of transport related cyber threats with respect to the European Union. We  classify incidents according to the proposed classification for the EU common security and defence policy11, as  follows.  Near – Affected networks, systems, controlled and assured within EU borders. Affected population within the borders  of the EU.  Mid – Networks and systems considered vital for operational objectives within the scope of the EU digital single  market and the NIS directive sectors, but their control and assurance rely on non-EU institutional authorities or  Member State public or private authorities. Affected population in geographical areas close to EU borders.  Far – Networks and systems that, if influenced, will have a critical impact on operational objectives within the scope  of the EU digital single market and the NIS directive sectors. Control and assurance of those networks and systems  lies beyond EU institutional authorities and Member States’ public or private authorities. Affected population in  geographical areas Far from the EU.  Global – All the aforementioned areas.  The following map gives an overview of the incidents observed in the world for the reporting period, while Figure 3  and Figure 4 show the proximity of incidents to the EU for 2021 and 2022 respectively.  Figure 2: Map of observed incidents (January 2021 to October 2022)  Note: the size of the circle refers to the sum of observed incidents in the country during the reporting period.  11 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/603175/EPRS_STU(2017)603175_EN.pdf  https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/603175/EPRS_STU(2017)603175_EN.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  9  As mentioned above, the data collection process prioritises incidents that occur in the EU. Even with this limitation,  we can safely assess that in 2022 there was a significant increase of incidents that were made public and affected  the EU (category ‘Near’) and areas close to the EU (category ‘Mid’), compared to 2021. This comes as no surprise  considering the current geopolitical situation in which the EU is involved and the significance which was placed on the  transport sector during Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.  Figure 3: Proximity of observed incidents  (January 2021 to December 2021)  Figure 4: Proximity of observed incidents  (January 2022 to October 2022)  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  10  2.2  PRIME THREATS  During the reporting period, we observed the following types of threats (Figure 5) to the transport sector. An incident  can be categorised in more than one threat category, which means that the total percentage of the threats shown in  Figure 5 exceeds 100%. For example, the attack vector for initial access may include a phishing campaign, which is  then followed by a compromise with ransomware. Likewise, incidents which included an attack to a supplier were  categorised both as supply-chain attacks and as the type of attack used for the compromise.  Figure 5: Prime threats to the transport sector (January 2021 to October 2022)  Ransomware  Ransomware is defined as a type of attack where threat actors take control of a target’s assets and demand a  ransom in exchange for the return of the asset’s availability12. Ransomware incidents are presented separately from  malware, as they are significant portion of the identified incidents (38%) during the reporting period, with several high  profile and highly publicised incidents.  Threats against data  Sources of data are being targeted with the aim of unauthorised access and disclosure and manipulating data to  interfere with the behaviour of systems. These threats are also the basis of many other threats, also discussed in this  report. For instance, ransomware, or DDoS attacks aim to deny access to data and possibly collect a payment to  restore this access. Technically speaking, threats against data can mainly be classified as data breaches and data  leaks. A data breach is an intentional attack brought by a cybercriminal with the goal of gaining unauthorised access  and the release of sensitive, confidential or protected data. A data leak is an event that can cause the unintentional  release of sensitive, confidential or protected data due to, for example, misconfigurations, vulnerabilities or human  errors. In this reporting period, around 30% of the observed incidents were a form of threat against the data of  transport organisations.  Malware  Malware is an overarching term used to describe any software or firmware intended to perform an unauthorised  process that will have an adverse impact on the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a system. Traditionally,  12 ENISA Threat Landscape for Ransomware Attacks https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-ransomware-attacks  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-ransomware-attacks  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  11  examples of malicious code types include viruses, worms, trojan horses, spyware, adware or other code-based  entities that infect a host. During this reporting period, 17% of incidents targeting the transport sector involved  malware.  Denial of service  Availability is the target of a plethora of threats and attacks, among which DDoS stands out. DDoS attacks target  system and data availability and, though not a new threat, have a significant role in the cybersecurity threat  landscape of the transport sector. Attacks occur when users of a system or service are not able to access relevant  data, services or other resources. This can be accomplished by exhausting the service and its resources or  overloading the components of the network infrastructure. During the reporting period, geopolitical developments and  hacktivist activity increased the number of DDoS attacks against transport organisations, reaching 16% of total  incidents.  Vulnerability exploitation  Vulnerability exploitation refers to exploitation of known or zero-day vulnerabilities13.  Social engineering  Social engineering encompasses a broad range of activities that attempt to exploit a human error or human behaviour  with the objective of gaining access to information or services. It uses various forms of manipulation to trick victims  into making mistakes or handing over sensitive or secret information. In cybersecurity, social engineering lures users  into opening documents, files or emails, visiting websites or granting unauthorised persons access to systems or  services. This threat canvas consists mainly of the following vectors: phishing, spear-phishing, whaling, smishing,  vishing, business email compromise, fraud, impersonation and counterfeiting. In this reporting period, we primarily  observed phishing and spear phishing attacks targeting transport users (10%) and fraud, impersonation and  counterfeit incidents (6%).  Attacks to suppliers and supply-chain attacks  A supply-chain attack targets the relationship between organisations and their suppliers. For this report we use the  definition as stated in the ENISA Threat Landscape for Supply Chain, where an attack is considered to have a  supply-chain component when it consists of a combination of at least two attacks. For an attack to be classified as a  supply-chain attack, both the supplier and the customer have to be targets. It seems that threat actors are continuing  to feed on this source to conduct their operations and gain a foothold within organisations, in an attempt to benefit  from the widespread impact and potential victim base of such attacks. In this reporting period, we observed both  supply-chain attacks, as defined above, and attacks to suppliers that caused disruptions or losses to entities in the  transport sector (10% of total incidents). This impact was not necessarily the effect of a secondary attack.  Breach/intrusion  Breach/intrusion refers to incidents where an attack to a system has been confirmed or made public and attackers  have gained access to systems, but the details of how the breach or the intrusion took place are not clear. These  types of incidents account for 9% of the total number of incidents.  Other threats include single occasions of credential harvesting and spoofing of geolocation in the maritime  sector.  Finally, there is a small percentage of incidents where even though a cyberattack took place, there is insufficient  information to allow for the incident to be categorised. This accounts for a total of 7% of incidents (unknowns).  13 For more information regarding the common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) that were discovered and used from July 2021 to June 2022, see  ENISA Threat Landscape 2022 (annex C). https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  12  Figure 6: Prime threats to the transport sector: 2021 v 2022  The data on incidents collected until October 2022 indicate an increase in reporting of ransomware attacks during  2022. The number of ransomware attacks reported to the transport sector almost doubled, rising to 25% in 2022 from  13% during 2021. Contrary to ransomware, we observed a decline in malware incidents in 2022 compared to 2021  (from 11% to 6%).  Data related threats (breaches, leaks) declined compared to ransomware, but remain significant. The attacks  observed in 2021 and 2022 targeted credentials, the personal data of employees and passengers, corporate data  and intellectual property.  We also observed an increase in DDoS attacks in 2022, which is mostly linked to recent activity by hacktivists. The  rates of these attacks are focused on specific regions and are affected by current geopolitical tensions. The current  geopolitical situation and its effect on the transport sector can be seen in Figure 7. The map depicts selected  incidents in all transport sectors which were attributed to hacktivism. The motivation was primarily operational  disruption and ideological.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  13  Figure 7: Global map of incidents (hacktivism)  Note: the size of the circle refers to the sum of observed incidents in the country during the reporting period.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  14  2.3  THREAT ACTORS & MOTIVATION  Similarly to the ENISA Threat Landscape 202114 and ENISA Threat Landscape 202215, we considered four  categories of cybersecurity threat actors: state-sponsored actors, cybercriminals, hackers-for-hire, and hacktivists.  • Cybercriminals’ primary motive is financial gain, often stealing data or demanding ransom.  • Hackers-for-hire sell their services to people who do not have the skills or capabilities to do so.  • State-sponsored actors target organisations to compromise, steal, change, or destroy information. These  groups are usually affiliated with a nation state16.  • Hacktivists are politically, socially, or ideologically motivated and target victims for publicity or to effect  change.  For the cases in which one of these types of actors was not identified, we either categorised the incident as an  individual actor or as unknown. During the reporting, we did not have information on hacker-for-hire actors targeting  the transport sector, so they are not included in Figure 8.  Figure 8: Actors  Figure 8 shows the overall activity of actors targeting the sector, while Figure 9 analyses this activity on a monthly  basis.  14 ENISA Threat Landscape 2021 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021  15 ENISA Threat Landscape 2022 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  16 The term has been used interchangeably with Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), however APT refers to a type of activity conducted by a range of  actors.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  15  Figure 9: Actor activity (January 2021 to October 2022)  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  16  For the analysis of the incidents, we have considered the following motivations.  • Espionage, when the aim of the attack is information gathering (either intellectual property or information of  national importance).  • Financial gain, when there is a clear monetary claim behind the attack, such as extortion, selling of stolen  data, etc.  • Ideological, when the attack is linked to hacktivist activity and there are clear declarations on the aim of the  attack by the actor.  • Operational disruption, when the attack is aiming at disrupting services, as opposed to cases where a  disruption of operations is a side effect of an attack.  Figure 10: Motivation  More than half of the incidents observed in the reporting period were linked to cybercriminals (55%). This is also  linked with the motivation behind these attacks which is predominately financial gain (38%). The transport sector is  considered a lucrative business for cybercriminals, with customer data considered a commodity and with highly  valuable proprietary information when transport supply chain is being targeted. One fourth of the attacks are linked to  hacktivist groups (23%), with the motivation of their attacks usually being linked to the geopolitical environment and  aiming at operational disruption (20%) or ideological motivation (6%).  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  17  2.4  IMPACT  When considering the impact of an incident to the sector, we analysed who was the target of the attack (Figure 11)  and which were the affected assets (Figure 12).  As the types of targeted entities differ between subsectors, Figure 11 offers a breakdown of the targets by subsector.  Please note that one incident may be targeting multiple transport entities.  All subsectors had authorities and bodies that were being targeted, in fact 38% of the incidents targeted transport  authorities. In the railway sector, incidents almost exclusively targeted railway undertakings and infrastructure  managers. Similarly, port operators were the most affected entities in the maritime sector. These two sectors had only  a few incidents targeting supply chain or service providers. This was not the case in the road sector, where OEM, tier- X suppliers and service providers were targeted, along with public transport operators. In the aviation sector, airlines  and airport operators are the main targets, followed by service providers, surface transport operators and the supply  chain.  Figure 11: Targets (number of incidents per entity type)  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  18  Figure 12: Affected assets  Detailed and reliable information about the impact of incidents is not readily available in OSINT reports. It can often  be deduced from the description of the incident, but the impact assessment can often include a lower level of  confidence. In particular, reputational, legal and social impacts are particularly difficult to assess. Similarly, financial  impact can be calculated in various ways by the affected party and it can change over time as the effect of an incident  develops and its long-term consequences are assessed. For this reason, we were able to include only reported digital  or physical impact in the analysis.  Figure 13: Digital impact  Digital impact (Figure 13) refers to any effect of the attack on the information and communications technology (ICT)  systems of the affected entity, while physical impact (Figure 14) refers to cases where the incident causes operational  disruption or even destruction of the infrastructure. As we observe, we have more rich information when it comes to  the digital impact of cyberattacks on the transport sector. For physical impact, we could not find information of the  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  19  actual physical impact for the majority of incidents, as either information was not disclosed or physical impact did not  take place.  Figure 14: Physical impact  An alternative dataset which gives a better indication of the impact of attacks are the incidents reported to ENISA by  national authorities under the provisions of the NIS directive17. These refer to incidents that cause significant impact.  At the time of publication data for 2022 were not yet available, data were available only for 2021. In 2021, 34  incidents had a significant impact on transport entities. They account for 6% of the total number of incidents reported  to ENISA in 2021. In fact, 65% of these incidents were the result of malicious actions, 32% were due to system  failures and 3% were due to human error. These data highlight a significant gap in finding information on non- malicious incidents that can cause disruptions to the transport sector, as these are rarely available in OSINT reports.  17 In the EU, critical service providers have to report cybersecurity incidents that have a significant impact to the national authorities in their country. At  the end of each year, the summary reports about these incidents are collected, anonymised, aggregated and analysed by ENISA. The visualisation tool  shows the overall statistics for the EU. https://ciras.enisa.europa.eu/  https://ciras.enisa.europa.eu/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  20  3. SECTOR ANALYSIS  In this section we further analyse the findings for each transport sector. We distinguish between incidents targeting  aviation, maritime, railway and road transport, while we also include a category called ‘all transport’ which refers to  attacks that target either all four sectors or, more commonly, ministries of transport. For the reporting period, we  studied 27 incidents targeting aviation (28%), 18 incidents targeting maritime (18%), 21 incidents targeting railway  (21%) and 24 incidents targeting road transport (24%). We also included 8 incidents (8%) that targeted the transport  sector as a whole, or incidents targeting transport ministries.  Figure 15: Observed incidents in each sector  Figure 16: Annual observed incidents in each sector (January 2021 to December 2021,  January 2022 to October 2022)  Figure 17 shows the monthly incidents in each sector for the reporting period.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  21  Figure 17: Monthly observed incidents in each sector  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  22  Figure 18 shows the geographical spread of the observed incidents. We can see here that the focus of the report is  on the incidents that affect EU transport and the neighbouring countries. However, we have included significant  incidents from the world, targeting transport entities primarily in North America and Asia. The map also gives an  indication of the geographical spread of affected subsectors.  Figure 18: Global map of observed incidents  Note: the size of the circle refers to the sum of observed incidents in the country during the reporting period.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  23  In Figure 19 and Figure 20 we depict the motivation and the actors of the observed incidents for each sector.  Figure 19: Motivation in each sector  Figure 20: Actor in each sector  Cybercriminals are the main actors responsible for attacks on the transport sector (54% of the total number of  incidents) and they target all subsectors. They use the ‘follow the money’ philosophy in their modus operandi. Almost  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  24  two fifths of the total number of incidents are incidents attributed to cybercriminals targeting two sectors: aviation and  road transport. During the reporting period, 18% of cybercriminals targeted the aviation sector (primarily airports and  airlines and their customers) and 19% targeted the road sector (primarily the automotive industry). Likewise, the  motivation behind attacks on these two sectors was primarily financial gain (11% and 13% of the total number of  incidents, respectively), as the aviation and automotive industries are considered to be the more lucrative ones for  cybercriminals. The attacks are considered opportunistic in nature, as we have not observed known groups targeting  the transport sector exclusively.  We observe that hacktivists have claimed responsibility for attacks on the railway (8%) and aviation (6%) sectors, and  this has to do mainly with attacks linked to the Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine. In particular, these types  of attacks make up almost one tenth of the total number of incidents that aimed at operational disruption in the  railway sector.  State-sponsored actors were more often attributed to targeting the maritime sector or targeting government  authorities of transport (‘All transport’ category).  Figure 21 presents the sectorial analysis of all observed threats. We observe that there are differences in how these  threats affect specific sectors. These differences are discussed in greater detail in the chapters that follow.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  25  Figure 21: Prime threats in each sector (number of observed incidents)  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  26  3.1  AVIATION SECTOR  According to the data collected through OSINT by ENISA and the EU aviation safety agency (see Figure 22), prime  threats for the aviation sector are data-related threats (45%), ransomware (36%) and malware (23%). In the majority  of ransomware cases in the aviation sector, the attack is followed by data-related threats, such as data exfiltration  and leakage, so there is significant overlap in these two categories. Customer data are one of the prime targeted  assets of the sector, followed by the proprietary information of original equipment manufacturers (OEM).  Figure 22: Aviation - prime threats  In 2022, we observed an increase in the number of ransomware attacks affecting airports (see Figure 23). Out of all  operators (excluding original equipment manufacturers), airport operators are the most affected by ransomware  attacks. Airports, airlines and ultimately the passengers suffer due to other incidents that have an impact on their  data. The most notable events include the following.  • In March 2021 the passenger service system provider SITA was hacked; hundreds of thousands of Star  Alliance passengers’ details were stolen.  • In April 2021 a malware attack on Radixx Res disrupts 20 airlines’ ticket reservation systems18. The service  disruption made it impossible for many of the airline passengers to make, change, delete or confirm  bookings through the airlines’ websites, although flight operations were not affected.  • In May 2021 Air India suffered a data breach. 4.5 million customers were impacted only 2 months after its  passenger service system provider SITA was hacked.  • In August 2021 Bangkok Air confirmed the leak of passenger data after a ransomware attack19. According to  the airline, some of the personal data that may have been included in the stolen files included data fields  such as passenger name, family name, nationality, gender, phone number, email address, home address,  contact information, passport information, historical travel information, partial credit card information and  special meal information.  18 https://www.databreaches.net/malware-attack-on-radixx-res-disrupts-20-airlines-ticket-reservation-systems/  19 https://therecord.media/bangkok-air-confirms-passenger-pii-leak-after-ransomware-attack/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  27  Figure 23: Aviation - prime threats (annually)  • In January 2022 Dassault Falcon Jet was hit by the Ragnar Locker ransomware gang20. The attack may  have led to the exposure of personal information belonging to current and former employees, and their  spouses and dependents.  • In February 2022 Swissport International was hit by a ransomware attack that had a severe impact on its  operations, causing flights to suffer delays. Following the attack, the perpetrators (BlackCat) leaked data  which included business documents, tax declarations, images of passports and ID cards of individuals.  Leaked data also included personal information of job candidates21.  • In May 2022, after a ransomware attack on SpiceJet, hundreds of passengers were stranded at airports  across India, particularly those airports where restrictions on night operations were in effect22.  • In May 2022 a Turkish airline exposed flight and crew information in a 6.5 terabyte leak23.  • In August 2022 Accelya, a technology firm providing services to Delta, British Airways, JetBlue, United,  Virgin Atlantic, American Airlines and many others, confirmed that company data was posted on a  ransomware leak site24.  • In August 2022 TAP Air Portugal was the target of a Ragnar Locker ransomware attack. The attackers  leaked customers’ names, addresses and telephone numbers25.  20 https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dassault-falcon-jet-reports-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/  21 https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/128039/cyber-crime/blackcat-swissport-ransomware-attack.html  22 https://therecord.media/spiceject-ransomware-attack-flights-grounded/  23 https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/turkish-airline-exposes-flight/  24 https://therecord.media/major-airline-technology-provider-accelya-attacked-by-ransomware-group/  25 https://www.portugalresident.com/hackers-share-personal-data-of-1-5-million-tap-passengers/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  28  • In October 2022 ransomware group LockBit 3.0 claimed to have compromised the aeronautical French  defence and technology firm Thales Group26.  • In October 2022 it was claimed on the Black Basta data leak website that the United States (US) aerospace  and defence company Genesys Aerosystems, which mainly produces advanced avionics solutions and  components, was a ransomware victim27.  The data collected and analysed by Eurocontrol’s EATM-CERT28 highlight a threat that often goes underreported in  open sources. The main threat which is being reported to Eurocontrol is fraudulent websites impersonating airlines.  From January 2022 to June 2022, fraudulent websites accounted for 46% of incidents reported to Eurocontrol. This  discrepancy is due to the fact that this information is not often made publicly available. It is linked to the sector’s  victimology, which is mainly airlines and their customers being targeted. The rest of the threats reported to  Eurocontrol for the first semester of 2022 were web application attacks (22%), DDoS attacks (13%), phishing  attempts (12%), ransomware (6%) and malware (1%).  DDoS attacks were primarily observed by ENISA in 2022 and were linked with hacktivist activity against airports and  aviation authorities, such as the following.  • In April 2022 the website of the Israel Airports Authority was temporarily taken offline due to a denial-of- service attack29.  • In May 2022 a pro-Russia hacker group launched an attack on the websites of Italian ministries, including  attacks targeting Italian airports30.  • In June 2022 pro-Russia hacker group NoName057 targeted Lithuanian airports with DDoS attacks31.  • In October 2022 Russian threat actors (e.g. Anonymous Russia) led DDoS attacks on airports in Bratislava  32, Budapest and Bulgaria33, targeting their websites.  • In October 2022 the websites of major US airports34 were disrupted due to a large-scale campaign of DDoS  attacks, in which pro-Russian hacker group Killnet flooded servers with web traffic to take websites offline.  Eurocontrol EATM-CERT collected and shared with ENISA 97 individual cases where pro-Russian hacker group  Killnet targeted airports in the EU and neighbouring countries during 2022 (proximity ‘Near’, Mid’). The map of this  activity is depicted in Figure 24.  Data collected from ENISA and Eurocontrol indicate that airspace users/airlines are the main victims of attacks (see  Figure 25). This is mainly due to the financial motivation behind these attacks, which is predominant in the sector.  Airlines are being targeted directly by attacks to their systems and indirectly by attacks targeting their customers (e.g.  by fraudulent websites). Eurocontrol reports airspace users (80%), airports (12%), OEMs / supply chain (6%), air  navigation service providers (1%) and civil aviation authorities (1%) as the main targets for January 2022 to June  2022.  26 https://cyware.com/news/lockbit-30-gang-allegedly-stole-thales-groups-data-aa676192/  27 https://www.redpacketsecurity.com/black-basta-ransomware-victim-genesys-aerosystems/  28 The incidents which served as a basis for the analyses (January 2021 to June 2022) were: (a) publicly reported incidents/events which EATM-CERT  collected, (b) findings of EATM-CERT (c) non-publicly reported cyber incidents or events, shared with EATM-CERT by aviation stakeholders (air  navigation service providers, airport operators, original equipment manufacturers, civil aviation authorities, airspace users) and the Aviation Information  Sharing and Analysis Centre.  29 https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/airport-websites-hit-by-denial-of-service-attack/  30 https://www.wired.it/article/attacco-cyber-russia-italia-legion-ministero-polizia/  31 https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1728365/major-incidents-contained-after-lithuania-gets-hit-with-massive-cyber-attacks  32 https://www.cyberthreat.report/ddos-attack-against-slovakia-by-russian-hackers/  33 https://sofiaglobe.com/2022/10/16/official-cyber-attack-on-bulgarian-government-websites-traced-to-russia/  34 https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-airports-sites-taken-down-in-ddos-attacks-by-pro-russian-hackers/  https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/airport-websites-hit-by-denial-of-service-attack/ https://www.wired.it/article/attacco-cyber-russia-italia-legion-ministero-polizia/ https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1728365/major-incidents-contained-after-lithuania-gets-hit-with-massive-cyber-attacks https://www.cyberthreat.report/ddos-attack-against-slovakia-by-russian-hackers/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  29  Figure 24: Airports targeted by Killnet in Europe and neighbouring countries during 2022  Note: the size of the circle refers to the sum of observed incidents in the country during the reporting period.

Figure 25: Aviation - targets  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  30  3.2  MARITIME SECTOR  The proliferation of cybersecurity incidents35 in ports over the last few years, such as the cyberattack on Antwerp  port36, the NotPetya ransomware incident and its impact on Maersk37 and the wave of ransomware attacks on the  Port of Barcelona 38 and San Diego39, has led to a change in the sector's cyber risk profile. Figures 26 and 27 show  the threats targeting the maritime sector overall and on an annual basis.  Figure 26: Maritime - prime threats  Attacks in the maritime domain are often politically motivated and perpetrated by state-sponsored attackers. During  2021 and 2022, a few notable cases of activities linked to state actors were reported. These attacks indicate the  interest of state sponsored actors to cause operational disruption by targeting ports and vessels.  In early 2021, it was reported that two Indian sea ports were targeted by Chinese hackers amid geopolitical  tensions40. In August 2021 the Port of Houston Authority was targeted by a cybersecurity attack which is believed to  have originated from a nation-state actor. In October 2021 Microsoft reported that ‘Iran-linked’ hackers targeted US,  EU and Israeli defence and maritime sectors with password spray attacks41. May 2022 Israel was linked to a  disruptive cyberattack on an Iranian port facility42. Computers that regulate the flow of vessels, trucks and goods all  crashed at once, creating massive congestions on waterways and roads leading to the facility. In May 2022 the Port  of London Authority was hit by a DDoS attack, which temporarily took the Port of London’s website offline. The attack  is believed to have been carried out by the Iran-affiliated Altahrea group and politically rather than financially  35 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/port-cybersecurity-good-practices-for-cybersecurity-in-the-maritime-sector/@@download/fullReport  36 https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24539417  37 https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/  38 https://www.securitynewspaper.com/2018/09/26/hacking-attack-in-port-of-barcelona/  39 https://www.darktrace.com/en/blog/troubled-waters-cyber-attacks-on-san-diego-and-barcelonas-ports/  40 https://www.recordedfuture.com/redecho-targeting-indian-power-sector  41 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/10/11/iran-linked-dev-0343-targeting-defense-gis-and-maritime-sectors/  42 https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/officials-israel-linked-to-a-disruptive-cyberattack-on-iranian-port-facility/2020/05/18/9d1da866- 9942-11ea-89fd-28fb313d1886_story.html  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/port-cybersecurity-good-practices-for-cybersecurity-in-the-maritime-sector/@@download/fullReport https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24539417 https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/ https://www.securitynewspaper.com/2018/09/26/hacking-attack-in-port-of-barcelona/ https://www.darktrace.com/en/blog/troubled-waters-cyber-attacks-on-san-diego-and-barcelonas-ports/ https://www.recordedfuture.com/redecho-targeting-indian-power-sector https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/10/11/iran-linked-dev-0343-targeting-defense-gis-and-maritime-sectors/ https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/officials-israel-linked-to-a-disruptive-cyberattack-on-iranian-port-facility/2020/05/18/9d1da866-9942-11ea-89fd-28fb313d1886_story.html https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/officials-israel-linked-to-a-disruptive-cyberattack-on-iranian-port-facility/2020/05/18/9d1da866-9942-11ea-89fd-28fb313d1886_story.html  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  31  motivated43. This group is known for having made multiple DDoS attacks on Israeli targets, including the Israel Ports  Authority, in the past.  Finally, an interesting threat that may affect vessels is the spoofing of the automatic identification system44 by a  hostile state, although we have not seen many occurrences of this threat in the past.  Figure 27: Maritime - prime threats (annually)  When it comes to activity by cybercriminals or individual actors, we primarily observe ransomware, malware and  phishing / spear-phishing attacks targeting the port authorities, port operators or manufacturers (supply chain) (see  Figure 28).  Examples include the following.  • In February 2021 French boat building giant Beneteau announced that it had suffered a malware intrusion  on some of its servers and that it had decided to disconnect all ‘information systems’ to prevent the malware  from spreading. Several production units, notably in France, had to slow down or stop their production  activities for a few days45.  43 https://safety4sea.com/cyber-attack-targets-port-of-london-authority/  44 https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/24/russia_ais_spoofing/  45 https://www.securityweek.com/boat-building-giant-beneteau-says-cyberattack-disrupted-production  https://safety4sea.com/cyber-attack-targets-port-of-london-authority/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  32  • In June 2021 the Massachusetts Steamship Authority was targeted by a ransomware attack which brought  down its website and caused delays for ferry passengers.  • In August 2021 the Compagnie générale de navigation sur le Lac Léman fell victim to a cyberattack on its  website, targeting the ticketing system. The hackers managed to steal the bank details of some customers46.  • In September 2021 French carrier CMA CGM confirmed a data leak, which involved customer information,  including names, employers, positions, email and phone details47.  • In November 2021 a ransomware attack on the maritime IT company Danaos (ICT service provider) affected  several Greek shipping companies who used the Danaos’ communication systems48. Reportedly, the  cyberattack blocked their communication with ships, suppliers, agents, charterers and suppliers, while at the  same time the files with their correspondence were lost.  • In February 2022 a suspected ransomware attack knocked out the management information system at the  Jawaharlal Nehru Port Container Terminal, one of five container terminals in India’s top container gateway,  the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (Nhava Sheva). The Jawaharlal Nehru Port Container Terminal had one of  its scheduled vessels divert to a nearby terminal after it abruptly stopped accepting vessels. At the same  time, the system breakdown left port users no choice but to revert to paper-based cargo processing. This  caused major traffic problems at the gates of the port, also disrupting traffic at the gates of other terminals49.  Moreover, there were major disruptions in other ports where we lack information on what type of attack took place.  For example, in July 2021 four major ports in South Africa (Cape Town, Ngqura, Port Elizabeth and Durban) were  paralysed following a massive attack on the Transnet National Port Authority, the country’s main freight manager50. In  January 2022, several northern European oil hubs in major ports were the target of cyberattacks51. IT systems have  been disrupted at Oiltanking in Germany, SEA-Invest in Belgium and Evos in the Netherlands.

Ransomware  and data-related threats are the two main threats targeting the railway sector (45% and 25%, respectively), followed  by DDoS attacks with an increasing rate. Ransomware and Data-related threats are closely interlinked, as a  ransomware attack is often followed by data leakage or exfiltration.  Figure 29: Railway - prime threats  The majority of the attacks observed targeted the IT systems of railways (passenger services, ticketing systems,  mobile application, display boards, etc.) and caused disruptions due to the unavailability of these services. Examples  include the ransomware attacks targeting Skånetrafiken (August 2021) and Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane (March  2022), which resulted in customers not being able to buy tickets following infections to IT systems. The only cases  were OT systems and networks were affected were either when entire networks were affected or when safety-critical  IT systems were unavailable.  Notable data thefts include the cases of OmniTRAX, MTA, Norfolk Southern Railroads and Lokaltog A/S, where  personnel and medical records were stolen. The case of OmniTRAX represents the first publicly known case of a  double-extortion ransomware attack against a US freight rail operator.  Another interesting case includes the service disruptions to the Danish train operator DSB’s network (October 2022)  due to an attack on one of its ICT service providers after an alleged DDoS attack. The incident reportedly affected the  accessibility of a key safety-critical IT system, thereby disrupting DSB operations for several hours that day.  Finally, an interesting case is the one of hacktivists launching a ransomware attack on the Belarusian state-run train  company in a bid to disrupt Russian troop movements (January 2022). To achieve this, the group deployed modified  ransomware to bring down the railway system and encrypted servers, databases and workstations belonging to the  Belarusian railway service.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  34  Figure 30: Railway - prime threats (annually)  Figure 31: Railway - targets  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  35  DDoS attacks were on the rise in 2022, reaching one fifth of the attacks on the railway sector (20%). This is primarily  due to the increased hacktivist activity which followed Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Hacktivist elements  with pro-Russian/anti-NATO sentiments have been conducting DDoS attacks against railway companies. Examples  include pro-Russia hacker groups claiming responsibility for attacks on railway transport operator CFR Calatori (April  2022), Lithuanian Railways (June 2022), Latvian passenger train company SJSC (June 2022) and Estonian Railways  (August 2022).  When it comes to vulnerabilities (15%), two cases stand out. In December 2021 Canadian transportation agency  Metrolinx temporarily took down their website as a precautionary measure, after being informed by the federal  government about a cyber vulnerability. In January 2022, an anonymous hacker reported a vulnerability impacting the  Swiss national railway system and potentially allowing access to customers’ personal data.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  36  3.4  ROAD SECTOR  Figure 32 and Figure 33 show the threats targeting the road sector overall and on annual basis. Ransomware is the  predominant threat (43%) for the road transport sector, followed by data-related threats (26%) and malware (17%).  Figure 32: Road - prime threats  Ransomware has targeted the automotive industry, in particular OEMs and tier-X suppliers. In some cases, the  production of vehicles or parts had to stop due to an attack. Notable cases include the following.  • In September 2021 Dutch car company Bochane fell victim to a ransomware attack. According to the report,  which was published on the company website, a lot of their computers were blocked for a day52.  • In February 2022 Toyota Motor Corporation suspended factory operations for a day, losing around 13 000  cars of output, after a supplier of plastic parts and electronic components was hit by a suspected  cyberattack53.  • In February 2022 Kia Motors America suffered a ransomware attack by the DoppelPaymer gang, demanding  USD 20 million for a decrypter and to not leak stolen data. The attack was acknowledged in the public  domain after Kia Motors America portals faced major outages and internal disruptions to its customer-facing  systems across the country54.  • In March 2022 Japanese car parts giant Denso55 shut down the network connections of compromised  devices after detecting a breach. The incident has not led to the disruption of production activities, with  plants continuing to operate normally. However, the hacker group Pandora has taken credit for the attack,  claiming to have stolen 1.4 terabytes of data.  52 https://www.omroepflevoland.nl/nieuws/254573/autobedrijf-bochane-gehackt  53 https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-suspends-all-domestic-factory-operations-after-suspected-cyber-attack-2022-02-28/  54 https://aithority.com/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-attack-sinks-a-global-motor-companys-20-million/  55 https://www.securityweek.com/car-parts-giant-denso-targeted-ransomware-group  https://www.omroepflevoland.nl/nieuws/254573/autobedrijf-bochane-gehackt https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-suspends-all-domestic-factory-operations-after-suspected-cyber-attack-2022-02-28/ https://aithority.com/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-attack-sinks-a-global-motor-companys-20-million/ https://www.securityweek.com/car-parts-giant-denso-targeted-ransomware-group  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  37  Figure 33: Road - prime threats (annually)  • In April 2022 Germany’s car rental giant Sixt was hit by cyberattack56. All non-essential services were shut  down. It was assumed that ransomware groups are focusing on an organisation like Sixt because of the  upcoming tourist season.  • In May 2022 AGCO Corporation sites in China, France, Germany and the US suffered a ransomware attack,  making servers inaccessible and halting production for 2 days57.  • In June 2022 a US subsidiary of Nichirin58, a Japanese company that makes hoses for the automotive  industry, was hit by ransomware. The incident forced the company to shut down some production control  systems and switch to manual processes.  56 https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/car-rental-giant-sixt-hit-by/  57 https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/hauts-de-france/oise/beauvais/piratage-informatique-le-site-d-assemblage-de-tracteurs-massey-fergusson- agco-beauvais-victime-d-une-cyber-attaque-2537316.html  58 https://www.securityweek.com/us-subsidiary-automotive-hose-maker-nichirin-hit-ransomware  https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/car-rental-giant-sixt-hit-by/ https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/hauts-de-france/oise/beauvais/piratage-informatique-le-site-d-assemblage-de-tracteurs-massey-fergusson-agco-beauvais-victime-d-une-cyber-attaque-2537316.html https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/hauts-de-france/oise/beauvais/piratage-informatique-le-site-d-assemblage-de-tracteurs-massey-fergusson-agco-beauvais-victime-d-une-cyber-attaque-2537316.html https://www.securityweek.com/us-subsidiary-automotive-hose-maker-nichirin-hit-ransomware  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  38  Figure 34: Road - targets  Data-related threats primarily targeted IT systems in an effort to acquire customer or employee data and proprietary  information. In February 2021, hackers published the data of more than 3.2 million users of DriveSure (US car  dealership service provider focused on employee training programmes and customer retention)59. According to the  sources, hackers published leaked folders with over 22 GB of MySQL databases with not only personal information,  but also 93 063 hashed passwords and emails with clients. In August 2021, Skånetrafiken (Sweden’s regional public  transportation authority and operator) was, for the second time, the subject of cyberattacks. The target was ticketing  machines and the website for buying tickets60. Strætó61 (public transport company which operates city buses in the  Icelandic capital) also fell victim to cyberattacks, where the personal data of employees was stolen.  Notable cases of proprietary information being stolen or leaked include the attacks on Tesla and Volvo. In September  2021 Tesla’s ‘top-secret full self-driving AI car software’62, which enables Tesla cars to drive autonomously, was  leaked, enabling hackers outside the US to use this functionality. In December 2021 Volvo disclosed in a press  release63 that unknown attackers had stolen R & D information by hacking some of their servers, but did not confirm  the nature of the attack, which was allegedly a ransomware attack.  59 https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2021/02/01/personal-data-of-3-million-people-exposed-in-drivesure-hack/  60 https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/skane/skanetrafikens-sajt-och-app-ur-funktion  61 https://straeto.is/en/user-information/cyber-attack-against-straeto  62 https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/elon-musks-top-secret-full-24929177  63 https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/292817/notice-of-cyber-security-breach-by-third-party-1  https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2021/02/01/personal-data-of-3-million-people-exposed-in-drivesure-hack/ https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/skane/skanetrafikens-sajt-och-app-ur-funktion https://straeto.is/en/user-information/cyber-attack-against-straeto https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/news/elon-musks-top-secret-full-24929177 https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/292817/notice-of-cyber-security-breach-by-third-party-1  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  39  3.5  CROSS SECTOR ATTACKS  Finally, there is a limited number of cyber incidents that cannot be placed in one specific subsector. These include  general campaigns targeting the whole transportation sector in particular countries. These campaigns are often  attributed to hacktivists and state-sponsored actors and are linked to geopolitical tensions.  Moreover, there are also incidents where attackers directly target transport agencies. Examples include incidents of  impersonation, such as in the case of the US Department of Transport, which was the target of phishing attacks both  in September 202164 and in September 202265. For more examples of these types of attacks, please refer to the  Annex.  Figure 35: Threats targeting the transport sector as a whole  The report did not analyse the effect of cyber-attacks which target sectors that transport depends on. Such an  analysis would include energy and telecommunication. This is an interesting aspect to examine in future threat  landscapes.  64 https://threatpost.com/attackers-impersonate-dot-phishing-scam/169484/?web_view=true  65 https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-365-phishing-attacks-impersonate-us-govt-agencies/;  https://cofense.com/blog/credential-phishing-targeting-government-contractors-evolves-over-time  https://threatpost.com/attackers-impersonate-dot-phishing-scam/169484/?web_view=true https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-365-phishing-attacks-impersonate-us-govt-agencies/ https://cofense.com/blog/credential-phishing-targeting-government-contractors-evolves-over-time  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  40  4. CONCLUSIONS  In this report, we have performed a deep dive into the threat landscape of a particular sector, namely the transport  sector. While the annual ENISA threat landscapes include sectorial analysis, the documents do not analyse the  context of each sector in depth. In this report, we have tried to shed more light in the types of incidents, the actor  motivations, the affected assets, the victims and the potential impacts to the transport sector. This information is often  sector specific and can provide more valuable information for risk management to the cybersecurity professionals in  the transport sector.  Ransomware attacks became the most significant threat against the sector during 2022, surpassing data- related threats, which were the most significant threat in 2021  . However, it is still assessed that ransomware groups remain opportunistic and relatively indiscriminate in their  targeting. Recent months do not indicate that there has been any particular focus on the transport sector relative to  other sectors. Ransomware has been steadily increasing66 and the transport sector has been affected similarly to the  other sectors.  Our assessment is that threat actors will increasingly conduct ransomware attacks with not only monetary  motivations66. An example is the ransomware attack by Belarusian hacktivists against the Belarusian state railway in  January 202267. Hacktivists will likely be attracted by the effectiveness and the impact that ransomware attacks can  have and the media attention they attract. The scale and sophistication of hacktivists’ ransomware operations are not  expected to be as high as the ones conducted by cybercriminals. Finally, governmental organisations are very likely  the primary targets of hacktivists’ ransomware operations.  The significant increase in hacktivist activity, which followed Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and  the increasing rate of DDoS attacks are highly likely to continue. Hacktivist elements with pro-Russian/anti- NATO sentiments have been conducting DDoS attacks. These attacks targeted several European nations, perceived  by the groups to be assisting Ukraine in its war effort. This increasing volume of DDoS attacks against the European  transport sector was primarily observed in Q2 and Q3 2022. The main targets were European airports, railways and  transport authorities. Several examples are listed below (see Annex for further information).  • In April 2022 pro-Russia hacker group Killnet claimed to be behind attacks on Romanian government  websites, including railway transport operator CFR Calatori68.  • In May 2022 Czechia’s Directorate of Roads and Highways was targeted with DDoS attacks by Killnet,  resulting in disruption to web-based services69.  • In May 2022 Several Italian transport organisations were targeted with DDoS attacks by Legion - Cyber  Spetsnaz RF70.  • In June 2022 Killnet claimed to have disrupted the website of Lithuanian Railways, preventing passengers  from purchasing train tickets online71.  • In June 2022 Latvian passenger train company SJSC was targeted with DDoS attacks, likely by pro-Russian  hacktivists72.  • In July 2022 NoName057 targeted two Lithuanian airports with DDoS attacks73.  66 ENISA Threat Landscape 2022. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  67 https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/belarus-activists-fire-ransomware/;  https://www.wired.com/story/belarus-railways-ransomware-hack-cyber-partisans/;  https://www.railway-technology.com/news/belarusian-railway-cyber-breach/  68 https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-state-websites-cyberattack-2022  69 https://english.radio.cz/cyber-agency-says-attack-czech-states-road-and-motorway-directorate-encoded-data-8751033  70 https://www.wired.it/article/attacco-cyber-russia-italia-legion-ministero-polizia/  71 https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1728365/major-incidents-contained-after-lithuania-gets-hit-with-massive-cyber-attacks  72 https://www.apollo.lv/7535816/ddos-uzbrukumu-del-trauceta-pasazieru-vilciena-bilesu-tirdznieciba-uznemuma-majaslapa  73 https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1728365/major-incidents-contained-after-lithuania-gets-hit-with-massive-cyber-attacks  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022 https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/belarus-activists-fire-ransomware/ https://www.wired.com/story/belarus-railways-ransomware-hack-cyber-partisans/ https://www.railway-technology.com/news/belarusian-railway-cyber-breach/ https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-state-websites-cyberattack-2022 https://english.radio.cz/cyber-agency-says-attack-czech-states-road-and-motorway-directorate-encoded-data-8751033 https://www.wired.it/article/attacco-cyber-russia-italia-legion-ministero-polizia/ https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1728365/major-incidents-contained-after-lithuania-gets-hit-with-massive-cyber-attacks https://www.apollo.lv/7535816/ddos-uzbrukumu-del-trauceta-pasazieru-vilciena-bilesu-tirdznieciba-uznemuma-majaslapa https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1728365/major-incidents-contained-after-lithuania-gets-hit-with-massive-cyber-attacks  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  41  • In August 2022 Killnet claimed responsibility for attacks to more than 200 state and private Estonian  institutions, including Estonia Railways74.  • In August 2022 a pro-Russia hacker group known as the Cyber Army of Russia targeted the Ukrainian  government’s Department of Transport Safety.  Even though pro-Russian hacktivists continue to target transport organisations in Ukraine and neighbouring  countries, the capabilities of most pro-Russian hacktivists remain low and are largely limited to DDoS and  defacement attacks. On the other hand, hacktivists supporting Ukraine have been conducting DDoS and ‘hack and  leak’ operations. Some examples include the following.  • In March 2022 hacktivist collective Anonymous (presumably) carried out an attack on the Russian Federal  Air Transport Agency, deleting approximately 65 terabytes of data75.  • In April 2022 Anonymous-linked group GhostSec claimed to have accessed an IT system of  Metrospetstekhnika76.  • In August 2022 Anonymous claimed to have hacked Yandex Taxi, causing a massive traffic jam in  Moscow77.  • In September 2022 transport in Novosibirsk was affected as hacker security group Team Onefist disrupted  traffic78.  The majority of attacks to the transport sector target IT systems and can result in operational disruptions.  However, we have not received reliable information on a cyber-attack affecting the safety of transport.  Ransomware groups will likely target and disrupt OT operations in the foreseeable future66. The factors  contributing to this assessment are:  • the ongoing digital transformation in the transport sector and the increased connectivity between IT and OT  networks;  • the increased urgency to pay ransom to avoid any critical business and social impact;  • the ongoing rebranding of ransomware groups, which increases the chances of malware blending and the  development of capabilities to target and disrupt OT networks;  • Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine, as ransomware groups are taking sides and are likely to  conduct retaliatory attacks against critical western infrastructure;  • the increase in the number of newly identified vulnerabilities in OT environments.  The analysis of the ransomware threat landscape from May 2021 to June 2022 resulted in some conclusions that can  be regarded as lessons for the community.  While we have not observed notable attacks on global positioning systems, the potential effect of this type of  threat to the transport sector remains a concern. Jamming and spoofing of geolocation data could affect their  availability and integrity, affecting transport sector operations. This type of attack requires further analysis in the  future.  When it comes to mitigating threats which target the transport sector, readers may consult the recommendations and  security measures included in Annex D of the ENISA Threat Landscape 202279. For each threat type, specific  recommendations are provided and mapped to security measures that are part of international standards used by  entities under the NIS Directive, including transport organizations80.  74 https://www.ohtuleht.ee/1068880/kuberrunnakus-sai-pihta-ka-eesti-raudtee  75 https://www.aviacionline.com/2022/03/cyber-attack-on-russias-aviation-authority-this-is-what-we-know/  76 https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/130409/hacktivism/anonymous-hacked-other-russian-organizations.html  77 https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/135280/hacktivism/anonyomus-hacked-yandex-taxi.html  78 https://www.ibtimes.com/russians-novosibirsk-forced-pound-pavements-team-onefist-paralyzes-traffic-exclusive-3611628  79 ENISA Threat Landscape 2022 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  80 Minimum Security Measures for Operators of Essentials Services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum-security-measures-for- operators-of-essentials-services  https://www.ohtuleht.ee/1068880/kuberrunnakus-sai-pihta-ka-eesti-raudtee https://www.aviacionline.com/2022/03/cyber-attack-on-russias-aviation-authority-this-is-what-we-know/ https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/130409/hacktivism/anonymous-hacked-other-russian-organizations.html https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/135280/hacktivism/anonyomus-hacked-yandex-taxi.html https://www.ibtimes.com/russians-novosibirsk-forced-pound-pavements-team-onefist-paralyzes-traffic-exclusive-3611628 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum-security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum-security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  42  In general, cyberattacks are rarely reported, especially those with non-significant impact or near misses. Most  organisations prefer to deal with the problem internally and avoid bad publicity. Some countries have laws regulating  the mandatory reporting of incidents, but in most cases a security attack is first disclosed by the attacker. In the EU,  the arrival of the revised NIS2 directive81 and the enhanced notification provisions for security incidents is expected to  support a better understanding of relevant incidents.  The lack of reliable data from targeted organisations makes it very hard to fully understand the problem or even know  how many cyberattacks on the transport sector actually occur. Even using the data from the web pages of threat  actors (an undeniably unreliable source), it is very hard to keep track of the actual number of attacks. The most  important information that is missing is the technical explanation as to how the attackers obtained access to the  targets. This is usually private data that describes the security posture of the target, so it is never shared with the  public. As a consequence, our learning as a community of the problems to be solved remains fragmented and  isolated.  Moreover, the effects of cross sector dependencies could be of particular interest to the transport sector. We would  require a more detailed analysis of how cyberattacks targeting the energy and telecommunications sectors could  affect transport or how an attack on one means of transport could cause a disruption to another means of transport.  81 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-welcomes-political-agreement-new-rules-cybersecurity-network-and-information-systems  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-welcomes-political-agreement-new-rules-cybersecurity-network-and-information-systems  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE: TRANSPORT SECTOR  March 2023  43  ANNEX: MAJOR INCIDENTS  Table 1: Aviation  Date Proximity Country Incident  January  2021 Near France Dassault Falcon Jet were hit by the Ragnar Locker ransomware gang82.

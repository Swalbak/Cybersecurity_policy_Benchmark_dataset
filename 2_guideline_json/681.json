Today 2.9 billion people--40% of the  world’s population--are online. By 2020, market analysts expect between 20 and 50 billion connected  devices to be in the market. With all the benefits from the use of connected devices, also come a range of  threats from data manipulation, data theft, and cyberattacks – and these are increasing. In 2015, European  enterprises had at least a one-in-five chance of losing data through a targeted cyber-attack1. As a result,  they have high concern regarding the availability and integrity of their systems.  Today we are seeing a market failure for cybersecurity and privacy: trusted solutions are more costly for  suppliers and buyers are reluctant to pay a premium for security and privacy. This weakness creates a  severe risk that the European economy is falling behind in its ability to tap into the promising emerging IoT  markets. The lack of trust in smart and connected devices from businesses and consumers is a barrier to  growth and jobs.  The smart card world already knows the relevance and risks of physical attacks when devices are physically  accessible to an attacker. With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) enabling cars, critical infrastructure,  and health applications using the same pipes and systems to communicate, attacks will get even more  risky and threatening.  SOG-IS2 member states, including the respective accredited evaluation labs, have built high expertise for  the evaluation and certification of smart cards and similar devices to high assurance levels. We highly  recommend building on this unique expertise, scaling it to more member states, and optimizing its mutual  recognition within the EU to equalize the demand which is going to come with the rise of IoT (from low to  high assurance levels depending on the application needs).  Currently there is no basic level, no level zero defined for the security and privacy of connected and  smart devices. There are also no legal guidelines for trust of IoT devices and services and no precautionary  requirements in place. This is why we recommend effective baseline requirements for security and privacy  in the networked architecture and value chain as a whole: from simple IoT devices up to complex IoT- systems like connected cars and factories. Stakeholders need an equal and level playing field to implement  trust into connected devices and services.  We believe it necessary to define the European Baseline Requirements for Security and Privacy that  minimizes risk, is neutral in technological terms, and remains open to innovation. Currently a set of draft  baseline requirements is being developed and discussed within AIOTI3 by defining technical gaps.4 It  1 http://quocirca.com/content/least-1-5-europe-enterprises-lose-data-through-targeted-cyber-attacks  2 http://www.sogis.org/  3 Companies involved: https://docbox.etsi.org/SmartM2M/Open/AIOTI/!!20160616AIOTIWorkshopOnSecurity/  4 Report available at:  https://docbox.etsi.org/SmartM2M/Open/AIOTI/!!20160616AIOTIWorkshopOnSecurity/TICKEDv2%20List%20of%206  http://quocirca.com/content/least-1-5-europe-enterprises-lose-data-through-targeted-cyber-attacks http://www.sogis.org/ https://docbox.etsi.org/SmartM2M/Open/AIOTI/!!20160616AIOTIWorkshopOnSecurity/TICKEDv2%20List%20of%2061%20Registered%20(53%20ticked%20on%20site)%20Participants%20to%2016%20June%202016%20AIOTI%20Workshop%20on%20Security%20and%20Privacy%20in%20the%20hyper-connected%20world.pdf  December 2016  2  includes the request for third party evaluation and certification for connected devices and services. The  introduction of an EU Trust Label, based on various security levels and on a related risk assessment, as  discussed during an AIOTI workshop on Security and Privacy in the hyper-connected world in Sophia  Antipolis at ETSI recently, should also be evaluated by the European Commission.  Ideally, the use of the label should be mandatory as a symbol of trust of citizens, consumers and  businesses in the connected world. An obligatory reference framework and an associated label would  ensure appropriate levels of security for products and services. This would further lead to a level playing  field for the entire industry. As a second step, higher, sector- or application-specific security levels can be  developed building on and extending the baseline requirements.  2 Challenges and recommendations  2.1 Standardisation and certification – priority 1   Any existing and new regulation should take standards developed and / or strongly supported by EU  stakeholders (EU industry, EU governmental agencies) into account (related good examples: PSD2, eIDAS,  GDPR, NIS).   So called baseline requirements for IoT security and privacy that cover the essentials for trust, e.g. rules  for authentication / authorization, should set mandatory reference levels for trusted IoT solutions. Simple  ones for products like smart thermostats and more sophisticated ones for complex devices like a  smartphone.   The framework for interoperability testing needs to be adapted to new requirements related to IoT   The EU-standardisation process can be time-intensive, potentially causing delays in application of  necessary standards and interoperability. This situation needs to be improved. Solutions include the  support of European industry and best practices as precursors. industry standards could become  recognised by European Standard Development Organisations and integrated into their work   Future standards for scalability of security controls have to anticipate and meet the needs of different risk  levels. Some market sectors, such as industrial internet, have already defined and standardized four  security levels on cyber physical systems (IEC 62443). This approach should be evaluated to determine if it  could be used as a reference for other sectors.   A currently well-established certification of security products is Common Criteria (CC, ISO/IEC 15408). It  has been implemented in many EU Member States and other countries and benefits from a dedicated  mutual recognition agreement (SOG-IS MRA) between 13 EU member states. This should be extended  ideally to all Member States. Also SOG-IS MRA covers high assurance security levels, a key asset on which  the EU should build. The MRA and the way CC is applied require adjustments in order to stay attractive for  the development of modern applications and agile development methodologies. In addition, for  customers/applications not requiring full CC certification or those willing to accept lower security levels  while maintaining the vulnerability assessment of the security solutions, a baseline security certification  1%20Registered%20(53%20ticked%20on%20site)%20Participants%20to%2016%20June%202016%20AIOTI%20Works hop%20on%20Security%20and%20Privacy%20in%20the%20hyper-connected%20world.pdf  https://docbox.etsi.org/SmartM2M/Open/AIOTI/!!20160616AIOTIWorkshopOnSecurity/TICKEDv2%20List%20of%2061%20Registered%20(53%20ticked%20on%20site)%20Participants%20to%2016%20June%202016%20AIOTI%20Workshop%20on%20Security%20and%20Privacy%20in%20the%20hyper-connected%20world.pdf https://docbox.etsi.org/SmartM2M/Open/AIOTI/!!20160616AIOTIWorkshopOnSecurity/TICKEDv2%20List%20of%2061%20Registered%20(53%20ticked%20on%20site)%20Participants%20to%2016%20June%202016%20AIOTI%20Workshop%20on%20Security%20and%20Privacy%20in%20the%20hyper-connected%20world.pdf  December 2016  3  (essentially a “lightweight” certification) for ICT products should be developed and agreed by all MSs,  addressing IoT, Commercial of-the-shelf (COTS) and products with short life cycle. Certification should use  standardized security requirements for connected devices as reference.   The introduction of a European trust label for connected devices should be built on defined baseline  security requirements and existing internationally recognized certification schemes. Such a European trust  label should make the underlying certification transparent, also including the targeted security need. This  should be supported by a European Certification Framework.  The European Commission should define a policy framework for ensuring minimal security  requirements for connected devices. The development of European security standards needs to  become more efficient and/or adapted to new circumstances related to IoT. Based on those  requirements a European scheme for certification and the development of an associated trust  label should be evaluated.  2.2 Security processes and services – priority 1   Existing high assurance-level security processes and services that come with SOG-IS need to be  evaluated and adapted to new challenges related to IoT.   Evaluation of security processes and services (delivery, testing, life cycle management etc.) should lead to  certification.   Framework solely for interoperability testing is not sufficient with regard to the requirements. Speed and  cost of third party security testing should be improved by considering application specific attack scenarios  (e.g. by proper application of user guidance, testing in live environments in the course of certification).   There is a lack of awareness when it comes to security and privacy in IoT. Industry, especially SME,  needs to be provided with information about existing security features such as encryption, appropriate  key storage, strong authentication, privacy and identity management systems.   Existing approaches to Industrial Internet (i.e. Cyber-Physical Systems, Internet of Things, Cloud  Computing) should be promoted and studied further.  The European Commission should ensure that reliable security processes and services are being  developed and should support industry in implementing security features in their products (e.g.  through providing information and training about state-of-the art security solutions).  2.3 Security requirements and implementation – priority 2   Baseline requirements for security and privacy must become effective in the networked architecture and  value chain as a whole: from components of simple IoT-devices up to complex IoT-systems like connected  cars and factories. A mandatory reference level for any trusted IoT solution must be set. In future revisions  of existing legislation, scalable technical security requirements and common principles should be made  mandatory (e.g. NIS Directive). These common principles shall be based on scalable robustness  requirements (including security controls and mechanisms), reference security architectures, basic  functionalities, and security certification of embedded security services.  December 2016  4   Synergies across various sectors (e.g. energy, health care, transport, finance) should be used to a larger  extent to reduce the amount of standards for similar certification and service approaches.   Convergence of safety and security is important especially where human lives are endangered, e.g. in  Automotive or in Industry 4.0 (IEC 62443).   Privacy should be correctly perceived. Appropriate training should be mandatory in schools, universities  (through all disciplines) and industry, in order to exercise certain functions.  The European Commission should encourage the development of mandatory staged  requirements for security and privacy in the IoT, including some minimal requirements. These  common principles should be considered in future revisions and new legislative initiatives.  2.4 Economic dimensions – priority 2   A level playing field with the same rules and requirements on security to all stakeholders will support cost  benefits and provide legal certainty.   Insurance companies and policies could define a  ‘Digital Security Bonus’ as reward for implementation of  security solutions, particularly in non-regulated sectors, such as industrial internet, smart homes or smart  living. A mandatory cybersecurity insurance for connected devices might stipulate this approach.   Risk management practices, including certifications, (like that defined by Basel II accord) should be  promoted, e.g. by granting insurance premiums for assessing cybersecurity risks.   To set a good example, national public authorities should integrate appropriate security standards into  their sectoral public procurement policies.   An enforceable set of penalties should be defined for dealing with vendors of security products and  services that abuse established practices on certification and/or deliver counterfeit products.  The European Commission should create an equal level playing field for cybersecurity and look  into incentives similar to the Digital Security Bonus in order to reward the use of good security  practices.  3 About us  Infineon Technologies is a world leader in semiconductor solutions that make life easier, safer and  greener.

The European  Commission demonstrates its support through  developing EU regulation such as the Cybersecurity  Act1, the recently launched Proposal for a European  Cybersecurity Competence Network and Centre2, and  initiatives under the umbrella of the Connected Europe  Facility3. EU public and private stakeholders look to  ENISA, as the EU Agency supporting these EU focused  cybersecurity activities.  1 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eu-cybersecurity- certification-framework  2 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/proposal-european- cybersecurity-competence-network-and-centre  3 https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility  ENISA’S OPINION  PAPER ON ISAC  COOPERATION  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  In this brief paper, ENISA will share its opinion on the  ongoing developments and traction of Information  Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs). The ISAC-model  has demonstrated its value to cyber experts, policy  advisors and managers in EU Member states such as  the Netherlands where the National Cyber Security  Centre actively supports ISACs, and in sectors such as  finance where ISAC cooperation exists for many years  on pan European, international and national level.4  The EU institutions, Member States and industry are  increasing their interest in ISACs as a cooperation model:  Organisations such as the European Cyber Security  Organisation (ECSO) and the European Commission  support the model by exploring financial programmes  such as the Connecting Europe facility (CEF), discussing  possibilities for cooperation, and suggesting further  investment through procurement.  4 https://www.ncsc.nl/samenwerking/_samenwerken/sectorale- samenwerking-isac.html  ENISA presents its views  on how ISACs strengthen  EU cybersecurity and  identifies the benefits  of ISACs to the Digital  Single Market.

Why this paper  at this moment in time? As this model is not regulated  in the EU and its cooperation is voluntary, ENISA  considers the ISAC approach as a solid cooperation- model to explore and build upon. Supported by the  new ENISA mandate and regulation that tasks ENISA to  further invest in ISACs, ENISA is motivated to promote  the ISAC-model among the EU member states and  industry because:  The model focuses on cooperation across borders  and sectors at a time where the EU is introducing  multiple regulatory cybersecurity focused initiatives  and ENISA is in the unique position to bring together  the required public and private knowledge and  expertise;  The model allows for multi-layer cooperation from  discussing strategic issues to operational challenges;  The model requires no ‘heavy’ EU regulatory  framework, but simply the willingness of  cooperation and sharing based on trust, equality  and transparency among Network and Information  Security (NIS) experts;  The model increases cybersecurity information  sharing at national level.5  Therefore, the ISAC-model deserves more public  justification and support.  5 In the Netherlands, the ISACs are considered to be an essential  instrument in strengthening the resilience of critical infrastructure  sectors, and by doing so supportive of the NIS Directive. ISACs have  contributed annually to the National Cybersecurity Assessments:  https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/blg-811523.pdf  In the UK, the CiSP model is similar: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cisp  In this paper, ENISA presents its views on how ISACs  strengthen EU cybersecurity and identifies the  benefits of ISACs to the Digital Single Market.6 As the  ISAC model receives growing support and in order  to avoid fragmentation, ENISA concludes with some  recommendations on the future development of ISACs  within a European context. The target audience of  the paper consists of policy makers as well as critical  infrastructure and industry representatives that are  already involved in sectoral cooperation such as an ISAC,  and/or are interested in learning more about ISACs.  6 In 2018 ENISA published a study on analysing EU models and  how EU ISAC’s work: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ information-sharing-and-analysis-center-isacs-cooperative-models  Supported by the new  ENISA mandate and  regulation that tasks  ENISA to further invest  in ISACs, ENISA is  motivated to promote  the ISAC-model among  the EU member states  and industry.  https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/blg-811523.pdf https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cisp https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-analysis-center-isacs-cooperative-models https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-analysis-center-isacs-cooperative-models  OPINION PAPERS 3  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  1. BACKGROUND OF ISACs  Information Sharing and Analysis Centres  (ISACs) provide a central resource for gathering  information on cyber threats (in many cases to  critical infrastructure) and offer active sharing of  information between the private and the public  sector. ISACs have created communities within  the private and governmental sector. ISACs were  originally created in the USA. In 1997, after the first  terrorist attacks on World Trade Center (1993) and  Oklahoma City (1995), President Clinton appointed  the President’s Commission on Critical Infrastructure  Protection (PCCIP). Its objective was to identify  the possibility of cooperation between public and  private sector so that the US critical infrastructure  could be properly protected. One of the main  recommendations was to establish Information  Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISACs) in order to  build and strengthen cooperation between public  administration and the industry.7  Recent analysis and research shows that information  sharing through ISACs is effective and creates an  ecosystem in which trust is being built among critical  operators.8 This allows entities less advanced in the field  of cybersecurity to learn from others.  7 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing- and-analysis-center-isacs-cooperative-models 8 Luijf E., Kernkamp A., Sharing cyber Security Information  Good Practice Stemming from the Dutch Public-Private- Participation Approach, March 2015: https://publications.tno.nl/ publication/34616508/oLyfG9/luiijf-2015-sharing.pdf  Huistra A.

EU STATE OF PLAY: ISACs  European legislation encourages the creation of ISACs:  the NIS Directive supports incident reporting and the EU  Cybersecurity Act proposal supports information sharing  and analysis sharing among public and private entities in  an effort to ensure cybersecurity. ENISA should support  information sharing in and between sectors, in particular  in the sectors listed in Annex II of the NIS Directive, by  providing best practices and guidance on available tools,  procedure, as well as providing guidance on how to  address regulatory issues related to information sharing,  for example through facilitating the establishment of  sectoral ISACs.9  Under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funding,  several objectives are defined to establish an enabling  facility for a series of European level sectoral ISACs  (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers) with industry  and NIS Directive stakeholders for improved awareness  and preparedness of cybersecurity risks and threats.10  It demonstrates the support of the European Union to  invest in the ISAC model on European level.  9 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/ PDF/?uri=CONSIL:ST_12058_2018_INIT&from=EN 10 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/connecting- europe-facility-supports-expansion-cybersecurity-capabilities  ENISA’s membership offers the ISAC its experience  in capacity building and technical expertise such as  analysing incidents and threat intelligence. In addition,  ENISA offers its extensive network to further support  the ISACs. Each ISAC has its own development process  and characteristics, which means that ENISA adjusts its  role accordingly.  ENISA is actively  involved in the creation  and development of  EU focused ISACs. The  Agency supports the  EU Energy ISAC, the  EU FI ISAC, and the  development of the EU  Aviation ISAC and EU  Railway ISAC.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-analysis-center-isacs-cooperative-models https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-analysis-center-isacs-cooperative-models https://publications.tno.nl/publication/34616508/oLyfG9/luiijf-2015-sharing.pdf https://publications.tno.nl/publication/34616508/oLyfG9/luiijf-2015-sharing.pdf https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/rapporten/2017/03/07/verkenning-cybersecurity-informatiedeling-binnen-de-topsectoren https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/rapporten/2017/03/07/verkenning-cybersecurity-informatiedeling-binnen-de-topsectoren https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/rapporten/2017/03/07/verkenning-cybersecurity-informatiedeling-binnen-de-topsectoren https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/connecting-europe-facility-supports-expansion-cybersecurity-capabilities https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/connecting-europe-facility-supports-expansion-cybersecurity-capabilities  OPINION PAPERS 4  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  3. THE BENEFITS OF COOPERATION  The European Union is responsible for suggesting  and driving initiatives that lead to cooperation in  cybersecurity. The NIS Directive, the Cybersecurity Act  including the certification proposal, and the recently  published proposal for a European Cybersecurity  Competence Network and Centre, reflect this. Although  it is essential that public institutions initiate necessary  cyber regulation, it is important to mention that  administrative and regulatory thinking must not become  counterproductive to cybersecurity cooperation and  the digital market. It is unavoidable that independent  initiatives to secure and strengthen models such as  ISACs might create ambiguity among the (potential)  stakeholders. This is why ENISA recommends that  the industry takes the lead in creating sectoral ISACs,  supported by ENISA. In the absence of industry not  taking initiative, the public sector could fill the gap. These  initiatives strengthen the autonomy of the stakeholders  involved, create the opportunity to invite the public  stakeholders like law enforcement, and ultimately build  the foundations for an ISAC based on trust, equality and  shared interests.  Public private cooperation is at its best when the  stakeholders cooperate based on common interests,  not on differences. The same argument applies to the  EU institutions active in cybersecurity. A future network  of multiple EU focused ISACs could create a strong  network of defence to protect the digital society and  our Digital Single Market. ENISA is committed to fulfil  this responsibility together with the relevant public and  private stakeholders.  4. KEY MESSAGES/ RECOMMENDATIONS The ISAC model represents great potential for  strengthening cybersecurity and resilience in the  European digital society. In February 2018, ENISA  published a comprehensive study on the different  cooperation models of ISACs.11 Its conclusions and  recommendations explain the functioning and potential  value of ISACs to relevant stakeholders. In this opinion  paper, ENISA further elaborates on this study by providing  concrete recommendations to our stakeholders with the  purpose to promote and point out the future potential of  EU level ISACs and their cooperation:  11 Refer to footnote 4.  a.  ENISA supports existing EU ISACs that represent  critical infrastructure. However, not all Operators of  Essential Services (OES) sectors are represented with  an ISAC on the EU level. ENISA therefore strongly  recommends OES active on the EU market that are  not yet in an ISAC, to explore and initiate cooperation  by following the ISAC-model. Several national  cybersecurity authorities in the EU have already  developed a strong model of ISAC cooperation. ENISA  welcomes these initiatives and advises OES to get  informed and become involved on both a national and  European level if possible.12  12 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-releases- online-nis-directive-tool-showing-per-sector-the-national-authorities-  National cybersecurity  authorities will benefit  from supporting ISACs  at national and EU  level because it will  not only provide them  access to the industry,  it will also provide  them with a platform  to informally discuss  incidents, threats, and  policy proposals.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-releases-online-nis-directive-tool-showing-per-sector-the-national-authorities-for-operators-of-essential-services-and-digital-service-providers https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-releases-online-nis-directive-tool-showing-per-sector-the-national-authorities-for-operators-of-essential-services-and-digital-service-providers  OPINION PAPERS 5  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  b.  Although the initiation of an ISAC model remains  voluntary, this process requires expertise and  existing knowledge of cybersecurity cooperation.  This is especially a concern for EU focused ISACs.  The challenge of organising or facilitating ISAC  cooperation within the context of EU Member States  and its institutions requires up-to-date knowledge of  the current possibilities and existing proposals. ENISA  recommends any newly formed EU focused ISAC or  related collaboration initiative to find a sponsor with  excellent knowledge of EU institutions and funding  opportunities in order to become accepted as the  ISAC representing the sector.  c.  It is recommended that the current EU focused ISACs  continue to develop their activities with the support  of EU institutions, engaging and sharing knowledge  amongst each other. Against the background of  recent EU regulation that refers to cybersecurity  cooperation there is a continuous need for  cooperation concerning cross-sectoral dependencies,  this is a clear opportunity to further mature and  professionalise. In particular, ENISA recommends to  invest in developing the analysing capabilities within  and among the existing EU focused ISACs. By sharing  their best practices, analysis and expertise, ISAC  members hold great potential for addressing cross- sectoral challenges.  d.  EU focused ISACs represent not only an opportunity  to gather public and private stakeholders to share  their information and analysis, but once ISACs are  operational and ready to share information outside  their organisation, ENISA recommends exploring  cooperation with CSIRT communities, and even the  European CSIRTs Network. Thus, creating a strong  network of relevant players potentially covering all  relevant operators of essential services.  for-operators-of-essential-services-and-digital-service-providers  e.  Lastly, ENISA recommends initiating the discussion  on the development, structures and direction  of EU focused ISACs. What is desirable in terms  of representation of OES in EU focused ISACs:  representation per member state, or representation  by industry and multinationals? Should EU focused  ISACs be an instrument where more mature OES  stakeholders inform and assist the less mature OES  stakeholders in the EU cyber ecosystem? Is there a  maximum span of control concerning the amount of  members? How do the relevant stakeholders in the EU  ISAC ecosystem ensure that collaboration benefits all  involved? ENISA advises to initiate this discussion in  order to assist the next generation of collaboration.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-releases-online-nis-directive-tool-showing-per-sector-the-national-authorities-for-operators-of-essential-services-and-digital-service-providers  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  ABOUT ENISA  The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) is a centre of network and information  security expertise for the EU, its member states, the private sector and EU citizens.

It is recommended that the current EU focused ISACs  continue to develop their activities with the support  of EU institutions, engaging and sharing knowledge  amongst each other. Against the background of  recent EU regulation that refers to cybersecurity  cooperation there is a continuous need for  cooperation concerning cross-sectoral dependencies,  this is a clear opportunity to further mature and  professionalise. In particular, ENISA recommends to  invest in developing the analysing capabilities within  and among the existing EU focused ISACs. By sharing  their best practices, analysis and expertise, ISAC  members hold great potential for addressing cross- sectoral challenges.  d.  EU focused ISACs represent not only an opportunity  to gather public and private stakeholders to share  their information and analysis, but once ISACs are  operational and ready to share information outside  their organisation, ENISA recommends exploring  cooperation with CSIRT communities, and even the  European CSIRTs Network. Thus, creating a strong  network of relevant players potentially covering all  relevant operators of essential services.  for-operators-of-essential-services-and-digital-service-providers  e.  Lastly, ENISA recommends initiating the discussion  on the development, structures and direction  of EU focused ISACs. What is desirable in terms  of representation of OES in EU focused ISACs:  representation per member state, or representation  by industry and multinationals? Should EU focused  ISACs be an instrument where more mature OES  stakeholders inform and assist the less mature OES  stakeholders in the EU cyber ecosystem? Is there a  maximum span of control concerning the amount of  members? How do the relevant stakeholders in the EU  ISAC ecosystem ensure that collaboration benefits all  involved? ENISA advises to initiate this discussion in  order to assist the next generation of collaboration.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-releases-online-nis-directive-tool-showing-per-sector-the-national-authorities-for-operators-of-essential-services-and-digital-service-providers  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  ABOUT ENISA  The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) is a centre of network and information  security expertise for the EU, its member states, the private sector and EU citizens.

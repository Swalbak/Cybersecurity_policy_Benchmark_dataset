The directive was created with the objective of boosting  the overall level of cybersecurity in the European Union. It does so by increasing the cybersecurity  capabilities in the Member States, by enhancing cooperation on cybersecurity among the Member States,  and by requiring Operators of Essential Services (OES) and Digital Services Providers (DSPs) to manage their  risks. In relation to the latter, an important element of the risk to be assessed is the one of the  dependencies of the services offered on other services of either OES or DSPs. These dependencies might  be of either national or cross-border nature.  A glance at the interdependency landscape reveals a number of emerging interdependencies between  OES/DSPs at both system and service level. There is an increasing number of cybersecurity incidents that,  due to these interdependencies, either propagated across organisations, often across borders, or had a  cascading effect at the level of essential services.  Yet, despite the clear need to address interdependencies as part of their overall cybersecurity risk  management, organisations and National Competent Authorities (NCAs) face difficulties due to the  lack of suitable methods, tools, available data and expertise.  In order for OES, DSPs and National Competent Authorities (NCAs) to effectively identify and assess  interdependencies, a framework based on a 4-phase approach appears to be a suitable way forward.  Existing methods, tools and good practices for interdependencies can easily be mapped to these 4 phases  based on the respective individual or sectorial specificities and needs. The development of indicators for  the interdependencies' assessment, which are mapped to well-known and widely used industry standards  and frameworks would also constitute a practical approach.  This report includes a set of recommendations for OES, DSPs and NCAs to effectively address  interdependencies in their risk assessments, including:   OES and DSPs should conduct empirical investigations to collect data   OES, DSPs and NCAs should develop and integrate methodologies and tools   OES and DSPs should develop expertise via awareness and training   NCAs should work towards developing a common taxonomy of incident impact assessment   OES and DSPs should address interdependencies at operational level   NCAs should facilitate information sharing.  1 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  07  1. Introduction  The European Commission has adopted a series of measures to enhance Europe's capabilities addressing the  increasing risks of cyber attacks and incidents in terms of frequency of occurrence and severity of impact. These  measures aim at making the online environment more trustworthy and therefore supporting the functioning of the  European Union’s Digital Single Market2. Among such measures, the European Parliament and the Council reached  an agreement about the Directive3 on the security of network and information Systems (NIS Directive). The NIS  Directive represents the first step of an EU-wide strategy and legislation on cybersecurity. This report is part of a  series of ENISA activities supporting the implementation of the NIS Directive.  Scope and objectives  This study is concerned with dependencies and interdependencies among Operators of Essential Services  (OES) and Digital Service Providers (DSPs) as defined in the NIS Directive and addresses emerging  dependencies and interdependencies across sectors. Figure 1 depicts different dependencies and  interdependencies within the scope of this report as the result of combined dependencies:  Figure 1 Dependencies (and Interdependencies) among OES and DSPs  The main objectives of the study are:  1. To provide a description of interdependencies among OES and DSP  2. To highlight risk assessment practices for the evaluation of the potential impact of interdependencies  3. To propose a framework for assessing interdependencies  4. To define good practices for assessing interdependencies.  2 European Commission (2015): A Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe, COM/2015/0192.  3 European Parliament and the Council (2016): Directive (EU) 2016/1148 concerning measures for a high common level  of security of network and information systems across the Union. OJ L 194, 19.7.2016, p. 1–30.  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj  http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  08  These objectives would support relevant NIS stakeholders, in particular OES, DSP and National Competent  Authorities (NCAs) with addressing the risks associated with emerging dependencies and interdependencies.  Analysing emerging dependencies and interdependencies would also support decision makers in defining  mitigation measures reducing risks, thus enhancing the security of network and information systems.  Definitions  Guidelines concerning the security and resilience of critical infrastructures4 provide definitions for  dependency as “the one-directional reliance of an asset, system, network, or collection thereof—within or  across sectors—on an input, interaction, or other requirement from other sources in order to function  properly” –  and for interdependency as “mutually reliant relationship between entities (objects,  individuals, or groups); the degree of interdependency does not need to be equal in both directions”.  Taking into consideration the scope of this report, these definitions emphasise the directional aspects of  dependency and interdependency and highlight the directional relationships between services (OES and  DSPs), rather than simply on the underlying infrastructures. This characterisation is necessary in order to  take into account subtle interactions among services in operations and simultaneously aligns with the  definitions provided by the NIS Directive:  Dependency: A linkage or connection between two services (or underlying infrastructures), through  which the state of one service (infrastructure) influences or is correlated to the state of the other  Interdependency: A bidirectional relationship between two services (or underlying infrastructures)  through which the state of each service (infrastructure) influences or is correlated to the state of the  other. More generally, two services (infrastructures) are interdependent when each is dependent on the  other.  Nevertheless there are additional characteristics highlighting the nature of (inter)dependencies and their  potential impact on services, classifying the relationships (and the related impact on services) into cross- border, cross-sectorial, spatial and functional interconnectedness and dependency5.   Cross-border (inter)dependencies refers to services’ (inter)dependencies between OES themselves,  between DSPs themselves, and between OES and DSPs operating in two or more different Member  States.   Cross-sector (inter)dependencies refers to services’ (inter)dependencies between OES, between DSPs,  and between OES and DSPs operating in different sectors (without excluding the case of OES and DSPs  stationed in different Member States).   Functional interconnectedness refers to a situation in which an infrastructure is necessary for the  operations of another infrastructure.   Spatial interconnectedness refers to a situation where two infrastructures are in close proximity to  each other.  There are also cases with both types of interconnectedness. Three factors influence the results of these  (inter)dependencies:  4 US Department of Homeland Security (2013): National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP): Partnering for Critical  Infrastructure Security and Resilience.  5 Zimmerman, R. (2001): Social implications of infrastructure network interactions. Journal of Urban Technology  8(3):97–119. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/106307301753430764  https://doi.org/10.1080/106307301753430764  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  09   Interconnectedness and coupling (which affect how failures propagate through systems);   Redundancy (affecting alternative ways of restoring systems);   System knowledge (for example, which enables identification of threats).  How incidents propagate through (inter)dependencies of services can be described in four different  classes: Physical, Cyber, Geographic and Logical6 7. Figure 2 provides the graphical representation of these  classes of (inter)dependencies among OES and DSPs.  Figure 2 Classes of dependencies and interdependencies among OES and DSPs   Physical: A service (or an infrastructure) is physically dependent if the state of its operations is  dependent on the material output(s) of another service (infrastructure) through a functional and  structural linkage between the inputs and outputs of two assets.   Cyber: A service (or an infrastructure) is cyber dependent if its state of operation depends on  information and data transmitted through the information service (infrastructure) via electronic or  informational links.   Geographic: A service (or infrastructure) is geographically dependent if a local environmental event  can create changes in the state of operations in all of them. A geographic dependency occurs when  elements of service (infrastructure) assets are in close spatial proximity (e.g. a joint utility right-of- way).   Logical: A service (or an infrastructure) is logically dependent if its state of operations depends on the  state of another infrastructure via a mechanism that is not a physical, cyber, or geographic connection.  Logical dependency is attributable to human decisions and actions and is not the result of physical or  cyber processes; for instance, demand for services may shift from an infrastructure that does not  function properly to another infrastructure that provides similar services.  This formulation suggests that (inter)dependencies transcend individual infrastructure sectors. As such,  they vary in scale and complexity, ranging from local linkages to international linkages. Their differences  create a variety of spatial, temporal, and system complexities that are difficult to identify, represent and  analyse. Therefore, based on the impact of dependencies and interdependencies, infrastructure  (inter)dependencies classified in three general categories:   Cascading failure: how disruption in one infrastructure causes a disruption in the second   Escalating failure: how a disruption in one infrastructure exacerbates an independent disruption of a  second   Common cause failure: disruptions of two or more infrastructures is due to a common cause.

Dependencies and Interdependencies  Examples of cyber incidents with a cross-sector or cross-border impact  Recent cyber incidents (e.g. WannaCry, Petya, NotPetya, Stuxnet, etc.) provide instances of the potential  impact on different sectors and countries. Table 1 provides a schematic analysis of the impact of different  recent cyber incidents. It highlights the type of threat, the affected sectors, users, countries and systems8.  Table 1 Examples of cyber incidents and their potential impact  CYBER INCIDENT TYPE OF THREAT AFFECTED SECTORS AFFECTED USERS AFFECTED COUNTRIES AFFECTED SYSTEMS  WannaCry Ransomware Cross-sector  propagations (e.g.  Telecom and Health)  Multiple users  (more than 250  victims paid a  ransom)  Cross-border  propagations affecting  multiple countries  (more than 150  countries)  Operating Systems  (more than 230.000  systems)  Petya Ransomware Multiple Sectors Multiple users Multiple Countries (e.g.  Ukraine, USA, Russia,  France, UK, Germany,  India, China, etc.)  Operating Systems  NotPetya Malware Multiple Sectors (e.g.  Finance,  Transportation,  Energy, Commercial  facilities, and  Healthcare)  Multiple users Multiple Countries (e.g.  Ukraine, Russia,  Denmark, France, UK,  Belgium, USA, etc.)  Software Application  (i.e. the MEDoc Tax  and accounting  software package)  SamSam Ransomware Multiple Sectors  (including Transport  and Health)  Multiple users (of  the attacked  services)  Multiple Countries Targeted  infrastructures  VPNFilter Malware Multiple Sectors Multiple users Multiple Countries Infect certain routers  and network  attached-storage  (NAS) devices  Stuxnet Malware Energy Multiple users Multiple Countries  (mainly Iran but also  Indonesia, India, etc.)  Industrial Control  Systems (ICS),  Programmable Logic  Controllers (PLCs),  SCADA systems  BlackEnergy Trojan Energy Multiple users Multiple Countries SCADA distribution  management systems  8 Note that the table refers to the affected countries, because cyber incidents can propagate beyond regional areas and  beyond Member States. Moreover, it reports the impact of incidents based on reports that may rely on partial and  incomplete analyses. It is often difficult to have final accurate assessments due to the different reporting channels that  highlight partial assessments.  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  12   WannaCry (Ransomware) – Incident description: WannaCry was a global (worldwide) ransomware  cryptoworm cyber attack, which targeted computers running Microsoft Windows operating system. It  encrypted data and demanded ransom payments in Bitcoin cryptocurrency; Impact: The ransomware  campaign caused chaos due to its massive distribution, affecting more than 150 countries and infecting  over 230.000 systems. The economic impact of the WannaCry incident is estimated in the order of  hundreds of million euros with some cyber risk modelling analysts placing the losses in the order of  billions9. Insights: The attack started just before the weekend (on Friday). This made it very difficult for  companies and organisations to quickly react and resolve the crisis. Although security patches were  available, most systems still had unpatched vulnerabilities. The attack presented an increasing  complexity (in terms of speed of spreading and sophistication).   NotPetya (Malware) – Incident description: A fake Ukrainian tax software update (in June 2017)  spread laterally through infected networks like a worm, using attack vectors Supply Chain ME.doc and  the EternalBlue and EternalRomance exploits; Impact: NotPetya, a variant of the older Petya attack,  charged $300 in ransom from victims in more than 100 countries; NotPetya had significant economic  impact for a number of companies whose estimated losses in revenue alone are estimated at over 800  million euros10. Insights: Although the attack channel may be similar to other cyber attacks, NotPetya  seemed targeting specifically Ukranian government and organisations – suggesting the involvement of  organised crime or coordinated hacker groups (e.g. State-sponsored attacks).   SamSam (Ransomware) – Incident description: SamSam ransomeware attacks affected different  organisations across sectors, the ransomware encrypts data and demand a huge ransom payment in  Bitcoin in exchange for the decryption keys.; Impact: SamSam has attacked different large  organisations across sectors, including Transport (e.g. COSCO attack) and Health; SamSam has earned  its creator(s) more than 5 million euros since late 2015, a figure that does not take into account  revenue losses and system restore costs11. Insights: Differently from other ransomware attacks,  SamSam targets specific organisations’ infrastructures rather than spreading accidentally over the  Internet.  Figure 3 depicts one example of how cross sector and cross border propagation of incidents may occur.

The incidents’ review points out the  complexity of different types of attacks and their potential impact cross sector and cross border.  This also suggests that risk assessments need to take into account realistic scenarios in order to provide  insights on emerging dependencies and interdependencies.  Landscape of cyber (inter)dependencies  In this section, the landscape of cyber (inter)dependencies among different sectors and types of OES and  DSPs, as well as potentially sectors beyond the scope of the NIS Directive (e.g. telco or mobile  communications) is identified. Taking into account relevant studies in Critical Infrastructure Protection  (CIP) 13, the resulting landscape reveals a complexity of the relationships14 across sectors and their related  services. Any disruption on their operations may affect the cyber-security of these sectors and have either  a cross-sector (or even a cross-border) impact on the provided services. However, the examples (as  presented in the following sub-sections) acknowledge cross-sector (inter)dependencies as sources of  vulnerabilities and often point out mutual functional relationships among almost all sectors of critical  infrastructures (although in general terms).  The semantics of these cyber security incidents/attacks also suggest that the energy and  telecommunication sectors often drive cascade effects of critical infrastructure failures, whereas, other  sectors rather are victims of emerging dependencies and interdependencies15.  Due to the digitalisation of services, all major sectors16  have an increasing level of cyber  (inter)dependencies on digital infrastructures and DSPs. By analysing current and best practices within  different industrial sectors in the ways OES adopt the digital services, the identified key  (inter)dependencies of OES on DSPs as confirmed by means of interviews17 with involved stakeholders  (representatives of OES and DSPs) are highlighted in Figure 4. It should be clarified that these are the  identified (inter)dependencies and the list should not be considered exhaustive.  The variation among the degrees of dependencies (i.e. low, medium, high) is defined by using the  qualitative information as collected from the professional opinion of interviewed experts while taking into  consideration the cross-sector factor, as follows:   LOW = the OES capability to successfully carry out core mission/business functions has a limited  dependency on a DSP (for operational, security, risk management, compliance purposes)   MEDIUM = the OES capability to successfully carry out its core mission/business functions has an average  dependency on a DSP (for operational, security, risk management, compliance purposes)  12 EUROPOL (2018): Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA), European Cybercrime Centre (EC3).  13 European Commission, Commission Staff Working Document on a New Approach to the European Programme for  Critical Infrastructure Protection: Making European Critical Infrastructures more secure, 28.8.2013, SWD(2013) 318  final.  14 Note that there are not only complex relationships across sectors, but also within sectors. For example, charging  service providers and producers of invertors for solar panels (who offer internet access to production figures) control  large amounts of power and cyber incidents might affect the stability of grid operators' stability.  15 European Commission, Commission Staff Working Document on the Review of the European Programme for Critical  Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP), 22.6.2012, SWD(2012) 190 final.  16 Without excluding the telecom operators (although the NIS Directive does not directly cover them).  17 note that not all categories of OES use or are depending, to the same extent, on the services provided by DSPs  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  14   HIGH = the OES capability to successfully carry out its core mission/business functions has critical  dependency on a DSP (for operational, security, risk management, compliance purposes).  Figure 4: Dependencies of Operators of Essential Services on Digital Service Providers (overview)  Despite the efforts of OES in dealing with external parties (e.g. DSPs), it is challenging and difficult to  measure and assess the effectiveness of managing dependencies due to the complexity. Moreover, OES  need to verify effectively the trustworthiness of DSPs with respect to their security practices and processes  in operations. Typically, in order to address risks, common practices involve specifying security  requirements into contracts, Service Level Agreements (SLAs), Operational Level Agreements (OLAs) and  other formal agreements. However, such contracts and agreements can still leave some uncertainties  about (shared) duties, responsibilities and obligations in operations. Moreover, it can be difficult to clarify  such uncertainties in case of cybersecurity incidents (e.g. data breaches) affecting complex ICT systems and  services. Nevertheless, organisations in some cases may have limited ability to negotiate security  requirements. Sometimes, it is simply unrealistic to expect DSPs meeting stringent security requirements  in operations.  Of course, key cyber (inter)dependencies for OES and DSPs extend beyond the scope of the NIS  Directive. For instance, trust certificates at the infrastructure/service level are necessary in order to  support transactions with parties (e.g. for e-government, a high level of trust between the different  systems is needed).  In the following paragraphs, a brief overview of the respective cross-sector and of OES on DSPs  (inter)dependencies are provided.  The reason the examples are provided is for emphasizing the necessity  to provide methodologies for identifying and understanding cyber (inter)dependencies  in order to  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  15  mitigate any risk associated with security incidents as the impact of cyber-security incidents may  propagate across sectors.  2.2.1 Emerging (inter)dependencies in energy  Energy operations are possible thanks to a combination of goods and services that include digital services,  finance, digital infrastructure and transport. The energy sector also has dependencies with financial  market infrastructures. In economic terms, energy (i.e. electricity, oil and gas) is a commodity that can be  bought, sold and marketed. In the past, monopoly-based organisational structures were the common ways  of selling and exchanging energy18.  Nowadays the digitalisation of the energy sector has also transformed related financial market  infrastructures19 that support the negotiation of energy in real time in order to make the market efficient.  This highlights the increasing cyber dependencies with digital infrastructures and digital services such as  cloud computing becoming key elements supporting daily activities in the energy sector.  Moreover, within the energy subsectors of the NIS directive (Electricity, Oil and Gas), the distribution and  supply phases (or the activities concentrated in the downstream for the Oil and Gas sectors) in the value  chains present the most interest of the emerging (inter)dependencies on DSPs. This is due to the fact that  distribution and supply phases are the ones that have stronger market drivers (than other phases such as  production and transmission) targeting at innovation and competition.20 Cloud services enable data usages  regardless of the data storage location while connecting different teams from around the world, enabling  them to share information instantly and expedite the development process21.  Figure 5: Elements of the Energy value chain that depend most on DSPs  18 Barton, B., et al. (2004): Energy Security: Managing Risk in a Dynamic Legal and Regulatory Environment. Oxford  University Press.  19  Note also that the energy transition requires a lot of effort from especially regional grid operators.  20 This applies mainly to centralised production; as decentralised production becomes more prominent, dependencies  on digital services grow as well.  21 Saputelli, L.

Digital technologies and services (e.g. smart meters, IoT, cloud services)  increasingly enable information flows across the grid and the different value chain phases in order to  communicate and provide (real-time and updated) data for operations and customers. In the distribution  phase, many electricity operators are strategically investing in and acquiring advanced capabilities, which  allow customers to choose their energy supply mix in order to address their demands.  One example is EnergySage22, an online marketplace that enables comparison-shopping among pre- screened solar installers and financiers and a number of utilities. Another example, in the electricity  subsector where demand and offer of electricity are traded through specialised online marketplaces is  Nord Pool - a specialised online marketplace for the energy market in northern Europe23.  The supply phase involves different stakeholders ranging from infrastructure providers, utility retailers and  customers (both commercial and private end users). In the supply phase, cloud computing and IoT (e.g.  smart metering) have the greatest impact and involve customers’ interaction. Some of the digital  technologies currently employed by electricity involve cloud computing services, IoT and services such as  big data and analytics, impacting the interactions with and offering new digital capabilities to end users  and customers.  In the oil subsector, there is an emerging dependency on massive data connectivity, on cloud services and  infrastructures. The oil industry is prototyping new and connected technologies to reduce well completion  time, maintenance time, etc. through real-time monitoring and advanced analytical software, especially in  the areas of fracturing fluids, sand, and logistics management. Oil-specialised search engines is another  interesting illustrative example of digital services utilised by the oil subsector. More specifically, these  specialised search engines (e.g. Datafari) allow oil (and gas) geoscientists to get very quickly an overview of  all the data that are necessary for them to decide whether to drill an oilrig.  In the gas sub-sector, a forecast from the UK-based Oil and Gas Council24 indicates that the gas industry  stands to benefit particularly from cloud computing services. Cloud adoption is one of the main IT trends  for oil and gas in 2017, alongside with the Internet of Things (IoT), drones, intelligent rigs, and leak- detection software.  2.2.2 Emerging (inter)dependencies in transport  The increasing digitalisation of the transport sector makes it highly dependent on digital infrastructure  and DSPs. The transport sector is highly reliant on digital services such as online marketplaces, online  search engine and cloud computing services for their daily operations. For instance, unavailability of such  services would severely impact automated airport processes such as online check-in, self-service luggage,  ticketing, etc., resulting in flight delays, financial and reputational losses.  The cyber (inter)dependencies of the transport sector are likely to increase due to the digitalisation  and integration of transport services (e.g. multimodal transport).  22 EnergySage: https://www.energysage.com/  23 Nord Pool Market: http://www.nordpoolspot.com/  24 UK Oil Gas Council (2017): The forecast for oil & gas IT.  https://www.energysage.com/ http://www.nordpoolspot.com/  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  17  The digitalisation of transport services (including the adoption of autonomous cars) will likely increase the  cyber dependencies and interdependencies of the transport sectors (e.g. dependencies on digital services,  interdependencies among transport services, dependencies on energy sector, etc.).  Another dependency of the transport sector is on the energy sector. A study25 on the energy sector  highlights the potential effects of energy disruptions on other essential services. In particular, the transport  sector may be exposed to energy disruptions on the Electricity and Oil/Gas sectors.   Disruptions to electricity will potentially have an impact on electric public transportations,  signal and control systems, transport of fuel and shipping of goods and materials as well as  transport information systems (arrival times, platforms, etc.) and may affect ticket machines  and turnstiles   Disruptions to oil/gas will potentially have an impact on fuel and lubricants for vehicles and  facilities, transport of fuel and shipping of goods and materials.  Figure 6: Elements of the Transport value chain that depend most on DSPs  The rail sub-sector exhibits increasing dependencies on DSPs, particularly in the operations due to the  increasing adoption of online marketplaces (e.g. for ticketing), online search engines (e.g. for marketing),  cloud computing services (e.g. for information sharing). Illustrative cases of cloud services applied to  support the business of rail companies may include sharing of information and services of public  importance, such as the train timetables, scheduling information, seats reservations, monitoring of freight  cars, e-ticketing and public procurement. Higher level of rail transport traffic safety can be achieved with  support of cloud computing services that facilitate cooperation of the autonomous traffic and  transportation systems (especially in the area of distributed information systems, web user interface,  integrated database available on the Internet, effective reporting, etc.). Moreover, interoperability of rail  transport data and better information sharing between operators is also facilitated by the use of services  provided by the cloud DSPs.  25 NIST (2016): Guide Brief 5 – Assessing Energy System Dependencies, NIST Special Publication 1190GB-5. DOI:  http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1190GB-5  http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1190GB-5  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  18  In the road sub-sector, online road transport marketplaces are portals where transportation capacity is  bought and sold - typically, these can be categorized as vertical marketplaces as they deal specifically with  road transportation and sometimes with other added-value services for transportation management.  There is an increasing number of transport operators (whether for rail, road or water) that are adopting  cloud computing technologies and services to streamline their business, operations, to improve workflows  and to allow data sharing among a broader audience in their supply chain. Moreover, transport OES make  use of cloud computing services for geospatial applications. Cloud based GIS systems and applications  can also compile information from a wider array of sources via the web, encouraging data sharing among  stakeholders to support the interdisciplinary nature of transportation services (inter-modality).  Collaboration through cloud based applications or systems can increase efficiency by allowing access to the  same data set and eliminate duplicated data collection activities.  The air sub-sector has typically been a closed environment that exhibits low dependency regarding the  feasibility of the adoption of cloud computing in order to support the exchange of information among26 Air  Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), though cloud is being used especially for office automation, while  online marketplace are used for procurement. Although, broader adoption of cloud computing is under  consideration in order to reduce operational costs and to improve the overall system resilience and  continuity, no DSPs are involved in core operational services.  In water transport, typical applications involving cloud services for water transport operators are related  to27 ship/ fleet management, maintenance management, document management and reporting.  2.2.3 Emerging (inter)dependencies in banking and financial market infrastructures  The sectors of banking and financial market infrastructures show a high level of dependency on the digital  infrastructure and DSPs. This is because the activities of these sectors involve electronic transactions that  rely on digital infrastructures and services. For example, banking and financial market infrastructures’  operators depend on digital infrastructure operators managing Top-Level Domain (TLD) name registries.  Another example is the sector's dependency on Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial  Telecommunication (SWIFT), the world’s leading provider of secure financial messaging services,  which as of 2015 linked more than 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries and  territories  Another example is the sector's dependency on Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial  Telecommunication (SWIFT), the world’s leading provider of secure financial messaging services, which as  of 2015 linked more than 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories. Due to  the dependencies of banking and financial market infrastructures on digital infrastructures, there are also  secondary dependencies on the energy sector. For example, energy disruptions may have different  impacts:   Disruptions to electricity will potentially have an impact on financial transactions and HVAC (Heating,  Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems  26 Currently, considering the IT domain for ENAV, only a raw 20% is weighted as common office activity. Strong  commitment and expectations are posed on the SWIM activities, considered an enabler for the civil aviation  worldwide and SESAR JU consortium funds are available. There are similar programmes in the USA and other  international pan-European air transport services and, worth of note, ICAO is actively working for standardisation.  27 Pančo Ristov, M. P. V. T. (2014): The implementation of cloud computing in shipping companies. Scientific Journal  of Maritime Research.  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  19   Disruptions to oil/gas will potentially have an impact on fuel for heat, generators and facilities.  Indeed, disruptions to energy supplies could potentially trigger a cascade effect on the normal functioning  of digital infrastructures and then consequently to banking and financial market infrastructures.  2.2.4 Emerging (inter)dependencies in health  As the health sector is currently undergoing a process of digitalisation, the dependency on the electricity  sector is essentially the most critical for health services. The case of a power outage is just a practical  example that highlights the dependency of health operators on the energy sector for maintaining their  services (e.g. on-line prescription, appointment booking, etc.) that depend on networks and information  systems (e.g. laboratory information systems, radiology information systems, etc.). In turn, the power  generators requiring fossil fuels (mainly, oil and gas) in order to provide electricity to facilities of health  operators create a dependency with the rest of the energy sector.  Moreover, the sector is becoming more and more dependent on the digital infrastructure.  For example, incidents affecting Domain Name System (DNS) operators may affect health services  such as eHealth services relying on online websites (e.g. on-line prescription, appointment booking,  telemedicine, etc.).  The dependency with the drinking water supply and distribution sector is another critical dependency for  the health sector. Water supplies are necessary for cooling systems of operation environments in health  services such as data centres (e.g. servers in data rooms, routers, etc.). Healthcare also depends on  banking sector services in order to perform several financial transactions (e.g. payroll web applications) to  medical staff, suppliers, vendors and other third parties (e.g. electricity suppliers, digital services, etc.).  2.2.5 Emerging (inter)dependencies in drinking water supply and distribution  Services of drinking water supply and distribution depend on different SCADA systems, which need to  operate constantly in order to provide the necessary operational information creating a dependency on  the electricity sector. New digital technologies in the drinking water sector have introduced detailed  measurement and near real-time monitoring of water extraction, treatment, distribution, use and reuse,  with the potential to distinguish between different water qualities, sources, quantities and users28.  Among the most relevant categories of data29 handled by the drinking water sector, the following that  produce a large volume can be enlisted: Flow, chemical concentration and laboratory data; Water supply  metering and customer usage data; Engineering and construction data; and Water asset performance and  maintenance data.  Growth in the variety of data processed by the water supply and distribution operators, particularly  unstructured data, is changing the landscape of water data and the manner the use, storage and  protection of this data is more and more dependent on the DSPs. For example, the open source  28 Directive 2007/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007 on the assessment and  management of flood risks. OJ L 288, 6.11.2007, p. 27–34. ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2007/60/oj  29 Deloitte (2016): Water Tight 2.0 - Top trends in the global water sector.  http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2007/60/oj  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  20  unstructured data - web content, social content and crowdsourcing30 – is changing the landscape of  water data.  The information systems that support the ordering, planning and monitoring of chemical supplies create  indirectly cyber dependencies on the transport sector. However, due to the low level maturity concerning  the integration and standardisation of ICT solutions in the respective business processes31, incidents  related to digital infrastructure would have in principle a limited impact on the sector as a whole.  One of the most relevant and obvious opportunities – at the same time, dependencies – that the drinking  water supply and distribution operators have is on the cloud computing services providers. Drinking water  OES are benefitting from the availability of a broad variety of cloud services. In particular, data-related  services such as storage and analytics support the digitalisation of several services in the water value chain  (hence, the digital water process).  Figure 7 Drinking water value chain elements that depend the most on the DSPs  Moreover, the increasing digitalisation of SCADA systems and reliance on information networks expose the  operators of drinking water supply and distribution to potential cyber attacks32. Networked, intelligent  sensors and decision support systems in real time facilitate data acquisition, monitoring and reporting to  make better use of energy, avoid unnecessary water losses and minimize the consumption of resources.  2.2.6 Emerging (inter)dependencies in digital infrastructures  Most sectors are developing an increasing dependency on digital infrastructure services. This is due to the  progressive digitalisation of services across sectors. On the other hand, digital infrastructure services also  depend on other sectors. For example, a clear dependency relates to how the digital infrastructure relies  on servers, storage devices, network switches and data centre infrastructure, as well as a shift to much  greater shares of cloud and hyper scale data centres.  30 One definition of the crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting  contributions from a large group of people and especially from the online community rather than from traditional  employees or suppliers.  31 European Commission (2018). Report on the Action Plan to foster Digital Single Market for Water Services  (ICT4Water).  32 Birkett, D.M., (2017): Water Critical Infrastructure Security and Its Dependencies. Journal of Terrorism Research. 8(2),  pp.1–21. DOI: http://doi.org/10.15664/jtr.1289  http://doi.org/10.15664/jtr.1289  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  21  Big quantities of energy are needed in order to power this infrastructure. In this regard, Data centres  worldwide consumed around 194 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity in 2014, or about 1% of total  demand33.  Another dependency relates to the water sector. Indeed, cold water is needed in many cases by the  datacentre cooling systems for maintaining the system from overheating (e.g. servers in data rooms,  routers, UPSs etc.). Moreover, in some cases where the electric energy is produced from dumps, the digital  infrastructures has a secondary dependency with the water sector.  Cross-border (inter)dependencies  In order to have a comprehensive account of (inter)dependencies, it is necessary to discuss and analyse  them also from a cross-border perspective, that is, how security incidents affecting services in a Member  State may propagate cross-border to services in other Member States.  Cross-border impact provides another dimension for assessing the impact of security incidents and  significant incidents may have a cascading effect on different sectors as well as on services across  Member States.  In general, it is possible to distinguish three situations, as depicted in Figure 8.  Figure 8 Cyber attacks with cross-border impact  1. Common Vulnerabilities. In such cases, cyber incidents are due to the exploitations of common  vulnerabilities and may have an impact in multiple countries as the result of such vulnerabilities, rather  than cross border propagation. This type of attack may involve sophisticated technologies or services  and often suggests that cyber-attacks target specific services (e.g. large organisations providing  services or critical infrastructures) rather than citizens.  2. Connectivity of Services. In such cases, security incidents propagate due to the underlying connectivity  of sectors operating in different countries. For instance, this is the case of attacks infecting ICT systems  and propagating by infecting connected resources or systems. At the sectorial level, essential services  may be exposed to cyber-attacks affecting (inter)interdependencies. For example, banking and  33 IEA (International Energy Agency) (2017). Digitalisation and Energy 2017.  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  22  financial market infrastructures depend on service connectivity for financial transactions. Cyber- attacks targeting highly connected banking and financial market infrastructures can have significant  propagation effects that cascade into related and neighbouring financial services (e.g. payment and  other banking transactions) operating in other countries.  3. Service Structures. In such cases, security incidents have a cross-border impact due to structural  service dependencies, i.e., security incidents may affect multiple countries, because there exist  underlying structural dependencies among services. An example of this might be the case of energy  production services that may operate in multiple countries. A security incident affecting energy  production would affect the countries that depend on such energy supplies. Other examples involve  security incidents affecting Air Transport services (e.g. National Air Traffic Management services) that  may also have a cross-border impact due to underlying service structures.

Framework for Assessing Dependencies and Interdependencies  An extensive review of the relevant literature regarding good practices, methodologies, approaches and tools  revealed significant commonalities as regards the phases for (inter)dependencies risk assessment. This chapter  builds on these commonalities to propose a framework for assessing (inter)dependencies, based on a phased  approach. For each phase, the relevant state of the art in terms of methodologies, practices and tools is presented  to allow customised implementation of the framework based on the individual requirements, sectorial  specificities, maturity and resources of the different stakeholders who may wish to implement it in practice.  Introduction to the framework  Integrating the assessment of (inter)dependencies in an overall risk management process is a complex  process, particularly in the case of cross-sector or cross-border dependencies and interdependencies. This  section provides a framework for assessing (inter)dependencies, which follows common principles of risk  management34, 35 and defines a process consisting of four different phases (Figure 9).  Figure 9 Dependency and Interdependency Assessment  1. Contextualising and Tailoring Assessment: involves defining the key elements of the  (inter)dependencies risk assessment  2. Identification and Modelling of Dependencies and Interdependencies: involves diverse  methodological approaches, including the analysis of historical data, for the identification and  modelling of dependencies and interdependencies among OES and DSPs.  3. Analysis and Measurement of Dependencies and Interdependencies: involves analyses, including  quantitative analyses, based on different scenarios or simulations of the dependencies and  interdependencies among OES and DSPs.  4. Evaluation of Impact of Dependencies and Interdependencies: involves the impact assessment, based  on the performed analyses and measurements, for the identified and modelled dependencies and  interdependencies among OES and DSPs.  For each phase, the following sections provide an overview of different methodologies that take into  account such (inter)dependencies between OES and DSPs highlighting the main types of methodological  34 ISO 31000:2018, Risk management – Guidelines.  35 ISO 31010:2009 – Risk Management – Risk assessment techniques  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  24  approaches, the common risk assessment steps, approaches to metrics and impact assessments, as well as  key aspects of National Risk Assessment approaches.  The framework is applicable for:   OES/DSPs for supporting their (inter)dependencies risk assessment   NCAs for integrating (inter)dependencies in their National Risk Assessments (NRAs)  Contextualising and tailoring assessment  Prior to any methodological approach or tool adopted for conducting any aspects of (inter)dependencies  risk assessment, it is necessary to define the assessment’s key elements:   Scope: The scope and the scale of risk assessments depend on various factors including the involved  critical infrastructures, OES or DSPs taken into account as well as to what extent Member States are  vulnerable to security attacks affecting deliveries of services.   Cross Border and Regional Dimensions: Risk assessments highlight that incidents or hazardous  conditions may have origins beyond organisational and national boundaries. The nature of cyber  threats and the continuous evolution of threat landscape require understanding how cyber incidents  may propagate across organisations36 such as OES and DSPs, and across Member States.   Previous Incidents and Lessons Learnt: The availability of relevant data affects the overall risk  assessment (e.g. in terms of accuracy). The most common sources of information supporting risk  assessments are, for instance, historical records and databases of events, impacts and recorded losses  and damages. Although the sources of information, the ownership and the responsibility may belong  to different organisations (e.g. OES and DSPs as well as governmental bodies and authorities such as  CSIRTs and NCAs), data on previous incidents provide evidence and understanding of past events, their  occurrences and impact (e.g. in terms of damages and consequences).   Multi-stakeholder Involvement: (Inter)dependencies risk assessments typically involve different  stakeholders, who may have different responsibilities as well as different risk perceptions and who  position themselves differently with respect to emerging risks. It is necessary to involve all relevant  stakeholders, who may affect the outcomes of risk assessments.   Timeframe: (Inter)dependencies risk assessments are often conducted at specific time and are  constrained by budget; for instance, national risk assessments are conducted with a timeframe of  three to five years. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the timeframe of a risk assessment and its  validity with respect to emerging threats.  Identification and modelling of dependencies and interdependencies  The overall objective of this phase is to identify and model relationships, that is, (inter)dependencies  among OES and DSP, capturing domain-specific knowledge based on historical data and experts or data  insights.  The ISO 31010 standard identifies various techniques that can support risk identification. Such techniques  may support different types of activities for gathering stakeholder knowledge (e.g. brainstorming,  structured and semi-structured interviews, etc.).  36 Van Eeten, M., Nieuwenhuijs, A., Luiijf, E.,  Klaver, M., Cruz, E. (2011): The state and the threat of cascading failure  across critical infrastructures: the implications of empirical evidence from media incident reports. Public Administration  89(2):381-400. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.01926.x  https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.01926.x  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  25  Among the various techniques for identifying and modelling (inter)dependencies, risk scenarios capture  contextual knowledge and support the identification of risks for specific environments.  National Risk Assessments (NRAs) often develop specific risk-based scenarios37 in order to assess the  exposure of critical infrastructures to critical events such as cyber-attacks. In order to develop a  comprehensive account of risk, it is necessary to take into account two different aspects of the risk  scenarios:   Scenario severity and impact: risk scenarios may capture a single incident differently. Therefore, it is  necessary to develop multiple scenarios covering different magnitudes (e.g. in terms of criticality or  expected impact) and different interactions among threats or hazards. High-risk scenarios may be  associated to highly improbable events having catastrophic impacts. Although these risk scenarios are  unlikely, they are required in order to assess the potential impact of critical events.   Scenario timeline and scope: risk scenarios need to have a validity in alignment with foreseen  developments (e.g. increasing number of data breaches in the next five years, expected adoption of  digital services in the next five years, etc.) This information is necessary in order to clarify the scope (in  terms of time and space) of risk scenarios. Risk scenarios may also involve a scope beyond the  organisational or national boundaries. For example, severe events may have a cross-border impact  affecting services across multiple Member States. Moreover, it is necessary to underpin the main  relevant causes or trends.  In order to limit their complexity, risk scenarios may capture individual risks rather than multiple risks.  Unfortunately, catastrophic events may be due to interactions among multiple risks causing chains of  events having severe impacts. Therefore, it is necessary to understand and to define risk scenarios in order  to support single-risk as well as multiple-risk assessments.  A common pitfall in risk identification is overlooking dependencies that are embedded or hidden in  plain sight, such as ICT services that are widely used - thus implicitly taken for granted - but are key  services to OES and DSPs.38  Existing methodological approaches supporting risk analysis often involve different types of modelling and  characterisation of risk (e.g. Fault Tree Analysis, Event Three Analysis, Failure Mode and Effect Analysis,  Bayesian Network Analysis, etc.). Methodological approaches supporting risk analyses of  (inter)dependencies of OES and DSPs include39:  37 Risk scenarios are representations of risk situations leading to significant impacts, selected for the purpose of  assessing in more detail a particular type of risk for which it is representative, or constitutes an informative example  or illustration.  38 Interview referring to Luiijf, E., Klaver, M.

Empirical approaches analyse (inter)dependencies taking into account historical data of incidents (e.g.  in terms of frequency and severity of incident patterns) and expert opinions (based on their domain- specific experiences).  2. Agent based approaches capture the complexity of (inter)dependencies as interactions of autonomous  agents that interact among one another in their environments based on specific rules. Such  approaches adopt a bottom-up method and assume the complex behaviour or phenomenon emerge  from many individual and relatively simple interactions of autonomous agents.  3. System dynamics based approaches represent (inter)dependencies as results of emergent system  behaviours. Such approaches take a top-down method to manage and analyse complex adaptive  systems involving (inter)dependencies.  4. Economic based approaches capture (inter)dependencies as results of economic and market theories  involving exchanges of values (e.g. capital, demand, offer, etc.). Such approaches take into account the  production and consumption of services (or other related constrained resources).  5. Network based approaches capture (inter)dependencies as results of the relationships (e.g.  information flows) among individual components. Such approaches model single systems/services by  networks and describe their (inter)dependencies by inter-links, providing intuitive representations  along with detailed descriptions of their topologies and flow patterns.  6. Service-based approaches capture the modelling of interdependencies conducted on the basis of  services that infrastructures exchange. This allows the development of a simulation framework which  is sector agnostic40.  A more detailed description of the aforementioned approaches and an overview of the relevant research  activities is available in Annex B.  Analysis and measurement of dependencies and interdependencies  The overall objective of the risk analysis is to assess the likelihood and impact of the identified risks. In a  quantitative risk analysis, risks are the combination of the consequences of a critical risk and the  associated likelihood of its occurrence41. Consequences are the negative effects of a disaster expressed, for  example, in terms of human impacts, economic and environmental impacts, and political/social impacts.  The probability of occurrence captures (in those situations that it is possible to quantify) the likelihood of  occurrence of a hazard (or threat) of a certain intensity, whereas, the severity of impact provides an  assessment of the consequences of critical events (occurrence of hazards or threats). Analysis and  measurements of (inter)dependencies typically involves:  1. Scenarios and simulations; and  2. Metrics.  A special case of (inter)dependencies analysis and measurement are the national risk assessments  conducted by Member States in order to assess their exposure to critical events including natural and  40 Ihttp://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC102547/lbna28073enn.pdf  41 The classical algebraic representation of risk is that Risk is equal to the Impact (severity of hazard/threat  consequences) times Frequency (likelihood of occurrences). Note that not all risks are quantifiable, socio-technical  aspects of risks highlight the limitation of quantitative approaches to risks. It is necessary to understand also the  limitations of risk assessments (and quantification approaches) in order to conduct them properly. For a socio-technical  account of risk see: Anderson, S., Felici, M. (2012): Emerging Technological Risk – Underpinning the Risk of Technology  Innovation, Springer. DOI https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-2143-5  http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC102547/lbna28073enn.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-2143-5  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  27  man‑made disasters42. The conducted national risk assessments provide an overview of current practices  adopted by Member States in assessing their exposures to diverse risks (e.g. earthquake, flooding, critical  infrastructure disruption, cybercrime, etc.). National risk assessments typically involve developing specific  scenarios (or simulations) under which to evaluate (possibly, quantitatively) the risks associated with  specific threats. These national risk assessments provide insights in order to define crisis management  strategies and contingency plans. National risk assessments are described in more detail in section 3.6.  3.4.1 Scenarios and simulations  The (inter)dependencies risk assessments may involve different types of scenarios and simulations and the  scenarios themselves can involve different types of incidents or disruptive events, from natural disasters  due to earthquakes to incidents to essential services (e.g. transport incidents such as collisions, explosions  of oil and gas pipelines, disruptions of energy supplies, etc.). Examples of cyberattacks, affecting  organisations and individuals, targeting OES and DSPs include syntactic attacks (using malicious software  relevant to intrusion, cyber espionage and sabotage and semantic attacks (through the dissemination of  incorrect information to affect credibility of the target resources, relevant in the case of cyber subversion).  Other forms of cyber threats have become increasingly relevant, such as the risk of social engineering  involving insider manipulation of individual data and installation of malware43. Hybrid threats involve  military and non-military actions, which state or non-state actors can use in a coordinated manner, often in  a disguised and deniable form, to undermine public trust in government institutions or exploiting social  vulnerabilities while remaining below the threshold of formally declared warfare. Hybrid threats can  involve cyberattacks having an impact on critical information systems causing disruptions to critical  services such as energy supplies or financial services. Important components of a scenario-based risk  assessment are:   Different scenarios for an incident: it is necessary to develop different scenarios for the same type of  incident covering different magnitudes and different interactions among threats.   Defined time and space scope of each scenario: it is necessary to define the scope (e.g. in terms of  time and geographical distribution) for each scenario in order to clarify also its validity. Some scenarios  may also have a scope beyond the national boundaries involving multiple Member States.   Identify underlying cause(s) and important trends: it is necessary to recognise the underlying causes  and important trends (e.g. increasing deployments of Internet of Things, digitalisation of essential  services, etc.) that may provide contextual information.   Catastrophic Scenarios: it is necessary to develop also catastrophic scenarios (i.e. highly improbable  events to which response is difficult) overwhelming national or organisational capacity to respond (e.g.  coordinated cyberwarfare targeting simultaneously all operators of essential services).  Scenarios and simulations, therefore, capture critical events of cyberattacks exploiting vulnerabilities (at  organisational and system level) in order to assess the impact on essential and digital services. For  example, national risk assessments have taken into account scenarios of cyber terrorism, cyber incident to  network and information systems, cyberattacks on electricity services, cyber espionage and cyber activism.  Tools can support the analysis and measurement of security incidents affecting dependencies and  interdependencies. For example, the EC JRC developed the Geospatial Risk and Resilience Assessment  42 European Commission (2017). Overview of natural and man‑made disaster risks the European Union may face.  Commission Staff Working Document, SWD(2017) 176 final.  43 ENISA (2018). ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2017: 15 Top Cyber-Threats and Trends. Version 1.0, ETL 2017.

However, such types of tools/platforms are often  specialised and require specific expertise. Other tools (e.g. Zero Outage, CIPRTrainer Web Service, etc.)  may support the simulation and analysis of crisis conditions for essential services.  3.4.2 Metrics  Metrics are commonly used in quantitative risk assessment approaches to facilitate measurements  computing the likelihood of a potential risk and the severity of its impact (or consequence). Metrics used  for the evaluation and representation of (inter)dependencies can be grouped in two main categories:   Weighted Metrics: involving measurements of different variables (or indicators) providing specific risk  values (e.g. values or percentages of risks). Metrics may require data gathering resulting from  scenarios or simulations. Indicative examples of weighted metrics may include number of users  affected, geographical distribution of services, number of SLAs with third parties, performance  measures related to resilience etc.   Nominal Scales: involving assigning nominal values (i.e. qualitative category labels) associated with  different risk levels (e.g. likelihood or impact: very low, low, medium, high and very high.). Indicative  examples of nominal scale metrics may include social, economic or environmental impact, loss of  service capabilities, criticality of services in terms of security, coupling and complexity of services etc.  When analysing and measuring (inter)dependencies, it is also possible to create correspondence between  the results of weighted metrics and nominal scales, thus combining qualitative and quantitative  assessments.  Note that deciding whether to adopt either a qualitative or a quantitative approach (or a combination of  both) depends on different factors (e.g. data availability, expert involvement, etc.) that need to be  evaluated case by case. The level of awareness and maturity on the topic of (inter)dependencies is key in  this decision. In order to analyse and measure risks associated with (inter)dependencies, specific  challenges need to be addressed, in particular the lack of data - including unavailable, untrusted and  incomplete data - and lack of expertise in conducting (inter)dependencies risk assessments.  OES and DSPs rely on their own historical45 data or specific data sets coming from the industry itself (e.g.  insurance companies) to conduct such risk assessments. On the other hand, the most common sources of  information used by Member States in their NRA are historical records and databases of events, impacts  and recorded losses and damages. One additional challenge is that different organisations (both public and  private) may often own and manage proprietary databases. This may limit the data availability for  conducting risks assessments. It is necessary to support information sharing (e.g. by incentives, developing  44 https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/grrasp GRRASP consists of a distributed architecture involving open source technologies,  which bring together geospatial technologies and computational tools for the analysis and simulation of critical  infrastructures. It allows information sharing and constitutes a basis for future developments in the direction of  collaborative analysis and federated simulation. It takes into account security concerns in the information sharing  process (managing users and roles consistently). GRRASP can be deployed in separate servers and used by EU Member  States as a means to facilitate the analysis of risk and resilience in critical infrastructures. It supports analyses of critical  infrastructure disruptions at local, regional, national and international level. GRRASP follows a tiered approach – Tier 1  modules can be used for the analysis of critical infrastructures at sectoral level, Tier 2 modules for cross sector analyses  (of dependencies and interdependencies), and finally Tier 3 modules for high level economic impact of critical  infrastructure disruptions at state level.  45 It should be noted that when assessing past incidents / historical data, lack of such information or absence of  previously materialised risks should not be interpreted as reduced likelihood that a risk may occur in the future.  https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/grrasp  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  29  collaborative cultures, technologies such as sharing platforms). Data may provide evidence and  understanding of past events, their occurrences, magnitudes and even their consequences. This also  involves data about previous events that may have occurred in different Member States.  Evaluation of impact of dependencies and interdependencies  The final phase of risk assessment involves comparing the identified (inter)dependency risks with specific  (often, sectorial) criteria to determine whether risks and/or their magnitudes are acceptable or tolerable.  For example, the sectors of banking and financial market infrastructures provide another instance of  sectorial criteria and thresholds for the classification of incidents. For example, the European Banking  Authority (EBA) provides guidelines, criteria and thresholds for incident notification under the PSD2  Directive. The incident classification distinguishes only two different types of incidents: Major Incident and  Non-Major Incident. The classification dependents on thresholds of Lower Impact Level and Higher Impact  level for different criteria (i.e. transactions affected, Payment service users affected, Service downtime,  Economic impact, High level of internal escalation, Other payment service providers or relevant  infrastructures potentially affected, and Reputational impact). These examples of different evaluation  criteria for the assessment of incidents highlight the problem of defining common criteria (and thresholds)  across sectors and Member States.  Moreover, ENTSO-E has defined an incidents classification scale methodology for the electricity sector, in  particular, for transmission operators46 depicted in Figure 10.  Figure 10: ENTSO-E Incidents Classification Scale overview  National Risk Assessments highlight additional important aspects and challenges of impact evaluation. The  impact may be assessed either quantitatively (e.g. in terms of clear magnitude: number of affected  persons, monetary loss in euro, service unavailability in hours/day) or qualitatively. In the case of semi-  46 ENTSO-E (2014). Incidents Classification Scale Methodology, Working group incident classification scale under system  operations committee. European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E).  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  30  qualitative analysis, different criteria may be considered for the impact evaluation. National Risk  Assessments have adopted different impact categories and criteria47:   Human impact: usually quantified in terms of number of affected citizens.   Environmental impact: quantified or assessed qualitatively in terms of harm to natural resources.   Economic impact: usually quantified in terms of financial and material losses.   Societal impact: taking into account disruptions of daily activities and usages of essential services.   Political impact: taking into account the affected capacity to govern and control a country.  These impact criteria are in alignment with the ones that the NIS Directive identifies, including also  duration of the incident and geographical spread with regard to the area affected by the incident. The  review of National Risk Assessments highlights that impact criteria are often assessed differently. This is a  critical challenge for impact assessment in relation to (inter)dependencies across sectors and Member  States. It is necessary to provide a basic framework that can be used and tailored to different sectors and  to national contexts. The impact framework would support identifying different criteria for assessing the  impact of security incidents propagating also via (inter)dependencies.  National risk assessments  The following highlight key methodological elements related to how national risk assessments (NRAs)  address risks affecting the European Union48. The European Commission is supporting NRAs in order to  assess the exposure of Member States to different types of threats, including threats affecting the security  of network and information systems. NRAs therefore provide also insights about the exposure to cyber  threats of OES and DSPs. Figure 11 provides an account of the characteristics of NRAs.  Figure 11 Characteristics of National Risk Assessments  47 The ECI Directive 2008/114/EC also makes reference to casualties, economic and social impact of infrastructure  disruption  48 European Commission (2017): Commission Staff Working Document –  Overview of Natural and Man-made Disaster  Risks the European Union may face, SWD(2017) 176 final.  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  31   Risk selection criteria: Different criteria may be considered to identify and select the risks (threats)  defining the scope of risk assessments. Past incidents (e.g. historical data of past incidents) or expert  opinions may guide the definition of selections criteria, hence the identification and selection of risks.   Scenarios: Definition of scenarios with varying different levels of criticality should capture critical events  related to specific risks (threats). It is necessary to develop a detailed assessment programme consisting  of scenarios of different severity (e.g. from limited impact to catastrophic incidents) and complexity (e.g.  single-risk and multiple-risk scenarios) covering all identified risks.   Time horizon: It is necessary to clarify the timeframe validity of risk assessments. This is to make sure  that the developed scenarios and the risk assessments take also into account assumptions based on  emerging trends or potential constraints (e.g. technological trends, regulatory frameworks, etc.).   Methodology of analysis: Methodological approaches supporting risk analyses can provide different  types of results: qualitative, semi-qualitative and quantitative.   Management of uncertainties: It is necessary to take into account uncertainties that may undermine or  invalidate the assumptions underlying risks assessments (including assumptions shaping risk scenarios).   Links to capability assessments: The results of risk assessments should be linked to existing capabilities  or their developments mitigating risks, for example, by deploying security controls in order to reduce  the likelihood of threats, or by defining crisis management strategies or contingency plans in order to  reduce the impact of threats.

Challenges  for assessing (inter)dependencies  Integrating (inter)dependencies in the risk management process introduces a number of challenges that,  to some extent, differ between OES/DSPs and NCAs due to varying context and focus. This section  highlights the main challenges for managing (inter)dependencies these stakeholders respectively face.  Table 2 Challenges for assessing dependencies and interdependencies  CHALLENGES  OES / DSPs   Lack of data   Complexity of service supply chains   Specialised methodologies   Lack of skills   Taxonomy of incident impact assessment  NCAs   Sectorial approach   Lack of data   Complexity of scenarios   Cross border notification and coordination   Identification of operators of essential services   Auditing OES  The following sections highlight the main challenges, in particular, with identifying and modelling,  analysing and measuring, and evaluating dependencies and interdependencies.  Challenges for OES and DSPs  OES and DSPs face different challenges that limit assessing dependencies and interdependencies. Taking  also into account their roles and responsibilities (including, security requirements and incident  notifications) for assessing the potential risks associates with the security of network and information  systems, this section pinpoints and discusses such challenges.   Lack of Data. OES and DSPs face a lack of data to assess their (inter)dependencies. There are limited  incentives supporting sharing of information concerned with emerging operational  (inter)dependencies. To a certain extent, this is due to the fact that some (inter)dependencies may be  discovered only once incidents occur. OES and DSPs often gather their operational data in order to  provide their services. It is necessary to develop specific processes and mechanisms in order to share  relevant information confidentially with order OES, DSPs and other NIS actors such as NCAs.   Complexity of Service Supply Chains. Another challenge for assessing (inter)dependencies is due to  the complexity of service supply chains. Although OES and DSPs can probably identify direct  dependencies on other services, it is often difficult to identify and assess second order dependencies.  Moreover, service supply chains may also have complex dependencies in operations.   Specialised Methodologies. Developing data-driven assessment requires often combining different  specialised methodologies (including tools). These methodologies enable OES and DSPs to develop  data-driven risk assessments, heuristics and decision-making processes related to (inter)dependencies.  In order to reach the required organisational and methodological maturity, there is need for a  substantial investment to develop tailored specialised methodologies and to integrate them into  organisational practices.  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  33   Lack of Skills. OES and DSPs face the common problem of shortage of qualified personnel, who has the  required skills for applying specialised methodologies in their complex operational environments.   Taxonomy of Incident Impact Assessment. The analyses of different cyber incidents highlight that  there is a lack of common criteria for assessing and describing their impact. Most of the incident  reports focus on describing the type of attacks, the exploited vulnerabilities and some dynamics how  infections spread across network and information systems. The incident impact is often  described/assessed in aggregated terms (e.g. number of systems affected, number of countries  affected, etc.). However, there is yet little emphasis on analysing the dynamics and impact of cyber  incidents in terms of cross-sector and cross-border propagations due to (inter)dependencies among  OES and DSP.  These challenges affect all phases (i.e. Identification and Modelling, Analysis and Measurement, and  Evaluation of Impact) of assessing (inter)dependencies, but more so their identification. The lack of data  poses additional challenges in identifying and assessing cross border (inter)dependencies. The emergent  complexity of (inter)dependencies combined with the required specialised methodologies and skills may  expose OES and DSPs to further challenges in analysing, measuring and assessing the potential impact of  security incidents.  Challenges for NCAs  National Competent Authorities (NCAs) have critical roles and responsibilities in developing a coordinated  approach supporting the security of network and information systems. They are responsible for  establishing incident notification and information sharing practices supporting cooperation and  coordination among all relevant stakeholders (nationally and cross-border). NCAs need to cooperate  closely, nationally and cross-border (e.g. via the Cooperation Group and CSIRTs Network) in the  implementation of the NIS Directive. NCAs face different challenges when dealing with assessment of  (inter)dependencies: sectorial specialisation, lack of data, and complexity of the scenarios.   Sectorial Approach: The NIS Directive identifies different sectors of OES and types of DSPs. Depending  on the different transpositions of the NIS Directive and its implementations across the Member States,  some NCAs and CSIRTs may be required to develop a sectorial approach specifying different thresholds  and incident notification practices capturing the specificities of the different sectors (and subsectors)  that the NIS Directive identifies. NCAs may have limited or patchy availability of data resulting in partial  sectorial knowledge. This represents a challenge for developing a comprehensive sectorial approach  and developing a complete overview of the security of network and information systems across all  sectors. This hinders assessing emerging (inter)dependencies among all sectors. Moreover, NCAs  operate at national level, which means that they have limited security operational knowledge of the  status of OES and DSPs operating cross-border in other Member States. This implies that while NCAs  may be able to deal with the assessment of (inter)dependencies nationally, they may face additional  challenges when assessing cross-border (inter)dependencies among all sectors of OES and types of  DSPs.   Lack of Data: Deeply related to the previous challenge, NCAs often face a lack of data. Indeed, in order  to assess (inter)dependencies, they need to develop an understating of the different operational  environments of OES and DSPs. However, OES and DSPs typically consider such type of data to be  confidential. Another reason for the lack of data is that NCAs may operate at a sectorial and national  base in many cases, which limits their access only to data related to their own sector or national scope.   Complexity of Scenarios: National Risk Assessments (NRAs) provide useful insights in order to  understand the risk exposures of OES and DSPs operating nationally and cross-border. However, NCAs  taking part in NRAs, may need to deal with designing complex scenarios involving single as well as  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  34  multiple risks. Lack of data or methodologies (and tools) may constraint and limit the complexity of  scenarios in NRAs. Typically, it is difficult to create realistic scenarios that can be analysed without  historical data and knowledge of different sectors across Member States. This means that in many  cases NRAs take into account scenarios that may overlook complex emerging (inter)dependencies  among sectors. Thus, NCAs are in many cases underprepared to deal with cross border and/or cross  sector (inter)dependencies.   Cross Border Notification and Coordination: In order to deal with cross border incidents, Member  States via NCAs and CSIRTs, need to establish synergies, foster close cooperative schemes and  probably develop a common response and crisis management plan (as required by the ECI Directive  2008/114/EC on the protection of critical infrastructures and the NIS Directive). The complexity  increases as more actors (e.g. NATO, national security/defence agencies) are involved in the process of  identifying cross border threats and transboundary risks posed against cross border services. This  involves shared responsibilities among NCAs and CSIRTs operating cross border in different Member  States. Managing challenges regarding the responsibility for restoration or incident  coordination/management when establishing cooperation mechanisms/ mutual aid agreements  between different operators, which are principally competitors, is an important and complex aspect  that should be addressed by the Member States. Moreover, in case that essential services (e.g.  transmission of electricity) extend beyond the EU territory, there are various concerns and challenges  for the notification requirements of incidents that affect at least an EU Member State and a non-EU  country. Transboundary essential services across the EU Member States, are raising challenges  regarding the notification of cross border incidents, which may affect either non-essential services in a  neighbouring EU Member State or essential/non-essential services in a non-EU country. These  operational challenges concerned with cross border notification and coordination affect the  assessment of (inter)dependencies.   Identification of Cross Border Dependencies and Interdependencies: Coordination and cooperation  among Member States are essential in order to support the identification of cross border  (inter)dependencies of OES and DSPs. However, NCAs may face different challenges when identifying  cross border dependencies and interdependencies. In particular, there is lack of common terminology  at EU level for critical sectors, critical infrastructures and operators of essential services. Member  States and NCAs often use similar terms interchangeably, for example, “vital”, “essential” and “time  critical”. Member State and NCAs may seek cross border (inter)dependencies with other operators of  other sectors (e.g. telecommunications), which possibly are identified as essential at national level, but  they fall outside the scope of the NIS or ECI Directives. Member States may need to proceed further  beyond the identification of critical infrastructures sectors and move towards the identification of  operators of essential services (Article 5 of the NIS Directive) and possibly the identification of related  essential services too.   Identification of Operators of Essential Services: Member States may identify more entities (essential  service operators), e.g. heating operators, considered as essential, according to their needs (e.g.  distribution system operators for electricity). The absolute value of thresholds used for the  identification of the European Critical Infrastructures (with respect to the ECI Directive) and for the  identification of essential services operators may vary across EU Member States, due to their different  sizes. The sensitivity of the business data might affect the ability of the EU Member States to collect  cross border data from national operators.   Auditing OES: NCAs will face difficulties when auditing OES, e.g. within the context of auditing  compliance to the provisions of the NIS Directive, that has (inter)dependencies with other OES and  DSPs, particularly when the latter are based in another Member State. The challenges are not limited  to the identification of those (inter)dependencies but also to the limitations in auditing the security  conformity level of the OES/DSPs on whose services the audited OES relies.

Indicators for assessing (inter)dependencies  This section provides a mapping of the key elements for assessing (inter)dependencies to risk assessment and  audit frameworks. The mapping supports an analysis of (inter)dependencies with respect to the most relevant and  used standards and frameworks in the risk management area. In particular, this section focuses on three main  standards: ISO/IEC 27002, NIST Cybersecurity Framework and COBIT 5. These risk assessment and audit  frameworks capture different risk domains and provide specific guidelines in order to plan and implement very  detailed risk-based strategy in an organisation. A genuine benchmark between these standards provides a set of  checklists composed of tailored and comprehensive risk criteria that may be associated to indicators of  (inter)dependencies between OES and DSPs. The resulting mapping between indicators of interdependencies and  risk assessment and audit frameworks will form a meta-framework for risk assessment and audit of  interdependencies.  Mapping to risk assessment and audit frameworks  This section provides a brief overview of the risk assessment and audit frameworks taken into account in  order to provide a characterisation of the (inter)dependencies’ indicators. ISO/IEC 27002 focuses on  implementing an Information Security Management System by defining risk criteria within a specific  external context. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework dives into security by providing a methodology to  implement organisational cyber-security strategies. COBIT5 integrates other frameworks by furnishing  guidance organizing IT objectives and good practices. ISO/IEC 27002, NIST Cybersecurity Framework and  COBIT5 are interdependent in many aspects. One focus is located at the governance level when others  cover the operational as well as the management stage. The detailed mapping of the proposed indicators  to all three standards provides a framework for operators to quickly and easily use their own tailor-made  implementation of ISO/IEC 27002, NIST and/or COBIT5 for (inter)dependencies risk assessment and use  them in tandem. The risk assessments of dependencies and interdependencies require identifying different  criteria and provide guidelines for their evaluation. Annex C: provides further information about the  analysed risk assessment and audit frameworks. Annex D: presents a detailed characterisation of different  criteria in terms of mappings to ISO/IEC 27002 security controls, NIST Cybersecurity controls and COBIT5  goals (Figure 12).  Figure 12 Mappings criteria to ISO/IEC 27002, NIST cybersecurity controls, COBIT5 enterprise and IT goals.  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  36  Despite the existence of different risk assessment and audit frameworks, it is difficult to identify one that  can cover different criteria for the risk assessment of (inter)dependencies. However, it is possible to map  the identified criteria to different risk assessment and audit frameworks. Conceptually, this means  combining ICT security, cybersecurity and governance together in order to characterise indicators for  assessing the risks associated with (inter)dependencies.  Indicators  This section identifies a set of indicators that relate to (inter)dependencies and may provide useful insights  for assessing them. The identified (types of) indicators relate to the assessment of the impact of an  incident in alignment with the security requirements and incident notification of the NIS Directive. The  indicators fall into four different domains (or types of indicators):   Impact: the impact indicators relate to information that is concerned with the potential impact of  incidents affecting the security of network and information systems.   Reliability, Dependability and Resilience: the reliability, dependability and resilience indicators relate  to information that is concerned with the potential impact of incidents on operations of affected  essential or digital services.   Structure: the structure indicators relate to information that is concerned with structural aspects of  essential and digital services (e.g. market structures and redundancy of services).   Time: the time indicators relate to information that is concerned with dynamics (including evolution  of) and timing aspects (e.g. seasonality of demand) of essential services and digital services.  Table 3 lists and describes the identified indicators of (inter)dependencies.  Table 3 Indicators of Dependencies and Interdependencies  ID INDICATOR DESCRIPTION  Indicators for Domain IMPACT  IND01 The number of serviced users (potentially affected by  an incident)49  The number of users of OES or DSPs may give preliminary  indications of the potential risks associated with dependencies and  interdependencies  IND02 Geographical distribution of services (e.g. cross border  services potentially affected by an incident)  The geographical distributions of dependent and interdependent  OES and DSPs may give preliminary indications of the potential risks  IND03 Social impact The social impact should also take into account the potential impact  of dependent and interdependent OES and DSPs on societal  activities  IND04 Economic Impact The economic impact should also take into account the potential  impact of dependent and interdependent OES and DSPs on  economic activities  IND05 Environmental impact The environmental impact should also take into account the  potential impact of dependent and interdependent OES and DSPs  on the environment  49 The number of users should reflect any abstractions encountered in practice; for instance, an airport might be a  single user for an OES or DSP but counting as one user would be an incorrect indicator of impact.

in  part due to their applicability in most if not all sectors and contexts. However, the framework can be  further expanded to address sectorial specificities or operational priorities by including mappings to other  relevant standards. One example of this is the ISA/IEC 6244350 family of standards, which covers Industrial  Automation and Control Systems Security and is very relevant to sectors that rely on Operational  Technology (OT) as well as IT.

Good Practices for (inter)dependencies  This chapter presents good practices to support stakeholders in assessing (inter)dependencies. These good  practices provide a pragmatic approach to assist OES and DSPs on the one hand and NCAs on the other  hand, taking into account their respective roles and responsibilities in the implementation of the NIS  Directive, with particular emphasis on the assessment of (inter)dependencies  Table 6 Good practices for assessing dependencies and interdependencies  GOOD PRACTICES  OES / DSPs   Operational accounts of dependencies and  interdependencies   Training and awareness   Methodologies and Tools  NCAs   Information sharing   Methodologies and tools   Cyber security intelligence  Good practices for OES and DSPs  OES and DSPs can take pragmatic actions enabling the assessment of (inter)dependencies including:   Operational accounts of (inter)dependencies: At the operational level, OES and DSPs need to develop  an account of their (inter)dependencies. This will require investing in operational, analytical and data- driven (or event-driven) capabilities (e.g. monitoring systems, incident notification practices, etc.)  supporting the identification and analysis of emerging (inter)dependencies in their operations. This  approach addresses, to a certain extent, the lack of data and enables OES and DSPs to further  understand their (inter)dependencies, while enhancing their overall resilience in dealing with security  incidents related to cyber (inter)dependencies After identifying these (inter)dependencies OES and  DSPs should examine whether existing plans for security or for business continuity take them into  account and update these plans accordingly.   Training and Awareness: In order to understand (inter)dependencies, it is necessary to develop a  comprehensive understanding of different operational aspects of OES and DSPs. Moreover, it is  necessary to link policy and regulatory frameworks with environments and operations of OES and  DSPs. This may require specialised skills combining, for example, policy analyses, analytics, risk  assessments, cyber security and so on, including skills concerned with the applications of  methodologies in specific contexts and situations (e.g. incident scenarios). Tailored training and  awareness programmes support developing the skills and practices required in the assessment of  (inter)dependencies.   Methodologies and Tools: OES and DSPs present different (inter)dependencies in their operations.  Although it is challenging to identity generic methodologies and tools that fit all different operational  environments, OES and DSPs would benefit from tailoring and integrating diverse methodologies and  tools that provide support for assessing dependencies and interdependencies.  These recommendations intend to support OES and DSPs in developing and integrating practices for  assessing dependencies and interdependencies. In particular, it is advisable to develop, tailor and integrate  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  42  practices supporting all phases (i.e. Identification and Modelling, Analysis and Measurement, and Impact  Evaluation).  Good practices for NCAs  Due to their roles and responsibilities, NCAs are in a good position to implement practices supporting the  assessment of (inter)dependencies, in particular their cross border identification.   Information Sharing: In order to create cross-sectoral and cross-border approaches, it essential to  support the collaboration and information sharing among NCAs. On the one hand, NCAs may support  ad-hoc collaborations and information sharing in order to support national risk assessment exercises  and to assessing particular cross border dependencies and interdependencies. Working groups under  the leadership of NCAs can also be established. These groups should agree on the kind of data to be  shared and the NCAs could take the burden of performing simulation since they are in a position to  have a better view of the whole system of infrastructures. On the other hand, EU-wide initiatives  (potentially driven by centralised authorities) should encourage and enable the exchange of  information among NCAs and CSIRTs during their operations in order to support the identification and  assessment of emergent cross border (inter)dependencies.   Methodologies and Tools: NCAs have patchy knowledge of cross sector and cross border  (inter)dependencies. The enforcement of the NIS Directive’s security requirements and incident  notification for OES and DSP will better position designated NCAs to identify and assess emergent  (inter)dependencies in operations. This may require them to develop and integrate tailored  methodologies and tools, which would help NCAs in developing a comprehensive account, reflecting  the emergent complexity in operations, of (inter)dependencies. Even if a sophisticated tool or method  is missing, a first step would be to make a workshop or exercise with key representatives of sectors in  order to perform an initial, simplified mapping of dependencies. It is necessary to develop additional  capabilities enabling the assessment of (inter)dependencies. In order to develop and disseminate best  practices (including the experiences of adopting methodologies and tools in specific contexts), the  roles and responsibilities of the Cooperation Group and the CSIRTs Network are essential.   Cyber Security Intelligence: NCAs and CSIRTs can engage constructively with OES and DSPs in order to  guide them in gathering the necessary information (e.g. records of past incidents affecting essential  services) for assessing (inter)dependencies. Moreover, NCAs and CSIRTs may have a convenient  position and active role in sharing critical knowledge about (ongoing) incidents. This would help NCAs  supporting the definition of reaction and mitigation measures, and their cross border adoption by OES  and DSPs. This means supporting a bidirectional information sharing among NCAs, CSIRTs, OES and  DSPs, hence supporting the gathering and dissemination of cyber security intelligence. This also would  encourage OES and DSPs to go beyond mandatory incident notification and to support voluntary  notification in order to enhance the assessment of (inter)dependencies. Cyber security intelligence  would enable NCAs, CSIRTs, OES and DSPs to further develop their technological (e.g. including data  analytics) and organisational structures required for assessing emergent cross sector and cross border  (inter)dependencies.  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  43  7. Conclusions and Recommendations  This report has investigated good practices on (inter)dependencies between OES and DSPs, specifically  how OES and DSPs can identify and assess the potential risks associated with emerging  (inter)dependencies. Taking into account diverse contributions (e.g. literature reviews, interviews with  experts, online surveys), this report also provides a detailed account of the landscape of  (inter)dependencies between OES and DSPs. Moreover, it provides a comprehensive overview of risk  assessment practices, including methodologies that Member States adopted in National Risk Assessments  (NRAs).   Dependencies and Interdependencies. The review of relevant literature and experts’ opinions provide  insights for defining the concepts of dependencies and interdependencies. This report provides  definitions tailored to the analysis of dependencies and interdependencies among OES and DSPs. Such  definitions enable analysing emerging (in particular, cyber) (inter)dependencies across all sectors of  the NIS Directive. Moreover, this report discusses dependencies of OES to DSPs in order to emphasise  emerging digital dependencies across sectors. Overall, this report provides an account that clarifies the  concepts of dependencies and interdependencies of OES and DSPs.   Assessing Dependencies and Interdependencies. Current industry practices highlight key phases –  Identification and Modelling, Analysis and Measurement, and Evaluation of Impact – forming a  systematic process for dependency and interdependency assessment. These phases involve diverse  methodologies and approaches, which allow investigating (inter)dependencies in order to assess their  potential impact on OES and DSPs. Member States and other authorities (e.g. the EC Joint Research  Centre) have adopted similar processes involving specific methodologies for conducting National Risk  Assessments (NRAs). NCAs, OES and DSPs, who may be involved in or conduct related assessments,  have to face various challenges due to the lack of operational data, the complexity of emerging  dependencies and the specificity of methodologies.   Good Practices for Dependencies and Interdependencies. Based on the characterisation of  (inter)dependencies and the review of risk assessment practices, this report discusses challenges and  provides good practices for their assessment. OES, DSPs and NCAs may benefit from the analysis of  such challenges and good practices.  In order to address the challenges that OES, DSPs and NCAs face in the assessment of (inter)dependencies,  this report provides the following recommendations:   OES and DSPs should conduct empirical investigations to collect data: The lack of data represents a  common challenge for assessing (inter)dependencies. Future initiatives should support information  sharing in order to conduct empirical investigations of emerging (inter)dependencies in the operations  of OES and DSPs.   OES, DSPs and NCAs should develop and integrate methodologies and tools: Risk assessment  practices highlight specific phases (i.e. Identification and Modelling, Analysis and Measurement, and  Impact Evaluation) for assessing (inter)interdependencies. Future initiatives should investigate further  how specific methodologies and tools support each phase. In particular, they should provide guidance  how to integrate methodologies and tools in practices across sectors. This also would help tailoring  methodologies and tools to the needs of OES, DSPs and NCAs.   OES and DSPs should promote training and awareness: Another common challenge is due to the need  of specialised expertise in order to assess emerging (inter)dependencies. Future initiatives should  support developing competencies for applying different methodologies and tools in specific  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  44  operational contexts. This also would support further understanding (inter)dependencies among OES  and DSPs.   NCAs should work towards developing a common taxonomy of incident impact assessment: In order  to support the assessment of cross-sector and cross-border incidents, it is necessary to develop a  common taxonomy of incident impact assessment. The implementation of the NIS Directive can  provide a good starting point for providing some harmonisation (e.g. by developing incident  notification mechanisms tailored to the NIS Directive and supporting information sharing across  relevant stakeholders such as OES, DSP, CSIRTs and NCAs).   OES and DSPs should address (inter)dependencies at operational level: OES and DSPs should  integrate (inter)dependencies in their risk assessment and security operations and this should be  reflected in the development of tools, methodologies, skills and the way incidents are presented,  reported and analysed.   NCAs should facilitate information sharing: At a national level, NCAs should facilitate information  exchange about (inter)dependencies, including direct dialogue between (inter)dependent  organisations. At cross-border level, Member States should promote a framework for the exchange of  information regarding cross-border (inter)dependencies that establishes how information exchange  can take place and what type of information is relevant.   OES, DSPs and NCAs should invest on resilience: Boost resilience by developing response  management capabilities and establishing common response and crisis management plans. Member  States should invest on the resilience by addressing redundancy (the availability of alternatives),  diversity of technical implementations and time for recovery.   NCAs should integrate cross-border (inter)dependencies in NRAs: Member States should address  cross-border (inter)dependencies when conducting NRAs by identifying services which create such  dependencies. Identification should be based on a granular process, all relevant parties should be  identified and a national registry of cross-border dependencies should be developed and maintained.

Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  48  Annex B: Research on (inter)dependencies risk assessment methods  Empirical approaches  These approaches involve the use of statistical data as well as expert opinions in order to identify and  capture dependencies and interdependencies. There are different possibilities in order to take an historical  account, such as qualitative approaches based on databases, quantitative approaches (e.g. metrics) for  probabilistic risk assessment and regression analysis for analysing relationships (e.g. emerging  correlations).  Studies with databases involve the analysis of patterns of a given phenomenon, which may be the  interdependence of the infrastructures suggested in failures of some of them, according to information  collected in publications officers, or in the media, in expert surveys, or in other relevant sources. This kind  of work can be useful for characterizing the phenomena and compare their consequences52.  The quantitative metrics are ways of quantifying the interdependence. In this sense, it is common to use  simple ratios to show the direction of faults in infrastructure. For instance, the interaction ration to  measure interdependence relates to the number of times when the problem of one infrastructure affects  another. Researchers have proposed a duration ratio of failure in the service of an infrastructure, on the  duration of the failure in another, with the objective of analysing the direction of the cascade effect that  occurs from a particular failure53. Other authors have used the Pearson's correlation coefficient as the  metric to quantify the intensity of interdependence54.  Probabilistic risk assessments can be used together with decision analysis approaches, incorporating  different groups of interest, to build scenarios that provide information on interdependencies potential55.  An initial event generates a scenario that in turn generates others according to existing interdependencies.  The probabilistic risk assessments include the statistical analysis of historical events, bibliographic review  and inputs of the different interest groups. This focuses on studying the severity and probability of the  event, according to the parameters previously stipulated, considering historical databases. Finally, it is  important to note that methods, such as the probabilistic risk approach, are used to the extent that there  is a lack of sufficient information to apply econometric methodologies. When there is more data that can  be used, for example, some authors have worked with time series to evaluate the interdependencies. They  52 McDaniels, T.; Chang, S.; Peterson, K.; Mikawoz, J.; Reed, D. (2007): Empirical framework for characterizing  infrastructure failure interdependencies.

Very similarly,  other authors have proposed the use of Statistical Learning Theory (STL) in case of sufficient information57.  Agent based approaches  Agent-based models are computational models that allow the simulation of actions and interactions of  autonomous individuals within an environment, and allow to determine what effects they produce in the  system as a whole. An agent-based model adopts a bottom-up approach to analyse the complex  architecture and adaptive behaviours of the components of infrastructure systems. Agent-based  approaches have the capability to model down to the level of a single component of an infrastructure  system as well as the behaviour of a decision-maker. Through discrete-event simulations, such methods  can capture all kinds of the interdependencies among infrastructure systems58. One of the major  advantages of using agent-based methods is that they can provide flexible scenario-based what-if analyses  assessing the effectiveness of different strategies. They can also be integrated with other modelling  techniques to provide a detailed analysis. Our research suggests that agent-based methods can be applied  to a range of decision contexts involving a host of stakeholder concerns. However, agent-based  approaches present some challenges. The modeller needs to make some strong assumptions about the  behaviour of an agent, and, in some cases, such assumptions are hard to justify. In order to properly  calibrate the parameters of a simulation model, agent-based methods require a large set of detailed data  about infrastructure systems and agent behaviour; it is sometimes difficult to collect such detailed  information on infrastructure performance particularly when the relevant infrastructures have data  sensitive to public safety and/or stakeholder interests. Considering this context, it is possible to develop  models that include networks of agents of different classes (firms, households) with particular emphasis on  how they use the particular infrastructures, and how these agents and infrastructures respond to  hypothetical faults. For its development, economic and infrastructure in standardized databases, to then  create the simulations during normal conditions and disruptive events59.  System dynamics based approaches  Models based on system dynamics are another technique of modelling complex systems. The  conceptualisation is based on the feedback, or circular causality between observable variables. Because of  its structure, it is possible to represent these models using traditional mathematical language, with a set of  algebraic equations whose variables are properties of the modelled system. The problem lies in identifying  the causal links. Circuits, stocks and feedback flows must be differentiated. Circuits are the connections or  directions of the effects and stocks are the amounts in the system, whose levels are given by the flows  56 Dueñas-Osorio et al.

With this kind of models, it is possible to analyse the consequences of a failure of a  sector / infrastructure in others and in the economy in general60.  The product input matrix describes the equilibrium behaviour of regional and national economies. It is a  useful tool to describe the interactive nature between different systems of the economy and can obviously  be used for analysing the interdependencies in infrastructure. In practice, this model aims to use  information of input product of national accounts to estimate the impact of failures of an infrastructure in  another and study the spread of that impact. A further step consists of having computable general  equilibrium models61, and even having spatial equilibrium models computable in general62. Research  provides also instances of system-based models for capturing dependencies in critical infrastructures63.  Economic theory based approaches  There are different models that take into account economic indicators in order to assess various aspects of  services. For example, utility theory provides a modelling approach for assessing alternative choices and  supporting decision making. Utility theory modes services and their properties by functions (i.e. the utility  functions) in order to assess the results according to assumed behaviours (e.g. consumer behaviour,  service demand, etc.). The objective is often to maximise the utility function assuming that it corresponds  to best choice (that is, the highest utility satisfaction).  The input-output model provides another approach for assessing various economic indicators from a  functional viewpoint. In particular, rather than assessing individual services, the input-output model  provides a quantitative economic approach for capturing and assessing interdependencies between  different branches of a national economy or different regional economies. The input-output model is also  useful for assessing the risks associated with interdependencies of critical activities (including essential  services) across Member States. For example, the JRC has adopted the input-output model for conducting  a national risk assessment64. The reported risk assessment involved evaluating emerging  interdependencies among critical sectors (e.g. electricity, telecom, water supply and distribution, road  transport, etc.) in different disruptive scenarios (e.g. blackout, gas leak, earthquake and explosion).  Network based approaches  In network-based models, infrastructures are modelled as networks, composed of nodes and arcs, with  goods flowing between them (represented by flows). In these models, the services are desired levels of the  60 Bush, B., Dauelsberg, L., Leclaire, R., Powell, D., Deland, S., and Samsa, M.

Network based approaches are usually divided into those whose objective is a  structural analysis and those who are intended to perform a functional analysis. The former analyse the  design of the infrastructure and the relationship between designs, and the latter consider operational  issues. This class of models is useful to analyse how critical a certain location is, in case of a certain failure,  and perform vulnerability analysis. It is also possible to create a link with the use of geographic information  data65.  Infrastructure systems can be represented by networks, where nodes or vertices represent different  components of a system and links or edges represent relationships among them. Network based  approaches can analyse interdependencies through different analytical techniques. Through network  based approaches, intuitive representations of critical infrastructures are possible by providing the  detailed descriptions of their structures and flow patterns. In these approaches, individual component  failures of a single infrastructure under a disruption can be modelled and the performance response of the  infrastructure system can be analysed. Network based approaches can be divided into two groups: (a)  topology based approaches, and (b) flow based approaches.  These modelling and simulation based approaches can be used for vulnerability assessment of large scale  data sets of infrastructure systems. However, such approaches are limited since they ignore the functional  relationships among the different elements of the network missing vital information about infrastructure  performance. Flow-based methods, on the other hand, can capture the flow characteristics of  interdependent infrastructures, and provide more realistic descriptions on their operation mechanisms.  However, these approaches are not scalable since when the network is modelled in detail the  computational cost to analyse it is very high.  Service based approaches  Service based approaches capture interdependencies on the basis of exchange of services between  infrastructures of the same or different sector. For example, transport infrastructure depends on services  from electricity infrastructure and if the amount of provided service falls below a certain threshold then  the disruption propagates to the dependent infrastructure. This enables the development of a sector  agnostic analysis framework which can be applied without entering into the details of the underlying  physics and flow models. The amount of a service disruption for a given scenario can be provided by other  more detailed models (i.e. flow models) or from expert judgement.  Comparative analysis of different approaches  The aforementioned methodologies based on five criteria: amount of data needed, accessibility of data,  types of (inter)dependencies surveyed, computational cost and maturity of investigations. Regarding  data, most methodologies are intensive in the use of information, though the ones with a structural  approach require the least amount of data. At the other extreme, there are the simulation-based models.  Regarding the type of interdependencies studied, the models that have a broader scope are those based  on the product input matrix, since consider the geographical and logical interdependencies. The rest, in  most of their variants, limit their study to the four different types of dependencies (i.e. physical, cyber,  geographic and logical). In terms of computational cost and complexity, those less intensive in this regard  are the empirical approaches in general, in the same way that the approach that uses the product input  65 Ouyang, M.; Dueñas-Osorio, L.

Agent-based models and  Network-based, flow-based models are the more cost intensive approaches. It is important to point out  here that there is a proposal to unify and consolidate current research on analysis of interdependencies  based on a five dimensional framework66: system analysis, behaviour analysis, knowledge discovery,  visualisation and information sharing. These methodologies support the identification and modelling of  dependencies and interdependencies in order to assess the associated risks67.  66 Bagheri, E., Ghorbani, A. A.

These standards have been chosen because look at  three different areas particularly affected by dependencies and interdependencies. Indeed, as shown in  Figure 13 COBIT5 deals with Enterprise and IT goals; ISO/IEC 27002 deals with ICT Security Controls and  finally; the NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides a substrate of cybersecurity controls that bring the  other two standards together.  Figure 13 Intersections between ISO/IEC 27002, NIST Cybersecurity Framework and COBIT5  C.1 COBIT5  COBIT stands for ‘Control Objectives for Information and related Technology’. Its fifth and latest version was  launched in April 2012. The mission of COBIT is “to research, develop, publish and promote a set of control  objectives generally accepted for information technologies that are authorized (given by someone with authority),  updated, and international for the day-to-day use of business managers (also managers) and auditors”. This means  that not only managers and auditors, but also general users, can benefit from the development. Indeed, COBIT5  can help them to understand their Information Systems (or information technologies) and decide the level of  security and control that is necessary to protect the assets of their companies through the development of a  model of administration of information technologies. These are the elements of COBIT5:   Framework: COBIT5 Organizes IT governance objectives and good practices by IT domains and processes  and links them to business requirements.   Process Model: COBIT5 is a reference process model and common language for everyone in an  organization. The processes map to responsibility areas of plan, build, run, and monitor.   Maturity model: COBIT5 assesses maturity and capability per process and helps to address gaps.   Controls: COBIT5 provides a complete set of high-level controls to be considered for the effective  management of each IT process.  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  54   Guidelines: COBIT5 helps assign responsibility, agree on objectives, measure performance, and illustrate  interrelationship with other processes.  COBIT5 defines a set of generic processes for the management of IT. Each process is formulated based on  process inputs and outputs, key process-activities, process objectives, performance measures and an  elementary maturity model. The framework also provides a set of recommended best practices for  governance and control process of information systems and technology with the essence of aligning IT  with business. In this regard, the business orientation of COBIT5 consists of linking IT goals to the general  business goals of the stakeholders, identifying the associated responsibilities of business and IT process  owners and providing metrics and maturity models to measure their achievement.  C.2 ISO/IEC 27000/1/2 Standards  ISO/IEC put in place an Information Security Management System family of standards in order to tackle  constantly evolving information security issues faced by organizations. The series provides specific controls  and recommendations in order to manage adequately security risks. The series is deliberately broad in  scope, covering more than just privacy, confidentiality and IT/technical/cybersecurity issues. It is applicable  to organizations of all shapes and sizes. All organizations are encouraged to assess their information risks,  then treat them according to their needs, using the guidance and suggestions where relevant. Given the  dynamic nature of information risk and security, the ISMS concept incorporates continuous feedback and  improvement activities to respond to changes in the threats, vulnerabilities or impacts of incidents.  In the family, particularly relevant for the purposes of this study is ISO/IEC 27002, Code of practice for  information security controls. The latter is essentially a detailed catalogue of information security controls  that might be managed through Information Security Management Systems. It provides best practice  recommendations on information security controls for use by those responsible for initiating,  implementing or maintaining ISMS. Information security is defined within the standard in the context of  the Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability triad.  C.3 NIST Cybersecurity Framework  The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is US Government guidance for private sector organizations that own,  operate, or supply critical infrastructure. It provides a reasonable base level of cyber security. It establishes  basic processes and essential controls for cybersecurity. It is designed for individual businesses and other  organizations to use to assess risks they face.  The framework is composed of three main components “Core”, “Profile” and “Tiers”. The “Framework  Core” contains an array of activities, outcomes and references about aspects and approaches to cyber  security. The “Framework Implementation Tiers” are used by an organization to clarify for itself and its  partners how it views cybersecurity risk and the degree of sophistication of its management approach. A  “Framework Profile” is a list of outcomes that an organization has chosen from the categories and  subcategories, based on its needs and risk assessments.  An organization typically starts by using the framework to develop a “Current Profile” which describes its  cybersecurity activities and what outcomes it is achieving. It can then develop a “Target Profile”, or adopt a  baseline profile tailored to its sector (e.g. infrastructure industry) or type of organization. It can then define  steps switch from its current profile to its target profile.

The directive was created with the objective of boosting  the overall level of cybersecurity in the European Union. It does so by increasing the cybersecurity  capabilities in the Member States, by enhancing cooperation on cybersecurity among the Member States,  and by requiring Operators of Essential Services (OES) and Digital Services Providers (DSPs) to manage their  risks. In relation to the latter, an important element of the risk to be assessed is the one of the  dependencies of the services offered on other services of either OES or DSPs. These dependencies might  be of either national or cross-border nature.  A glance at the interdependency landscape reveals a number of emerging interdependencies between  OES/DSPs at both system and service level. There is an increasing number of cybersecurity incidents that,  due to these interdependencies, either propagated across organisations, often across borders, or had a  cascading effect at the level of essential services.  Yet, despite the clear need to address interdependencies as part of their overall cybersecurity risk  management, organisations and National Competent Authorities (NCAs) face difficulties due to the  lack of suitable methods, tools, available data and expertise.  In order for OES, DSPs and National Competent Authorities (NCAs) to effectively identify and assess  interdependencies, a framework based on a 4-phase approach appears to be a suitable way forward.  Existing methods, tools and good practices for interdependencies can easily be mapped to these 4 phases  based on the respective individual or sectorial specificities and needs. The development of indicators for  the interdependencies' assessment, which are mapped to well-known and widely used industry standards  and frameworks would also constitute a practical approach.  This report includes a set of recommendations for OES, DSPs and NCAs to effectively address  interdependencies in their risk assessments, including:   OES and DSPs should conduct empirical investigations to collect data   OES, DSPs and NCAs should develop and integrate methodologies and tools   OES and DSPs should develop expertise via awareness and training   NCAs should work towards developing a common taxonomy of incident impact assessment   OES and DSPs should address interdependencies at operational level   NCAs should facilitate information sharing.  1 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  07  1. Introduction  The European Commission has adopted a series of measures to enhance Europe's capabilities addressing the  increasing risks of cyber attacks and incidents in terms of frequency of occurrence and severity of impact. These  measures aim at making the online environment more trustworthy and therefore supporting the functioning of the  European Union’s Digital Single Market2. Among such measures, the European Parliament and the Council reached  an agreement about the Directive3 on the security of network and information Systems (NIS Directive). The NIS  Directive represents the first step of an EU-wide strategy and legislation on cybersecurity. This report is part of a  series of ENISA activities supporting the implementation of the NIS Directive.  Scope and objectives  This study is concerned with dependencies and interdependencies among Operators of Essential Services  (OES) and Digital Service Providers (DSPs) as defined in the NIS Directive and addresses emerging  dependencies and interdependencies across sectors. Figure 1 depicts different dependencies and  interdependencies within the scope of this report as the result of combined dependencies:  Figure 1 Dependencies (and Interdependencies) among OES and DSPs  The main objectives of the study are:  1. To provide a description of interdependencies among OES and DSP  2. To highlight risk assessment practices for the evaluation of the potential impact of interdependencies  3. To propose a framework for assessing interdependencies  4. To define good practices for assessing interdependencies.  2 European Commission (2015): A Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe, COM/2015/0192.  3 European Parliament and the Council (2016): Directive (EU) 2016/1148 concerning measures for a high common level  of security of network and information systems across the Union.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj  http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  08  These objectives would support relevant NIS stakeholders, in particular OES, DSP and National Competent  Authorities (NCAs) with addressing the risks associated with emerging dependencies and interdependencies.  Analysing emerging dependencies and interdependencies would also support decision makers in defining  mitigation measures reducing risks, thus enhancing the security of network and information systems.  Definitions  Guidelines concerning the security and resilience of critical infrastructures4 provide definitions for  dependency as “the one-directional reliance of an asset, system, network, or collection thereof—within or  across sectors—on an input, interaction, or other requirement from other sources in order to function  properly” –  and for interdependency as “mutually reliant relationship between entities (objects,  individuals, or groups); the degree of interdependency does not need to be equal in both directions”.  Taking into consideration the scope of this report, these definitions emphasise the directional aspects of  dependency and interdependency and highlight the directional relationships between services (OES and  DSPs), rather than simply on the underlying infrastructures. This characterisation is necessary in order to  take into account subtle interactions among services in operations and simultaneously aligns with the  definitions provided by the NIS Directive:  Dependency: A linkage or connection between two services (or underlying infrastructures), through  which the state of one service (infrastructure) influences or is correlated to the state of the other  Interdependency: A bidirectional relationship between two services (or underlying infrastructures)  through which the state of each service (infrastructure) influences or is correlated to the state of the  other. More generally, two services (infrastructures) are interdependent when each is dependent on the  other.  Nevertheless there are additional characteristics highlighting the nature of (inter)dependencies and their  potential impact on services, classifying the relationships (and the related impact on services) into cross- border, cross-sectorial, spatial and functional interconnectedness and dependency5.   Cross-border (inter)dependencies refers to services’ (inter)dependencies between OES themselves,  between DSPs themselves, and between OES and DSPs operating in two or more different Member  States.   Cross-sector (inter)dependencies refers to services’ (inter)dependencies between OES, between DSPs,  and between OES and DSPs operating in different sectors (without excluding the case of OES and DSPs  stationed in different Member States).   Functional interconnectedness refers to a situation in which an infrastructure is necessary for the  operations of another infrastructure.   Spatial interconnectedness refers to a situation where two infrastructures are in close proximity to  each other.  There are also cases with both types of interconnectedness. Three factors influence the results of these  (inter)dependencies:  4 US Department of Homeland Security (2013): National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP): Partnering for Critical  Infrastructure Security and Resilience.  5 Zimmerman, R. (2001): Social implications of infrastructure network interactions. Journal of Urban Technology  8(3):97–119. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/106307301753430764  https://doi.org/10.1080/106307301753430764  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  09   Interconnectedness and coupling (which affect how failures propagate through systems);   Redundancy (affecting alternative ways of restoring systems);   System knowledge (for example, which enables identification of threats).  How incidents propagate through (inter)dependencies of services can be described in four different  classes: Physical, Cyber, Geographic and Logical6 7. Figure 2 provides the graphical representation of these  classes of (inter)dependencies among OES and DSPs.  Figure 2 Classes of dependencies and interdependencies among OES and DSPs   Physical: A service (or an infrastructure) is physically dependent if the state of its operations is  dependent on the material output(s) of another service (infrastructure) through a functional and  structural linkage between the inputs and outputs of two assets.   Cyber: A service (or an infrastructure) is cyber dependent if its state of operation depends on  information and data transmitted through the information service (infrastructure) via electronic or  informational links.   Geographic: A service (or infrastructure) is geographically dependent if a local environmental event  can create changes in the state of operations in all of them. A geographic dependency occurs when  elements of service (infrastructure) assets are in close spatial proximity (e.g. a joint utility right-of- way).   Logical: A service (or an infrastructure) is logically dependent if its state of operations depends on the  state of another infrastructure via a mechanism that is not a physical, cyber, or geographic connection.  Logical dependency is attributable to human decisions and actions and is not the result of physical or  cyber processes; for instance, demand for services may shift from an infrastructure that does not  function properly to another infrastructure that provides similar services.  This formulation suggests that (inter)dependencies transcend individual infrastructure sectors. As such,  they vary in scale and complexity, ranging from local linkages to international linkages. Their differences  create a variety of spatial, temporal, and system complexities that are difficult to identify, represent and  analyse. Therefore, based on the impact of dependencies and interdependencies, infrastructure  (inter)dependencies classified in three general categories:   Cascading failure: how disruption in one infrastructure causes a disruption in the second   Escalating failure: how a disruption in one infrastructure exacerbates an independent disruption of a  second   Common cause failure: disruptions of two or more infrastructures is due to a common cause.

Dependencies and Interdependencies  Examples of cyber incidents with a cross-sector or cross-border impact  Recent cyber incidents (e.g. WannaCry, Petya, NotPetya, Stuxnet, etc.) provide instances of the potential  impact on different sectors and countries. Table 1 provides a schematic analysis of the impact of different  recent cyber incidents. It highlights the type of threat, the affected sectors, users, countries and systems8.

Moreover, it reports the impact of incidents based on reports that may rely on partial and  incomplete analyses. It is often difficult to have final accurate assessments due to the different reporting channels that  highlight partial assessments.  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  12   WannaCry (Ransomware) – Incident description: WannaCry was a global (worldwide) ransomware  cryptoworm cyber attack, which targeted computers running Microsoft Windows operating system. It  encrypted data and demanded ransom payments in Bitcoin cryptocurrency; Impact: The ransomware  campaign caused chaos due to its massive distribution, affecting more than 150 countries and infecting  over 230.000 systems. The economic impact of the WannaCry incident is estimated in the order of  hundreds of million euros with some cyber risk modelling analysts placing the losses in the order of  billions9. Insights: The attack started just before the weekend (on Friday). This made it very difficult for  companies and organisations to quickly react and resolve the crisis. Although security patches were  available, most systems still had unpatched vulnerabilities. The attack presented an increasing  complexity (in terms of speed of spreading and sophistication).   NotPetya (Malware) – Incident description: A fake Ukrainian tax software update (in June 2017)  spread laterally through infected networks like a worm, using attack vectors Supply Chain ME.doc and  the EternalBlue and EternalRomance exploits; Impact: NotPetya, a variant of the older Petya attack,  charged $300 in ransom from victims in more than 100 countries; NotPetya had significant economic  impact for a number of companies whose estimated losses in revenue alone are estimated at over 800  million euros10. Insights: Although the attack channel may be similar to other cyber attacks, NotPetya  seemed targeting specifically Ukranian government and organisations – suggesting the involvement of  organised crime or coordinated hacker groups (e.g. State-sponsored attacks).   SamSam (Ransomware) – Incident description: SamSam ransomeware attacks affected different  organisations across sectors, the ransomware encrypts data and demand a huge ransom payment in  Bitcoin in exchange for the decryption keys.; Impact: SamSam has attacked different large  organisations across sectors, including Transport (e.g. COSCO attack) and Health; SamSam has earned  its creator(s) more than 5 million euros since late 2015, a figure that does not take into account  revenue losses and system restore costs11. Insights: Differently from other ransomware attacks,  SamSam targets specific organisations’ infrastructures rather than spreading accidentally over the  Internet.  Figure 3 depicts one example of how cross sector and cross border propagation of incidents may occur.

The incidents’ review points out the  complexity of different types of attacks and their potential impact cross sector and cross border.  This also suggests that risk assessments need to take into account realistic scenarios in order to provide  insights on emerging dependencies and interdependencies.  Landscape of cyber (inter)dependencies  In this section, the landscape of cyber (inter)dependencies among different sectors and types of OES and  DSPs, as well as potentially sectors beyond the scope of the NIS Directive (e.g. telco or mobile  communications) is identified. Taking into account relevant studies in Critical Infrastructure Protection  (CIP) 13, the resulting landscape reveals a complexity of the relationships14 across sectors and their related  services. Any disruption on their operations may affect the cyber-security of these sectors and have either  a cross-sector (or even a cross-border) impact on the provided services. However, the examples (as  presented in the following sub-sections) acknowledge cross-sector (inter)dependencies as sources of  vulnerabilities and often point out mutual functional relationships among almost all sectors of critical  infrastructures (although in general terms).  The semantics of these cyber security incidents/attacks also suggest that the energy and  telecommunication sectors often drive cascade effects of critical infrastructure failures, whereas, other  sectors rather are victims of emerging dependencies and interdependencies15.  Due to the digitalisation of services, all major sectors16  have an increasing level of cyber  (inter)dependencies on digital infrastructures and DSPs. By analysing current and best practices within  different industrial sectors in the ways OES adopt the digital services, the identified key  (inter)dependencies of OES on DSPs as confirmed by means of interviews17 with involved stakeholders  (representatives of OES and DSPs) are highlighted in Figure 4. It should be clarified that these are the  identified (inter)dependencies and the list should not be considered exhaustive.  The variation among the degrees of dependencies (i.e. low, medium, high) is defined by using the  qualitative information as collected from the professional opinion of interviewed experts while taking into  consideration the cross-sector factor, as follows:   LOW = the OES capability to successfully carry out core mission/business functions has a limited  dependency on a DSP (for operational, security, risk management, compliance purposes)   MEDIUM = the OES capability to successfully carry out its core mission/business functions has an average  dependency on a DSP (for operational, security, risk management, compliance purposes)  12 EUROPOL (2018): Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA), European Cybercrime Centre (EC3).  13 European Commission, Commission Staff Working Document on a New Approach to the European Programme for  Critical Infrastructure Protection: Making European Critical Infrastructures more secure, 28.8.2013, SWD(2013) 318  final.  14 Note that there are not only complex relationships across sectors, but also within sectors. For example, charging  service providers and producers of invertors for solar panels (who offer internet access to production figures) control  large amounts of power and cyber incidents might affect the stability of grid operators' stability.  15 European Commission, Commission Staff Working Document on the Review of the European Programme for Critical  Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP), 22.6.2012, SWD(2012) 190 final.  16 Without excluding the telecom operators (although the NIS Directive does not directly cover them).  17 note that not all categories of OES use or are depending, to the same extent, on the services provided by DSPs  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  14   HIGH = the OES capability to successfully carry out its core mission/business functions has critical  dependency on a DSP (for operational, security, risk management, compliance purposes).  Figure 4: Dependencies of Operators of Essential Services on Digital Service Providers (overview)  Despite the efforts of OES in dealing with external parties (e.g. DSPs), it is challenging and difficult to  measure and assess the effectiveness of managing dependencies due to the complexity. Moreover, OES  need to verify effectively the trustworthiness of DSPs with respect to their security practices and processes  in operations. Typically, in order to address risks, common practices involve specifying security  requirements into contracts, Service Level Agreements (SLAs), Operational Level Agreements (OLAs) and  other formal agreements. However, such contracts and agreements can still leave some uncertainties  about (shared) duties, responsibilities and obligations in operations. Moreover, it can be difficult to clarify  such uncertainties in case of cybersecurity incidents (e.g. data breaches) affecting complex ICT systems and  services. Nevertheless, organisations in some cases may have limited ability to negotiate security  requirements. Sometimes, it is simply unrealistic to expect DSPs meeting stringent security requirements  in operations.  Of course, key cyber (inter)dependencies for OES and DSPs extend beyond the scope of the NIS  Directive. For instance, trust certificates at the infrastructure/service level are necessary in order to  support transactions with parties (e.g. for e-government, a high level of trust between the different  systems is needed).  In the following paragraphs, a brief overview of the respective cross-sector and of OES on DSPs  (inter)dependencies are provided.  The reason the examples are provided is for emphasizing the necessity  to provide methodologies for identifying and understanding cyber (inter)dependencies  in order to  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  15  mitigate any risk associated with security incidents as the impact of cyber-security incidents may  propagate across sectors.  2.2.1 Emerging (inter)dependencies in energy  Energy operations are possible thanks to a combination of goods and services that include digital services,  finance, digital infrastructure and transport. The energy sector also has dependencies with financial  market infrastructures. In economic terms, energy (i.e. electricity, oil and gas) is a commodity that can be  bought, sold and marketed. In the past, monopoly-based organisational structures were the common ways  of selling and exchanging energy18.  Nowadays the digitalisation of the energy sector has also transformed related financial market  infrastructures19 that support the negotiation of energy in real time in order to make the market efficient.  This highlights the increasing cyber dependencies with digital infrastructures and digital services such as  cloud computing becoming key elements supporting daily activities in the energy sector.  Moreover, within the energy subsectors of the NIS directive (Electricity, Oil and Gas), the distribution and  supply phases (or the activities concentrated in the downstream for the Oil and Gas sectors) in the value  chains present the most interest of the emerging (inter)dependencies on DSPs. This is due to the fact that  distribution and supply phases are the ones that have stronger market drivers (than other phases such as  production and transmission) targeting at innovation and competition.20 Cloud services enable data usages  regardless of the data storage location while connecting different teams from around the world, enabling  them to share information instantly and expedite the development process21.  Figure 5: Elements of the Energy value chain that depend most on DSPs  18 Barton, B., et al. (2004): Energy Security: Managing Risk in a Dynamic Legal and Regulatory Environment. Oxford  University Press.  19  Note also that the energy transition requires a lot of effort from especially regional grid operators.  20 This applies mainly to centralised production; as decentralised production becomes more prominent, dependencies  on digital services grow as well.  21 Saputelli, L. A., Bravo C., Moricca, G., Cramer R., Nikolaou, M., Lopez, C., Mochizuki S. (2013): Best Practices And  Lessons Learned After 10 Years Of Digital Oilfield (DOF) Implementations, SPE Paper 167269, Presented at the SPE  Kuwait Oil and Gas Show and Conference, 8-10 October, Kuwait City, Kuwait. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2118/167269- MS  http://dx.doi.org/10.2118/167269-MS http://dx.doi.org/10.2118/167269-MS  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  16  In the electricity sub-sector, there will be new roles due to the digital transformation of electricity systems  across the value chain. Digital technologies and services (e.g. smart meters, IoT, cloud services)  increasingly enable information flows across the grid and the different value chain phases in order to  communicate and provide (real-time and updated) data for operations and customers. In the distribution  phase, many electricity operators are strategically investing in and acquiring advanced capabilities, which  allow customers to choose their energy supply mix in order to address their demands.  One example is EnergySage22, an online marketplace that enables comparison-shopping among pre- screened solar installers and financiers and a number of utilities. Another example, in the electricity  subsector where demand and offer of electricity are traded through specialised online marketplaces is  Nord Pool - a specialised online marketplace for the energy market in northern Europe23.  The supply phase involves different stakeholders ranging from infrastructure providers, utility retailers and  customers (both commercial and private end users). In the supply phase, cloud computing and IoT (e.g.  smart metering) have the greatest impact and involve customers’ interaction. Some of the digital  technologies currently employed by electricity involve cloud computing services, IoT and services such as  big data and analytics, impacting the interactions with and offering new digital capabilities to end users  and customers.  In the oil subsector, there is an emerging dependency on massive data connectivity, on cloud services and  infrastructures. The oil industry is prototyping new and connected technologies to reduce well completion  time, maintenance time, etc. through real-time monitoring and advanced analytical software, especially in  the areas of fracturing fluids, sand, and logistics management. Oil-specialised search engines is another  interesting illustrative example of digital services utilised by the oil subsector. More specifically, these  specialised search engines (e.g. Datafari) allow oil (and gas) geoscientists to get very quickly an overview of  all the data that are necessary for them to decide whether to drill an oilrig.  In the gas sub-sector, a forecast from the UK-based Oil and Gas Council24 indicates that the gas industry  stands to benefit particularly from cloud computing services. Cloud adoption is one of the main IT trends  for oil and gas in 2017, alongside with the Internet of Things (IoT), drones, intelligent rigs, and leak- detection software.  2.2.2 Emerging (inter)dependencies in transport  The increasing digitalisation of the transport sector makes it highly dependent on digital infrastructure  and DSPs. The transport sector is highly reliant on digital services such as online marketplaces, online  search engine and cloud computing services for their daily operations. For instance, unavailability of such  services would severely impact automated airport processes such as online check-in, self-service luggage,  ticketing, etc., resulting in flight delays, financial and reputational losses.  The cyber (inter)dependencies of the transport sector are likely to increase due to the digitalisation  and integration of transport services (e.g. multimodal transport).  22 EnergySage: https://www.energysage.com/  23 Nord Pool Market: http://www.nordpoolspot.com/  24 UK Oil Gas Council (2017): The forecast for oil & gas IT.  https://www.energysage.com/ http://www.nordpoolspot.com/  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  17  The digitalisation of transport services (including the adoption of autonomous cars) will likely increase the  cyber dependencies and interdependencies of the transport sectors (e.g. dependencies on digital services,  interdependencies among transport services, dependencies on energy sector, etc.).  Another dependency of the transport sector is on the energy sector. A study25 on the energy sector  highlights the potential effects of energy disruptions on other essential services. In particular, the transport  sector may be exposed to energy disruptions on the Electricity and Oil/Gas sectors.   Disruptions to electricity will potentially have an impact on electric public transportations,  signal and control systems, transport of fuel and shipping of goods and materials as well as  transport information systems (arrival times, platforms, etc.) and may affect ticket machines  and turnstiles   Disruptions to oil/gas will potentially have an impact on fuel and lubricants for vehicles and  facilities, transport of fuel and shipping of goods and materials.  Figure 6: Elements of the Transport value chain that depend most on DSPs  The rail sub-sector exhibits increasing dependencies on DSPs, particularly in the operations due to the  increasing adoption of online marketplaces (e.g. for ticketing), online search engines (e.g. for marketing),  cloud computing services (e.g. for information sharing). Illustrative cases of cloud services applied to  support the business of rail companies may include sharing of information and services of public  importance, such as the train timetables, scheduling information, seats reservations, monitoring of freight  cars, e-ticketing and public procurement. Higher level of rail transport traffic safety can be achieved with  support of cloud computing services that facilitate cooperation of the autonomous traffic and  transportation systems (especially in the area of distributed information systems, web user interface,  integrated database available on the Internet, effective reporting, etc.). Moreover, interoperability of rail  transport data and better information sharing between operators is also facilitated by the use of services  provided by the cloud DSPs.  25 NIST (2016): Guide Brief 5 – Assessing Energy System Dependencies, NIST Special Publication 1190GB-5. DOI:  http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1190GB-5  http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1190GB-5  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  18  In the road sub-sector, online road transport marketplaces are portals where transportation capacity is  bought and sold - typically, these can be categorized as vertical marketplaces as they deal specifically with  road transportation and sometimes with other added-value services for transportation management.  There is an increasing number of transport operators (whether for rail, road or water) that are adopting  cloud computing technologies and services to streamline their business, operations, to improve workflows  and to allow data sharing among a broader audience in their supply chain. Moreover, transport OES make  use of cloud computing services for geospatial applications. Cloud based GIS systems and applications  can also compile information from a wider array of sources via the web, encouraging data sharing among  stakeholders to support the interdisciplinary nature of transportation services (inter-modality).  Collaboration through cloud based applications or systems can increase efficiency by allowing access to the  same data set and eliminate duplicated data collection activities.  The air sub-sector has typically been a closed environment that exhibits low dependency regarding the  feasibility of the adoption of cloud computing in order to support the exchange of information among26 Air  Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), though cloud is being used especially for office automation, while  online marketplace are used for procurement. Although, broader adoption of cloud computing is under  consideration in order to reduce operational costs and to improve the overall system resilience and  continuity, no DSPs are involved in core operational services.  In water transport, typical applications involving cloud services for water transport operators are related  to27 ship/ fleet management, maintenance management, document management and reporting.  2.2.3 Emerging (inter)dependencies in banking and financial market infrastructures  The sectors of banking and financial market infrastructures show a high level of dependency on the digital  infrastructure and DSPs. This is because the activities of these sectors involve electronic transactions that  rely on digital infrastructures and services. For example, banking and financial market infrastructures’  operators depend on digital infrastructure operators managing Top-Level Domain (TLD) name registries.  Another example is the sector's dependency on Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial  Telecommunication (SWIFT), the world’s leading provider of secure financial messaging services,  which as of 2015 linked more than 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries and  territories  Another example is the sector's dependency on Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial  Telecommunication (SWIFT), the world’s leading provider of secure financial messaging services, which as  of 2015 linked more than 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories. Due to  the dependencies of banking and financial market infrastructures on digital infrastructures, there are also  secondary dependencies on the energy sector. For example, energy disruptions may have different  impacts:   Disruptions to electricity will potentially have an impact on financial transactions and HVAC (Heating,  Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems  26 Currently, considering the IT domain for ENAV, only a raw 20% is weighted as common office activity. Strong  commitment and expectations are posed on the SWIM activities, considered an enabler for the civil aviation  worldwide and SESAR JU consortium funds are available. There are similar programmes in the USA and other  international pan-European air transport services and, worth of note, ICAO is actively working for standardisation.  27 Pančo Ristov, M. P. V. T. (2014): The implementation of cloud computing in shipping companies. Scientific Journal  of Maritime Research.  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  19   Disruptions to oil/gas will potentially have an impact on fuel for heat, generators and facilities.  Indeed, disruptions to energy supplies could potentially trigger a cascade effect on the normal functioning  of digital infrastructures and then consequently to banking and financial market infrastructures.  2.2.4 Emerging (inter)dependencies in health  As the health sector is currently undergoing a process of digitalisation, the dependency on the electricity  sector is essentially the most critical for health services. The case of a power outage is just a practical  example that highlights the dependency of health operators on the energy sector for maintaining their  services (e.g. on-line prescription, appointment booking, etc.) that depend on networks and information  systems (e.g. laboratory information systems, radiology information systems, etc.). In turn, the power  generators requiring fossil fuels (mainly, oil and gas) in order to provide electricity to facilities of health  operators create a dependency with the rest of the energy sector.  Moreover, the sector is becoming more and more dependent on the digital infrastructure.  For example, incidents affecting Domain Name System (DNS) operators may affect health services  such as eHealth services relying on online websites (e.g. on-line prescription, appointment booking,  telemedicine, etc.).  The dependency with the drinking water supply and distribution sector is another critical dependency for  the health sector. Water supplies are necessary for cooling systems of operation environments in health  services such as data centres (e.g. servers in data rooms, routers, etc.). Healthcare also depends on  banking sector services in order to perform several financial transactions (e.g. payroll web applications) to  medical staff, suppliers, vendors and other third parties (e.g. electricity suppliers, digital services, etc.).  2.2.5 Emerging (inter)dependencies in drinking water supply and distribution  Services of drinking water supply and distribution depend on different SCADA systems, which need to  operate constantly in order to provide the necessary operational information creating a dependency on  the electricity sector. New digital technologies in the drinking water sector have introduced detailed  measurement and near real-time monitoring of water extraction, treatment, distribution, use and reuse,  with the potential to distinguish between different water qualities, sources, quantities and users28.  Among the most relevant categories of data29 handled by the drinking water sector, the following that  produce a large volume can be enlisted: Flow, chemical concentration and laboratory data; Water supply  metering and customer usage data; Engineering and construction data; and Water asset performance and  maintenance data.  Growth in the variety of data processed by the water supply and distribution operators, particularly  unstructured data, is changing the landscape of water data and the manner the use, storage and  protection of this data is more and more dependent on the DSPs. For example, the open source  28 Directive 2007/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007 on the assessment and  management of flood risks. OJ L 288, 6.11.2007, p. 27–34. ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2007/60/oj  29 Deloitte (2016): Water Tight 2.0 - Top trends in the global water sector.  http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2007/60/oj  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  20  unstructured data - web content, social content and crowdsourcing30 – is changing the landscape of  water data.  The information systems that support the ordering, planning and monitoring of chemical supplies create  indirectly cyber dependencies on the transport sector. However, due to the low level maturity concerning  the integration and standardisation of ICT solutions in the respective business processes31, incidents  related to digital infrastructure would have in principle a limited impact on the sector as a whole.  One of the most relevant and obvious opportunities – at the same time, dependencies – that the drinking  water supply and distribution operators have is on the cloud computing services providers. Drinking water  OES are benefitting from the availability of a broad variety of cloud services. In particular, data-related  services such as storage and analytics support the digitalisation of several services in the water value chain  (hence, the digital water process).  Figure 7 Drinking water value chain elements that depend the most on the DSPs  Moreover, the increasing digitalisation of SCADA systems and reliance on information networks expose the  operators of drinking water supply and distribution to potential cyber attacks32. Networked, intelligent  sensors and decision support systems in real time facilitate data acquisition, monitoring and reporting to  make better use of energy, avoid unnecessary water losses and minimize the consumption of resources.  2.2.6 Emerging (inter)dependencies in digital infrastructures  Most sectors are developing an increasing dependency on digital infrastructure services. This is due to the  progressive digitalisation of services across sectors. On the other hand, digital infrastructure services also  depend on other sectors. For example, a clear dependency relates to how the digital infrastructure relies  on servers, storage devices, network switches and data centre infrastructure, as well as a shift to much  greater shares of cloud and hyper scale data centres.  30 One definition of the crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting  contributions from a large group of people and especially from the online community rather than from traditional  employees or suppliers.  31 European Commission (2018). Report on the Action Plan to foster Digital Single Market for Water Services  (ICT4Water).  32 Birkett, D.M., (2017): Water Critical Infrastructure Security and Its Dependencies. Journal of Terrorism Research. 8(2),  pp.1–21. DOI: http://doi.org/10.15664/jtr.1289  http://doi.org/10.15664/jtr.1289  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  21  Big quantities of energy are needed in order to power this infrastructure. In this regard, Data centres  worldwide consumed around 194 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity in 2014, or about 1% of total  demand33.  Another dependency relates to the water sector. Indeed, cold water is needed in many cases by the  datacentre cooling systems for maintaining the system from overheating (e.g. servers in data rooms,  routers, UPSs etc.). Moreover, in some cases where the electric energy is produced from dumps, the digital  infrastructures has a secondary dependency with the water sector.  Cross-border (inter)dependencies  In order to have a comprehensive account of (inter)dependencies, it is necessary to discuss and analyse  them also from a cross-border perspective, that is, how security incidents affecting services in a Member  State may propagate cross-border to services in other Member States.  Cross-border impact provides another dimension for assessing the impact of security incidents and  significant incidents may have a cascading effect on different sectors as well as on services across  Member States.  In general, it is possible to distinguish three situations, as depicted in Figure 8.  Figure 8 Cyber attacks with cross-border impact  1. Common Vulnerabilities. In such cases, cyber incidents are due to the exploitations of common  vulnerabilities and may have an impact in multiple countries as the result of such vulnerabilities, rather  than cross border propagation. This type of attack may involve sophisticated technologies or services  and often suggests that cyber-attacks target specific services (e.g. large organisations providing  services or critical infrastructures) rather than citizens.  2. Connectivity of Services. In such cases, security incidents propagate due to the underlying connectivity  of sectors operating in different countries. For instance, this is the case of attacks infecting ICT systems  and propagating by infecting connected resources or systems. At the sectorial level, essential services  may be exposed to cyber-attacks affecting (inter)interdependencies. For example, banking and  33 IEA (International Energy Agency) (2017). Digitalisation and Energy 2017.  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  22  financial market infrastructures depend on service connectivity for financial transactions. Cyber- attacks targeting highly connected banking and financial market infrastructures can have significant  propagation effects that cascade into related and neighbouring financial services (e.g. payment and  other banking transactions) operating in other countries.  3. Service Structures. In such cases, security incidents have a cross-border impact due to structural  service dependencies, i.e., security incidents may affect multiple countries, because there exist  underlying structural dependencies among services. An example of this might be the case of energy  production services that may operate in multiple countries. A security incident affecting energy  production would affect the countries that depend on such energy supplies. Other examples involve  security incidents affecting Air Transport services (e.g. National Air Traffic Management services) that  may also have a cross-border impact due to underlying service structures.

Framework for Assessing Dependencies and Interdependencies  An extensive review of the relevant literature regarding good practices, methodologies, approaches and tools  revealed significant commonalities as regards the phases for (inter)dependencies risk assessment. This chapter  builds on these commonalities to propose a framework for assessing (inter)dependencies, based on a phased  approach. For each phase, the relevant state of the art in terms of methodologies, practices and tools is presented  to allow customised implementation of the framework based on the individual requirements, sectorial  specificities, maturity and resources of the different stakeholders who may wish to implement it in practice.  Introduction to the framework  Integrating the assessment of (inter)dependencies in an overall risk management process is a complex  process, particularly in the case of cross-sector or cross-border dependencies and interdependencies. This  section provides a framework for assessing (inter)dependencies, which follows common principles of risk  management34, 35 and defines a process consisting of four different phases (Figure 9).  Figure 9 Dependency and Interdependency Assessment  1. Contextualising and Tailoring Assessment: involves defining the key elements of the  (inter)dependencies risk assessment  2. Identification and Modelling of Dependencies and Interdependencies: involves diverse  methodological approaches, including the analysis of historical data, for the identification and  modelling of dependencies and interdependencies among OES and DSPs.  3. Analysis and Measurement of Dependencies and Interdependencies: involves analyses, including  quantitative analyses, based on different scenarios or simulations of the dependencies and  interdependencies among OES and DSPs.  4. Evaluation of Impact of Dependencies and Interdependencies: involves the impact assessment, based  on the performed analyses and measurements, for the identified and modelled dependencies and  interdependencies among OES and DSPs.  For each phase, the following sections provide an overview of different methodologies that take into  account such (inter)dependencies between OES and DSPs highlighting the main types of methodological  34 ISO 31000:2018, Risk management – Guidelines.  35 ISO 31010:2009 – Risk Management – Risk assessment techniques  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  24  approaches, the common risk assessment steps, approaches to metrics and impact assessments, as well as  key aspects of National Risk Assessment approaches.  The framework is applicable for:   OES/DSPs for supporting their (inter)dependencies risk assessment   NCAs for integrating (inter)dependencies in their National Risk Assessments (NRAs)  Contextualising and tailoring assessment  Prior to any methodological approach or tool adopted for conducting any aspects of (inter)dependencies  risk assessment, it is necessary to define the assessment’s key elements:   Scope: The scope and the scale of risk assessments depend on various factors including the involved  critical infrastructures, OES or DSPs taken into account as well as to what extent Member States are  vulnerable to security attacks affecting deliveries of services.   Cross Border and Regional Dimensions: Risk assessments highlight that incidents or hazardous  conditions may have origins beyond organisational and national boundaries. The nature of cyber  threats and the continuous evolution of threat landscape require understanding how cyber incidents  may propagate across organisations36 such as OES and DSPs, and across Member States.   Previous Incidents and Lessons Learnt: The availability of relevant data affects the overall risk  assessment (e.g. in terms of accuracy). The most common sources of information supporting risk  assessments are, for instance, historical records and databases of events, impacts and recorded losses  and damages. Although the sources of information, the ownership and the responsibility may belong  to different organisations (e.g. OES and DSPs as well as governmental bodies and authorities such as  CSIRTs and NCAs), data on previous incidents provide evidence and understanding of past events, their  occurrences and impact (e.g. in terms of damages and consequences).   Multi-stakeholder Involvement: (Inter)dependencies risk assessments typically involve different  stakeholders, who may have different responsibilities as well as different risk perceptions and who  position themselves differently with respect to emerging risks. It is necessary to involve all relevant  stakeholders, who may affect the outcomes of risk assessments.   Timeframe: (Inter)dependencies risk assessments are often conducted at specific time and are  constrained by budget; for instance, national risk assessments are conducted with a timeframe of  three to five years. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the timeframe of a risk assessment and its  validity with respect to emerging threats.  Identification and modelling of dependencies and interdependencies  The overall objective of this phase is to identify and model relationships, that is, (inter)dependencies  among OES and DSP, capturing domain-specific knowledge based on historical data and experts or data  insights.  The ISO 31010 standard identifies various techniques that can support risk identification. Such techniques  may support different types of activities for gathering stakeholder knowledge (e.g. brainstorming,  structured and semi-structured interviews, etc.).  36 Van Eeten, M., Nieuwenhuijs, A., Luiijf, E.,  Klaver, M., Cruz, E. (2011): The state and the threat of cascading failure  across critical infrastructures: the implications of empirical evidence from media incident reports. Public Administration  89(2):381-400. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.01926.x  https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.01926.x  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  25  Among the various techniques for identifying and modelling (inter)dependencies, risk scenarios capture  contextual knowledge and support the identification of risks for specific environments.  National Risk Assessments (NRAs) often develop specific risk-based scenarios37 in order to assess the  exposure of critical infrastructures to critical events such as cyber-attacks. In order to develop a  comprehensive account of risk, it is necessary to take into account two different aspects of the risk  scenarios:   Scenario severity and impact: risk scenarios may capture a single incident differently. Therefore, it is  necessary to develop multiple scenarios covering different magnitudes (e.g. in terms of criticality or  expected impact) and different interactions among threats or hazards. High-risk scenarios may be  associated to highly improbable events having catastrophic impacts. Although these risk scenarios are  unlikely, they are required in order to assess the potential impact of critical events.   Scenario timeline and scope: risk scenarios need to have a validity in alignment with foreseen  developments (e.g. increasing number of data breaches in the next five years, expected adoption of  digital services in the next five years, etc.) This information is necessary in order to clarify the scope (in  terms of time and space) of risk scenarios. Risk scenarios may also involve a scope beyond the  organisational or national boundaries. For example, severe events may have a cross-border impact  affecting services across multiple Member States. Moreover, it is necessary to underpin the main  relevant causes or trends.  In order to limit their complexity, risk scenarios may capture individual risks rather than multiple risks.  Unfortunately, catastrophic events may be due to interactions among multiple risks causing chains of  events having severe impacts. Therefore, it is necessary to understand and to define risk scenarios in order  to support single-risk as well as multiple-risk assessments.  A common pitfall in risk identification is overlooking dependencies that are embedded or hidden in  plain sight, such as ICT services that are widely used - thus implicitly taken for granted - but are key  services to OES and DSPs.38  Existing methodological approaches supporting risk analysis often involve different types of modelling and  characterisation of risk (e.g. Fault Tree Analysis, Event Three Analysis, Failure Mode and Effect Analysis,  Bayesian Network Analysis, etc.). Methodological approaches supporting risk analyses of  (inter)dependencies of OES and DSPs include39:  37 Risk scenarios are representations of risk situations leading to significant impacts, selected for the purpose of  assessing in more detail a particular type of risk for which it is representative, or constitutes an informative example  or illustration.  38 Interview referring to Luiijf, E., Klaver, M.

Empirical approaches analyse (inter)dependencies taking into account historical data of incidents (e.g.  in terms of frequency and severity of incident patterns) and expert opinions (based on their domain- specific experiences).  2. Agent based approaches capture the complexity of (inter)dependencies as interactions of autonomous  agents that interact among one another in their environments based on specific rules. Such  approaches adopt a bottom-up method and assume the complex behaviour or phenomenon emerge  from many individual and relatively simple interactions of autonomous agents.  3. System dynamics based approaches represent (inter)dependencies as results of emergent system  behaviours. Such approaches take a top-down method to manage and analyse complex adaptive  systems involving (inter)dependencies.  4. Economic based approaches capture (inter)dependencies as results of economic and market theories  involving exchanges of values (e.g. capital, demand, offer, etc.). Such approaches take into account the  production and consumption of services (or other related constrained resources).  5. Network based approaches capture (inter)dependencies as results of the relationships (e.g.  information flows) among individual components. Such approaches model single systems/services by  networks and describe their (inter)dependencies by inter-links, providing intuitive representations  along with detailed descriptions of their topologies and flow patterns.  6. Service-based approaches capture the modelling of interdependencies conducted on the basis of  services that infrastructures exchange. This allows the development of a simulation framework which  is sector agnostic40.  A more detailed description of the aforementioned approaches and an overview of the relevant research  activities is available in Annex B.  Analysis and measurement of dependencies and interdependencies  The overall objective of the risk analysis is to assess the likelihood and impact of the identified risks. In a  quantitative risk analysis, risks are the combination of the consequences of a critical risk and the  associated likelihood of its occurrence41. Consequences are the negative effects of a disaster expressed, for  example, in terms of human impacts, economic and environmental impacts, and political/social impacts.  The probability of occurrence captures (in those situations that it is possible to quantify) the likelihood of  occurrence of a hazard (or threat) of a certain intensity, whereas, the severity of impact provides an  assessment of the consequences of critical events (occurrence of hazards or threats). Analysis and  measurements of (inter)dependencies typically involves:  1. Scenarios and simulations; and  2. Metrics.  A special case of (inter)dependencies analysis and measurement are the national risk assessments  conducted by Member States in order to assess their exposure to critical events including natural and  40 Ihttp://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC102547/lbna28073enn.pdf  41 The classical algebraic representation of risk is that Risk is equal to the Impact (severity of hazard/threat  consequences) times Frequency (likelihood of occurrences). Note that not all risks are quantifiable, socio-technical  aspects of risks highlight the limitation of quantitative approaches to risks. It is necessary to understand also the  limitations of risk assessments (and quantification approaches) in order to conduct them properly. For a socio-technical  account of risk see: Anderson, S., Felici, M. (2012): Emerging Technological Risk – Underpinning the Risk of Technology  Innovation, Springer. DOI https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-2143-5  http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC102547/lbna28073enn.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-2143-5  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  27  man‑made disasters42. The conducted national risk assessments provide an overview of current practices  adopted by Member States in assessing their exposures to diverse risks (e.g. earthquake, flooding, critical  infrastructure disruption, cybercrime, etc.). National risk assessments typically involve developing specific  scenarios (or simulations) under which to evaluate (possibly, quantitatively) the risks associated with  specific threats. These national risk assessments provide insights in order to define crisis management  strategies and contingency plans. National risk assessments are described in more detail in section 3.6.  3.4.1 Scenarios and simulations  The (inter)dependencies risk assessments may involve different types of scenarios and simulations and the  scenarios themselves can involve different types of incidents or disruptive events, from natural disasters  due to earthquakes to incidents to essential services (e.g. transport incidents such as collisions, explosions  of oil and gas pipelines, disruptions of energy supplies, etc.). Examples of cyberattacks, affecting  organisations and individuals, targeting OES and DSPs include syntactic attacks (using malicious software  relevant to intrusion, cyber espionage and sabotage and semantic attacks (through the dissemination of  incorrect information to affect credibility of the target resources, relevant in the case of cyber subversion).  Other forms of cyber threats have become increasingly relevant, such as the risk of social engineering  involving insider manipulation of individual data and installation of malware43. Hybrid threats involve  military and non-military actions, which state or non-state actors can use in a coordinated manner, often in  a disguised and deniable form, to undermine public trust in government institutions or exploiting social  vulnerabilities while remaining below the threshold of formally declared warfare. Hybrid threats can  involve cyberattacks having an impact on critical information systems causing disruptions to critical  services such as energy supplies or financial services. Important components of a scenario-based risk  assessment are:   Different scenarios for an incident: it is necessary to develop different scenarios for the same type of  incident covering different magnitudes and different interactions among threats.   Defined time and space scope of each scenario: it is necessary to define the scope (e.g. in terms of  time and geographical distribution) for each scenario in order to clarify also its validity. Some scenarios  may also have a scope beyond the national boundaries involving multiple Member States.   Identify underlying cause(s) and important trends: it is necessary to recognise the underlying causes  and important trends (e.g. increasing deployments of Internet of Things, digitalisation of essential  services, etc.) that may provide contextual information.   Catastrophic Scenarios: it is necessary to develop also catastrophic scenarios (i.e. highly improbable  events to which response is difficult) overwhelming national or organisational capacity to respond (e.g.  coordinated cyberwarfare targeting simultaneously all operators of essential services).  Scenarios and simulations, therefore, capture critical events of cyberattacks exploiting vulnerabilities (at  organisational and system level) in order to assess the impact on essential and digital services. For  example, national risk assessments have taken into account scenarios of cyber terrorism, cyber incident to  network and information systems, cyberattacks on electricity services, cyber espionage and cyber activism.  Tools can support the analysis and measurement of security incidents affecting dependencies and  interdependencies. For example, the EC JRC developed the Geospatial Risk and Resilience Assessment  42 European Commission (2017). Overview of natural and man‑made disaster risks the European Union may face.  Commission Staff Working Document, SWD(2017) 176 final.  43 ENISA (2018). ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2017: 15 Top Cyber-Threats and Trends. Version 1.0, ETL 2017.  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  28  Platform (GRRASP44), which supports the analysis of complex networked systems taking into consideration  cross-sectoral and cross-border (inter)dependencies. However, such types of tools/platforms are often  specialised and require specific expertise. Other tools (e.g. Zero Outage, CIPRTrainer Web Service, etc.)  may support the simulation and analysis of crisis conditions for essential services.  3.4.2 Metrics  Metrics are commonly used in quantitative risk assessment approaches to facilitate measurements  computing the likelihood of a potential risk and the severity of its impact (or consequence). Metrics used  for the evaluation and representation of (inter)dependencies can be grouped in two main categories:   Weighted Metrics: involving measurements of different variables (or indicators) providing specific risk  values (e.g. values or percentages of risks). Metrics may require data gathering resulting from  scenarios or simulations. Indicative examples of weighted metrics may include number of users  affected, geographical distribution of services, number of SLAs with third parties, performance  measures related to resilience etc.   Nominal Scales: involving assigning nominal values (i.e. qualitative category labels) associated with  different risk levels (e.g. likelihood or impact: very low, low, medium, high and very high.). Indicative  examples of nominal scale metrics may include social, economic or environmental impact, loss of  service capabilities, criticality of services in terms of security, coupling and complexity of services etc.  When analysing and measuring (inter)dependencies, it is also possible to create correspondence between  the results of weighted metrics and nominal scales, thus combining qualitative and quantitative  assessments.  Note that deciding whether to adopt either a qualitative or a quantitative approach (or a combination of  both) depends on different factors (e.g. data availability, expert involvement, etc.) that need to be  evaluated case by case. The level of awareness and maturity on the topic of (inter)dependencies is key in  this decision. In order to analyse and measure risks associated with (inter)dependencies, specific  challenges need to be addressed, in particular the lack of data - including unavailable, untrusted and  incomplete data - and lack of expertise in conducting (inter)dependencies risk assessments.  OES and DSPs rely on their own historical45 data or specific data sets coming from the industry itself (e.g.  insurance companies) to conduct such risk assessments. On the other hand, the most common sources of  information used by Member States in their NRA are historical records and databases of events, impacts  and recorded losses and damages. One additional challenge is that different organisations (both public and  private) may often own and manage proprietary databases. This may limit the data availability for  conducting risks assessments. It is necessary to support information sharing (e.g. by incentives, developing  44 https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/grrasp GRRASP consists of a distributed architecture involving open source technologies,  which bring together geospatial technologies and computational tools for the analysis and simulation of critical  infrastructures. It allows information sharing and constitutes a basis for future developments in the direction of  collaborative analysis and federated simulation. It takes into account security concerns in the information sharing  process (managing users and roles consistently). GRRASP can be deployed in separate servers and used by EU Member  States as a means to facilitate the analysis of risk and resilience in critical infrastructures. It supports analyses of critical  infrastructure disruptions at local, regional, national and international level. GRRASP follows a tiered approach – Tier 1  modules can be used for the analysis of critical infrastructures at sectoral level, Tier 2 modules for cross sector analyses  (of dependencies and interdependencies), and finally Tier 3 modules for high level economic impact of critical  infrastructure disruptions at state level.  45 It should be noted that when assessing past incidents / historical data, lack of such information or absence of  previously materialised risks should not be interpreted as reduced likelihood that a risk may occur in the future.  https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/grrasp  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  29  collaborative cultures, technologies such as sharing platforms). Data may provide evidence and  understanding of past events, their occurrences, magnitudes and even their consequences. This also  involves data about previous events that may have occurred in different Member States.  Evaluation of impact of dependencies and interdependencies  The final phase of risk assessment involves comparing the identified (inter)dependency risks with specific  (often, sectorial) criteria to determine whether risks and/or their magnitudes are acceptable or tolerable.  For example, the sectors of banking and financial market infrastructures provide another instance of  sectorial criteria and thresholds for the classification of incidents. For example, the European Banking  Authority (EBA) provides guidelines, criteria and thresholds for incident notification under the PSD2  Directive. The incident classification distinguishes only two different types of incidents: Major Incident and  Non-Major Incident. The classification dependents on thresholds of Lower Impact Level and Higher Impact  level for different criteria (i.e. transactions affected, Payment service users affected, Service downtime,  Economic impact, High level of internal escalation, Other payment service providers or relevant  infrastructures potentially affected, and Reputational impact). These examples of different evaluation  criteria for the assessment of incidents highlight the problem of defining common criteria (and thresholds)  across sectors and Member States.  Moreover, ENTSO-E has defined an incidents classification scale methodology for the electricity sector, in  particular, for transmission operators46 depicted in Figure 10.  Figure 10: ENTSO-E Incidents Classification Scale overview  National Risk Assessments highlight additional important aspects and challenges of impact evaluation. The  impact may be assessed either quantitatively (e.g. in terms of clear magnitude: number of affected  persons, monetary loss in euro, service unavailability in hours/day) or qualitatively. In the case of semi-  46 ENTSO-E (2014). Incidents Classification Scale Methodology, Working group incident classification scale under system  operations committee. European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E).  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  30  qualitative analysis, different criteria may be considered for the impact evaluation. National Risk  Assessments have adopted different impact categories and criteria47:   Human impact: usually quantified in terms of number of affected citizens.   Environmental impact: quantified or assessed qualitatively in terms of harm to natural resources.   Economic impact: usually quantified in terms of financial and material losses.   Societal impact: taking into account disruptions of daily activities and usages of essential services.   Political impact: taking into account the affected capacity to govern and control a country.  These impact criteria are in alignment with the ones that the NIS Directive identifies, including also  duration of the incident and geographical spread with regard to the area affected by the incident. The  review of National Risk Assessments highlights that impact criteria are often assessed differently. This is a  critical challenge for impact assessment in relation to (inter)dependencies across sectors and Member  States. It is necessary to provide a basic framework that can be used and tailored to different sectors and  to national contexts. The impact framework would support identifying different criteria for assessing the  impact of security incidents propagating also via (inter)dependencies.  National risk assessments  The following highlight key methodological elements related to how national risk assessments (NRAs)  address risks affecting the European Union48. The European Commission is supporting NRAs in order to  assess the exposure of Member States to different types of threats, including threats affecting the security  of network and information systems. NRAs therefore provide also insights about the exposure to cyber  threats of OES and DSPs. Figure 11 provides an account of the characteristics of NRAs.  Figure 11 Characteristics of National Risk Assessments  47 The ECI Directive 2008/114/EC also makes reference to casualties, economic and social impact of infrastructure  disruption  48 European Commission (2017): Commission Staff Working Document –  Overview of Natural and Man-made Disaster  Risks the European Union may face, SWD(2017) 176 final.  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  31   Risk selection criteria: Different criteria may be considered to identify and select the risks (threats)  defining the scope of risk assessments. Past incidents (e.g. historical data of past incidents) or expert  opinions may guide the definition of selections criteria, hence the identification and selection of risks.   Scenarios: Definition of scenarios with varying different levels of criticality should capture critical events  related to specific risks (threats). It is necessary to develop a detailed assessment programme consisting  of scenarios of different severity (e.g. from limited impact to catastrophic incidents) and complexity (e.g.  single-risk and multiple-risk scenarios) covering all identified risks.   Time horizon: It is necessary to clarify the timeframe validity of risk assessments. This is to make sure  that the developed scenarios and the risk assessments take also into account assumptions based on  emerging trends or potential constraints (e.g. technological trends, regulatory frameworks, etc.).   Methodology of analysis: Methodological approaches supporting risk analyses can provide different  types of results: qualitative, semi-qualitative and quantitative.   Management of uncertainties: It is necessary to take into account uncertainties that may undermine or  invalidate the assumptions underlying risks assessments (including assumptions shaping risk scenarios).   Links to capability assessments: The results of risk assessments should be linked to existing capabilities  or their developments mitigating risks, for example, by deploying security controls in order to reduce  the likelihood of threats, or by defining crisis management strategies or contingency plans in order to  reduce the impact of threats.

Challenges  for assessing (inter)dependencies  Integrating (inter)dependencies in the risk management process introduces a number of challenges that,  to some extent, differ between OES/DSPs and NCAs due to varying context and focus. This section  highlights the main challenges for managing (inter)dependencies these stakeholders respectively face.  Table 2 Challenges for assessing dependencies and interdependencies  CHALLENGES  OES / DSPs   Lack of data   Complexity of service supply chains   Specialised methodologies   Lack of skills   Taxonomy of incident impact assessment  NCAs   Sectorial approach   Lack of data   Complexity of scenarios   Cross border notification and coordination   Identification of operators of essential services   Auditing OES  The following sections highlight the main challenges, in particular, with identifying and modelling,  analysing and measuring, and evaluating dependencies and interdependencies.  Challenges for OES and DSPs  OES and DSPs face different challenges that limit assessing dependencies and interdependencies. Taking  also into account their roles and responsibilities (including, security requirements and incident  notifications) for assessing the potential risks associates with the security of network and information  systems, this section pinpoints and discusses such challenges.   Lack of Data. OES and DSPs face a lack of data to assess their (inter)dependencies. There are limited  incentives supporting sharing of information concerned with emerging operational  (inter)dependencies. To a certain extent, this is due to the fact that some (inter)dependencies may be  discovered only once incidents occur. OES and DSPs often gather their operational data in order to  provide their services. It is necessary to develop specific processes and mechanisms in order to share  relevant information confidentially with order OES, DSPs and other NIS actors such as NCAs.   Complexity of Service Supply Chains. Another challenge for assessing (inter)dependencies is due to  the complexity of service supply chains. Although OES and DSPs can probably identify direct  dependencies on other services, it is often difficult to identify and assess second order dependencies.  Moreover, service supply chains may also have complex dependencies in operations.   Specialised Methodologies. Developing data-driven assessment requires often combining different  specialised methodologies (including tools). These methodologies enable OES and DSPs to develop  data-driven risk assessments, heuristics and decision-making processes related to (inter)dependencies.  In order to reach the required organisational and methodological maturity, there is need for a  substantial investment to develop tailored specialised methodologies and to integrate them into  organisational practices.  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  33   Lack of Skills. OES and DSPs face the common problem of shortage of qualified personnel, who has the  required skills for applying specialised methodologies in their complex operational environments.   Taxonomy of Incident Impact Assessment. The analyses of different cyber incidents highlight that  there is a lack of common criteria for assessing and describing their impact. Most of the incident  reports focus on describing the type of attacks, the exploited vulnerabilities and some dynamics how  infections spread across network and information systems. The incident impact is often  described/assessed in aggregated terms (e.g. number of systems affected, number of countries  affected, etc.). However, there is yet little emphasis on analysing the dynamics and impact of cyber  incidents in terms of cross-sector and cross-border propagations due to (inter)dependencies among  OES and DSP.  These challenges affect all phases (i.e. Identification and Modelling, Analysis and Measurement, and  Evaluation of Impact) of assessing (inter)dependencies, but more so their identification. The lack of data  poses additional challenges in identifying and assessing cross border (inter)dependencies. The emergent  complexity of (inter)dependencies combined with the required specialised methodologies and skills may  expose OES and DSPs to further challenges in analysing, measuring and assessing the potential impact of  security incidents.  Challenges for NCAs  National Competent Authorities (NCAs) have critical roles and responsibilities in developing a coordinated  approach supporting the security of network and information systems. They are responsible for  establishing incident notification and information sharing practices supporting cooperation and  coordination among all relevant stakeholders (nationally and cross-border). NCAs need to cooperate  closely, nationally and cross-border (e.g. via the Cooperation Group and CSIRTs Network) in the  implementation of the NIS Directive. NCAs face different challenges when dealing with assessment of  (inter)dependencies: sectorial specialisation, lack of data, and complexity of the scenarios.   Sectorial Approach: The NIS Directive identifies different sectors of OES and types of DSPs. Depending  on the different transpositions of the NIS Directive and its implementations across the Member States,  some NCAs and CSIRTs may be required to develop a sectorial approach specifying different thresholds  and incident notification practices capturing the specificities of the different sectors (and subsectors)  that the NIS Directive identifies. NCAs may have limited or patchy availability of data resulting in partial  sectorial knowledge. This represents a challenge for developing a comprehensive sectorial approach  and developing a complete overview of the security of network and information systems across all  sectors. This hinders assessing emerging (inter)dependencies among all sectors. Moreover, NCAs  operate at national level, which means that they have limited security operational knowledge of the  status of OES and DSPs operating cross-border in other Member States. This implies that while NCAs  may be able to deal with the assessment of (inter)dependencies nationally, they may face additional  challenges when assessing cross-border (inter)dependencies among all sectors of OES and types of  DSPs.   Lack of Data: Deeply related to the previous challenge, NCAs often face a lack of data. Indeed, in order  to assess (inter)dependencies, they need to develop an understating of the different operational  environments of OES and DSPs. However, OES and DSPs typically consider such type of data to be  confidential. Another reason for the lack of data is that NCAs may operate at a sectorial and national  base in many cases, which limits their access only to data related to their own sector or national scope.   Complexity of Scenarios: National Risk Assessments (NRAs) provide useful insights in order to  understand the risk exposures of OES and DSPs operating nationally and cross-border. However, NCAs  taking part in NRAs, may need to deal with designing complex scenarios involving single as well as  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  34  multiple risks. Lack of data or methodologies (and tools) may constraint and limit the complexity of  scenarios in NRAs. Typically, it is difficult to create realistic scenarios that can be analysed without  historical data and knowledge of different sectors across Member States. This means that in many  cases NRAs take into account scenarios that may overlook complex emerging (inter)dependencies  among sectors. Thus, NCAs are in many cases underprepared to deal with cross border and/or cross  sector (inter)dependencies.   Cross Border Notification and Coordination: In order to deal with cross border incidents, Member  States via NCAs and CSIRTs, need to establish synergies, foster close cooperative schemes and  probably develop a common response and crisis management plan (as required by the ECI Directive  2008/114/EC on the protection of critical infrastructures and the NIS Directive). The complexity  increases as more actors (e.g. NATO, national security/defence agencies) are involved in the process of  identifying cross border threats and transboundary risks posed against cross border services. This  involves shared responsibilities among NCAs and CSIRTs operating cross border in different Member  States. Managing challenges regarding the responsibility for restoration or incident  coordination/management when establishing cooperation mechanisms/ mutual aid agreements  between different operators, which are principally competitors, is an important and complex aspect  that should be addressed by the Member States. Moreover, in case that essential services (e.g.  transmission of electricity) extend beyond the EU territory, there are various concerns and challenges  for the notification requirements of incidents that affect at least an EU Member State and a non-EU  country. Transboundary essential services across the EU Member States, are raising challenges  regarding the notification of cross border incidents, which may affect either non-essential services in a  neighbouring EU Member State or essential/non-essential services in a non-EU country. These  operational challenges concerned with cross border notification and coordination affect the  assessment of (inter)dependencies.   Identification of Cross Border Dependencies and Interdependencies: Coordination and cooperation  among Member States are essential in order to support the identification of cross border  (inter)dependencies of OES and DSPs. However, NCAs may face different challenges when identifying  cross border dependencies and interdependencies. In particular, there is lack of common terminology  at EU level for critical sectors, critical infrastructures and operators of essential services. Member  States and NCAs often use similar terms interchangeably, for example, “vital”, “essential” and “time  critical”. Member State and NCAs may seek cross border (inter)dependencies with other operators of  other sectors (e.g. telecommunications), which possibly are identified as essential at national level, but  they fall outside the scope of the NIS or ECI Directives. Member States may need to proceed further  beyond the identification of critical infrastructures sectors and move towards the identification of  operators of essential services (Article 5 of the NIS Directive) and possibly the identification of related  essential services too.   Identification of Operators of Essential Services: Member States may identify more entities (essential  service operators), e.g. heating operators, considered as essential, according to their needs (e.g.  distribution system operators for electricity). The absolute value of thresholds used for the  identification of the European Critical Infrastructures (with respect to the ECI Directive) and for the  identification of essential services operators may vary across EU Member States, due to their different  sizes. The sensitivity of the business data might affect the ability of the EU Member States to collect  cross border data from national operators.   Auditing OES: NCAs will face difficulties when auditing OES, e.g. within the context of auditing  compliance to the provisions of the NIS Directive, that has (inter)dependencies with other OES and  DSPs, particularly when the latter are based in another Member State. The challenges are not limited  to the identification of those (inter)dependencies but also to the limitations in auditing the security  conformity level of the OES/DSPs on whose services the audited OES relies.

Indicators for assessing (inter)dependencies  This section provides a mapping of the key elements for assessing (inter)dependencies to risk assessment and  audit frameworks. The mapping supports an analysis of (inter)dependencies with respect to the most relevant and  used standards and frameworks in the risk management area. In particular, this section focuses on three main  standards: ISO/IEC 27002, NIST Cybersecurity Framework and COBIT 5. These risk assessment and audit  frameworks capture different risk domains and provide specific guidelines in order to plan and implement very  detailed risk-based strategy in an organisation. A genuine benchmark between these standards provides a set of  checklists composed of tailored and comprehensive risk criteria that may be associated to indicators of  (inter)dependencies between OES and DSPs. The resulting mapping between indicators of interdependencies and  risk assessment and audit frameworks will form a meta-framework for risk assessment and audit of  interdependencies.  Mapping to risk assessment and audit frameworks  This section provides a brief overview of the risk assessment and audit frameworks taken into account in  order to provide a characterisation of the (inter)dependencies’ indicators. ISO/IEC 27002 focuses on  implementing an Information Security Management System by defining risk criteria within a specific  external context. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework dives into security by providing a methodology to  implement organisational cyber-security strategies. COBIT5 integrates other frameworks by furnishing  guidance organizing IT objectives and good practices. ISO/IEC 27002, NIST Cybersecurity Framework and  COBIT5 are interdependent in many aspects. One focus is located at the governance level when others  cover the operational as well as the management stage. The detailed mapping of the proposed indicators  to all three standards provides a framework for operators to quickly and easily use their own tailor-made  implementation of ISO/IEC 27002, NIST and/or COBIT5 for (inter)dependencies risk assessment and use  them in tandem. The risk assessments of dependencies and interdependencies require identifying different  criteria and provide guidelines for their evaluation. Annex C: provides further information about the  analysed risk assessment and audit frameworks. Annex D: presents a detailed characterisation of different  criteria in terms of mappings to ISO/IEC 27002 security controls, NIST Cybersecurity controls and COBIT5  goals (Figure 12).  Figure 12 Mappings criteria to ISO/IEC 27002, NIST cybersecurity controls, COBIT5 enterprise and IT goals.  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  36  Despite the existence of different risk assessment and audit frameworks, it is difficult to identify one that  can cover different criteria for the risk assessment of (inter)dependencies. However, it is possible to map  the identified criteria to different risk assessment and audit frameworks. Conceptually, this means  combining ICT security, cybersecurity and governance together in order to characterise indicators for  assessing the risks associated with (inter)dependencies.  Indicators  This section identifies a set of indicators that relate to (inter)dependencies and may provide useful insights  for assessing them. The identified (types of) indicators relate to the assessment of the impact of an  incident in alignment with the security requirements and incident notification of the NIS Directive. The  indicators fall into four different domains (or types of indicators):   Impact: the impact indicators relate to information that is concerned with the potential impact of  incidents affecting the security of network and information systems.   Reliability, Dependability and Resilience: the reliability, dependability and resilience indicators relate  to information that is concerned with the potential impact of incidents on operations of affected  essential or digital services.   Structure: the structure indicators relate to information that is concerned with structural aspects of  essential and digital services (e.g. market structures and redundancy of services).   Time: the time indicators relate to information that is concerned with dynamics (including evolution  of) and timing aspects (e.g. seasonality of demand) of essential services and digital services.  Table 3 lists and describes the identified indicators of (inter)dependencies.  Table 3 Indicators of Dependencies and Interdependencies  ID INDICATOR DESCRIPTION  Indicators for Domain IMPACT  IND01 The number of serviced users (potentially affected by  an incident)49  The number of users of OES or DSPs may give preliminary  indications of the potential risks associated with dependencies and  interdependencies  IND02 Geographical distribution of services (e.g. cross border  services potentially affected by an incident)  The geographical distributions of dependent and interdependent  OES and DSPs may give preliminary indications of the potential risks  IND03 Social impact The social impact should also take into account the potential impact  of dependent and interdependent OES and DSPs on societal  activities  IND04 Economic Impact The economic impact should also take into account the potential  impact of dependent and interdependent OES and DSPs on  economic activities  IND05 Environmental impact The environmental impact should also take into account the  potential impact of dependent and interdependent OES and DSPs  on the environment  49 The number of users should reflect any abstractions encountered in practice; for instance, an airport might be a  single user for an OES or DSP but counting as one user would be an incorrect indicator of impact.

in  part due to their applicability in most if not all sectors and contexts. However, the framework can be  further expanded to address sectorial specificities or operational priorities by including mappings to other  relevant standards. One example of this is the ISA/IEC 6244350 family of standards, which covers Industrial  Automation and Control Systems Security and is very relevant to sectors that rely on Operational  Technology (OT) as well as IT. Another example would be the ISO 22301:201251 that focuses on Business  Continuity Systems.  While addressing specific sectorial examples is beyond the scope of the proposed framework, an indicative  list of relevant standards and frameworks that can complement the mapping is presented below:  Table 5 Indicative list of additional relevant standards  SECTOR STANDARDS  Cross sector   ANSI/ISA, Series “ISA-62443: Security for industrial automation and control system”   ISO 22301:2012   ISO/IEC 27004:2016   ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011   ISO/IEC 10181-2:1996   ISO/IEC 27033-1:2015   ISO/IEC TR 19791:2010  Energy / Electricity   NIST SP800-82 Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security   ISO 27019 -- Information security management guidelines based on ISO/IEC 27002 for process control  systems specific to the energy utility industry   NERC CIP Series \"Critical Infrastructure Protection Cyber Security\": CIP–002 to CIP-011.

Good Practices for (inter)dependencies  This chapter presents good practices to support stakeholders in assessing (inter)dependencies. These good  practices provide a pragmatic approach to assist OES and DSPs on the one hand and NCAs on the other  hand, taking into account their respective roles and responsibilities in the implementation of the NIS  Directive, with particular emphasis on the assessment of (inter)dependencies  Table 6 Good practices for assessing dependencies and interdependencies  GOOD PRACTICES  OES / DSPs   Operational accounts of dependencies and  interdependencies   Training and awareness   Methodologies and Tools  NCAs   Information sharing   Methodologies and tools   Cyber security intelligence  Good practices for OES and DSPs  OES and DSPs can take pragmatic actions enabling the assessment of (inter)dependencies including:   Operational accounts of (inter)dependencies: At the operational level, OES and DSPs need to develop  an account of their (inter)dependencies. This will require investing in operational, analytical and data- driven (or event-driven) capabilities (e.g. monitoring systems, incident notification practices, etc.)  supporting the identification and analysis of emerging (inter)dependencies in their operations. This  approach addresses, to a certain extent, the lack of data and enables OES and DSPs to further  understand their (inter)dependencies, while enhancing their overall resilience in dealing with security  incidents related to cyber (inter)dependencies After identifying these (inter)dependencies OES and  DSPs should examine whether existing plans for security or for business continuity take them into  account and update these plans accordingly.   Training and Awareness: In order to understand (inter)dependencies, it is necessary to develop a  comprehensive understanding of different operational aspects of OES and DSPs. Moreover, it is  necessary to link policy and regulatory frameworks with environments and operations of OES and  DSPs. This may require specialised skills combining, for example, policy analyses, analytics, risk  assessments, cyber security and so on, including skills concerned with the applications of  methodologies in specific contexts and situations (e.g. incident scenarios). Tailored training and  awareness programmes support developing the skills and practices required in the assessment of  (inter)dependencies.   Methodologies and Tools: OES and DSPs present different (inter)dependencies in their operations.  Although it is challenging to identity generic methodologies and tools that fit all different operational  environments, OES and DSPs would benefit from tailoring and integrating diverse methodologies and  tools that provide support for assessing dependencies and interdependencies.  These recommendations intend to support OES and DSPs in developing and integrating practices for  assessing dependencies and interdependencies. In particular, it is advisable to develop, tailor and integrate  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  42  practices supporting all phases (i.e. Identification and Modelling, Analysis and Measurement, and Impact  Evaluation).  Good practices for NCAs  Due to their roles and responsibilities, NCAs are in a good position to implement practices supporting the  assessment of (inter)dependencies, in particular their cross border identification.   Information Sharing: In order to create cross-sectoral and cross-border approaches, it essential to  support the collaboration and information sharing among NCAs. On the one hand, NCAs may support  ad-hoc collaborations and information sharing in order to support national risk assessment exercises  and to assessing particular cross border dependencies and interdependencies. Working groups under  the leadership of NCAs can also be established. These groups should agree on the kind of data to be  shared and the NCAs could take the burden of performing simulation since they are in a position to  have a better view of the whole system of infrastructures. On the other hand, EU-wide initiatives  (potentially driven by centralised authorities) should encourage and enable the exchange of  information among NCAs and CSIRTs during their operations in order to support the identification and  assessment of emergent cross border (inter)dependencies.   Methodologies and Tools: NCAs have patchy knowledge of cross sector and cross border  (inter)dependencies. The enforcement of the NIS Directive’s security requirements and incident  notification for OES and DSP will better position designated NCAs to identify and assess emergent  (inter)dependencies in operations. This may require them to develop and integrate tailored  methodologies and tools, which would help NCAs in developing a comprehensive account, reflecting  the emergent complexity in operations, of (inter)dependencies. Even if a sophisticated tool or method  is missing, a first step would be to make a workshop or exercise with key representatives of sectors in  order to perform an initial, simplified mapping of dependencies. It is necessary to develop additional  capabilities enabling the assessment of (inter)dependencies. In order to develop and disseminate best  practices (including the experiences of adopting methodologies and tools in specific contexts), the  roles and responsibilities of the Cooperation Group and the CSIRTs Network are essential.   Cyber Security Intelligence: NCAs and CSIRTs can engage constructively with OES and DSPs in order to  guide them in gathering the necessary information (e.g. records of past incidents affecting essential  services) for assessing (inter)dependencies. Moreover, NCAs and CSIRTs may have a convenient  position and active role in sharing critical knowledge about (ongoing) incidents. This would help NCAs  supporting the definition of reaction and mitigation measures, and their cross border adoption by OES  and DSPs. This means supporting a bidirectional information sharing among NCAs, CSIRTs, OES and  DSPs, hence supporting the gathering and dissemination of cyber security intelligence. This also would  encourage OES and DSPs to go beyond mandatory incident notification and to support voluntary  notification in order to enhance the assessment of (inter)dependencies. Cyber security intelligence  would enable NCAs, CSIRTs, OES and DSPs to further develop their technological (e.g. including data  analytics) and organisational structures required for assessing emergent cross sector and cross border  (inter)dependencies.  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  43  7. Conclusions and Recommendations  This report has investigated good practices on (inter)dependencies between OES and DSPs, specifically  how OES and DSPs can identify and assess the potential risks associated with emerging  (inter)dependencies. Taking into account diverse contributions (e.g. literature reviews, interviews with  experts, online surveys), this report also provides a detailed account of the landscape of  (inter)dependencies between OES and DSPs. Moreover, it provides a comprehensive overview of risk  assessment practices, including methodologies that Member States adopted in National Risk Assessments  (NRAs).   Dependencies and Interdependencies. The review of relevant literature and experts’ opinions provide  insights for defining the concepts of dependencies and interdependencies. This report provides  definitions tailored to the analysis of dependencies and interdependencies among OES and DSPs. Such  definitions enable analysing emerging (in particular, cyber) (inter)dependencies across all sectors of  the NIS Directive. Moreover, this report discusses dependencies of OES to DSPs in order to emphasise  emerging digital dependencies across sectors. Overall, this report provides an account that clarifies the  concepts of dependencies and interdependencies of OES and DSPs.   Assessing Dependencies and Interdependencies. Current industry practices highlight key phases –  Identification and Modelling, Analysis and Measurement, and Evaluation of Impact – forming a  systematic process for dependency and interdependency assessment. These phases involve diverse  methodologies and approaches, which allow investigating (inter)dependencies in order to assess their  potential impact on OES and DSPs. Member States and other authorities (e.g. the EC Joint Research  Centre) have adopted similar processes involving specific methodologies for conducting National Risk  Assessments (NRAs). NCAs, OES and DSPs, who may be involved in or conduct related assessments,  have to face various challenges due to the lack of operational data, the complexity of emerging  dependencies and the specificity of methodologies.   Good Practices for Dependencies and Interdependencies. Based on the characterisation of  (inter)dependencies and the review of risk assessment practices, this report discusses challenges and  provides good practices for their assessment. OES, DSPs and NCAs may benefit from the analysis of  such challenges and good practices.  In order to address the challenges that OES, DSPs and NCAs face in the assessment of (inter)dependencies,  this report provides the following recommendations:   OES and DSPs should conduct empirical investigations to collect data: The lack of data represents a  common challenge for assessing (inter)dependencies. Future initiatives should support information  sharing in order to conduct empirical investigations of emerging (inter)dependencies in the operations  of OES and DSPs.   OES, DSPs and NCAs should develop and integrate methodologies and tools: Risk assessment  practices highlight specific phases (i.e. Identification and Modelling, Analysis and Measurement, and  Impact Evaluation) for assessing (inter)interdependencies. Future initiatives should investigate further  how specific methodologies and tools support each phase. In particular, they should provide guidance  how to integrate methodologies and tools in practices across sectors. This also would help tailoring  methodologies and tools to the needs of OES, DSPs and NCAs.   OES and DSPs should promote training and awareness: Another common challenge is due to the need  of specialised expertise in order to assess emerging (inter)dependencies. Future initiatives should  support developing competencies for applying different methodologies and tools in specific  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  44  operational contexts. This also would support further understanding (inter)dependencies among OES  and DSPs.   NCAs should work towards developing a common taxonomy of incident impact assessment: In order  to support the assessment of cross-sector and cross-border incidents, it is necessary to develop a  common taxonomy of incident impact assessment. The implementation of the NIS Directive can  provide a good starting point for providing some harmonisation (e.g. by developing incident  notification mechanisms tailored to the NIS Directive and supporting information sharing across  relevant stakeholders such as OES, DSP, CSIRTs and NCAs).   OES and DSPs should address (inter)dependencies at operational level: OES and DSPs should  integrate (inter)dependencies in their risk assessment and security operations and this should be  reflected in the development of tools, methodologies, skills and the way incidents are presented,  reported and analysed.   NCAs should facilitate information sharing: At a national level, NCAs should facilitate information  exchange about (inter)dependencies, including direct dialogue between (inter)dependent  organisations. At cross-border level, Member States should promote a framework for the exchange of  information regarding cross-border (inter)dependencies that establishes how information exchange  can take place and what type of information is relevant.   OES, DSPs and NCAs should invest on resilience: Boost resilience by developing response  management capabilities and establishing common response and crisis management plans. Member  States should invest on the resilience by addressing redundancy (the availability of alternatives),  diversity of technical implementations and time for recovery.   NCAs should integrate cross-border (inter)dependencies in NRAs: Member States should address  cross-border (inter)dependencies when conducting NRAs by identifying services which create such  dependencies. Identification should be based on a granular process, all relevant parties should be  identified and a national registry of cross-border dependencies should be developed and maintained.

Cross sector dependencies and  interdependencies  Dependencies and interdependencies between OES, between DSPs, and between OES and DSPs  operating in different sectors.  Cyber dependency or  interdependency  A service (or an infrastructure) has a cyber dependency if its state of operation depends on  information and data transmitted through the information service (infrastructure) via electronic or  informational links. Outputs of the information service (infrastructure) are inputs to the other service  (infrastructure), and the commodity passed among the service (infrastructure) assets is information.  Cyber Resilience The overall ability of systems and organisations to withstand cyber events and, where harm is caused,  recover from them Cyber security - the protection of internet-connected systems (to include  hardware, software and associated infrastructure), the data on them, and the services they provide,  from unauthorised access, harm or misuse. This includes harm caused intentionally by the operator of  the system, or accidentally, as a result of failing to follow security procedures or being manipulated  into doing so.  Dependency A linkage or connection between two services (or underlying infrastructures), through which the state  of one service (infrastructure) influences or is correlated to the state of the other.  Digital Service Any Information Society service, that is to say, any service normally provided for remuneration, at a  distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services. For the purposes  of this definition:  (i) ‘at a distance’ means that the service is provided without the parties being simultaneously present;  (ii) ‘by electronic means’ means that the service is sent initially and received at its destination by  means of electronic equipment for the processing (including digital compression) and storage of data,  and entirely transmitted, conveyed and received by wire, by radio, by optical means or by other  electromagnetic means;  (iii) ‘at the individual request of a recipient of services’ means that the service is provided through the  transmission of data on individual request.

Information security incident  management  Processes for detecting, reporting, assessing, responding to, dealing with, and learning from  information security incidents.  Interdependency A bidirectional relationship between two services (or underlying infrastructures) through which the  state of each service (infrastructure) influences or is correlated to the state of the other. More  generally, two services (infrastructures) are interdependent when each is dependent on the other.  Internet Exchange Point (IXP) A network facility which enables the interconnection of more than two independent autonomous  systems, primarily for the purpose of facilitating the exchange of internet traffic; an IXP provides  interconnection only for autonomous systems; an IXP does not require the internet traffic passing  between any pair of participating autonomous systems to pass through any third autonomous system,  nor does it alter or otherwise interfere with such traffic.  Logical dependency or  interdependency  A service (or an infrastructure) is logically dependent if its state of operations depends on the state of  another infrastructure via a mechanism that is not a physical, cyber, or geographic connection. Logical  dependency is attributable to human decisions and actions and is not the result of physical or cyber  processes.

Physical dependency or  interdependency  A service (or an infrastructure) is physically dependent if the state of its operations is dependent on  the material output(s) of another service (infrastructure) through a functional and structural linkage  between the inputs and outputs of two assets: a commodity (i.e. good or service) produced or  modified by one service (infrastructure) – an output – is required by another service (infrastructure)  for its operation – an input.  Risk Any reasonably identifiable circumstance or event having a potential adverse effect on the security of  network and information systems.  Risk Analysis Process to comprehend the nature of risk and to determine the level of risk. Risk analysis provides the  basis for risk evaluation and decisions about risk treatment.

Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  47  TERM DEFINITION  Risk Evaluation Process of comparing the results of risk analysis with risk criteria to determine whether the risk and/or  its magnitude is acceptable or tolerable. Risk evaluation assists in the decision about risk treatment.  Risk Identification Process of finding, recognising and describing risks. Risk identification involves the identification of risk  sources, events, their causes and their potential consequences. Risk identification can involve  historical data, theoretical analysis, informed and expert opinions, and stakeholders’ needs.  Threat Potential cause of an unwanted incident, which may result in harm to a system or organization.  Top-level domain name  registry (TLD)  An entity which administers and operates the registration of internet domain names under a specific  top-level domain.  Value chain A set of activities that a firm operating in a specific sector/sub-sector performs in order to deliver a  valuable product or service for the market. The phases are “production”, “transmission” and  “distribution”.  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  48  Annex B: Research on (inter)dependencies risk assessment methods  Empirical approaches  These approaches involve the use of statistical data as well as expert opinions in order to identify and  capture dependencies and interdependencies. There are different possibilities in order to take an historical  account, such as qualitative approaches based on databases, quantitative approaches (e.g. metrics) for  probabilistic risk assessment and regression analysis for analysing relationships (e.g. emerging  correlations).  Studies with databases involve the analysis of patterns of a given phenomenon, which may be the  interdependence of the infrastructures suggested in failures of some of them, according to information  collected in publications officers, or in the media, in expert surveys, or in other relevant sources. This kind  of work can be useful for characterizing the phenomena and compare their consequences52.  The quantitative metrics are ways of quantifying the interdependence. In this sense, it is common to use  simple ratios to show the direction of faults in infrastructure. For instance, the interaction ration to  measure interdependence relates to the number of times when the problem of one infrastructure affects  another. Researchers have proposed a duration ratio of failure in the service of an infrastructure, on the  duration of the failure in another, with the objective of analysing the direction of the cascade effect that  occurs from a particular failure53. Other authors have used the Pearson's correlation coefficient as the  metric to quantify the intensity of interdependence54.  Probabilistic risk assessments can be used together with decision analysis approaches, incorporating  different groups of interest, to build scenarios that provide information on interdependencies potential55.  An initial event generates a scenario that in turn generates others according to existing interdependencies.  The probabilistic risk assessments include the statistical analysis of historical events, bibliographic review  and inputs of the different interest groups. This focuses on studying the severity and probability of the  event, according to the parameters previously stipulated, considering historical databases. Finally, it is  important to note that methods, such as the probabilistic risk approach, are used to the extent that there  is a lack of sufficient information to apply econometric methodologies. When there is more data that can  be used, for example, some authors have worked with time series to evaluate the interdependencies.

Very similarly,  other authors have proposed the use of Statistical Learning Theory (STL) in case of sufficient information57.  Agent based approaches  Agent-based models are computational models that allow the simulation of actions and interactions of  autonomous individuals within an environment, and allow to determine what effects they produce in the  system as a whole. An agent-based model adopts a bottom-up approach to analyse the complex  architecture and adaptive behaviours of the components of infrastructure systems. Agent-based  approaches have the capability to model down to the level of a single component of an infrastructure  system as well as the behaviour of a decision-maker. Through discrete-event simulations, such methods  can capture all kinds of the interdependencies among infrastructure systems58. One of the major  advantages of using agent-based methods is that they can provide flexible scenario-based what-if analyses  assessing the effectiveness of different strategies. They can also be integrated with other modelling  techniques to provide a detailed analysis. Our research suggests that agent-based methods can be applied  to a range of decision contexts involving a host of stakeholder concerns. However, agent-based  approaches present some challenges. The modeller needs to make some strong assumptions about the  behaviour of an agent, and, in some cases, such assumptions are hard to justify. In order to properly  calibrate the parameters of a simulation model, agent-based methods require a large set of detailed data  about infrastructure systems and agent behaviour; it is sometimes difficult to collect such detailed  information on infrastructure performance particularly when the relevant infrastructures have data  sensitive to public safety and/or stakeholder interests. Considering this context, it is possible to develop  models that include networks of agents of different classes (firms, households) with particular emphasis on  how they use the particular infrastructures, and how these agents and infrastructures respond to  hypothetical faults. For its development, economic and infrastructure in standardized databases, to then  create the simulations during normal conditions and disruptive events59.  System dynamics based approaches  Models based on system dynamics are another technique of modelling complex systems. The  conceptualisation is based on the feedback, or circular causality between observable variables. Because of  its structure, it is possible to represent these models using traditional mathematical language, with a set of  algebraic equations whose variables are properties of the modelled system. The problem lies in identifying  the causal links. Circuits, stocks and feedback flows must be differentiated. Circuits are the connections or  directions of the effects and stocks are the amounts in the system, whose levels are given by the flows  56 Dueñas-Osorio et al.

With this kind of models, it is possible to analyse the consequences of a failure of a  sector / infrastructure in others and in the economy in general60.  The product input matrix describes the equilibrium behaviour of regional and national economies. It is a  useful tool to describe the interactive nature between different systems of the economy and can obviously  be used for analysing the interdependencies in infrastructure. In practice, this model aims to use  information of input product of national accounts to estimate the impact of failures of an infrastructure in  another and study the spread of that impact. A further step consists of having computable general  equilibrium models61, and even having spatial equilibrium models computable in general62. Research  provides also instances of system-based models for capturing dependencies in critical infrastructures63.  Economic theory based approaches  There are different models that take into account economic indicators in order to assess various aspects of  services. For example, utility theory provides a modelling approach for assessing alternative choices and  supporting decision making. Utility theory modes services and their properties by functions (i.e. the utility  functions) in order to assess the results according to assumed behaviours (e.g. consumer behaviour,  service demand, etc.). The objective is often to maximise the utility function assuming that it corresponds  to best choice (that is, the highest utility satisfaction).  The input-output model provides another approach for assessing various economic indicators from a  functional viewpoint. In particular, rather than assessing individual services, the input-output model  provides a quantitative economic approach for capturing and assessing interdependencies between  different branches of a national economy or different regional economies. The input-output model is also  useful for assessing the risks associated with interdependencies of critical activities (including essential  services) across Member States. For example, the JRC has adopted the input-output model for conducting  a national risk assessment64. The reported risk assessment involved evaluating emerging  interdependencies among critical sectors (e.g. electricity, telecom, water supply and distribution, road  transport, etc.) in different disruptive scenarios (e.g. blackout, gas leak, earthquake and explosion).  Network based approaches  In network-based models, infrastructures are modelled as networks, composed of nodes and arcs, with  goods flowing between them (represented by flows). In these models, the services are desired levels of the  60 Bush, B., Dauelsberg, L., Leclaire, R., Powell, D., Deland, S., and Samsa, M.

Network based approaches are usually divided into those whose objective is a  structural analysis and those who are intended to perform a functional analysis. The former analyse the  design of the infrastructure and the relationship between designs, and the latter consider operational  issues. This class of models is useful to analyse how critical a certain location is, in case of a certain failure,  and perform vulnerability analysis. It is also possible to create a link with the use of geographic information  data65.  Infrastructure systems can be represented by networks, where nodes or vertices represent different  components of a system and links or edges represent relationships among them. Network based  approaches can analyse interdependencies through different analytical techniques. Through network  based approaches, intuitive representations of critical infrastructures are possible by providing the  detailed descriptions of their structures and flow patterns. In these approaches, individual component  failures of a single infrastructure under a disruption can be modelled and the performance response of the  infrastructure system can be analysed. Network based approaches can be divided into two groups: (a)  topology based approaches, and (b) flow based approaches.  These modelling and simulation based approaches can be used for vulnerability assessment of large scale  data sets of infrastructure systems. However, such approaches are limited since they ignore the functional  relationships among the different elements of the network missing vital information about infrastructure  performance. Flow-based methods, on the other hand, can capture the flow characteristics of  interdependent infrastructures, and provide more realistic descriptions on their operation mechanisms.  However, these approaches are not scalable since when the network is modelled in detail the  computational cost to analyse it is very high.  Service based approaches  Service based approaches capture interdependencies on the basis of exchange of services between  infrastructures of the same or different sector. For example, transport infrastructure depends on services  from electricity infrastructure and if the amount of provided service falls below a certain threshold then  the disruption propagates to the dependent infrastructure. This enables the development of a sector  agnostic analysis framework which can be applied without entering into the details of the underlying  physics and flow models. The amount of a service disruption for a given scenario can be provided by other  more detailed models (i.e. flow models) or from expert judgement.  Comparative analysis of different approaches  The aforementioned methodologies based on five criteria: amount of data needed, accessibility of data,  types of (inter)dependencies surveyed, computational cost and maturity of investigations. Regarding  data, most methodologies are intensive in the use of information, though the ones with a structural  approach require the least amount of data. At the other extreme, there are the simulation-based models.  Regarding the type of interdependencies studied, the models that have a broader scope are those based  on the product input matrix, since consider the geographical and logical interdependencies. The rest, in  most of their variants, limit their study to the four different types of dependencies (i.e. physical, cyber,  geographic and logical). In terms of computational cost and complexity, those less intensive in this regard  are the empirical approaches in general, in the same way that the approach that uses the product input  65 Ouyang, M.; Dueñas-Osorio, L.

Agent-based models and  Network-based, flow-based models are the more cost intensive approaches. It is important to point out  here that there is a proposal to unify and consolidate current research on analysis of interdependencies  based on a five dimensional framework66: system analysis, behaviour analysis, knowledge discovery,  visualisation and information sharing. These methodologies support the identification and modelling of  dependencies and interdependencies in order to assess the associated risks67.  66 Bagheri, E., Ghorbani, A. A.

These standards have been chosen because look at  three different areas particularly affected by dependencies and interdependencies. Indeed, as shown in  Figure 13 COBIT5 deals with Enterprise and IT goals; ISO/IEC 27002 deals with ICT Security Controls and  finally; the NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides a substrate of cybersecurity controls that bring the  other two standards together.  Figure 13 Intersections between ISO/IEC 27002, NIST Cybersecurity Framework and COBIT5  C.1 COBIT5  COBIT stands for ‘Control Objectives for Information and related Technology’. Its fifth and latest version was  launched in April 2012. The mission of COBIT is “to research, develop, publish and promote a set of control  objectives generally accepted for information technologies that are authorized (given by someone with authority),  updated, and international for the day-to-day use of business managers (also managers) and auditors”. This means  that not only managers and auditors, but also general users, can benefit from the development. Indeed, COBIT5  can help them to understand their Information Systems (or information technologies) and decide the level of  security and control that is necessary to protect the assets of their companies through the development of a  model of administration of information technologies. These are the elements of COBIT5:   Framework: COBIT5 Organizes IT governance objectives and good practices by IT domains and processes  and links them to business requirements.   Process Model: COBIT5 is a reference process model and common language for everyone in an  organization. The processes map to responsibility areas of plan, build, run, and monitor.   Maturity model: COBIT5 assesses maturity and capability per process and helps to address gaps.   Controls: COBIT5 provides a complete set of high-level controls to be considered for the effective  management of each IT process.  Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs  November 2018  54   Guidelines: COBIT5 helps assign responsibility, agree on objectives, measure performance, and illustrate  interrelationship with other processes.  COBIT5 defines a set of generic processes for the management of IT. Each process is formulated based on  process inputs and outputs, key process-activities, process objectives, performance measures and an  elementary maturity model. The framework also provides a set of recommended best practices for  governance and control process of information systems and technology with the essence of aligning IT  with business. In this regard, the business orientation of COBIT5 consists of linking IT goals to the general  business goals of the stakeholders, identifying the associated responsibilities of business and IT process  owners and providing metrics and maturity models to measure their achievement.  C.2 ISO/IEC 27000/1/2 Standards  ISO/IEC put in place an Information Security Management System family of standards in order to tackle  constantly evolving information security issues faced by organizations. The series provides specific controls  and recommendations in order to manage adequately security risks. The series is deliberately broad in  scope, covering more than just privacy, confidentiality and IT/technical/cybersecurity issues. It is applicable  to organizations of all shapes and sizes. All organizations are encouraged to assess their information risks,  then treat them according to their needs, using the guidance and suggestions where relevant. Given the  dynamic nature of information risk and security, the ISMS concept incorporates continuous feedback and  improvement activities to respond to changes in the threats, vulnerabilities or impacts of incidents.  In the family, particularly relevant for the purposes of this study is ISO/IEC 27002, Code of practice for  information security controls. The latter is essentially a detailed catalogue of information security controls  that might be managed through Information Security Management Systems. It provides best practice  recommendations on information security controls for use by those responsible for initiating,  implementing or maintaining ISMS. Information security is defined within the standard in the context of  the Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability triad.  C.3 NIST Cybersecurity Framework  The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is US Government guidance for private sector organizations that own,  operate, or supply critical infrastructure. It provides a reasonable base level of cyber security. It establishes  basic processes and essential controls for cybersecurity. It is designed for individual businesses and other  organizations to use to assess risks they face.  The framework is composed of three main components “Core”, “Profile” and “Tiers”. The “Framework  Core” contains an array of activities, outcomes and references about aspects and approaches to cyber  security. The “Framework Implementation Tiers” are used by an organization to clarify for itself and its  partners how it views cybersecurity risk and the degree of sophistication of its management approach. A  “Framework Profile” is a list of outcomes that an organization has chosen from the categories and  subcategories, based on its needs and risk assessments.  An organization typically starts by using the framework to develop a “Current Profile” which describes its  cybersecurity activities and what outcomes it is achieving. It can then develop a “Target Profile”, or adopt a  baseline profile tailored to its sector (e.g. infrastructure industry) or type of organization. It can then define  steps switch from its current profile to its target profile.

It first provides background on such competitions, their structure and variations. Analyses  of recent competitions is then conducted, comprising an in-depth qualitative analysis of notable  events (22 in total) and a high-level statistical analysis of a large dataset of public events of all  levels (879 in total).  The results show a great deal of variation in some areas:   team size   challenge categories   scoring methodology   hosting of event online vs. in-person   use of qualifier rounds   inclusion of peripheral activities   communication channels for media strategy  By contrast, little variation was seen in:   entry restrictions (usually only upon location)   diversity policy (mostly absent)   format (typically a ‘Jeopardy’ format)   prizes (usually provided)   duration (events typically spanning a single day or a few days)  The report discusses the findings and proposes topics for consideration during event design. In  particular:  Team sizes: Hard limits may not be necessary and unbounded team sizes are seen in  notable events.  Formats: Recognised formats promote east of understanding among participants.  Formats have commonly-associated scoring methodologies and challenge categories,  which can act as a starting point for event design.  Parallel Competitions: Running parallel events with a different focus (different audience  or different challenge type) can broaden appeal easily.  Range of Media: Public engagement strategies benefit from a range of media. Inclusion of  CTF specific venues (such as that used in the statistical analysis) is recommended to best  reach the CTF community.  Release of Data: Retrospective release of challenges, solutions, competition metrics and  lessons-learned are helpful to the wider community.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  3  TABLE OF CONTENTS  1.

INTRODUCTION  1.1 SUMMARY  This report describes capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions and their contemporary use in cyber  security education and recreation worldwide. It provides background on CTFs and describes the  various competition formats and practices.  It reports on an analysis of recent competitions; both an in-depth qualitative examination of a  selection of major events and a quantitative analysis of a large, public dataset of events. The  analysis describes a range of aspects including formats, challenge types, platforms, event  structures, entry requirements and team composition. To create this report, a survey of previous  significant competitions was performed and each event was tagged according to a number of  research themes and questions. In addition, statistics were obtained from public datasets and  used to perform a general analysis of CTF events.  Based on the results of the analysis, different events and their practices are compared and  contrasted; to find commonalities and identify design decisions and their trade-offs. The report  concludes by making recommendations for consideration during event design.  1.2 STRUCTURE  This report is structured into the following sections:   Background: An outline of CTF competitions and formats to give background for later  sections. In particular, the challenge types, scoring systems and formats of both  \"Jeopardy\" and \"Attack-Defence\" events are detailed.   Methodology: A full description of the methodology used in this report, including data  themes, an explanation and justification of data sources, and methods used in the  statistical analysis.   Results: A per-theme analysis of the manually gathered data on each individual event,  together with summaries of the results of the statistical data gathered.   Discussion: A discussion of the results, including trends and consideration of the  differences between the two datasets produced by this report.   Conclusions: Conclusions drawn for running future CTF events based on the data  and analysis gathered in this report.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  6  2. BACKGROUND  A Capture-The-Flag (CTF) is a competitive computer security event where participants compete  in security-themed challenges for the purpose of obtaining the highest score [1] [2]. There are a  number of formats in common use. The CTF name derives from the outdoor game, in which  participants seek to find and retrieve a physical \"flag\", and its similarity to early \"wargaming\" and  \"king-of-the-hill\" cyber security competitions. Today, the CTF term encompasses a range of  competition types and targets a wide audience. A renowned CTF has been run at the DEF CON  security conference since 1996 and a calendar of events takes place, online and at physical  sites, throughout the year.  CTFs take many forms, but the most common forms are Jeopardy and Attack-Defence [3],  which are described in detail below. The information in this section is informed by the  experience of the authors in participating in and organising events, by the results of the  analyses of the report, and by the related work cited.  2.1 JEOPARDY  Jeopardy CTFs [2] [4] [5], the most common format for current competitions, contain a set of  custom-made, artificial challenges created specifically for the event. Participants tackle each  challenge as a stand-alone problem, and a solving a challenge results in a flag, which can be  submitted to a scoring system for a number of points.  2.1.1 Format  Jeopardy challenges are highly variable and the only key property is that they should grant  access to one (or more) flags when solved. Challenges are typically completely independent of  each other (although they may have multiple parts), and participants are able to solve them,  broadly, in any order. Each challenge consists of some downloadable files, a remote server, or  both. When remote servers are present, participants are not able to impact the performance of  the server for other teams, so that each team participants in the competition independently.  Challenges that consist only of files will usually contain the flag embedded into the  downloadable file and participants are expected to use any means to find the flag within the  files. When a remote server is present, participants are typically expected to perform a remote  exploit on the server to recover the flag, and there may be downloadable files (such as  challenge source code, or compiled binaries), that aid them in the attempt.  Challenges vary across a large and diverse number of categories, and the flexible format of the  contest allows for a wide degree of variation in challenges. Some common categories are  expected in any CTF, while less-common categories may appear depending on the theme or  format of the event. In particular, more difficult events tend to be more focused on categories  that replicate real exploits (such as pwn, web and re), while beginner-focused events have  more scope for categories that explore more gamified areas (often under the grouping of misc  challenges). Some of the most common categories include [6]:  2.1.1.1 pwn  Deriving their name from \"owning\" services, these challenges replicate attacks on real  vulnerable services. In some cases, these challenges may involve performing the compromise  of a piece of known-vulnerable software, but more often they are custom binaries that are  developed to showcase a particularly interesting exploit. These challenges are solved by  participants by interacting with a remote server, usually over a command line. In easier  challenges, participants may be given access to the compiled binary running on the target, or  even the source code directly. In harder challenges, participants will be given no information  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  7  other than access to the remote service. An example challenge might give participants access  to a remote server which runs a binary vulnerable to a buffer overflow. Overflowing the buffer  would cause the binary to crash and consequently output the flag.  2.1.1.2 re (or reversing)  These challenges involve reverse engineering a piece of software in order to extract the flag.  They differ most clearly from pwn challenges in that they typically have no remote service to  compromise, so participants are required to extract a flag directly from a downloaded binary.  These challenges offer an opportunity for participants to practice understanding of unknown,  compiled code and may involve discovering a flag hidden in the code, or may require  understanding how a piece of software operates in order to cause it to act in a certain way.  Solutions to these challenges may require creating patches to modify the compiled code to  change the way it runs and cause it to output the flag.  2.1.1.3 web  Web challenges follow the same pattern as pwn challenges, but involve a target that runs a  web server, usually serving over HTTP, and often backed by other common web technologies  such as a database. Participants exploit the web server and cause it to provide the flag. In  contrast to pwn challenges, these challenges rarely involve low-level exploits of the web server  itself; participants will rarely gain shell access to the server. Instead, these usually involve  attacks on the web pages themselves, with SQL injection and PHP vulnerabilities common  themes in this category.  2.1.1.4 crypto  Cryptography challenges are similar to re challenges but involve reverse engineering of a  particular cryptographic protocol or implementation. These challenges can take the form of  encrypted messages that must be broken, or access to a flawed implementation of a  cryptographic protocol on a service which can be exploited to cause it to reveal secret keys.  2.1.1.5 forensics  Forensics challenges involve participants investigating an unknown piece of data, usually  determining the format of the data and then finding or building a tool capable of reading the  information. In these challenges, the flag is usually contained but obfuscated inside the  downloadable files and participants must understand the format in order to read the flag. There  are many varieties of challenges in this category, including reverse engineering corrupted file  formats, mounting obscure drive formats and finding hidden files, and investigating patterns in  recorded web traffic.  2.1.1.6 misc  Miscellaneous challenges that do not fall into other categories. These challenges are popular  for newer participants and beginner CTFs, where they can help participants get used to the  format of CTF competitions and teach introductory skills. Miscellaneous challenges are typically  more gamified than other categories and often offer a chance for organisers to include more  interesting, though less realistic, challenges. Examples vary hugely but might include reading  the source code for a simple maze generator and solving the maze, or interacting with a service  in a highly unusual way, such as via images.  2.1.1.7 programming  Some challenges are designed particularly to test the participants ability to write code. These  are less common and challenges of this nature are less favoured, in preference for challenges  in other categories that may require a programmed solution. This may be a response to the  popularity of programming-specific hackathon competitions, distinct from security-focused CTF  events.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  8  2.1.1.8 physical  In-person events may include physical challenges that involve the participants interacting with  something in the real world. This may be security-focused, or intended to encourage  participants to interact with each other or explore the area. Examples of security-focused  challenges include performing wire-taps of Ethernet cables, intercepting WiFi traffic, and the  perennial-favourite of picking locks. Interaction-focused challenges might include giving parts of  a flag to each team so they must trade parts with each other, or hiding flags on QR codes  around the event location. Interaction-focused challenges are less preferred in higher skill  competitions in favour of more competitive challenges.  Flags are usually a string of text in a standardised format. This enables participants to know  when the challenge is successfully solved, and means that the entire process is automated  without the need for a judging process. Flag formats are standardised so that participants do not  need to guess what the flag is once the challenge is solved. While some competitions may use  answers to questions as flags (e.g., \"which IP tried to attack the server?\") this is less popular  and can be a frequent source of confusion and ambiguity. Most competitions embed flags into  challenges in such a way that a successful solution to the challenge results in a clear flag that  can be submitted. To this end, flags often begin and end with a published string, for instance  often taking the format `[CTF Name]{[Flag Text]}`.  In this case, the `Flag Text` contains a  challenge-specific string, typically taking one of two formats:   A random string of text: This has the benefit of being un-guessable and requiring  participants to solve to find the entire flag rather than a partial string. In some  challenges, participants may be able to recover half the flag easily, but not the whole  flag.   A word or phrase: In some competitions, the flag text is a short phrase, often a joke or  a play on words involving the challenge and its solution. While enjoyable for  participants, these can be susceptible to guessing, particularly where participants are  able to get part of the flag and infer the rest.  2.1.2 Scoring  Each successful challenge completion results in the participant gaining access to a flag [6]. This  flag can be submitted to a scoring system which then rewards the participant with some number  of points. The number of points rewarded varies according to the rules of the competition, and  may be affected by:   A base score for the challenge, which may be constant across challenges or selected  by the organiser to reflect the perceived difficulty of the competition.   The time taken to solve the challenge, with challenges decreasing in value as time  goes on; in some cases, special challenges may be released that must be solved  within a given period.   The number of teams that have already solved the challenge. This is mostly commonly  a reward for the first team to solve that particular challenge (sometimes referred to as a  \"first blood\" award), but may be a decreasing amount of points awarded as more  teams solve the challenge.   The number of teams that ever solve the challenge. Many CTFs award the final points  based on the number of teams that have solved the challenge by the end of the  competition. This means that the value of a challenge varies over time (including for  teams that have already solved it). By doing this, the number of successful solves of a  challenge acts as a proxy for the difficulty of the challenge, and teams are rewarded  more for solving challenges that fewer teams solve.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  9  In addition to awarding points, some competitions award prizes to the first solutions of particular  challenges; this is often done in conjunction with sponsor-provided challenges, who will provide  a prize for the team that is first to solve the challenge.  Each team's score is the sum of their awarded scores for each challenge, and the winning team  is decided by the highest score at the end of the competition.  2.1.3 Discussion  Jeopardy CTFs offer an excellent platform for engaging participants of all levels. Because  participant teams interact with the challenges independently of each other, participants are not  blocked from solving problems by the success of other teams. As a result, even the lowest-  scoring teams are able to engage with, and benefit from, the experience. The wide variety of  categories and difficulties makes it easy for organisers to ensure that all participants are catered  to, irrespective of background or skill level. The flexible nature of challenges also make these  competitions suitable for a variety of time-frames, particularly when participants are spread  across time-zones. Participants can start and stop their participation during the contest as  required, with no pressure to participate at te same time as other teams. Teams can distribute  tasks amongst team members, either as individuals or groups, and approach multiple problems  at once.  In contrast to other formats, however, Jeopardy competitions are more gamified and less  representative of realistic security skillsets, although this can largely be mitigated by organisers  choosing suitable challenges. When teams participate in Jeopardy contests it is possible (and  not uncommon) for each member to tackle different categories of challenges. Consequently, the  co-operation between team members may be minimal and there may be little interaction  between team members during a competition.  2.1.4 Variants  There are a number of Jeopardy variants currently in use, with varying degrees of popularity  2.1.4.1 Hack Quest  Hack Quests are a Jeopardy variant where participants are guided through a series of  challenges, often with a (loose) story that ties them together. In this format, participants solve  each challenge in turn and are granted access to the next challenge upon completion of the  previous. Hack Quests are often targeted towards beginners, and act as an introduction to the  CTF format. By guiding players through challenges in order, organisers can assist new  participants through easy challenges and slowly increase difficulty. Associated stories and  thematic elements allow for more engaging content, particularly for players who may be slow to  solve challenges. Hack Quests may be run alongside other events, enabling the involvement of  teams who are not able to participate in the full event (either by not having an invitation or not  being capable of solving the challenges). A notable example is the Google CTF, which has a  Beginner's Quest event designed for new CTF participants.  2.1.4.2 Vulnerable VMs  While most Jeopardy competitions consist of independent challenges, a common variant is to  provide contestants with one or more vulnerable Virtual Machines, which teams are then able to  attack to secure flags. This is categorised here as Jeopardy because the participants are not  required to defend a virtual machine, and so the existence of challenges on virtual machines  acts more as a challenge distribution platform than a fundamental change in the format of the  competition.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  10  2.1.4.3 Quiz-style  Some competitions adapt the Jeopardy format slightly by asking questions about the challenges  to participants which must be answered to score points. These may be objective, and judged  automatically, or subjective and be given to a jury to award points.  2.2 ATTACK-DEFENCE  In an Attack-Defence CTF [2] [5], teams are given access to a set of target hosts [7]. The  objective of each participant team is to take and maintain control over as many of the target  hosts as possible. To enable this, challenge organisers will deploy or create a range of  vulnerable services, ensuring that each target contains one or more vulnerabilities.  Teams must balance the need to attack other hosts and accrue more points, with the need to  patch vulnerable services on hosts they already control -- preventing other teams from  compromising those hosts instead.  This was the earliest CTF format, having grown from  'wargame' activities in military and hacker communities. Because of the complexity required in  setting up and running events of this format, together with the comparatively-high security risks  involved, Attack-Defence CTFs are more common for invitational or private events, and  infrequent in public events.  2.2.1 Format  In this format, participants are tasked with successfully compromising (and subsequently  securing) target servers. Each server contains one or more vulnerable services, which may be  based either on real-world vulnerabilities or novel vulnerabilities created by the organisers.  Participants in an Attack-Defence CTF are tasked with performing compromises on systems  designed to look and act like real servers running real services.  Attack-Defence CTFs are also unusual in that participants are expected to hold control of the  target, and so to perform defensive actions such as patching or mitigating vulnerabilities. Teams  may be expected to deploy specific patches to vulnerable software, which might range from  updating off-the-shelf vulnerable software, through to writing and applying patches directly to  custom services. They may also be expected to perform general network-hardening measures,  such as updating firewall rules, resetting or strengthening passwords, and disabling unwanted  or untrusted services or users.  Teams may begin the competition already in control of some or all of the target hosts. In some  styles, every host is always under the control of its original owner, and teams are rewarded for  repeatedly performing exploits against other hosts over time, encouraging teams to fix their  vulnerabilities to prevent attacks from gaining further points from that attack.  2.2.2 Scoring  Points are typically awarded on a regular interval (for example, every minute), with each team  receiving a certain number of points for each host they control at that moment. This encourages  participants to compromise, and subsequently protect, the servers in the contest. Competition  rules typically require services to remain active and available in order for points to be awarded,  to prevent teams from simply disabling vulnerable services.  2.2.3 Discussion  Attack-Defence CTFs offer a very practical model of real security scenarios, with participants  gaining experience of both red-teaming and blue-teaming. Competitions in this form are often  less artificial or gamified, particularly in contrast to the more-popular Jeopardy contests.  Attack-  Defence competitions are more suitable for spectators and live events, as observers can  witness the changing control of servers throughout the event. Participants, tasked with a more  rounded set of objectives, must also manage their time, splitting their attention between seeking  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  11  targets, compromising them, and defending their own servers. This makes them especially  suitable to team events, particularly when building or testing team cohesion is desired.  Events in this format can be more daunting to new-comers and have a higher barrier to entry.  Because of the requirement to fit challenges into the format of a practical vulnerability in a  service, challenge designers have less freedom and so are less able to make challenges that  cater to beginners. Compounding this, the directly-adversarial nature of Attack-Defence  challenges, where participants seek to directly compromise the servers of other teams, have  significant consequences when participant skill levels are imbalanced; overly-capable teams  have the ability to quickly overtake servers and make them all-but-impenetrable to the other  teams, resulting in contests that are decided very quickly. As participants can only make  progress by capturing the servers of other teams, it is possible that some teams are then unable  to perform any successful exploits during the entire contest.  Establishing and running successful Attack-Defence CTFs presents more difficulties than that of  formats such as Jeopardy. Participants are granted access to the target hosts, usually via a  Virtual Private Network (VPN) architecture, with the aim of isolating malicious traffic and  preventing accidental attacks on non-targets. Despite these precautions, participants must still  take care to target their exploits onto strictly in-scope targets.  2.2.4 Variants  2.2.4.1 Exploit Contest  Moving further than even the limited gamification of Attack-Defence CTFs, some competitions  encourage participants to directly attack real software to discover unknown vulnerabilities.  These contest therefore act like time-limited bug bounty programmes, with participants  performing valuable security research by participating. Participants in these contests have found  vulnerabilities in many well-known and widely-used pieces of software.  2.2.4.2 Wargames  Wargames are closely related to Attack-Defence CTFs, but are less gamified and have a  stronger focus on capability-building, particularly in the context of training security teams with  realistic experience. Wargames are frequently defender-focused, in contrast to the greater focus  on attackers in Attack-Defence competitions. When red-teams are present, they are usually  considered part of the organisers and not participants in their own right. While these are  significant and important events, they have a different role to most CTF competitions and so are  not typically categorised as CTF events.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  12  3. REPORT METHODOLOGY  To perform the analysis presented in this report, three sources were used. Firstly, the survey of  members from the International Cyber Security Challenge (ICSC)1 provided overall guidance  towards the events and methodology used throughout the rest of the data gathering. Secondly,  a manual selection, analysis and coding of important events was performed. Details on the  selection criteria and coding used is explained below. Thirdly, to build context into the report  statistical analysis of existing events was performed on a large dataset. For this purpose, the  selection criteria were broader in order to sample as many events as possible.  3.1 MANUAL ANALYSIS  The manual data-gathering and analysis component of this report follows a thematic analysis  [8]. Themes were pre-determined based on the requirements of the report and the experience  of the report writers in similar events. This was performed in favour of a grounded theory  approach due to the specific requirements of the ICSC Steering Committee and subsequent  need to gather data around specific themes. In particular, it is intended that the themes selected  provide readers with sufficient detail about all aspects of the organisation of CTF events.  The core data source for this report is the manual analysis of a set of CTF events. Events were  chosen via selection criteria and then researched via public information available about the  event. Before events were found, a set of key themes and questions within each theme were  determined based around key event information, the specified requirements of the report, the  requirements of the ICSC Steering Committee, and the data likely to be accessible and  practical. Data was initially stored as unstructured text per-question. Once data had been  gathered for each event and question pairing, the results for each question were aggregated  and grouped across events into a set of non-exclusive tags. At this point, the data was  standardised into a database containing the set of appropriate tags for each question and event.  This structured data formed the basis for subsequent analysis and presentation in this report.  3.1.1 Selection criteria  Events were selected according to a set of criteria to ensure a balanced selection. In particular,  the following were considered for each event:  3.1.1.1 Competition Format  Events were selected only if they were Capture-the-Flag events, as defined in the Background  section above. In particular, events were excluded if they were not security-themed, such as  hackathons (which primarily relate to development) or programming contests (whose challenges  are selected for requiring particularly challenging programming). Capture-the-Flags in all the  formats described in the Background section were included, with the exception of Wargames,  which were excluded because they are typically organised as training exercises for established  security teams, rather than open-format contests. In particular, events with both Jeopardy and  Attack-Defence formats were sought. This criterion was intended to give a broad range of  Capture-the-Flag events, without including similar formats that differ in theme or content.  3.1.1.2 Online and In-Person  Preference was made for events that took place in-person, and events that took place solely  online were not included unless: they were related to an in-person event (for instance, they  1 The International Cyber Security Challenge is a CTF-type of event to be hosted by ENISA in Athens in late 2021. Several  agencies, universities and governmental institutions from all regions participate in the Steering Committee which is  responsible for the organisation of the event.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  13  were used to invite participants to in-person events); they had been run in-person in previous  years; or they had been intended to run in-person but had been forced to move online to due  disruption from COVID-19. Because of the significant logistical differences between online and  in-person events, data relating to online-only events was considered less applicable to the  purposes of this report. The comparative abundance of online events, however, make them  beneficial when considering challenge formats, which are typically more consistent between  online and in-person events. In particular, the context-building statistical analysis considered  more online events, and the statistical differences between online and in-person events are  detailed later.  3.1.1.3 Significance  Events were selected only if they were significant according to one of the following tests: they  had a considerable number of participants, either as part of their final event or qualifiers; they  were used as a qualification event into a significant event, such as the European Cyber Security  Challenge; they were run, officially or unofficially, as a national-level contest, particularly when  used as a selection method for a national team.  3.1.1.4 Availability of Information  To facilitate the success of this report, events were only researched where it was apparent that  sufficient information about them was available publicly online. Including events that did not  meet this criterion would necessarily have lead to a decrease in the confidence in the  conclusions drawn. Due to the wide sampling and significant range of events that met the  criteria specified, it was deemed possible to select enough events for a significant analysis  without relying on events for which insufficient or low-quality data could be gathered. In  particular, when gathering potential candidates for analysis, each candidate was considered  suitable if it had one or more of the following: a published and accessible document of rules; a  published and accessible schedule of the event; sufficient trustworthy reporting, either by the  organisers or by third parties. This enabled the analysis to avoid working with events for which  little or no information could be determined, and in practice almost all candidate events passed  this criterion.  3.1.1.5 Explicit Mention in Survey  Events that were explicitly mentioned in the survey were considered even if they did not meet  other selection criteria. The majority of events mentioned in the survey had been included  through the previous criteria.  3.1.1.6 Location  Location was not used as a selection criterion and events from anywhere in the world were  included. This was a particular specification of this report, and effort was made to ensure that  events represented locations across the world.  3.1.2 Data sources  Data for each event was gathered primarily from public information released by the organisers.  For this purpose, two primary documents were sought for each event analysed:   A detailed rules document. These documents typically contain, implicitly or explicitly,  information about the format of the competition. This can include duration, team  information, selection criteria for participants, challenge formats, competition format,  and other information. Because of the formal structure of most events, almost every  event surveyed had a published rules document, and working from this structured data  improved the subsequent quality of our data gathering.   Published schedules: Events often publish detailed schedules, either as information for  participants or as marketing material (particularly where external sponsors are involved  in aspects of the schedule). Schedules provided detailed information about the length  of the competition and any organiser-planned activities during the event.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  14  On top of these documents, information was gathered from other sources published by event  organisers:   Almost every event found contained a public webpage detailing the event, either as a  post-event summary or as a record of pre-event marketing and information. These  websites were a source for general information about events but often lacked specific  details, except when contained within the documents listed above.   In some cases, particularly open-format events, access into the platforms used during  the event was still available. This enabled direct data gathering, particularly when  concerned with challenge formats and information. Where platforms contained a record  of organiser communication during the events, a considerable about of information  across data themes could be gathered directly or by inference from records of public  communications.  In some events, little event information was published by the organisers. This was more  common for events that were not open to participation applications, such as in directly  invitational events. While the majority of these events would fail to pass the stated availability of  information selection criteria, some events had sufficient data published about them from third-  party sources. In particular, news articles reporting the outcome of the event frequently contain  some information about the structure and format of the event.  In some cases, direct experience with the events being researched was available and in these  cases this was used to inform the data gathering.  3.1.3 Themes  Once events had been selected and filtered according to the selection criteria, they were  researched individually through the sources described above. During the research of each  event, data in a specific set of themes was gathered. Furthermore, each theme consisted of a  set of questions. Each question was answered in free-text by researchers during the  compilation process, before any coding was performed. Each theme was established in order to  address the general concerns of this report. Questions were determined by considering the  information that would be most beneficial towards the aim of the analysis and report, with  concern for the practicality of gathering the data via the identified sources.  Questions were gathered into themes in order to aggregate limited information into workable  collections, and to provide structure to the data gathering and analysis process. Consequently,  this report is laid out with these themes in mind, and analysis is broken down by theme to aid  comprehensibility and make clear the connection between gathered data and conclusions  drawn.  3.1.3.1 Theme 1 – Entry Requirements  Participants for all events studied were required to meet some set of entry requirements in order  to participate. In particular, events frequently had age requirements or the requirement to be at  a particular school level. Data was gathered on the following questions:  Age: Did the event have specific age requirements for participants, either as an upper-  or lower- bound on the ages of participants? Were teams all required to be the same  age? Were teams of different ages put into different competition categories?  Status: Did the event require participants to be a member of a particular organisation,  such as a school or university? Were teams of different status put into different  competition categories? Did participants have to have demonstrated previous success  at other events? This does not include succeeding at an event-specific qualifier.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  15  Qualifications: Did the event require participants to hold any particular qualifications?  Were they required to pass any tests, either formal or informal, in order to attend? This  does not include successfully competing at other events.  Location: Did the event require participants to be of a particular nationality, or reside in  a particular country? Did the event have different prizes or categories for participants  from different locations?  3.1.3.2 Theme 2 - Diversity and Inclusion  To address diversity requirements, and improve inclusion across a variety of measures, events  sometimes published information about efforts made to encourage, or improve access for,  under-represented groups. In particular, many events have had a significant gender imbalance  and had considerably more male participants. Data was gathered on the following questions:  Gender: Did the event have competition rules designed to encourage female  participation? Did the event have competition structure designed to encourage female  participation, such as grouping participants by gender?  Socio-economic: Did the event have competition rules designed to equalise socio-  economic disadvantages? Did the event make considerations for participants with  socio-economic disadvantages?  Ethnicity: Did the event have competition rules designed to encourage  underrepresented ethnicities?  3.1.3.3 Theme 3 - Challenge Format  Data was gathered regarding the format of challenges; that is, specifically relating to the  competition itself and how participants competed, including how they were scored and whether  or not they were competing for prizes. Theme 3 is distinguished from Theme 4 by considering  the specific competition process rather than the more general format of the competition.  Format: Which CTF formats did the challenges come from? Did the event contain only  one format, or contain components of multiple formats?  Challenge Categories: Which categories were challenges drawn from? In the case of  Jeopardy-style events, which categories were challenges from? In the case of Attack  Defence-style events, which aspects of Attack-Defence competitions were part of the  competition?  Scoring: What scoring methods were used for scoring participants? Were there  multiple ways to score points through challenges? Were there any non-challenge ways  to earn points towards winning the competition?  Platform: What platform was used by the event? Was the platform custom-made?  Was the platform an existing off-the-shelf solution?  Prizes: Was there a prize for the winning team or teams? Were there prizes for  particular challenges? Were there prizes for other parts of the competition, such as  providing challenges or writing write-ups?  Length: How long was the competition period? Was it broken up into multiple period,  or continuous? If the event was online, were participants able to begin their  competition period on-demand?  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  16  3.1.3.4 Theme 4 - Competition Format  The competition format concerned more general parts of the competition that were less related  to the challenges and more to how the competition took place. In particular, whether there were  multiple parts to the competition, such as qualifiers or parallel events, and whether teams were  allowed mentors or coaches.  Team Size: Was there a maximum team size? Was there a minimum team size? Were  teams formed by participants in advance of the competition or formed by the  organisers after selection of participants?  Mentors and Coaches: Were teams allowed a mentor or coach? Were teams required  to have a mentor or coach? Were teams assigned a mentor or coach by the  organisers?  Qualifiers: Did the event have a separate qualifier round? Did participants have to  achieve the top scores in the qualifiers to compete, or was the qualifier only part of the  selection process? Was the qualifier a specific event run by the same organisers or  was it based on other events run by different organisers?  Parallel Contests: Were there other competitions, other than the primary competition,  running at the event? Were they targeted at a different audience? Did they have a  different theme or challenge categories? Were they an extension of the main  competition with further challenges of the same type?  Online or In-Person: Was the event run entirely online? Was the event entirely in-  person? Was the event a mixture of both, such as having an online portion leading into  an in-person event? Was the event simultaneously in-person and online, for instance  to cater to different groups or to host different formats? Did this differ from previous  events, in particular because of COVID-19 restrictions or concerns?  Organiser Communication: Did the organisers communicate with participants during  the event? Did the organisers provide help using the platform during the event? Did the  organisers give hints during the competition? Did the organisers help participants with  challenges when requested?  Challenge Providers: Did the organisation create all challenges? Did the event use  existing challenges, such as from a platform or challenge provider? Were participants  expected to provide challenges?  3.1.3.5 Theme 5 - Event Organisation  Beyond the format of the event, this report also seeks to gather data on non-competition  activities run alongside competition events. For instance, whether social events were put on as  part of the competition, and whether participants were expected to find their own funding for  travel and accommodation expenses.  Other Activities: What other activities were organised by the event, in addition to the  competition? Were there any social activities? Were there sponsor-led activities? Were  there activities designed to benefit participants, such as career events?  Catering: Was the event catered by the organisers? Was catering only during the  competition period or during the entire event period, such as dinners after competition  days?  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  17  Transport and Accommodation: Did the organisers provide funding for transport to  the event? Did the organisers provide funding for accommodation expenses for  participants?  3.1.3.6 Theme 6 - Post-event  Once CTF events are completed, participants often request, or provide, solutions to the  challenges. In particular, the creation and sharing of solution write-ups for challenges is  a significant and important part of the community. Data was sought to discover if this  was supported or resisted by organisers.  Challenge Distribution: Did organisers release the challenges publicly once the  competition was over? Did the organisers explicitly prevent participants from sharing  challenges themselves?  Solution Distribution: Did organisers release solutions publicly once the competition  was over? Did the organisers explicitly prevent participants from sharing challenge  solutions themselves? Did the organisers actively promote participants who created  write-ups, for instance by having prizes or featuring solutions?  Data Release: Did organisers release data gathered during the competition? Did  organisers publish participant statistics, such as participant numbers or breakdowns?  Subsequent Publications: Did the organisers make formal publications as a result of  the competition and data gathered?  3.1.4 Coding and aggregation  Once data was gathered in free-text format for each theme and sub-theme, data for each  question was viewed laterally across the whole set events. This was used to study the spectrum  of results for each question and provide justification for a coding system. For this, a non-  exclusive tagging system was used, where the free-text answers for each question were tagged  with zero or more tags that categorised their answer. Tags were selected to appropriately cover  and aggregate the data seen in the free-text answers. Every question could also be tagged as  Unknown, where data found was insufficient to properly classify which tags were appropriate. In  some cases, additional primary research was performed to determine which tags should be  applied, and in this way research on each event was driven as a comparison to other events in  the dataset.  As part of the tag creation process, data for each question underwent aggregation into suitable,  granular categories. This was performed to facilitate later analysis and to avoid over-specificity  in cases where considerable amounts of data were present. This was particularly important  where events had very little available data.  In some cases, multiple question groups were aggregated together to provide more content  across all events. The rest of this report is structured around discussion of each theme, and  data is presented in these aggregated groupings so that each grouping provides sufficient detail  for meaningful analysis and discussion.  3.2 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  To augment later discussion and provide context to the events studied in detail, a statistical  analysis was conducted over a large, public dataset.  The dataset consists of events tracked by the CTFTime website (https://ctftime.org);  populated voluntarily by the CTF community, with records submitted either by organisers or  participants. CTFTime is a notable community website that lists events and tracks team  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  18  performance across multiple competitions. It is also public and free-to-access, both for readers  and CTF organisers, such that announcing a CTF event is accessible even with minimal  financial resources. As such it is a de facto publication platform for CTF events and therefore a  data source that is likely to be accurate and complete. The website also offers an open API to  allow analysis of the data.  The dataset was compiled from data retrieved via the open API and cover the period  01/01/2015 -- 06/12/2020; including data on events and contained challenges.  From manual inspection, event records were overwhelmingly complete and consistent, with only  a small number of empty or invalid entries. Challenge records were less complete, with only  approximately 73% of events having challenge records associated to them. Challenge records  would only be expected for events in a Jeopardy format, but records were incomplete for even  this subset. Nevertheless, the data were considered to be easily sufficient.  3.2.1 Dataset structure  The records contained in the dataset incorporate the following information:  Event   Title : The name of the CTF event   URL : Website for event   Format : Event type; with values within [Jeopardy, Attack-Defence, Hack Quest]   Restrictions : Entry restrictions; with values within [Open, High-School, Academic,  Prequalified, Invited]   Start : Event start time (to minute accuracy)   Finish : Event finish time (to minute accuracy)   On-site? : Flag indicating in-person events, instead of online   Location : Physical location (applicable only for on-site events)   Weight : A metric intended to track CTF event difficulty, for the purposes of ranking  teams. The weight is determined either by voting among competing teams or by  decision of CTFTime administrators. Weight values run from 0 (easiest) to 100 (most  difficult).   Challenge : Subsidiary records describing challenges within a CTF competition  o Name : The name of the challenge  o Points : Points awarded on completion of challenge  o Write-up count : Number of published write-ups associated with the  challenge  o Tags : A list of attributes for the challenge, typically used to encode the  challenge category at minimum, with greater specificity provided in some  cases  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  19  4. ANALYSIS RESULTS  4.1 MANUAL ANALYSIS  Following the selection process, a total of 22 CTF competitions were included in the manual  analysis. The competitions are listed below, with a longer profile for each given in Annex A.   European Cyber Security Challenge   Cyber Centurion - CSC UK   ACSC-ASEAN   Cambridge 2 Cambridge Cyber Competition   Country 2 Country   Cyber Challenge Italia   Cyber Security Challenge Canada   Cyber Security Challenge Germany   Cyber Security Challenge SA   DEF CON CTF   Midnight Sun Capture the Flag (AFCEA Sweden)   PicoCTF   Pwn2Own   US Cyber Challenge   WCTF (Qihoo 360)   CyberTalents Arab and Africa Regional CTF   National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition   International Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition   Global Cyberlympics   PlaidCTF   HITCON   Google CTF  The analysed CTF competitions were variously organised by governments, universities, for-  profit companies and community groups (see Figure 1). Government events were organised  either by national-level governments or supra-national bodies (such as the EU bloc), with no  local-government events in the analysis. University-run CTFs often had government support,  either through partnerships or via research-body funding.  Some university events sought to perform research in cybersecurity education, using the event  as a study, and publish findings as research papers. In other cases, the delivery of that  education and the promotion of cybersecurity careers was the main goal. Of the four  commercial events, three were operated by large, well-known technology companies, while one  was run by a cybersecurity recruitment agency. Community events were often, but not always,  attached to security conferences.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  20  Figure 1: Breakdown of Events by Organising Entity  The majority of the analysed events were intended either for the general public or for students in  tertiary education (see Figure 2). However, a small number specifically targeted school-aged  children to promote early cybersecurity education. The structure of these varied; with one  restricting entry solely to children, while others were open to wider age groups in another stream  of the competition. Most public CTFs were open to wide participation among hobbyists and  professionals. Four competitions were noted to target only skilled professionals in the area,  either with specific entry restrictions or de facto due to low entrant limits and high challenge  difficulties.  Figure 2: Breakdown of Events by Intended Audience  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  21  4.2 PER-THEME ANALYSIS  This section describes the results of manual analysis. Results are presented on a per-theme  basis.  4.2.1 Entry requirements  Age is the most common entry restriction, with competitions open to 'children only', 'university  students only' or 'adults only' (see Figure 3). This restriction is alternatively captured with no  age specification, but a requirement that entrants be of a given type, or possess specific skills  (Figure 4, Figure 5). Events targeted at a general audience generally make no restrictions  however (excepting that minors be accompanied). While globally-available, online competitions  were typical in community-organised and commercial events, location restrictions were common  for publicly-funded events (operated either directly by governments or through universities).  These required entrants to be from a particular nation, or group of nations, with the restrictions  complemented by further regional subdivisions in two cases (Figure 6).  Figure 3: Breakdown of Events by Age  Figure 4: Breakdown of Events by Participant Type  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  22  Figure 5: Breakdown of Events by Qualifications Required  Figure 6: Breakdown of Events by Location  4.2.2 Diversity and inclusion  Of those examined, no event restricted entrance by gender (see Figure 7). In the case of the  UK's Cyber Centurion competition (an event aimed at children), teams were categorised by  gender. In two other events teams with female members received a bonus in competition. No  restrictions were made by socio-economic background either (Figure 8). Only the large, public  PicoCTF made any direct reference to economic accessibility, with the organisers specifically  stating that the competition platform had been designed to be easily accessible to those with  low-cost hardware. In some events, equipment was provided by the organisers, although this  was typically to avoid competitive advantages, rather than to promote access. No event was  found to indicate any policy for diversity by ethnicity (Figure 9).  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  23  Figure 7: Breakdown of Events by Gender Restrictions  Figure 8: Breakdown of Events by Socio-Economic Restrictions  Figure 9: Breakdown of Events by Ethnicity Restrictions  4.2.3 Challenge format  The analysed CTF events displayed a wide variety of configurations. The majority of  competitions were in the Jeopardy format, by a substantial margin, with Attack-Defence and  question-based competitions the most popular of the other categories (see Figure 10). The  popularity of head-to-head Attack-Defence was higher for in-person competitions, although  Jeopardy competitions were also common here. Yet, a range of unusual derivatives were also  noted, including questionnaires, individual attack campaigns against vulnerable virtual machines  and patching exercises. The US-based National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition and  International Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition both followed an unusual defence-only  format in which entrants acted as a 'Blue Team' pitted against an attacking 'Red Team' formed  of volunteers who were cybersecurity professionals.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  24  Figure 10: Breakdown of Events by Format  Popular challenge categories were represented across the examined events, with Crypto,  Exploitation, Forensics, Web and Reverse Engineering commonly appearing (see Figure 11).  As noted above, defensive categories were also well-represented, both as defence against  targeted attacks and defence against malware. Where reported, major CTFs typically operated  custom platforms (Figure 12), although external hosted services were occasionally seen  (indeed, the same HackingLab hosted platform was used in two cases).  It is suspected that popular open-source platforms were utilised for these custom  arrangements, rather than software developed from scratch, although hard data was not  available to support that. Scoring was primarily seen to be fixed, with specific point values given  for Jeopardy challenges or successful Attack-Defence captures and holds (Figure 13). Most  variants upon scoring included either modified point values, an element of manual grading or  additional points for special cases (such as 'King-of-the-Hill' in Attack-Defence). In one notable  case, Qihoo 360 WCTF operated primarily on a Jeopardy model, but supplemented the main  solution points with an additional round in which solutions were evaluated by a technical jury  and awarded bonus points.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  25  Figure 11: Breakdown of Events by Challenge Category  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  26  Figure 12: Breakdown of Events by Platform  Figure 13: Breakdown of Events by Scoring  It was found that winners' prizes were commonly awarded (see Figure 14). These were either  items of consumer technology, cash prizes, or invitations to other prestigious events. There was  wide variation in this rule, however. The Pwn2Own competition operates as a live bug bounty  event, in which successful attacks have direct commercial applications, and as such carries  cash prizes up to $80,000 (USD).  By contrast, the very well-respected, DEF CON CTF offers prizes with low monetary value -- but  enormous prestige in the community. Ancillary prizes were occasionally awarded for contributed  challenges and stand-out actions (\"the je ne sais quoi award\" in Cambridge2Cambridge), but  these were not common (Figure 15).  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  27  Figure 14: Breakdown of Events by Winner Prize Inclusion  Figure 15: Breakdown of Events by Other Prize Inclusion  Most events were short, with 2--3 day CTFs marginally more popular than single-day CTFs  events (see Figure 16Figure 16). As many of the analysed events were large, in-person  competitions; operating short, focused events is understandable -- both in terms of cost and  available participant time. Online competitions typically ran for longer periods; consistent with  being background or hobby activities rather than full-time pursuits.  Figure 16: Breakdown of Events by Length  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  28  4.2.4 Competition format  Team size requirements in the analysed competitions varied widely, as Figure 17 shows. More  competitions permit a team-size range, than prescribe an exact team size. Where a bounded  range was permitted, the largest size was never higher than 10 and usually less than 5.  However, in a set of major community-run events (and one commercial event) team size is  unbounded. Of these, three events were online, where team sizes cannot easily be enforced,  while one was in-person (providing up to 8 team seats, but no limit on external access). The  other event was Pwn2Own, an exploit finding competition, in which team size is not so strongly  connected to performance as in other formats.  Figure 17: Breakdown of Events by Team Size Restrictions  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  29  From those analysed, more events incorporated qualifying rounds than did not, although this is  skewed by the selection of renowned competitions and 'finals' events with limited memberships  -- open competitions typically have far more entrants (see Figure 18). Competitions operating  in-person or online were equally matched (Figure 19). However, in 2020, a handful of events  were moved online due to COVID-19, despite otherwise being held in-person. Events were split  between allowing a mentor with a team and prohibiting this (Figure 20). Where allowed,  mentors were variously an accompanying adult (for children), an employer or a prior competitor  at the event.  CTF organisers typically provide at least technical support for entrants, with hints being provided  in some cases. Few CTFs made a concrete statement of the communication policy and the  availability of hints was very rare (Figure 22). A handful of events operated parallel competitive  contests alongside the main challenges (Figure 21) and these were either targeting another  audience (i.e., a student tier of a professional competition) or adding additional challenges of a  different type (e.g., hardware attacks, physical security challenges or a social engineering  exercise during social events).  Figure 18: Breakdown of Events by Qualifier Round Inclusion  Figure 19: Breakdown of Events by Physicality  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  30  Figure 20: Breakdown of Events by Mentor/Coach Allowance  Figure 21: Breakdown of Events by Inclusion of Parallel Contests  Figure 22: Breakdown of Events by Organiser Communication Policy  4.2.5 Event organisation  Peripheral activities were incorporated in just under half of the examined CTFs, principally social  and careers activities (see Figure 23. Catering was often provided for in-person events, with  transportation provided occasionally (Figure 24, Figure 25). In one interesting case (Cyber  Security Challenge Canada), catering was provided for a nationwide, online event with  participants distributed across the country. In no other cases was catering or transportation  made available for an online event.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  31  Figure 23: Breakdown of Events by Other Activity Inclusion  Figure 24: Breakdown of Events by Catering Provision  Figure 25: Breakdown of Events by Transport Provision  Where information was available, CTF challenges were mostly provided by event organisers,  with a small number incorporating challenges from sponsors (see Figure 26). A handful of  events asked participating teams to produce challenges, or used those provided by a hosted  platform.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  32  Figure 26: Breakdown of Events by Challenge Source  Events were advertised over a range of media (see Figure 27). Events usually (although not  universally) hosted a public website. Twitter was used nearly as frequently to disseminate  information. Live updates, via Twitter, blogs, Discord channels or a video feed were a common  feature. Live streaming of competitions is rare, but seen both for in-person events (National  Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition, Qihoo 360 WCTF) and one online event (GoogleCTF).  In the latter case, it was a competition requirement for finalist teams to stream their work from a  designated computer and these streams are available on YouTube.  Figure 27: Breakdown of Events by Communication Channel  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  33  4.2.6 Post-event  In the examined events, the amount and type of information released by CTF organisers was  varied. Challenges and solutions were officially released for 28% and 23% of events,  respectively (see Figure 28, Figure 29). However, these numbers should be considered with  some context. Challenges accessed after a competition were sometimes broken (e.g., where a  webservice must be attacked, this was often found to be unavailable), while unofficial solutions  (in the form of participant write-ups) were often plentiful even if no official solutions were  released.  Figure 28: Breakdown of Events by Challenge Release Policy  Figure 29: Breakdown of Events by Solution Release Policy  Events with an education focus, rather than an entertainment focus, sometimes released more  detailed data (see Figure 30), or even published academic papers about the design and  operation of the event (see Figure 31). Both were rare overall, however.  Figure 30: Breakdown of Events by Data Publication  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  34  Figure 31: Breakdown of Events by Research Paper Publication  4.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  In total, 879 events were recorded in the CTFTime community dataset.  The number of CTF competitions has grown every year, even reporting the highest numbers in  2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic (see Figure 32). Competitions are primarily conducted  online (>73%), but in-person events take place all over the world (Figure 33). Figure 34 shows  the locations of in-person events.  Figure 32: Competitions by Year  Figure 33: Competitions by Location  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  35  Figure 34: Map of In-person Competition Locations  The majority of events took place over either a single day, or a few days (see Figure 35). A  notable benefit of short multi-day events is to minimise the effect of time-zones to promote  worldwide participation. Nevertheless, even the predominantly-online CTF Time events were  still mostly bounded to only a small multi-day duration.  Figure 35: Competitions by Duration  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  36  As with the events studied in the manual analysis, the vast majority of competitions from the  CTF Time dataset use a Jeopardy format (>87%), over Attack-Defence or Hack Quest formats  (see Figure 36). Again however, Attack-Defence is more popular for in-person events;  accounting for nearly 25% of the total events, while online competitions only use an Attack-  Defence format approximately 5% of the time.  Figure 36: Competitions by Format  The competitions listed on CTF Time overwhelmingly specify no entry criteria; with all teams  welcome to apply (see Figure 37). A small number are restricted to (high-) schoolchildren or  university teams, but this is less common than in the manual analysis. A handful of  competitions, usually larger and more renowned events, apply a prequalification criterion. This  is typically an initial public competition, from which the best-placing teams are selected for  invitation to the main competition. Alternatively, teams may be scouted among other notable  competitions and invited without a direct qualification round. While the use of qualification  rounds was seen often in the manual analysis, it is far rarer in the full CTF Time data, likely due  to the logistical effort required and the focus on accessibility, over exclusivity and performance,  that is common of community events.  Figure 37: Competitions by Entry Restriction  In the CTF Time difficulty weighting, events were significantly clustered around a low-to-medium  difficulty level (approx. 25), although with instances of events having nearly every difficulty  weighting. This is visualised as a histogram of weightings in Figure 38. This is consistent with  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  37  the focus on accessible challenges that can be enjoyed by a range of participants, along with  the likelihood that many community organisers cannot devote sufficient resources to create very  challenging tasks as part of their events. Many events included in the manual analysis do not  appear on CTF Time (particularly government events), however those that do have an average  weighting of 53.05 and include DEF CON CTF, HITCON CTF and PlaidCTF, which all have  weightings over 90 in recent years.  Figure 38: Histogram of Competitions by Weighting  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  38  5. DISCUSSION  This section contains a discussion of the results found in the course of this report and their  relevant for organisers of future events.  5.1 PARTICIPATION AND INVOLVEMENT  5.1.1 Popularity  The data gathered in this report shows that CTFs are a hugely, and increasingly, popular event  format. CTF events are carried out all over the world, with participants from a range of age  groups and skill levels. The number of events has consistently grown year-on-year since the  earliest year in the data gathered. Recommendations of the educational benefits of security  competitions2 have resonance with the success of events aimed at school- and university-age  groups. The data gathered in this report suggests that there are more events targeted at these  groups than at professionals; which suggests the value of CTFs as introductory and skill-  building opportunities. CTFs have also been used to encourage the traditionally-  underrepresented group of female participants. Some events were seen to offer benefits to  teams with female members, although this was not a popular approach. Indeed, in the authors'  experience of one such event, their female colleagues felt this practice commented negatively  on their contribution. In other cases, gender diversity measures focused on providing access to  role models and tailored mentorship as peripheral activities, rather than employing measures  that altered the competition.  5.1.2 Online and in-person  While the CTF format lends itself well to online participation, half of the significant events that  data was gathered on were in-person. Some events supplemented an in-person competition  with online components in order to allow greater participation; this was found in both high-tier  events such as DEF CON (which allows remote participants to assist a size-limited in-person  team) and events focused on education and outreach (with some events holding open-access  online events concurrent to invitation- or qualification-only in-person events). Where these  parallel contests occurred, they had a range of purposes; concurrent events were found that  targeted a different audience, provided challenges on a different theme (such as a set of  challenges about hacking into wireless networks), or simply provided extra challenges on the  same theme.  5.1.3 Mentors and coaches  Events, particularly those targeted at minors, often invited teams to participate under a mentor  or coach. In many cases, this was an adult or teacher, presumably for the purpose of taking  responsibility for child participants. Beyond this, some events allocate teams a mentor from one  of the sponsoring organisations, and in one case previous competitors were selected to mentor  later teams. Mentorship in this way offers a range of benefits, including allowing sponsoring  organisations to work with potential job applicants in a close fashion and allowing teams to  benefit from professional input and experience. Previous competitors, particularly those who are  no longer able to compete, may enjoy mentoring and coaching as an opportunity to continue to  be involved, and their input to teams provides teams with experienced guidance. In the  experience of the authors, providing new participants with close guidance during their  2 Chothia and Novakovic, ‘An Offline Capture the Flag-Style Virtual Machine and an Assessment of Its Value for  Cybersecurity Education’.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  39  introduction to the CTF format is highly productive and can enable participants to gain  experience from avenue that they may be otherwise have been dissuaded from using.  5.2 COMPETITION AND CHALLENGE  5.2.1 Format  While Jeopardy is the dominant format both online and in-person, Attack-Defence events have  had a persistent presence since the earliest events. Mixed-format events, containing both  Jeopardy challenges and Attack-Defence targets provides a middle-ground that combines the  benefits of both styles. In the manually-gathered dataset, only one of the events surveyed was  purely Attack-Defence without any Jeopardy components. The considerably higher costs  associated with setting up and managing Attack-Defence infrastructure may be a considerable  factor in the decisions of event organisers. Further, the comparative difficulty of scaling-up  Attack-Defence contests may further explain their lack of use in online formats, which typically  have larger participant numbers. Attack-Defence may also be associated with higher skill  requirements for participants, as their less-gamified structure may increase the knowledge and  tools needed to successfully perform compromises. This is somewhat supported by the  participant-perceived difficulty of the events, with Attack-Defence events having the highest  average difficulty, followed by Jeopardy. Hack Quests, were on average considered to be  significantly easier than standard Jeopardy, suggesting their typical use as highly-structured  introductory events for new players.  5.2.2 Challenge categories  The strength of CTFs, and in particular Jeopardy formats, comes from their flexibility and  inclusion of many types of distinct tasks for participants. The events surveyed covered a wide  variety of areas; forming 26 distinct categories in this report. The most popular categories -- in  terms of presence at most events -- are unsurprising to seasoned CTF participants, with Crypto,  Forensics, Re, Web and Exploit forming the top five. Other, more unusual challenge themes  found included Human Factors, Privacy, Hardware, and Hash-Breaking.  Challenges are predominantly technical, and while some events mentioned non-technical  categories, the survey was not able to find any specific instances of non-technical challenges.  Some examples from prior experience include social engineering challenges, such as  interacting with an automated email service to send it phishing emails, lockpicking and  interacting with other teams to gather all the parts of a flag. Physical security challenges such as  lockpicking are sometimes incorporated into the main, scored competition, while others are  conducted as an unscored peripheral activity (such as a guided exercise, from the authors'  experience, in which participants performed a physical wiretap of a network cable).  5.2.3 Challenge sources  Challenges came from a variety of sources, although they were predominantly provided by the  organisers directly. In some cases, participants themselves were required to provide challenges  in order to compete. These submitted challenges were then vetted and modified by organisers  before inclusion. In one instance this formed the basis for a secondary prize, where the team  with the best challenge received an award. Participant-submitted challenges were observed in  two Jeopardy contests; in one case, the participants were required to submit a vulnerable virtual  machine containing weaknesses. Some events also included sponsor-provided challenges.  These would could cover a similar theme to the sponsor, or even explicitly involve the use of the  sponsor's product. In one event, sponsor challenges acted as a separate competition, with  participants being awarded individual prizes for the best performance in the sponsor challenge.  In some cases, the event was hosted by an existing CTF provider and may have used the  existing challenges produced by that provider.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  40  5.2.4 Jeopardy variants  Within the Jeopardy format, there was considerable variation. While the standard format of  individual challenges with automatically-scored flags was the most prevalent, many events  provided further interest with alternative scoring or challenge formats. There was relatively little  consensus -- the most popular non-standard variation was only found in three of the events --  but almost all in-person events included some variant. The most popular was  quiz- or question-  based scoring, where participants were required to answer further information about the  challenges they were performing. This may take the form of multiple-choice questions or  through written submissions that were evaluated by a jury. As opposed to the standard CTF  platform infrastructure, some events opted to distribute challenges via vulnerable virtual  machine images, in a manner similar to Attack-Defence. Points were rewarded for participants  primarily based on a fixed-per-solve basis, although events also included points that scaled  according to the number of solves, and extra points for the first solves of a challenge. Four  events also explicitly mentioned providing points for other, miscellaneous, non-challenge  activities.  5.3 STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION  5.3.1 Event length  Event length varied considerably in the larger dataset; events most often lasted a day or two but  many took place over up to a week and some considerably longer. Conversely, almost all the  events in the manually-gathered dataset took a few days or less, with half of them taking one  day. Only one event, PicoCTF, took place over a longer period (two weeks). Actual competition  time was often shorter; some events took place for a few hours on a single day and included  time for other activities. Conversely, some events took place over a few days and enabled  participants to continue working \"out of hours\"; this is primarily the case for online events but  also seen in some in-person events. In these instances, scoreboards and submission systems  may be disabled while participants are not in the venue.  5.3.2 Peripheral activities  In-person events frequently advertised other activities planned during the competition period.  These included briefings, meals, and other social activities. Events also included activities led  by or including sponsors; particularly job fairs, career advice sessions and other recruitment  activities. In many cases these were disconnected from the competition, in a few instances they  were connected to the scoring of the competition (for instance, sponsor booths that allowed  participants to score points by engaging with an activity). Many events explicitly mentioned  providing catering, including one online event which offered to deliver pizza to competitors.  Fewer events mentioned covering travel or accommodation costs, although the nature of the  data sources used made this data difficult to gather with confidence.  5.3.3 Organiser communication  Organisers communicated with their participants through a variety of media, both before and  during the event. Almost (but, notably, not all) events had an event-specific webpage that  provided details and (normally) a means of participants to register. Twitter and Facebook were  both commonly used by a significant number of events, and other social media such as  LinkedIn, Instagram and Flickr were also utilised. Chat-based platforms, such as IRC, Discord  and Telegram were also seen, with Discord proving the most widely-used (although still only  found in a small number of events). In particular, some events used Discord both as a  communication means and as a challenge-distribution platform, where participants were able to  download challenges directly from Discord channels. Some events reported that organisers  would provide hints and help during the competition, although this was unusual. While live  streaming of screens, scoreboards and judging processes was witnessed in some cases, it was  rare for events to fully embrace the medium. Pwn2Own is a notable counterexample, however,  with day-long streams and live commentary.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  41  5.4 QUALIFICATION AND POST-EVENT  5.4.1 Qualification  Few CTF events had explicit requirements on who could compete, aside from educational  status; one event required participants to pass a short online test that examined technical skills  and English-language proficiency. One event, which was on the borderline between a wargame  exercise and a CTF, was invitational and only included participants who worked professionally  as cyber incident responders. Roughly half the events used a qualification round to filter  participants down for final events. In most cases, qualification rounds were run by the same  organisers and were often online or run in a decentralised fashion, with individual schools or  universities hosting qualifiers. In some cases, events that are significant in themselves are used  as qualifiers to a future event, and successful winners of the main event go on to participate in a  further competition. This was particularly prevalent in the dataset due to selection biases, and  many surveyed events act as national qualifiers for the ECSC. In the case of DEF CON,  participant teams were able to join from successful participation in the DEF CON qualification  round or by winning other selected other events (including the previous year).  5.4.2 Team allocation  Participants almost always participated in teams in main events, although many events allow  participation in teams of one. In some cases, participants qualified individually and were then  sorted into teams by the organisers. In the Cambridge2Cambridge event, this was performed by  sorting participants by qualification score and assembling teams of equal skill. Teams  occasionally had further requirements: in one case, teams needed to contain participants from  different age groups; in two, teams were encouraged to include female members by providing  benefits in the rules (for instance, by allowing teams to have one additional member if they were  female).  5.4.3 Resultant publications  There are many papers in academic literature relating to both the organisational processes, and  to the education and training benefits. Experience of running events is a frequent basis of this  work and consequently many events led directly to publications. For instance, the organisers of  PicoCTF list a collection of papers and research work they have performed around the  competition, on topics such as how to encourage participation, how to generate challenges  automatically (with a view to overcoming flag-sharing), and more generally on the running of  PicoCTF itself.  5.4.4 Data Sharing  Some events also release detailed statistics about the event. DEF CON release considerable  information, including raw packet captures, that provide detailed insight both to the event itself  and to the exploits and vulnerabilities that were used during the competition. Other events  release demographic statistics; Cyber Challenge Italia release such statistics both for their final  event and broken down by individual qualifier events. In total, detailed data was found for six of  the events.  5.4.5 Writeups  CTF culture places significant importance of the creation, study and dissemination of post-event  writeups. Each writeup explains the details of a challenge and its solution from the perspective  of a participant or team. These are widely shared and repositories exist that collect them  together (for instance, CTFTime allows users to submit writeups for challenges once a contest  is ended). This is reinforced by some event organisers, who encourage (and sometimes reward)  participants who submit high-quality writeups to them. In some instances, teams must supply  writeups to challenges they solve in order to be presented with their prizes. This may act as a  deterrent to cheats, or may ensure winning teams have a thorough understanding of the  challenges they have solved. Organisers may also release solutions to their challenges  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  42  themselves so that participants can understand the technicalities behind the challenges after  the event. On the other end of the spectrum, some competitions explicitly forbid the release of  writeups or the sharing of challenge files after the event. This may be intended to enable them  to re-use challenges in later years, although it is unlikely that determined participants would be  unable to find copies of the solutions to previous years. In the manual dataset, we found no  direct evidence that any of the events surveyed forbade sharing of either challenges or  writeups.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  43  6. CONCLUSIONS  In this section, we provide the following recommendations for organisers of future competitions.  These conclusions are informed by the analysis and discussions presented in this report. These  recommendations are made in the context of the survey results. Our conclusions are as follows:  6.1 COMPETITION FORMAT  Jeopardy is heavily favoured in both online and in-person event formats. This is likely due to a  range of factors, including accessibility, lower deployment costs, and scalability. Despite this,  the continued prevalence of Attack-Defence (particularly in the well-respected DEF CON CTF),  and its similarity to the wargame formats preferred by professional training exercises, indicates  the value of this format. We suggest that events designed to be accessible to non-professional  audiences are based on the Jeopardy format, and follow the trend of other events and include  Attack-Defence elements if desired. Structuring in this way gives the benefits of both formats  and reduces the drawbacks of either.  6.2 TEAM REQUIREMENTS  We found that many events are deliberately targeted to specific age groups, or specifically to  students. Further, we found evidence that some events attempt to create a more even gender  balance. We found little evidence of events requiring specific degrees or certifications, except  implicitly in professional competitions. We suggest that attempts to encourage gender balance  through team composition are unlikely to have significant impact, particularly for top-tier events  where participants are likely to have needed to be preparing for (and attempting qualify for) the  event for a long period.  Teams may expect to have a mentor or coach present, particular when younger participants are  involved. In cases where a mentor is involved, it may be important to provide clear rules and  roles for them. In particular, their communication with their team during the event may give an  unfair advantage to competitors based on the expertise and willingness of their mentor. As a  result, we suggest that mentor roles are clearly defined, if included at all.  6.3 TEAM SIZES  The greatest division between the results of our analysis and the survey results are in team  size, where the ideal size suggested in the survey was approximately twice as large as the  expected team size in the events surveyed. We believe this is due to the nature of ECSC as an  international event with national qualifiers; as participant teams are likely to be created out of  the top-performing teams from individual qualifying events, it is natural that large team sizes  would be more suitable and preferred by participants. It may be worth drawing a parallel to DEF  CON, which equally represents the culmination of a number of events and, equally, is typically  attended by teams of a larger size. It may be worth considering that DEF CON places a limit on  the in-person team size, presumably for logistical reasons, while placing no limit on the size of  the remote team -- limiting the size of a remote team is impossible to enforce and therefore  unlikely to be suitable to a competitive environment.  6.4 SCORING AND RULES  For Jeopardy formats, it is anticipated that participants would expect the primary scoring  mechanism to follow traditional Jeopardy fixed-per-challenge or scoring based on the number of  solves. Many events provide some deviation from this, and in particular some events provide  subjective or jury-evaluated questions alongside challenges. We believe these are less likely to  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  44  scale well into larger competitions with higher skill levels and suggest that objective scoring  systems have higher integrity.  Equally, while some events include participant-submitted challenges, these require a distinct  skillset to that of typical CTF participation. Including participant-submitted challenges also  creates an uneven playing field, where each team has a different set of challenges to solve and  consequently this may somewhat dilute the competitive aspect. Sponsor-provided challenges  provide a potential opportunity for more competitive challenge variety. In these instances, care  should be taken that challenges fit with the format and style of the rest of the competition; in our  experience, unrestricted sponsor challenges can fit poorly with the rest of the competition,  possibly due to sponsor inexperience with the format.  6.5 PARALLEL COMPETITIONS  Including a parallel competition may be a valuable way to increase engagement beyond core  participants. Of particular note, Google CTF's Beginner's Quest offered interested non-  participants an opportunity to experience the event without requiring the (relatively high) skills  necessary to participate in the full event. Hack Quests in particular offer an enjoyable and  engaging way to bring new participants into later competitions and build interest in the CTF  scene. It may also be appropriate, in some events, to run specialist parallel competitions that  focus specifically on one aspect of the competition that may not be a good fit for general  participants. For instance, it may be the case that few participants have experience of hardware  challenges, and inclusion in the main event may give a disproportionate advantage to those with  prior experience.  6.6 CHALLENGE FORMATS  The \"typical\" range of Jeopardy CTF challenges is extremely broad. While there are standard  categories that most challenges are drawn from (specifically reverse engineering, exploitation,  web-based exploits, forensics, and cryptography), there is a wide variety of alternative  categories that may be suitable for inclusion. In particular, challenges that benefit from the  physical, in-person nature of the event, such as snooping on wireless traffic, may be well-  received, particularly as they are less likely to have been experienced previously. There is some  evidence of increased interest in non-technical challenges, and the interdisciplinary nature of  cybersecurity may be encouraged by including challenges of this form. Particularly, there has  been some evidence of automated social engineering challenges. Events which utilise jury-  based evaluation may find greater success with challenges of this form, which may require more  subjective analysis, but care should be taken not to deviate too greatly from the established and  successful CTF format.  6.7 COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA  Web and social media presence is generally consistent across all events, with almost every  event (and every open event) maintaining a website and some social media presence.  Facebook and Twitter were the most common, and some degree of engagement with these  platforms is likely anticipated by participants. We further recommend the consideration of chat-  based platforms, such as Discord, IRC, or Slack, which offer an excellent opportunity for general  communication, announcements, challenge and platform support. Further, community-led  platforms such as these offer a chance for engagement beyond the competition. In the Discord  servers we surveyed, we found evidence that participants were still engaged with each other,  with discussions of both security and general interests.  6.8 POST-EVENT  To further encourage and engage the community beyond the event itself, organisers may wish  to support participants (and non-participants) who wish to go over the challenges in their own  time. This has two primary avenues; firstly, making challenges available after the event, and  secondly, ensuring that writeups or solutions for challenges are available. Organisers may not  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  45  need to do a great deal to facilitate this, as the community has a strong tradition of publishing  writeups for most events. However, organisers who go further to facilitate this, such as by  amplifying or sharing participant writeups, or by providing awards to the best writeups, may  compound the benefits. Releasing challenges after the event is also beneficial as they can be  used as a training and teaching tool, particularly for participants seeking to prepare for future  iterations of the event. Some thought may need to be given to this in cases where challenges  involve servers, and this may not be possible in cases where hardware is involved.  In addition to supporting the spread of challenges and writeups, organisers should consider the  beneficial impact they can have on the academic community. This could be performed indirectly,  by sharing data about the competition, such as demographic data on participants, or about the  challenges themselves. Such data is of particular interest in Attack-Defence formats, where  attack traffic data may closely mirror real-world attack traffic. Further, organisers may wish to  follow the example of other events and directly publish their conclusions that follow from their  own experience running an event.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  46  7.

It first provides background on such competitions, their structure and variations. Analyses  of recent competitions is then conducted, comprising an in-depth qualitative analysis of notable  events (22 in total) and a high-level statistical analysis of a large dataset of public events of all  levels (879 in total).  The results show a great deal of variation in some areas:   team size   challenge categories   scoring methodology   hosting of event online vs. in-person   use of qualifier rounds   inclusion of peripheral activities   communication channels for media strategy  By contrast, little variation was seen in:   entry restrictions (usually only upon location)   diversity policy (mostly absent)   format (typically a ‘Jeopardy’ format)   prizes (usually provided)   duration (events typically spanning a single day or a few days)  The report discusses the findings and proposes topics for consideration during event design. In  particular:  Team sizes: Hard limits may not be necessary and unbounded team sizes are seen in  notable events.  Formats: Recognised formats promote east of understanding among participants.  Formats have commonly-associated scoring methodologies and challenge categories,  which can act as a starting point for event design.  Parallel Competitions: Running parallel events with a different focus (different audience  or different challenge type) can broaden appeal easily.  Range of Media: Public engagement strategies benefit from a range of media. Inclusion of  CTF specific venues (such as that used in the statistical analysis) is recommended to best  reach the CTF community.  Release of Data: Retrospective release of challenges, solutions, competition metrics and  lessons-learned are helpful to the wider community.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  3  TABLE OF CONTENTS  1.

INTRODUCTION  1.1 SUMMARY  This report describes capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions and their contemporary use in cyber  security education and recreation worldwide. It provides background on CTFs and describes the  various competition formats and practices.  It reports on an analysis of recent competitions; both an in-depth qualitative examination of a  selection of major events and a quantitative analysis of a large, public dataset of events. The  analysis describes a range of aspects including formats, challenge types, platforms, event  structures, entry requirements and team composition. To create this report, a survey of previous  significant competitions was performed and each event was tagged according to a number of  research themes and questions. In addition, statistics were obtained from public datasets and  used to perform a general analysis of CTF events.  Based on the results of the analysis, different events and their practices are compared and  contrasted; to find commonalities and identify design decisions and their trade-offs. The report  concludes by making recommendations for consideration during event design.  1.2 STRUCTURE  This report is structured into the following sections:   Background: An outline of CTF competitions and formats to give background for later  sections. In particular, the challenge types, scoring systems and formats of both  \"Jeopardy\" and \"Attack-Defence\" events are detailed.   Methodology: A full description of the methodology used in this report, including data  themes, an explanation and justification of data sources, and methods used in the  statistical analysis.   Results: A per-theme analysis of the manually gathered data on each individual event,  together with summaries of the results of the statistical data gathered.   Discussion: A discussion of the results, including trends and consideration of the  differences between the two datasets produced by this report.   Conclusions: Conclusions drawn for running future CTF events based on the data  and analysis gathered in this report.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  6  2. BACKGROUND  A Capture-The-Flag (CTF) is a competitive computer security event where participants compete  in security-themed challenges for the purpose of obtaining the highest score [1] [2]. There are a  number of formats in common use. The CTF name derives from the outdoor game, in which  participants seek to find and retrieve a physical \"flag\", and its similarity to early \"wargaming\" and  \"king-of-the-hill\" cyber security competitions. Today, the CTF term encompasses a range of  competition types and targets a wide audience. A renowned CTF has been run at the DEF CON  security conference since 1996 and a calendar of events takes place, online and at physical  sites, throughout the year.  CTFs take many forms, but the most common forms are Jeopardy and Attack-Defence [3],  which are described in detail below. The information in this section is informed by the  experience of the authors in participating in and organising events, by the results of the  analyses of the report, and by the related work cited.  2.1 JEOPARDY  Jeopardy CTFs [2] [4] [5], the most common format for current competitions, contain a set of  custom-made, artificial challenges created specifically for the event. Participants tackle each  challenge as a stand-alone problem, and a solving a challenge results in a flag, which can be  submitted to a scoring system for a number of points.  2.1.1 Format  Jeopardy challenges are highly variable and the only key property is that they should grant  access to one (or more) flags when solved. Challenges are typically completely independent of  each other (although they may have multiple parts), and participants are able to solve them,  broadly, in any order. Each challenge consists of some downloadable files, a remote server, or  both. When remote servers are present, participants are not able to impact the performance of  the server for other teams, so that each team participants in the competition independently.  Challenges that consist only of files will usually contain the flag embedded into the  downloadable file and participants are expected to use any means to find the flag within the  files. When a remote server is present, participants are typically expected to perform a remote  exploit on the server to recover the flag, and there may be downloadable files (such as  challenge source code, or compiled binaries), that aid them in the attempt.  Challenges vary across a large and diverse number of categories, and the flexible format of the  contest allows for a wide degree of variation in challenges. Some common categories are  expected in any CTF, while less-common categories may appear depending on the theme or  format of the event. In particular, more difficult events tend to be more focused on categories  that replicate real exploits (such as pwn, web and re), while beginner-focused events have  more scope for categories that explore more gamified areas (often under the grouping of misc  challenges). Some of the most common categories include [6]:  2.1.1.1 pwn  Deriving their name from \"owning\" services, these challenges replicate attacks on real  vulnerable services. In some cases, these challenges may involve performing the compromise  of a piece of known-vulnerable software, but more often they are custom binaries that are  developed to showcase a particularly interesting exploit. These challenges are solved by  participants by interacting with a remote server, usually over a command line. In easier  challenges, participants may be given access to the compiled binary running on the target, or  even the source code directly. In harder challenges, participants will be given no information  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  7  other than access to the remote service. An example challenge might give participants access  to a remote server which runs a binary vulnerable to a buffer overflow. Overflowing the buffer  would cause the binary to crash and consequently output the flag.  2.1.1.2 re (or reversing)  These challenges involve reverse engineering a piece of software in order to extract the flag.  They differ most clearly from pwn challenges in that they typically have no remote service to  compromise, so participants are required to extract a flag directly from a downloaded binary.  These challenges offer an opportunity for participants to practice understanding of unknown,  compiled code and may involve discovering a flag hidden in the code, or may require  understanding how a piece of software operates in order to cause it to act in a certain way.  Solutions to these challenges may require creating patches to modify the compiled code to  change the way it runs and cause it to output the flag.  2.1.1.3 web  Web challenges follow the same pattern as pwn challenges, but involve a target that runs a  web server, usually serving over HTTP, and often backed by other common web technologies  such as a database. Participants exploit the web server and cause it to provide the flag. In  contrast to pwn challenges, these challenges rarely involve low-level exploits of the web server  itself; participants will rarely gain shell access to the server. Instead, these usually involve  attacks on the web pages themselves, with SQL injection and PHP vulnerabilities common  themes in this category.  2.1.1.4 crypto  Cryptography challenges are similar to re challenges but involve reverse engineering of a  particular cryptographic protocol or implementation. These challenges can take the form of  encrypted messages that must be broken, or access to a flawed implementation of a  cryptographic protocol on a service which can be exploited to cause it to reveal secret keys.  2.1.1.5 forensics  Forensics challenges involve participants investigating an unknown piece of data, usually  determining the format of the data and then finding or building a tool capable of reading the  information. In these challenges, the flag is usually contained but obfuscated inside the  downloadable files and participants must understand the format in order to read the flag. There  are many varieties of challenges in this category, including reverse engineering corrupted file  formats, mounting obscure drive formats and finding hidden files, and investigating patterns in  recorded web traffic.  2.1.1.6 misc  Miscellaneous challenges that do not fall into other categories. These challenges are popular  for newer participants and beginner CTFs, where they can help participants get used to the  format of CTF competitions and teach introductory skills. Miscellaneous challenges are typically  more gamified than other categories and often offer a chance for organisers to include more  interesting, though less realistic, challenges. Examples vary hugely but might include reading  the source code for a simple maze generator and solving the maze, or interacting with a service  in a highly unusual way, such as via images.  2.1.1.7 programming  Some challenges are designed particularly to test the participants ability to write code. These  are less common and challenges of this nature are less favoured, in preference for challenges  in other categories that may require a programmed solution. This may be a response to the  popularity of programming-specific hackathon competitions, distinct from security-focused CTF  events.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  8  2.1.1.8 physical  In-person events may include physical challenges that involve the participants interacting with  something in the real world. This may be security-focused, or intended to encourage  participants to interact with each other or explore the area. Examples of security-focused  challenges include performing wire-taps of Ethernet cables, intercepting WiFi traffic, and the  perennial-favourite of picking locks. Interaction-focused challenges might include giving parts of  a flag to each team so they must trade parts with each other, or hiding flags on QR codes  around the event location. Interaction-focused challenges are less preferred in higher skill  competitions in favour of more competitive challenges.  Flags are usually a string of text in a standardised format. This enables participants to know  when the challenge is successfully solved, and means that the entire process is automated  without the need for a judging process. Flag formats are standardised so that participants do not  need to guess what the flag is once the challenge is solved. While some competitions may use  answers to questions as flags (e.g., \"which IP tried to attack the server?\") this is less popular  and can be a frequent source of confusion and ambiguity. Most competitions embed flags into  challenges in such a way that a successful solution to the challenge results in a clear flag that  can be submitted. To this end, flags often begin and end with a published string, for instance  often taking the format `[CTF Name]{[Flag Text]}`.  In this case, the `Flag Text` contains a  challenge-specific string, typically taking one of two formats:   A random string of text: This has the benefit of being un-guessable and requiring  participants to solve to find the entire flag rather than a partial string. In some  challenges, participants may be able to recover half the flag easily, but not the whole  flag.   A word or phrase: In some competitions, the flag text is a short phrase, often a joke or  a play on words involving the challenge and its solution. While enjoyable for  participants, these can be susceptible to guessing, particularly where participants are  able to get part of the flag and infer the rest.  2.1.2 Scoring  Each successful challenge completion results in the participant gaining access to a flag [6]. This  flag can be submitted to a scoring system which then rewards the participant with some number  of points. The number of points rewarded varies according to the rules of the competition, and  may be affected by:   A base score for the challenge, which may be constant across challenges or selected  by the organiser to reflect the perceived difficulty of the competition.   The time taken to solve the challenge, with challenges decreasing in value as time  goes on; in some cases, special challenges may be released that must be solved  within a given period.   The number of teams that have already solved the challenge. This is mostly commonly  a reward for the first team to solve that particular challenge (sometimes referred to as a  \"first blood\" award), but may be a decreasing amount of points awarded as more  teams solve the challenge.   The number of teams that ever solve the challenge. Many CTFs award the final points  based on the number of teams that have solved the challenge by the end of the  competition. This means that the value of a challenge varies over time (including for  teams that have already solved it). By doing this, the number of successful solves of a  challenge acts as a proxy for the difficulty of the challenge, and teams are rewarded  more for solving challenges that fewer teams solve.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  9  In addition to awarding points, some competitions award prizes to the first solutions of particular  challenges; this is often done in conjunction with sponsor-provided challenges, who will provide  a prize for the team that is first to solve the challenge.  Each team's score is the sum of their awarded scores for each challenge, and the winning team  is decided by the highest score at the end of the competition.  2.1.3 Discussion  Jeopardy CTFs offer an excellent platform for engaging participants of all levels. Because  participant teams interact with the challenges independently of each other, participants are not  blocked from solving problems by the success of other teams. As a result, even the lowest-  scoring teams are able to engage with, and benefit from, the experience. The wide variety of  categories and difficulties makes it easy for organisers to ensure that all participants are catered  to, irrespective of background or skill level. The flexible nature of challenges also make these  competitions suitable for a variety of time-frames, particularly when participants are spread  across time-zones. Participants can start and stop their participation during the contest as  required, with no pressure to participate at te same time as other teams. Teams can distribute  tasks amongst team members, either as individuals or groups, and approach multiple problems  at once.  In contrast to other formats, however, Jeopardy competitions are more gamified and less  representative of realistic security skillsets, although this can largely be mitigated by organisers  choosing suitable challenges. When teams participate in Jeopardy contests it is possible (and  not uncommon) for each member to tackle different categories of challenges. Consequently, the  co-operation between team members may be minimal and there may be little interaction  between team members during a competition.  2.1.4 Variants  There are a number of Jeopardy variants currently in use, with varying degrees of popularity  2.1.4.1 Hack Quest  Hack Quests are a Jeopardy variant where participants are guided through a series of  challenges, often with a (loose) story that ties them together. In this format, participants solve  each challenge in turn and are granted access to the next challenge upon completion of the  previous. Hack Quests are often targeted towards beginners, and act as an introduction to the  CTF format. By guiding players through challenges in order, organisers can assist new  participants through easy challenges and slowly increase difficulty. Associated stories and  thematic elements allow for more engaging content, particularly for players who may be slow to  solve challenges. Hack Quests may be run alongside other events, enabling the involvement of  teams who are not able to participate in the full event (either by not having an invitation or not  being capable of solving the challenges). A notable example is the Google CTF, which has a  Beginner's Quest event designed for new CTF participants.  2.1.4.2 Vulnerable VMs  While most Jeopardy competitions consist of independent challenges, a common variant is to  provide contestants with one or more vulnerable Virtual Machines, which teams are then able to  attack to secure flags. This is categorised here as Jeopardy because the participants are not  required to defend a virtual machine, and so the existence of challenges on virtual machines  acts more as a challenge distribution platform than a fundamental change in the format of the  competition.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  10  2.1.4.3 Quiz-style  Some competitions adapt the Jeopardy format slightly by asking questions about the challenges  to participants which must be answered to score points. These may be objective, and judged  automatically, or subjective and be given to a jury to award points.  2.2 ATTACK-DEFENCE  In an Attack-Defence CTF [2] [5], teams are given access to a set of target hosts [7]. The  objective of each participant team is to take and maintain control over as many of the target  hosts as possible. To enable this, challenge organisers will deploy or create a range of  vulnerable services, ensuring that each target contains one or more vulnerabilities.  Teams must balance the need to attack other hosts and accrue more points, with the need to  patch vulnerable services on hosts they already control -- preventing other teams from  compromising those hosts instead.  This was the earliest CTF format, having grown from  'wargame' activities in military and hacker communities. Because of the complexity required in  setting up and running events of this format, together with the comparatively-high security risks  involved, Attack-Defence CTFs are more common for invitational or private events, and  infrequent in public events.  2.2.1 Format  In this format, participants are tasked with successfully compromising (and subsequently  securing) target servers. Each server contains one or more vulnerable services, which may be  based either on real-world vulnerabilities or novel vulnerabilities created by the organisers.  Participants in an Attack-Defence CTF are tasked with performing compromises on systems  designed to look and act like real servers running real services.  Attack-Defence CTFs are also unusual in that participants are expected to hold control of the  target, and so to perform defensive actions such as patching or mitigating vulnerabilities. Teams  may be expected to deploy specific patches to vulnerable software, which might range from  updating off-the-shelf vulnerable software, through to writing and applying patches directly to  custom services. They may also be expected to perform general network-hardening measures,  such as updating firewall rules, resetting or strengthening passwords, and disabling unwanted  or untrusted services or users.  Teams may begin the competition already in control of some or all of the target hosts. In some  styles, every host is always under the control of its original owner, and teams are rewarded for  repeatedly performing exploits against other hosts over time, encouraging teams to fix their  vulnerabilities to prevent attacks from gaining further points from that attack.  2.2.2 Scoring  Points are typically awarded on a regular interval (for example, every minute), with each team  receiving a certain number of points for each host they control at that moment. This encourages  participants to compromise, and subsequently protect, the servers in the contest. Competition  rules typically require services to remain active and available in order for points to be awarded,  to prevent teams from simply disabling vulnerable services.  2.2.3 Discussion  Attack-Defence CTFs offer a very practical model of real security scenarios, with participants  gaining experience of both red-teaming and blue-teaming. Competitions in this form are often  less artificial or gamified, particularly in contrast to the more-popular Jeopardy contests.  Attack-  Defence competitions are more suitable for spectators and live events, as observers can  witness the changing control of servers throughout the event. Participants, tasked with a more  rounded set of objectives, must also manage their time, splitting their attention between seeking  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  11  targets, compromising them, and defending their own servers. This makes them especially  suitable to team events, particularly when building or testing team cohesion is desired.  Events in this format can be more daunting to new-comers and have a higher barrier to entry.  Because of the requirement to fit challenges into the format of a practical vulnerability in a  service, challenge designers have less freedom and so are less able to make challenges that  cater to beginners. Compounding this, the directly-adversarial nature of Attack-Defence  challenges, where participants seek to directly compromise the servers of other teams, have  significant consequences when participant skill levels are imbalanced; overly-capable teams  have the ability to quickly overtake servers and make them all-but-impenetrable to the other  teams, resulting in contests that are decided very quickly. As participants can only make  progress by capturing the servers of other teams, it is possible that some teams are then unable  to perform any successful exploits during the entire contest.  Establishing and running successful Attack-Defence CTFs presents more difficulties than that of  formats such as Jeopardy. Participants are granted access to the target hosts, usually via a  Virtual Private Network (VPN) architecture, with the aim of isolating malicious traffic and  preventing accidental attacks on non-targets. Despite these precautions, participants must still  take care to target their exploits onto strictly in-scope targets.  2.2.4 Variants  2.2.4.1 Exploit Contest  Moving further than even the limited gamification of Attack-Defence CTFs, some competitions  encourage participants to directly attack real software to discover unknown vulnerabilities.  These contest therefore act like time-limited bug bounty programmes, with participants  performing valuable security research by participating. Participants in these contests have found  vulnerabilities in many well-known and widely-used pieces of software.  2.2.4.2 Wargames  Wargames are closely related to Attack-Defence CTFs, but are less gamified and have a  stronger focus on capability-building, particularly in the context of training security teams with  realistic experience. Wargames are frequently defender-focused, in contrast to the greater focus  on attackers in Attack-Defence competitions. When red-teams are present, they are usually  considered part of the organisers and not participants in their own right. While these are  significant and important events, they have a different role to most CTF competitions and so are  not typically categorised as CTF events.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  12  3. REPORT METHODOLOGY  To perform the analysis presented in this report, three sources were used. Firstly, the survey of  members from the International Cyber Security Challenge (ICSC)1 provided overall guidance  towards the events and methodology used throughout the rest of the data gathering. Secondly,  a manual selection, analysis and coding of important events was performed. Details on the  selection criteria and coding used is explained below. Thirdly, to build context into the report  statistical analysis of existing events was performed on a large dataset. For this purpose, the  selection criteria were broader in order to sample as many events as possible.  3.1 MANUAL ANALYSIS  The manual data-gathering and analysis component of this report follows a thematic analysis  [8]. Themes were pre-determined based on the requirements of the report and the experience  of the report writers in similar events. This was performed in favour of a grounded theory  approach due to the specific requirements of the ICSC Steering Committee and subsequent  need to gather data around specific themes. In particular, it is intended that the themes selected  provide readers with sufficient detail about all aspects of the organisation of CTF events.  The core data source for this report is the manual analysis of a set of CTF events. Events were  chosen via selection criteria and then researched via public information available about the  event. Before events were found, a set of key themes and questions within each theme were  determined based around key event information, the specified requirements of the report, the  requirements of the ICSC Steering Committee, and the data likely to be accessible and  practical. Data was initially stored as unstructured text per-question. Once data had been  gathered for each event and question pairing, the results for each question were aggregated  and grouped across events into a set of non-exclusive tags. At this point, the data was  standardised into a database containing the set of appropriate tags for each question and event.  This structured data formed the basis for subsequent analysis and presentation in this report.  3.1.1 Selection criteria  Events were selected according to a set of criteria to ensure a balanced selection. In particular,  the following were considered for each event:  3.1.1.1 Competition Format  Events were selected only if they were Capture-the-Flag events, as defined in the Background  section above. In particular, events were excluded if they were not security-themed, such as  hackathons (which primarily relate to development) or programming contests (whose challenges  are selected for requiring particularly challenging programming). Capture-the-Flags in all the  formats described in the Background section were included, with the exception of Wargames,  which were excluded because they are typically organised as training exercises for established  security teams, rather than open-format contests. In particular, events with both Jeopardy and  Attack-Defence formats were sought. This criterion was intended to give a broad range of  Capture-the-Flag events, without including similar formats that differ in theme or content.  3.1.1.2 Online and In-Person  Preference was made for events that took place in-person, and events that took place solely  online were not included unless: they were related to an in-person event (for instance, they  1 The International Cyber Security Challenge is a CTF-type of event to be hosted by ENISA in Athens in late 2021. Several  agencies, universities and governmental institutions from all regions participate in the Steering Committee which is  responsible for the organisation of the event.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  13  were used to invite participants to in-person events); they had been run in-person in previous  years; or they had been intended to run in-person but had been forced to move online to due  disruption from COVID-19. Because of the significant logistical differences between online and  in-person events, data relating to online-only events was considered less applicable to the  purposes of this report. The comparative abundance of online events, however, make them  beneficial when considering challenge formats, which are typically more consistent between  online and in-person events. In particular, the context-building statistical analysis considered  more online events, and the statistical differences between online and in-person events are  detailed later.  3.1.1.3 Significance  Events were selected only if they were significant according to one of the following tests: they  had a considerable number of participants, either as part of their final event or qualifiers; they  were used as a qualification event into a significant event, such as the European Cyber Security  Challenge; they were run, officially or unofficially, as a national-level contest, particularly when  used as a selection method for a national team.  3.1.1.4 Availability of Information  To facilitate the success of this report, events were only researched where it was apparent that  sufficient information about them was available publicly online. Including events that did not  meet this criterion would necessarily have lead to a decrease in the confidence in the  conclusions drawn. Due to the wide sampling and significant range of events that met the  criteria specified, it was deemed possible to select enough events for a significant analysis  without relying on events for which insufficient or low-quality data could be gathered. In  particular, when gathering potential candidates for analysis, each candidate was considered  suitable if it had one or more of the following: a published and accessible document of rules; a  published and accessible schedule of the event; sufficient trustworthy reporting, either by the  organisers or by third parties. This enabled the analysis to avoid working with events for which  little or no information could be determined, and in practice almost all candidate events passed  this criterion.  3.1.1.5 Explicit Mention in Survey  Events that were explicitly mentioned in the survey were considered even if they did not meet  other selection criteria. The majority of events mentioned in the survey had been included  through the previous criteria.  3.1.1.6 Location  Location was not used as a selection criterion and events from anywhere in the world were  included. This was a particular specification of this report, and effort was made to ensure that  events represented locations across the world.  3.1.2 Data sources  Data for each event was gathered primarily from public information released by the organisers.  For this purpose, two primary documents were sought for each event analysed:   A detailed rules document. These documents typically contain, implicitly or explicitly,  information about the format of the competition. This can include duration, team  information, selection criteria for participants, challenge formats, competition format,  and other information. Because of the formal structure of most events, almost every  event surveyed had a published rules document, and working from this structured data  improved the subsequent quality of our data gathering.   Published schedules: Events often publish detailed schedules, either as information for  participants or as marketing material (particularly where external sponsors are involved  in aspects of the schedule). Schedules provided detailed information about the length  of the competition and any organiser-planned activities during the event.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  14  On top of these documents, information was gathered from other sources published by event  organisers:   Almost every event found contained a public webpage detailing the event, either as a  post-event summary or as a record of pre-event marketing and information. These  websites were a source for general information about events but often lacked specific  details, except when contained within the documents listed above.   In some cases, particularly open-format events, access into the platforms used during  the event was still available. This enabled direct data gathering, particularly when  concerned with challenge formats and information. Where platforms contained a record  of organiser communication during the events, a considerable about of information  across data themes could be gathered directly or by inference from records of public  communications.  In some events, little event information was published by the organisers. This was more  common for events that were not open to participation applications, such as in directly  invitational events. While the majority of these events would fail to pass the stated availability of  information selection criteria, some events had sufficient data published about them from third-  party sources. In particular, news articles reporting the outcome of the event frequently contain  some information about the structure and format of the event.  In some cases, direct experience with the events being researched was available and in these  cases this was used to inform the data gathering.  3.1.3 Themes  Once events had been selected and filtered according to the selection criteria, they were  researched individually through the sources described above. During the research of each  event, data in a specific set of themes was gathered. Furthermore, each theme consisted of a  set of questions. Each question was answered in free-text by researchers during the  compilation process, before any coding was performed. Each theme was established in order to  address the general concerns of this report. Questions were determined by considering the  information that would be most beneficial towards the aim of the analysis and report, with  concern for the practicality of gathering the data via the identified sources.  Questions were gathered into themes in order to aggregate limited information into workable  collections, and to provide structure to the data gathering and analysis process. Consequently,  this report is laid out with these themes in mind, and analysis is broken down by theme to aid  comprehensibility and make clear the connection between gathered data and conclusions  drawn.  3.1.3.1 Theme 1 – Entry Requirements  Participants for all events studied were required to meet some set of entry requirements in order  to participate. In particular, events frequently had age requirements or the requirement to be at  a particular school level. Data was gathered on the following questions:  Age: Did the event have specific age requirements for participants, either as an upper-  or lower- bound on the ages of participants? Were teams all required to be the same  age? Were teams of different ages put into different competition categories?  Status: Did the event require participants to be a member of a particular organisation,  such as a school or university? Were teams of different status put into different  competition categories? Did participants have to have demonstrated previous success  at other events? This does not include succeeding at an event-specific qualifier.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  15  Qualifications: Did the event require participants to hold any particular qualifications?  Were they required to pass any tests, either formal or informal, in order to attend? This  does not include successfully competing at other events.  Location: Did the event require participants to be of a particular nationality, or reside in  a particular country? Did the event have different prizes or categories for participants  from different locations?  3.1.3.2 Theme 2 - Diversity and Inclusion  To address diversity requirements, and improve inclusion across a variety of measures, events  sometimes published information about efforts made to encourage, or improve access for,  under-represented groups. In particular, many events have had a significant gender imbalance  and had considerably more male participants. Data was gathered on the following questions:  Gender: Did the event have competition rules designed to encourage female  participation? Did the event have competition structure designed to encourage female  participation, such as grouping participants by gender?  Socio-economic: Did the event have competition rules designed to equalise socio-  economic disadvantages? Did the event make considerations for participants with  socio-economic disadvantages?  Ethnicity: Did the event have competition rules designed to encourage  underrepresented ethnicities?  3.1.3.3 Theme 3 - Challenge Format  Data was gathered regarding the format of challenges; that is, specifically relating to the  competition itself and how participants competed, including how they were scored and whether  or not they were competing for prizes. Theme 3 is distinguished from Theme 4 by considering  the specific competition process rather than the more general format of the competition.  Format: Which CTF formats did the challenges come from? Did the event contain only  one format, or contain components of multiple formats?  Challenge Categories: Which categories were challenges drawn from? In the case of  Jeopardy-style events, which categories were challenges from? In the case of Attack  Defence-style events, which aspects of Attack-Defence competitions were part of the  competition?  Scoring: What scoring methods were used for scoring participants? Were there  multiple ways to score points through challenges? Were there any non-challenge ways  to earn points towards winning the competition?  Platform: What platform was used by the event? Was the platform custom-made?  Was the platform an existing off-the-shelf solution?  Prizes: Was there a prize for the winning team or teams? Were there prizes for  particular challenges? Were there prizes for other parts of the competition, such as  providing challenges or writing write-ups?  Length: How long was the competition period? Was it broken up into multiple period,  or continuous? If the event was online, were participants able to begin their  competition period on-demand?  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  16  3.1.3.4 Theme 4 - Competition Format  The competition format concerned more general parts of the competition that were less related  to the challenges and more to how the competition took place. In particular, whether there were  multiple parts to the competition, such as qualifiers or parallel events, and whether teams were  allowed mentors or coaches.  Team Size: Was there a maximum team size? Was there a minimum team size? Were  teams formed by participants in advance of the competition or formed by the  organisers after selection of participants?  Mentors and Coaches: Were teams allowed a mentor or coach? Were teams required  to have a mentor or coach? Were teams assigned a mentor or coach by the  organisers?  Qualifiers: Did the event have a separate qualifier round? Did participants have to  achieve the top scores in the qualifiers to compete, or was the qualifier only part of the  selection process? Was the qualifier a specific event run by the same organisers or  was it based on other events run by different organisers?  Parallel Contests: Were there other competitions, other than the primary competition,  running at the event? Were they targeted at a different audience? Did they have a  different theme or challenge categories? Were they an extension of the main  competition with further challenges of the same type?  Online or In-Person: Was the event run entirely online? Was the event entirely in-  person? Was the event a mixture of both, such as having an online portion leading into  an in-person event? Was the event simultaneously in-person and online, for instance  to cater to different groups or to host different formats? Did this differ from previous  events, in particular because of COVID-19 restrictions or concerns?  Organiser Communication: Did the organisers communicate with participants during  the event? Did the organisers provide help using the platform during the event? Did the  organisers give hints during the competition? Did the organisers help participants with  challenges when requested?  Challenge Providers: Did the organisation create all challenges? Did the event use  existing challenges, such as from a platform or challenge provider? Were participants  expected to provide challenges?  3.1.3.5 Theme 5 - Event Organisation  Beyond the format of the event, this report also seeks to gather data on non-competition  activities run alongside competition events. For instance, whether social events were put on as  part of the competition, and whether participants were expected to find their own funding for  travel and accommodation expenses.  Other Activities: What other activities were organised by the event, in addition to the  competition? Were there any social activities? Were there sponsor-led activities? Were  there activities designed to benefit participants, such as career events?  Catering: Was the event catered by the organisers? Was catering only during the  competition period or during the entire event period, such as dinners after competition  days?  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  17  Transport and Accommodation: Did the organisers provide funding for transport to  the event? Did the organisers provide funding for accommodation expenses for  participants?  3.1.3.6 Theme 6 - Post-event  Once CTF events are completed, participants often request, or provide, solutions to the  challenges. In particular, the creation and sharing of solution write-ups for challenges is  a significant and important part of the community. Data was sought to discover if this  was supported or resisted by organisers.  Challenge Distribution: Did organisers release the challenges publicly once the  competition was over? Did the organisers explicitly prevent participants from sharing  challenges themselves?  Solution Distribution: Did organisers release solutions publicly once the competition  was over? Did the organisers explicitly prevent participants from sharing challenge  solutions themselves? Did the organisers actively promote participants who created  write-ups, for instance by having prizes or featuring solutions?  Data Release: Did organisers release data gathered during the competition? Did  organisers publish participant statistics, such as participant numbers or breakdowns?  Subsequent Publications: Did the organisers make formal publications as a result of  the competition and data gathered?  3.1.4 Coding and aggregation  Once data was gathered in free-text format for each theme and sub-theme, data for each  question was viewed laterally across the whole set events. This was used to study the spectrum  of results for each question and provide justification for a coding system. For this, a non-  exclusive tagging system was used, where the free-text answers for each question were tagged  with zero or more tags that categorised their answer. Tags were selected to appropriately cover  and aggregate the data seen in the free-text answers. Every question could also be tagged as  Unknown, where data found was insufficient to properly classify which tags were appropriate. In  some cases, additional primary research was performed to determine which tags should be  applied, and in this way research on each event was driven as a comparison to other events in  the dataset.  As part of the tag creation process, data for each question underwent aggregation into suitable,  granular categories. This was performed to facilitate later analysis and to avoid over-specificity  in cases where considerable amounts of data were present. This was particularly important  where events had very little available data.  In some cases, multiple question groups were aggregated together to provide more content  across all events. The rest of this report is structured around discussion of each theme, and  data is presented in these aggregated groupings so that each grouping provides sufficient detail  for meaningful analysis and discussion.  3.2 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  To augment later discussion and provide context to the events studied in detail, a statistical  analysis was conducted over a large, public dataset.  The dataset consists of events tracked by the CTFTime website (https://ctftime.org);  populated voluntarily by the CTF community, with records submitted either by organisers or  participants. CTFTime is a notable community website that lists events and tracks team  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  18  performance across multiple competitions. It is also public and free-to-access, both for readers  and CTF organisers, such that announcing a CTF event is accessible even with minimal  financial resources. As such it is a de facto publication platform for CTF events and therefore a  data source that is likely to be accurate and complete. The website also offers an open API to  allow analysis of the data.  The dataset was compiled from data retrieved via the open API and cover the period  01/01/2015 -- 06/12/2020; including data on events and contained challenges.  From manual inspection, event records were overwhelmingly complete and consistent, with only  a small number of empty or invalid entries. Challenge records were less complete, with only  approximately 73% of events having challenge records associated to them. Challenge records  would only be expected for events in a Jeopardy format, but records were incomplete for even  this subset. Nevertheless, the data were considered to be easily sufficient.  3.2.1 Dataset structure  The records contained in the dataset incorporate the following information:  Event   Title : The name of the CTF event   URL : Website for event   Format : Event type; with values within [Jeopardy, Attack-Defence, Hack Quest]   Restrictions : Entry restrictions; with values within [Open, High-School, Academic,  Prequalified, Invited]   Start : Event start time (to minute accuracy)   Finish : Event finish time (to minute accuracy)   On-site? : Flag indicating in-person events, instead of online   Location : Physical location (applicable only for on-site events)   Weight : A metric intended to track CTF event difficulty, for the purposes of ranking  teams. The weight is determined either by voting among competing teams or by  decision of CTFTime administrators. Weight values run from 0 (easiest) to 100 (most  difficult).   Challenge : Subsidiary records describing challenges within a CTF competition  o Name : The name of the challenge  o Points : Points awarded on completion of challenge  o Write-up count : Number of published write-ups associated with the  challenge  o Tags : A list of attributes for the challenge, typically used to encode the  challenge category at minimum, with greater specificity provided in some  cases  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  19  4. ANALYSIS RESULTS  4.1 MANUAL ANALYSIS  Following the selection process, a total of 22 CTF competitions were included in the manual  analysis. The competitions are listed below, with a longer profile for each given in Annex A.   European Cyber Security Challenge   Cyber Centurion - CSC UK   ACSC-ASEAN   Cambridge 2 Cambridge Cyber Competition   Country 2 Country   Cyber Challenge Italia   Cyber Security Challenge Canada   Cyber Security Challenge Germany   Cyber Security Challenge SA   DEF CON CTF   Midnight Sun Capture the Flag (AFCEA Sweden)   PicoCTF   Pwn2Own   US Cyber Challenge   WCTF (Qihoo 360)   CyberTalents Arab and Africa Regional CTF   National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition   International Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition   Global Cyberlympics   PlaidCTF   HITCON   Google CTF  The analysed CTF competitions were variously organised by governments, universities, for-  profit companies and community groups (see Figure 1). Government events were organised  either by national-level governments or supra-national bodies (such as the EU bloc), with no  local-government events in the analysis. University-run CTFs often had government support,  either through partnerships or via research-body funding.  Some university events sought to perform research in cybersecurity education, using the event  as a study, and publish findings as research papers. In other cases, the delivery of that  education and the promotion of cybersecurity careers was the main goal. Of the four  commercial events, three were operated by large, well-known technology companies, while one  was run by a cybersecurity recruitment agency. Community events were often, but not always,  attached to security conferences.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  20  Figure 1: Breakdown of Events by Organising Entity  The majority of the analysed events were intended either for the general public or for students in  tertiary education (see Figure 2). However, a small number specifically targeted school-aged  children to promote early cybersecurity education. The structure of these varied; with one  restricting entry solely to children, while others were open to wider age groups in another stream  of the competition. Most public CTFs were open to wide participation among hobbyists and  professionals. Four competitions were noted to target only skilled professionals in the area,  either with specific entry restrictions or de facto due to low entrant limits and high challenge  difficulties.  Figure 2: Breakdown of Events by Intended Audience  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  21  4.2 PER-THEME ANALYSIS  This section describes the results of manual analysis. Results are presented on a per-theme  basis.  4.2.1 Entry requirements  Age is the most common entry restriction, with competitions open to 'children only', 'university  students only' or 'adults only' (see Figure 3). This restriction is alternatively captured with no  age specification, but a requirement that entrants be of a given type, or possess specific skills  (Figure 4, Figure 5). Events targeted at a general audience generally make no restrictions  however (excepting that minors be accompanied). While globally-available, online competitions  were typical in community-organised and commercial events, location restrictions were common  for publicly-funded events (operated either directly by governments or through universities).  These required entrants to be from a particular nation, or group of nations, with the restrictions  complemented by further regional subdivisions in two cases (Figure 6).  Figure 3: Breakdown of Events by Age  Figure 4: Breakdown of Events by Participant Type  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  22  Figure 5: Breakdown of Events by Qualifications Required  Figure 6: Breakdown of Events by Location  4.2.2 Diversity and inclusion  Of those examined, no event restricted entrance by gender (see Figure 7). In the case of the  UK's Cyber Centurion competition (an event aimed at children), teams were categorised by  gender. In two other events teams with female members received a bonus in competition. No  restrictions were made by socio-economic background either (Figure 8). Only the large, public  PicoCTF made any direct reference to economic accessibility, with the organisers specifically  stating that the competition platform had been designed to be easily accessible to those with  low-cost hardware. In some events, equipment was provided by the organisers, although this  was typically to avoid competitive advantages, rather than to promote access. No event was  found to indicate any policy for diversity by ethnicity (Figure 9).  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  23  Figure 7: Breakdown of Events by Gender Restrictions  Figure 8: Breakdown of Events by Socio-Economic Restrictions  Figure 9: Breakdown of Events by Ethnicity Restrictions  4.2.3 Challenge format  The analysed CTF events displayed a wide variety of configurations. The majority of  competitions were in the Jeopardy format, by a substantial margin, with Attack-Defence and  question-based competitions the most popular of the other categories (see Figure 10). The  popularity of head-to-head Attack-Defence was higher for in-person competitions, although  Jeopardy competitions were also common here. Yet, a range of unusual derivatives were also  noted, including questionnaires, individual attack campaigns against vulnerable virtual machines  and patching exercises. The US-based National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition and  International Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition both followed an unusual defence-only  format in which entrants acted as a 'Blue Team' pitted against an attacking 'Red Team' formed  of volunteers who were cybersecurity professionals.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  24  Figure 10: Breakdown of Events by Format  Popular challenge categories were represented across the examined events, with Crypto,  Exploitation, Forensics, Web and Reverse Engineering commonly appearing (see Figure 11).  As noted above, defensive categories were also well-represented, both as defence against  targeted attacks and defence against malware. Where reported, major CTFs typically operated  custom platforms (Figure 12), although external hosted services were occasionally seen  (indeed, the same HackingLab hosted platform was used in two cases).  It is suspected that popular open-source platforms were utilised for these custom  arrangements, rather than software developed from scratch, although hard data was not  available to support that. Scoring was primarily seen to be fixed, with specific point values given  for Jeopardy challenges or successful Attack-Defence captures and holds (Figure 13). Most  variants upon scoring included either modified point values, an element of manual grading or  additional points for special cases (such as 'King-of-the-Hill' in Attack-Defence). In one notable  case, Qihoo 360 WCTF operated primarily on a Jeopardy model, but supplemented the main  solution points with an additional round in which solutions were evaluated by a technical jury  and awarded bonus points.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  25  Figure 11: Breakdown of Events by Challenge Category  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  26  Figure 12: Breakdown of Events by Platform  Figure 13: Breakdown of Events by Scoring  It was found that winners' prizes were commonly awarded (see Figure 14). These were either  items of consumer technology, cash prizes, or invitations to other prestigious events. There was  wide variation in this rule, however. The Pwn2Own competition operates as a live bug bounty  event, in which successful attacks have direct commercial applications, and as such carries  cash prizes up to $80,000 (USD).  By contrast, the very well-respected, DEF CON CTF offers prizes with low monetary value -- but  enormous prestige in the community. Ancillary prizes were occasionally awarded for contributed  challenges and stand-out actions (\"the je ne sais quoi award\" in Cambridge2Cambridge), but  these were not common (Figure 15).  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  27  Figure 14: Breakdown of Events by Winner Prize Inclusion  Figure 15: Breakdown of Events by Other Prize Inclusion  Most events were short, with 2--3 day CTFs marginally more popular than single-day CTFs  events (see Figure 16Figure 16). As many of the analysed events were large, in-person  competitions; operating short, focused events is understandable -- both in terms of cost and  available participant time. Online competitions typically ran for longer periods; consistent with  being background or hobby activities rather than full-time pursuits.  Figure 16: Breakdown of Events by Length  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  28  4.2.4 Competition format  Team size requirements in the analysed competitions varied widely, as Figure 17 shows. More  competitions permit a team-size range, than prescribe an exact team size. Where a bounded  range was permitted, the largest size was never higher than 10 and usually less than 5.  However, in a set of major community-run events (and one commercial event) team size is  unbounded. Of these, three events were online, where team sizes cannot easily be enforced,  while one was in-person (providing up to 8 team seats, but no limit on external access). The  other event was Pwn2Own, an exploit finding competition, in which team size is not so strongly  connected to performance as in other formats.  Figure 17: Breakdown of Events by Team Size Restrictions  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  29  From those analysed, more events incorporated qualifying rounds than did not, although this is  skewed by the selection of renowned competitions and 'finals' events with limited memberships  -- open competitions typically have far more entrants (see Figure 18). Competitions operating  in-person or online were equally matched (Figure 19). However, in 2020, a handful of events  were moved online due to COVID-19, despite otherwise being held in-person. Events were split  between allowing a mentor with a team and prohibiting this (Figure 20). Where allowed,  mentors were variously an accompanying adult (for children), an employer or a prior competitor  at the event.  CTF organisers typically provide at least technical support for entrants, with hints being provided  in some cases. Few CTFs made a concrete statement of the communication policy and the  availability of hints was very rare (Figure 22). A handful of events operated parallel competitive  contests alongside the main challenges (Figure 21) and these were either targeting another  audience (i.e., a student tier of a professional competition) or adding additional challenges of a  different type (e.g., hardware attacks, physical security challenges or a social engineering  exercise during social events).  Figure 18: Breakdown of Events by Qualifier Round Inclusion  Figure 19: Breakdown of Events by Physicality  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  30  Figure 20: Breakdown of Events by Mentor/Coach Allowance  Figure 21: Breakdown of Events by Inclusion of Parallel Contests  Figure 22: Breakdown of Events by Organiser Communication Policy  4.2.5 Event organisation  Peripheral activities were incorporated in just under half of the examined CTFs, principally social  and careers activities (see Figure 23. Catering was often provided for in-person events, with  transportation provided occasionally (Figure 24, Figure 25). In one interesting case (Cyber  Security Challenge Canada), catering was provided for a nationwide, online event with  participants distributed across the country. In no other cases was catering or transportation  made available for an online event.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  31  Figure 23: Breakdown of Events by Other Activity Inclusion  Figure 24: Breakdown of Events by Catering Provision  Figure 25: Breakdown of Events by Transport Provision  Where information was available, CTF challenges were mostly provided by event organisers,  with a small number incorporating challenges from sponsors (see Figure 26). A handful of  events asked participating teams to produce challenges, or used those provided by a hosted  platform.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  32  Figure 26: Breakdown of Events by Challenge Source  Events were advertised over a range of media (see Figure 27). Events usually (although not  universally) hosted a public website. Twitter was used nearly as frequently to disseminate  information. Live updates, via Twitter, blogs, Discord channels or a video feed were a common  feature. Live streaming of competitions is rare, but seen both for in-person events (National  Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition, Qihoo 360 WCTF) and one online event (GoogleCTF).  In the latter case, it was a competition requirement for finalist teams to stream their work from a  designated computer and these streams are available on YouTube.  Figure 27: Breakdown of Events by Communication Channel  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  33  4.2.6 Post-event  In the examined events, the amount and type of information released by CTF organisers was  varied. Challenges and solutions were officially released for 28% and 23% of events,  respectively (see Figure 28, Figure 29). However, these numbers should be considered with  some context. Challenges accessed after a competition were sometimes broken (e.g., where a  webservice must be attacked, this was often found to be unavailable), while unofficial solutions  (in the form of participant write-ups) were often plentiful even if no official solutions were  released.  Figure 28: Breakdown of Events by Challenge Release Policy  Figure 29: Breakdown of Events by Solution Release Policy  Events with an education focus, rather than an entertainment focus, sometimes released more  detailed data (see Figure 30), or even published academic papers about the design and  operation of the event (see Figure 31). Both were rare overall, however.  Figure 30: Breakdown of Events by Data Publication  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  34  Figure 31: Breakdown of Events by Research Paper Publication  4.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  In total, 879 events were recorded in the CTFTime community dataset.  The number of CTF competitions has grown every year, even reporting the highest numbers in  2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic (see Figure 32). Competitions are primarily conducted  online (>73%), but in-person events take place all over the world (Figure 33). Figure 34 shows  the locations of in-person events.  Figure 32: Competitions by Year  Figure 33: Competitions by Location  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  35  Figure 34: Map of In-person Competition Locations  The majority of events took place over either a single day, or a few days (see Figure 35). A  notable benefit of short multi-day events is to minimise the effect of time-zones to promote  worldwide participation. Nevertheless, even the predominantly-online CTF Time events were  still mostly bounded to only a small multi-day duration.  Figure 35: Competitions by Duration  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  36  As with the events studied in the manual analysis, the vast majority of competitions from the  CTF Time dataset use a Jeopardy format (>87%), over Attack-Defence or Hack Quest formats  (see Figure 36). Again however, Attack-Defence is more popular for in-person events;  accounting for nearly 25% of the total events, while online competitions only use an Attack-  Defence format approximately 5% of the time.  Figure 36: Competitions by Format  The competitions listed on CTF Time overwhelmingly specify no entry criteria; with all teams  welcome to apply (see Figure 37). A small number are restricted to (high-) schoolchildren or  university teams, but this is less common than in the manual analysis. A handful of  competitions, usually larger and more renowned events, apply a prequalification criterion. This  is typically an initial public competition, from which the best-placing teams are selected for  invitation to the main competition. Alternatively, teams may be scouted among other notable  competitions and invited without a direct qualification round. While the use of qualification  rounds was seen often in the manual analysis, it is far rarer in the full CTF Time data, likely due  to the logistical effort required and the focus on accessibility, over exclusivity and performance,  that is common of community events.  Figure 37: Competitions by Entry Restriction  In the CTF Time difficulty weighting, events were significantly clustered around a low-to-medium  difficulty level (approx. 25), although with instances of events having nearly every difficulty  weighting. This is visualised as a histogram of weightings in Figure 38. This is consistent with  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  37  the focus on accessible challenges that can be enjoyed by a range of participants, along with  the likelihood that many community organisers cannot devote sufficient resources to create very  challenging tasks as part of their events. Many events included in the manual analysis do not  appear on CTF Time (particularly government events), however those that do have an average  weighting of 53.05 and include DEF CON CTF, HITCON CTF and PlaidCTF, which all have  weightings over 90 in recent years.  Figure 38: Histogram of Competitions by Weighting  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  38  5. DISCUSSION  This section contains a discussion of the results found in the course of this report and their  relevant for organisers of future events.  5.1 PARTICIPATION AND INVOLVEMENT  5.1.1 Popularity  The data gathered in this report shows that CTFs are a hugely, and increasingly, popular event  format. CTF events are carried out all over the world, with participants from a range of age  groups and skill levels. The number of events has consistently grown year-on-year since the  earliest year in the data gathered. Recommendations of the educational benefits of security  competitions2 have resonance with the success of events aimed at school- and university-age  groups. The data gathered in this report suggests that there are more events targeted at these  groups than at professionals; which suggests the value of CTFs as introductory and skill-  building opportunities. CTFs have also been used to encourage the traditionally-  underrepresented group of female participants. Some events were seen to offer benefits to  teams with female members, although this was not a popular approach. Indeed, in the authors'  experience of one such event, their female colleagues felt this practice commented negatively  on their contribution. In other cases, gender diversity measures focused on providing access to  role models and tailored mentorship as peripheral activities, rather than employing measures  that altered the competition.  5.1.2 Online and in-person  While the CTF format lends itself well to online participation, half of the significant events that  data was gathered on were in-person. Some events supplemented an in-person competition  with online components in order to allow greater participation; this was found in both high-tier  events such as DEF CON (which allows remote participants to assist a size-limited in-person  team) and events focused on education and outreach (with some events holding open-access  online events concurrent to invitation- or qualification-only in-person events). Where these  parallel contests occurred, they had a range of purposes; concurrent events were found that  targeted a different audience, provided challenges on a different theme (such as a set of  challenges about hacking into wireless networks), or simply provided extra challenges on the  same theme.  5.1.3 Mentors and coaches  Events, particularly those targeted at minors, often invited teams to participate under a mentor  or coach. In many cases, this was an adult or teacher, presumably for the purpose of taking  responsibility for child participants. Beyond this, some events allocate teams a mentor from one  of the sponsoring organisations, and in one case previous competitors were selected to mentor  later teams. Mentorship in this way offers a range of benefits, including allowing sponsoring  organisations to work with potential job applicants in a close fashion and allowing teams to  benefit from professional input and experience. Previous competitors, particularly those who are  no longer able to compete, may enjoy mentoring and coaching as an opportunity to continue to  be involved, and their input to teams provides teams with experienced guidance. In the  experience of the authors, providing new participants with close guidance during their  2 Chothia and Novakovic, ‘An Offline Capture the Flag-Style Virtual Machine and an Assessment of Its Value for  Cybersecurity Education’.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  39  introduction to the CTF format is highly productive and can enable participants to gain  experience from avenue that they may be otherwise have been dissuaded from using.  5.2 COMPETITION AND CHALLENGE  5.2.1 Format  While Jeopardy is the dominant format both online and in-person, Attack-Defence events have  had a persistent presence since the earliest events. Mixed-format events, containing both  Jeopardy challenges and Attack-Defence targets provides a middle-ground that combines the  benefits of both styles. In the manually-gathered dataset, only one of the events surveyed was  purely Attack-Defence without any Jeopardy components. The considerably higher costs  associated with setting up and managing Attack-Defence infrastructure may be a considerable  factor in the decisions of event organisers. Further, the comparative difficulty of scaling-up  Attack-Defence contests may further explain their lack of use in online formats, which typically  have larger participant numbers. Attack-Defence may also be associated with higher skill  requirements for participants, as their less-gamified structure may increase the knowledge and  tools needed to successfully perform compromises. This is somewhat supported by the  participant-perceived difficulty of the events, with Attack-Defence events having the highest  average difficulty, followed by Jeopardy. Hack Quests, were on average considered to be  significantly easier than standard Jeopardy, suggesting their typical use as highly-structured  introductory events for new players.  5.2.2 Challenge categories  The strength of CTFs, and in particular Jeopardy formats, comes from their flexibility and  inclusion of many types of distinct tasks for participants. The events surveyed covered a wide  variety of areas; forming 26 distinct categories in this report. The most popular categories -- in  terms of presence at most events -- are unsurprising to seasoned CTF participants, with Crypto,  Forensics, Re, Web and Exploit forming the top five. Other, more unusual challenge themes  found included Human Factors, Privacy, Hardware, and Hash-Breaking.  Challenges are predominantly technical, and while some events mentioned non-technical  categories, the survey was not able to find any specific instances of non-technical challenges.  Some examples from prior experience include social engineering challenges, such as  interacting with an automated email service to send it phishing emails, lockpicking and  interacting with other teams to gather all the parts of a flag. Physical security challenges such as  lockpicking are sometimes incorporated into the main, scored competition, while others are  conducted as an unscored peripheral activity (such as a guided exercise, from the authors'  experience, in which participants performed a physical wiretap of a network cable).  5.2.3 Challenge sources  Challenges came from a variety of sources, although they were predominantly provided by the  organisers directly. In some cases, participants themselves were required to provide challenges  in order to compete. These submitted challenges were then vetted and modified by organisers  before inclusion. In one instance this formed the basis for a secondary prize, where the team  with the best challenge received an award. Participant-submitted challenges were observed in  two Jeopardy contests; in one case, the participants were required to submit a vulnerable virtual  machine containing weaknesses. Some events also included sponsor-provided challenges.  These would could cover a similar theme to the sponsor, or even explicitly involve the use of the  sponsor's product. In one event, sponsor challenges acted as a separate competition, with  participants being awarded individual prizes for the best performance in the sponsor challenge.  In some cases, the event was hosted by an existing CTF provider and may have used the  existing challenges produced by that provider.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  40  5.2.4 Jeopardy variants  Within the Jeopardy format, there was considerable variation. While the standard format of  individual challenges with automatically-scored flags was the most prevalent, many events  provided further interest with alternative scoring or challenge formats. There was relatively little  consensus -- the most popular non-standard variation was only found in three of the events --  but almost all in-person events included some variant. The most popular was  quiz- or question-  based scoring, where participants were required to answer further information about the  challenges they were performing. This may take the form of multiple-choice questions or  through written submissions that were evaluated by a jury. As opposed to the standard CTF  platform infrastructure, some events opted to distribute challenges via vulnerable virtual  machine images, in a manner similar to Attack-Defence. Points were rewarded for participants  primarily based on a fixed-per-solve basis, although events also included points that scaled  according to the number of solves, and extra points for the first solves of a challenge. Four  events also explicitly mentioned providing points for other, miscellaneous, non-challenge  activities.  5.3 STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION  5.3.1 Event length  Event length varied considerably in the larger dataset; events most often lasted a day or two but  many took place over up to a week and some considerably longer. Conversely, almost all the  events in the manually-gathered dataset took a few days or less, with half of them taking one  day. Only one event, PicoCTF, took place over a longer period (two weeks). Actual competition  time was often shorter; some events took place for a few hours on a single day and included  time for other activities. Conversely, some events took place over a few days and enabled  participants to continue working \"out of hours\"; this is primarily the case for online events but  also seen in some in-person events. In these instances, scoreboards and submission systems  may be disabled while participants are not in the venue.  5.3.2 Peripheral activities  In-person events frequently advertised other activities planned during the competition period.  These included briefings, meals, and other social activities. Events also included activities led  by or including sponsors; particularly job fairs, career advice sessions and other recruitment  activities. In many cases these were disconnected from the competition, in a few instances they  were connected to the scoring of the competition (for instance, sponsor booths that allowed  participants to score points by engaging with an activity). Many events explicitly mentioned  providing catering, including one online event which offered to deliver pizza to competitors.  Fewer events mentioned covering travel or accommodation costs, although the nature of the  data sources used made this data difficult to gather with confidence.  5.3.3 Organiser communication  Organisers communicated with their participants through a variety of media, both before and  during the event. Almost (but, notably, not all) events had an event-specific webpage that  provided details and (normally) a means of participants to register. Twitter and Facebook were  both commonly used by a significant number of events, and other social media such as  LinkedIn, Instagram and Flickr were also utilised. Chat-based platforms, such as IRC, Discord  and Telegram were also seen, with Discord proving the most widely-used (although still only  found in a small number of events). In particular, some events used Discord both as a  communication means and as a challenge-distribution platform, where participants were able to  download challenges directly from Discord channels. Some events reported that organisers  would provide hints and help during the competition, although this was unusual. While live  streaming of screens, scoreboards and judging processes was witnessed in some cases, it was  rare for events to fully embrace the medium. Pwn2Own is a notable counterexample, however,  with day-long streams and live commentary.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  41  5.4 QUALIFICATION AND POST-EVENT  5.4.1 Qualification  Few CTF events had explicit requirements on who could compete, aside from educational  status; one event required participants to pass a short online test that examined technical skills  and English-language proficiency. One event, which was on the borderline between a wargame  exercise and a CTF, was invitational and only included participants who worked professionally  as cyber incident responders. Roughly half the events used a qualification round to filter  participants down for final events. In most cases, qualification rounds were run by the same  organisers and were often online or run in a decentralised fashion, with individual schools or  universities hosting qualifiers. In some cases, events that are significant in themselves are used  as qualifiers to a future event, and successful winners of the main event go on to participate in a  further competition. This was particularly prevalent in the dataset due to selection biases, and  many surveyed events act as national qualifiers for the ECSC. In the case of DEF CON,  participant teams were able to join from successful participation in the DEF CON qualification  round or by winning other selected other events (including the previous year).  5.4.2 Team allocation  Participants almost always participated in teams in main events, although many events allow  participation in teams of one. In some cases, participants qualified individually and were then  sorted into teams by the organisers. In the Cambridge2Cambridge event, this was performed by  sorting participants by qualification score and assembling teams of equal skill. Teams  occasionally had further requirements: in one case, teams needed to contain participants from  different age groups; in two, teams were encouraged to include female members by providing  benefits in the rules (for instance, by allowing teams to have one additional member if they were  female).  5.4.3 Resultant publications  There are many papers in academic literature relating to both the organisational processes, and  to the education and training benefits. Experience of running events is a frequent basis of this  work and consequently many events led directly to publications. For instance, the organisers of  PicoCTF list a collection of papers and research work they have performed around the  competition, on topics such as how to encourage participation, how to generate challenges  automatically (with a view to overcoming flag-sharing), and more generally on the running of  PicoCTF itself.  5.4.4 Data Sharing  Some events also release detailed statistics about the event. DEF CON release considerable  information, including raw packet captures, that provide detailed insight both to the event itself  and to the exploits and vulnerabilities that were used during the competition. Other events  release demographic statistics; Cyber Challenge Italia release such statistics both for their final  event and broken down by individual qualifier events. In total, detailed data was found for six of  the events.  5.4.5 Writeups  CTF culture places significant importance of the creation, study and dissemination of post-event  writeups. Each writeup explains the details of a challenge and its solution from the perspective  of a participant or team. These are widely shared and repositories exist that collect them  together (for instance, CTFTime allows users to submit writeups for challenges once a contest  is ended). This is reinforced by some event organisers, who encourage (and sometimes reward)  participants who submit high-quality writeups to them. In some instances, teams must supply  writeups to challenges they solve in order to be presented with their prizes. This may act as a  deterrent to cheats, or may ensure winning teams have a thorough understanding of the  challenges they have solved. Organisers may also release solutions to their challenges  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  42  themselves so that participants can understand the technicalities behind the challenges after  the event. On the other end of the spectrum, some competitions explicitly forbid the release of  writeups or the sharing of challenge files after the event. This may be intended to enable them  to re-use challenges in later years, although it is unlikely that determined participants would be  unable to find copies of the solutions to previous years. In the manual dataset, we found no  direct evidence that any of the events surveyed forbade sharing of either challenges or  writeups.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  43  6. CONCLUSIONS  In this section, we provide the following recommendations for organisers of future competitions.  These conclusions are informed by the analysis and discussions presented in this report. These  recommendations are made in the context of the survey results. Our conclusions are as follows:  6.1 COMPETITION FORMAT  Jeopardy is heavily favoured in both online and in-person event formats. This is likely due to a  range of factors, including accessibility, lower deployment costs, and scalability. Despite this,  the continued prevalence of Attack-Defence (particularly in the well-respected DEF CON CTF),  and its similarity to the wargame formats preferred by professional training exercises, indicates  the value of this format. We suggest that events designed to be accessible to non-professional  audiences are based on the Jeopardy format, and follow the trend of other events and include  Attack-Defence elements if desired. Structuring in this way gives the benefits of both formats  and reduces the drawbacks of either.  6.2 TEAM REQUIREMENTS  We found that many events are deliberately targeted to specific age groups, or specifically to  students. Further, we found evidence that some events attempt to create a more even gender  balance. We found little evidence of events requiring specific degrees or certifications, except  implicitly in professional competitions. We suggest that attempts to encourage gender balance  through team composition are unlikely to have significant impact, particularly for top-tier events  where participants are likely to have needed to be preparing for (and attempting qualify for) the  event for a long period.  Teams may expect to have a mentor or coach present, particular when younger participants are  involved. In cases where a mentor is involved, it may be important to provide clear rules and  roles for them. In particular, their communication with their team during the event may give an  unfair advantage to competitors based on the expertise and willingness of their mentor. As a  result, we suggest that mentor roles are clearly defined, if included at all.  6.3 TEAM SIZES  The greatest division between the results of our analysis and the survey results are in team  size, where the ideal size suggested in the survey was approximately twice as large as the  expected team size in the events surveyed. We believe this is due to the nature of ECSC as an  international event with national qualifiers; as participant teams are likely to be created out of  the top-performing teams from individual qualifying events, it is natural that large team sizes  would be more suitable and preferred by participants. It may be worth drawing a parallel to DEF  CON, which equally represents the culmination of a number of events and, equally, is typically  attended by teams of a larger size. It may be worth considering that DEF CON places a limit on  the in-person team size, presumably for logistical reasons, while placing no limit on the size of  the remote team -- limiting the size of a remote team is impossible to enforce and therefore  unlikely to be suitable to a competitive environment.  6.4 SCORING AND RULES  For Jeopardy formats, it is anticipated that participants would expect the primary scoring  mechanism to follow traditional Jeopardy fixed-per-challenge or scoring based on the number of  solves. Many events provide some deviation from this, and in particular some events provide  subjective or jury-evaluated questions alongside challenges. We believe these are less likely to  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  44  scale well into larger competitions with higher skill levels and suggest that objective scoring  systems have higher integrity.  Equally, while some events include participant-submitted challenges, these require a distinct  skillset to that of typical CTF participation. Including participant-submitted challenges also  creates an uneven playing field, where each team has a different set of challenges to solve and  consequently this may somewhat dilute the competitive aspect. Sponsor-provided challenges  provide a potential opportunity for more competitive challenge variety. In these instances, care  should be taken that challenges fit with the format and style of the rest of the competition; in our  experience, unrestricted sponsor challenges can fit poorly with the rest of the competition,  possibly due to sponsor inexperience with the format.  6.5 PARALLEL COMPETITIONS  Including a parallel competition may be a valuable way to increase engagement beyond core  participants. Of particular note, Google CTF's Beginner's Quest offered interested non-  participants an opportunity to experience the event without requiring the (relatively high) skills  necessary to participate in the full event. Hack Quests in particular offer an enjoyable and  engaging way to bring new participants into later competitions and build interest in the CTF  scene. It may also be appropriate, in some events, to run specialist parallel competitions that  focus specifically on one aspect of the competition that may not be a good fit for general  participants. For instance, it may be the case that few participants have experience of hardware  challenges, and inclusion in the main event may give a disproportionate advantage to those with  prior experience.  6.6 CHALLENGE FORMATS  The \"typical\" range of Jeopardy CTF challenges is extremely broad. While there are standard  categories that most challenges are drawn from (specifically reverse engineering, exploitation,  web-based exploits, forensics, and cryptography), there is a wide variety of alternative  categories that may be suitable for inclusion. In particular, challenges that benefit from the  physical, in-person nature of the event, such as snooping on wireless traffic, may be well-  received, particularly as they are less likely to have been experienced previously. There is some  evidence of increased interest in non-technical challenges, and the interdisciplinary nature of  cybersecurity may be encouraged by including challenges of this form. Particularly, there has  been some evidence of automated social engineering challenges. Events which utilise jury-  based evaluation may find greater success with challenges of this form, which may require more  subjective analysis, but care should be taken not to deviate too greatly from the established and  successful CTF format.  6.7 COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA  Web and social media presence is generally consistent across all events, with almost every  event (and every open event) maintaining a website and some social media presence.  Facebook and Twitter were the most common, and some degree of engagement with these  platforms is likely anticipated by participants. We further recommend the consideration of chat-  based platforms, such as Discord, IRC, or Slack, which offer an excellent opportunity for general  communication, announcements, challenge and platform support. Further, community-led  platforms such as these offer a chance for engagement beyond the competition. In the Discord  servers we surveyed, we found evidence that participants were still engaged with each other,  with discussions of both security and general interests.  6.8 POST-EVENT  To further encourage and engage the community beyond the event itself, organisers may wish  to support participants (and non-participants) who wish to go over the challenges in their own  time. This has two primary avenues; firstly, making challenges available after the event, and  secondly, ensuring that writeups or solutions for challenges are available. Organisers may not  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  45  need to do a great deal to facilitate this, as the community has a strong tradition of publishing  writeups for most events. However, organisers who go further to facilitate this, such as by  amplifying or sharing participant writeups, or by providing awards to the best writeups, may  compound the benefits. Releasing challenges after the event is also beneficial as they can be  used as a training and teaching tool, particularly for participants seeking to prepare for future  iterations of the event. Some thought may need to be given to this in cases where challenges  involve servers, and this may not be possible in cases where hardware is involved.  In addition to supporting the spread of challenges and writeups, organisers should consider the  beneficial impact they can have on the academic community. This could be performed indirectly,  by sharing data about the competition, such as demographic data on participants, or about the  challenges themselves. Such data is of particular interest in Attack-Defence formats, where  attack traffic data may closely mirror real-world attack traffic. Further, organisers may wish to  follow the example of other events and directly publish their conclusions that follow from their  own experience running an event.  CTF EVENTS  May 2021  46  7.

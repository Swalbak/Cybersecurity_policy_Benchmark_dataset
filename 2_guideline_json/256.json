To do so,  first the methodology is described. This approach is based on the recently published CENELEC  Technical Specification 50701 (CLC/CLC/TS 50701:2021). The approach is complemented with  additional practical information and hints on how to make the implementation of zoning easier  for a railway operator. It gathers the experience of the European Railway Information Sharing  and Analysis Center and its members, i.e. European infrastructure managers and railway  undertakings.  Each of the steps of the zoning process is explained in detail. The document shows what  standards are required in each step and what processes should be performed. Additionally, the  document discusses the documentation that should be created during each step and guidance  in the form of a ‘cookbook’ is given.  During the zoning process, zoning models are developed over three iterations:  1. “Proposal railway zoning model”: it is used in the first steps, ranging from first collecting  information and designing initial zones (ZCR 1) up to the stage where zones, conduits,  communication lines and security levels (SL) get verified briefly for the first time (ZCR  3). The proposal zone model is generic. It can be aligned with but need not fit the  corporate structure.  2. “High-level railway zoning model”: it contains a concrete and defined risk verified  architecture (ZCR 4) and is implemented via cybersecurity measures (ZCR 5). The  company specific high-level zone model should be orientated to the corporate  structure.  3. “Final railway zoning model”: it is a detailed and verified version of the high-level  model, reflecting the corporate structure within all zones, conduits and communication  lines, the SL ZC and other information (ZCR 6 to ZCR 7).  At the end of this document, the phases after zoning is complete are discussed, i.e. Migration  (ZCR 8) and Operation (ZCR 9). Finally, the issue of legacy systems is commented on briefly.

INTRODUCTION  This document gives the reader additional guidance on the topic of zoning and conduits in the  railway sector. This topic is introduced in a general way in the standard series IEC 62443, as  well as CLC/TS 50701:2021. The concepts from these standards are used as a foundation and  their application is explained in more detail. This document contains an initial chapter, which  provides an overview on the topic of zoning and conduits. Afterwards, each step of the process  is explained in detail. Each of these process steps is described as follows.  • At the beginning a guiding question is defined, which aims at explaining to the reader why this  activity must be performed and what the expected outcome might look like.  • After this, the current step in the process is outlined and the relevant parts of CLC/TS  50701:2021 or the IEC 62443 series are indicated. Should the reader already have some  knowledge of this process step, he can skip the subsequent subsections of the chapter  accordingly, as these provide detailed guidance.  • Following this, design considerations for the process step are shown.  • Then the section that follows provides detailed guidance on how to perform the step and  ensure that the desired results are produced.  • Each section concludes with the identification and explanation of domain specific stipulations,  as well as some hints on implementation.  The document concludes with a quick look at the area of legacy systems.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  10  2. ZONING AND CONDUIT  METHODOLOGY  The following section gives an overview of the process of zoning and conduit methodology.  Each phase is then described in detail in the chapters that follow.  2.1 GENERAL OVERVIEW  ZCR 1: Identify assets and basic process demands:  a) Identify all assets;  b) Create a ‘draft architecture’ or a ‘proposal zone model’ following EN62443-3-2 (chapter  ‘Architecture and Design Principles’).  ZCR 2: Identify global corporate risks through an initial risk assessment  ZCR 3: Perform zoning  a) define the basic system context (networks in the company and their criticality, principal  communication matrix);  b) define zone, conduits, communication lines and ZC-levels;  c) go from draft or proposal zone model to the high-level zone model (following EN  62443-3-3);  d) define proposals for target security level (SL-T) for each conduit (zone and SuC);  e) establish the high-level zone model by verifying proposal zone model.  ZCR 4:  Perform high-level risk assessment with the high-level zone model and the  designated SL for exceeding risk  ZCR 5: Check threats  a) Check the high-level zone model against cybersecurity threats.  b) Identify countermeasures (following EN62443-3-3) and modify the high-level zone  model to become the final zone model.  c) Verify the ‘final zone model’ through a detailed risk assessment.  ZCR 6: Document all information and results  ZCR 7: Get approval from all stakeholders  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  11  The overall process steps to define zones from scratch based on the standard processes in  CLC/TS50701:2021 and EN62443-3-2:2018 are shown below. In this paper, some states are  split for easier explanation.  Figure 1 Zoning and conduit methodology  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  12  Figure 2 Zoning process: overview  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  13  The final zone model depends on existing systems and zones, the result of the threat risk  assessment and the target architecture of each railway operator. Security parameters such as  security levels (SL), zone criticality (ZC) or protection profiles are discussed in separate  chapters and are built upon of this generic base.

ZONING STEPS  3.1 IDENTIFICATION OF ASSETS AND THE SYSTEM UNDER  CONSIDERATION (ZCR 1)  Guiding questions. What assets will be considered? What organisational and technical  boundaries exist? Which process standards must they fulfil? What asset groups, lifecycle  groups and legacy systems exist? How many employees are working on security?  3.1.1 Process  Figure 3 Identification of assets and SuC (ZCR 1)  Figure 3 illustrates the steps to be applied to perform the initial risk assessment as a second  step and to derive a security architecture in ‘zones and conduits’.  3.1.2 Related parts of standards  Overall functional description  The location of the SuC within the model of the railway architecture shows the kind of system to  which the SuC belongs (e.g. rolling stock, signalling, infrastructure etc.) and which main  functions are supported. The identification of the cybersecurity threat to the SuC should be  based on a SuC where the system boundaries and the functionality provided are defined.  Therefore, this identification of the main functions should be detailed by providing information  related to:  • the objective (intended purpose) and the mission profile of the SuC comprising the  definition of the system functions, the system borders and the interfaces;  • the operational scenarios, which define how the SuC will be used and which actors are  interfering or interfacing with the SuC;  • the context of their implementation and use;  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  15  • the planned lifetime and therefore, possibly, necessary system updates to HW and  SW;  • maintenance plans and concepts for the SuC;  • constraints due to the environment which integrates with the SuC [Source: CLC/TS  50701:2021].  SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 CHAPTER 6.2.2  Assets supporting the essential functions  Assets supporting the essential functions of the SuC shall be clearly identified in the definition of  the system along with their relationship with their corresponding essential functions. [Source:  CLC/TS 50701:2021]  SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 CHAPTER 6.2.5  3.1.3 Design information  3.1.3.1 Note for security-architecture in greenfield environments  It is highly recommended that the processes of communication and the process of the essential  functions at a high level be checked with the responsible owner of the essential function before  going forward to ZCR 2 in order to prevent a re-design of the zone model and thus a step back  to ZCR 1 from a later stage.  3.1.3.2 Note for security-architecture in brownfield environments  Should an existing system need to be zoned after it is already in operation, things get a bit  trickier. In general, it is advised to undertake zoning in this case in a pragmatic way by  implementing the PERA model. This means that two clusters with boundary protection devices  (most likely NG-FWs) are applied and a DMZ is built, with a cluster to the north and the other  cluster to the south. After that has been done, all ‘normal’ IT devices are put in a zone north of  the DMZ, while all OT devices are put in a zone south of the DMZ. After that, the communication  is configured in such a way that no direct communication from IT to OT is possible. Also,  depending on the maintenance windows, a more fine-grained approached might be applicable.  3.1.4 Additional guidance  In this section additional guidance is given. Should you be experienced already with the  activities in this step, you can skip this section.  3.1.4.1 Cookbook step 1a: identify assets, communication and SuC  Process  Hint: zoning is similar to a puzzle with 10 000 parts. After emptying the box, you turn all the parts bottom down to  see the surface. Then you separate and group together the parts such as persons, buildings, walls, background.  Sky also a functional grouping such as edge parts or notches. Then you build up the first island, try to locate it in  the frame and move the islands to other places as necessary. Lastly, you connect the islands.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  16  Figure 4 Collecting asset information  Input  All asset and inventory information ‘systems’ independent of their sources (central IT CMDB,  decentralised CMDB, PLC Tools, Excel sheets, etc.)  Task  1) Collect all asset information from all entities and departments. After retrieving all this  information, check again in order to ensure that nothing has been missed.  Identify:  -  all assets, all systems,  -  functionality demands,  -  entity boundaries,  -  interfaces to external companies, RU, IM,  -  cloud environments and mobile network connections.  2) Identify and define organisational or technical SuCs (‘entity subsystems’), for example,  signalling, energy, office, datacentre, industrial, rolling stock (see Figure 7 or Figure 1  Output  High-level documentation of:  - assets and their communication needs;  - asset groups and their critical needs;  - process and organisational or entity boundaries;  - principal communication flow.  Hint: well-known PLC vendors often use proprietary asset management systems to check firmware and for device  parameter (backups) done by the engineering staff. These industrial or decentralised CMDBs are often not  acceptable in the IT environment but they do provide a high actual status concerning many OT devices.  Hint: if all ISE and ISA are supporting the CSA, they can work in parallel and thus speed up the overall process.  Note: there are more bodies to recover and unique systems to explore than you would ever believe. Should you  come across a system for which nobody wants to be responsible, consider whether a system without an owner is  desirable in your organisation. Perhaps shutting it down may result in a new owner for the system stepping up.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  17  3.1.4.2 Cookbook step 1b: group assets into a ‘proposal zone model’  Process  Figure 5 Proposal zone model with all assets and communication information  Input  All asset, inventory, and communication information is from Step 1.A.  Task  1) The railway operator should define an asset model of its railway system. Assets should  be split into groups corresponding to physical areas, entities and levels of functional  criticality.  • Assign the responsible assets to the entity subsystems (signalling: signalling,  command & control, auxiliary, comfort, public interlocking, crossing, RBC,  switches, etc.)  • Group the assets and technical SuC into a draft of zones by their essential  process functions (energy: power plants, substations, switch heating, tunnel  systems, traction mains, etc.).  The resulting model is an input to define the SuC and zones  2)  Identify all physical and logical boundaries of the SuC and each process or utility area.  3) Identify all physical and logical points of access to the SuC and each process or utility  area.  4) Connect zones and conduits between the zones by their essential process functions in  the entity subsystem.  5) Connect the entity subsystems to a corporate model and identify borders (‘place for  firewalls’).  6) Define the critical zone levels and a communication matrix.  Note: a strong collaboration and support between the CSA and all ISE, ISA, ISO and CISO helps to meet this  challenge in a manageable timeframe.  Hint: this step is in general not described in other standards. Grouping assets into a proposal zone model, and  especially knowing the boundaries, makes life easier for the high-level assessment of risk that follows.  Hint: look at the ‘Railway asset model’ chapter.  Note: strong collaboration and support between the CSA and all ISE, ISA, ISO and CISO is necessary to  overcome this challenge in a manageable timeframe.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  18  Output  • A proposal (of a railway system) zone model (architecture draft) and high-level  documentation of:  o organisational SuC (or subsystem to prevent misunderstandings with  technical SuC);  o zones in the organisational SuC;  o technical SuC such as interlocking systems or substations;  o communication scheme at a high level with conduits and boundaries or at  least a record of the boundaries and points of access to the SuC and each  process;  • A high-level description of the SuC to include the name, a high-level description of the  function and the intended usage of the SuC, as well as a description of the equipment  or process under control as it is known at the stage of initial risk assessment;  • At a later stage, during the detailed risk assessment, this SuC description should be  completed to achieve a detailed description of all assets (reference and version).  A simplified example for one entity (SuC) including the main ways for communication:  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  19  Figure 6 Simplified example of a proposal zone model for one entity  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  20  The following figure shows a proposal zone model for a system railway in a standardised and  modular way, including Business-IT and gateways to other entities or the internet and other  RU/IMs at a high level.  Figure 7 Example of a proposal railway system zone model concerning TS50701 (Source:  CLC/TS 50701:2021 -  © CENELEC, reproduced with permission)  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  21  SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 CHAPTER 4.4  EN62443-3-1 CHAPTERS 5 TO 16  3.1.5 Domain specific guidance  3.1.5.1 Signalling  A set of possible assets and requirements can be found in documents from the EULYNX  project.  3.1.5.2 Rolling stock  A set of possible requirements is found in Annex G of CLC/TS 50701:2021.  3.1.5.3 Fixed installations  No deviations.  3.1.5.4 Office and business  For office and business IT, it is most likely that an inventory of assets will exist, either for  accounting purposes or due to tax obligations.  3.2 INITIAL RISK ASSESSMENT (ZCR 2)  Guiding questions: What risks is my system prone to? What will I have to consider in later  stages?  3.2.1 Process  After the assets and SuC are identified, the initial risk assessment should be performed. This  process identifies and prioritises specific processes or utility areas of the SuC by their relative  importance to the asset owners’ business.  For the railway application, at least the following criteria should be considered:  • human health and safety  • operational availability  • financial impact.  Hint:  ZCR2 identify global and company risks.  ZCR4 identify and verify high-level risk by using the proposal zone model  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  22  Figure 8 Initial risk assessment to identify sources of high-level risk (ZCR 2)  3.2.2 Relevant parts of standards  3.2.3 Design information  No additional information.  3.2.4 Additional guidance  3.2.4.1 Cookbook step 2: identify corporate risks  Input  • the draft of the proposal zone model and high-level documentation of:  o organisational SuC (or ‘subsystem’ to prevent misunderstandings with  technical SuC),  o zones in the organisational SuC,  o technical SuC such as interlocking systems or substations,  o communication scheme on a high level with conduits and boundaries, or at  least a record of the boundaries and points of access to the SuC and each  process.  • draft of zone critical (ZC) levels and a communication matrix (CM).  Tasks  1. Perform an initial risk assessment:  • Identify risk scenarios and worst-case consequences for the risk events of loss of  confidentiality, integrity and availability for each process or utility area and the SuC.  The high-level security objectives of confidentiality, integrity and availability are  commonly used within information security and are further developed into seven  foundational requirements by the IEC 62443 series.  SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 CHAPTER 6.3 AND 6.3.1  EN 62443-3-2:2020 CHAPTER 5.3  Note: The worst-case consequence is limited to a span of x calendar day(s), which must be defined in the  enterprise risk management tools.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  23  In addition, impacts that continue beyond a defined number of calendar day(s) should  be considered within plans for business continuity and resilience.  • Assess the description of the consequences and rating for each area of impact (entity)  using the company’s risk criteria as defined in the risk management tool.  • Assess the description and rating of the risk for each identified risk.  • Determine the highest risk rating for each process or entity and the SuC.  2. Validate the draft of the high-level railway system zone model:  • Assign the highest risk rating for each process or entity and the SuC as the critical  rating.  • Note: as likelihood is assumed to be fixed, this document refers to the high-level risk  rating simply as the critical rating.  3. Validate the communication matrix and critical zone levels.  4. Validating all results through an impact evaluation.  The impact evaluation in the initial assessment of risk should identify the worst global  impact in case of loss of the properties of an asset. The global impact should be  evaluated not only at the business level, but also at the environmental, societal, and  human impact levels.

How to do zoning? How can I divide my system using good partitions?  What criteria should I use?  Hint: the detailed risk assessment process does not assume a fixed likelihood.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  24  3.3.1 Process  Figure 9 Partitioning and SuC process (ZCR 3)  SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 CHAPTER 6.4  EN62443-3-2 ALL CHAPTERS  3.3.2 Relevant parts of standards  Criteria for zones and conduits breakdown  Based on the output of the initial risk assessment, the assets should be assigned to consistent  security zones connected by conduits. This means all assets in the same zone and all data sent  by the same conduit share the same or similar cybersecurity requirements.  The following criteria should be used to partition the SuC into zones and conduits:  a. risk to the assets in terms of integrity, availability and confidentiality;  b. type of interfaces or connections to the other parts of the SuC (e.g. wireless);  c.  physical or logical location;  d. access requirements;  e. operational function;  f.  organisation responsibilities for each asset;  g. safety aspects;  h. technology lifecycle, e.g. product lifecycle, obsolescence [Source: CLC/TS 50701:2021].  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  25  Process for breaking down zones and conduits  The objective for grouping the assets into zones and conduits is to identify the assets that share  common cybersecurity requirements and group them to share the means of mitigation. The  following aspects should be considered for the process of defining zones and conduits.  • The business assets (IT) and control assets (OT) should be separated into different  zones.  • Safety-related assets shall be grouped in dedicated zones which are logically or  physically separated from zones which are not safety related. However, if non-safety  assets are allocated to such a zone, the complete zone is considered as safety related.  • Temporarily connected devices should be included in zones separated from assets  that are permanently connected.  • Wireless devices should be included in zones separated from the ones with the wired  devices.  • (Remote) Devices that are permitted to make connections should be grouped into a  separate zone(s).  • Zones should contain the security device protecting the perimeter at the edges of  conduits.  3.3.3 Design information  3.3.3.1 Remote maintenance access  a) With a possible impact on system operations  The following design rules should be considered for maintenance application:  • direct (maintenance) access from business zones or from external sources to OT  zones with higher security demands, e.g. up from ZC4 (depending on the individual ZC  Model) or SL2 without control by an internal security device or similar (e.g. proxy  server), should not be allowed;  • external maintenance access (e.g. via Internet) should be grouped, controlled and  forewarned in a separate internal zone, e.g. maintenance access via a B2B proxy in  the technical DMZ.

[Source: CLC/TS  50701:2021]  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  26  b) Without a possible impact on system operations  The following design rules should be considered for devices communicating with mobile phone  networks so that misconfiguration or sent commands don’t have any impact on normal  operations, e.g. datalogger, sensor values by IoT devices:  • direct (maintenance) access from business zones or external to control zones without  control by an internal security device or similar (e.g. proxy server) is allowed if the  source (sensor, device, IoT-edge) and the sink (collecting server) are in special and  separated zones;  • it is highly recommended, in order to guarantee the integrity of data, to encrypt  communications via unsecure or untrusted networks.  3.3.4 Additional guidance  3.3.4.1 Cookbook step 3a:  defining global surroundings  Before starting to plan zones, basic information on the company and its surroundings needs to  be defined. These basics concern the environment, devices, systems, employees etc. and may  differ for each company.  Task: Define ‘classes of networks’ by the maturity of their security  Firstly a set of ‘network classes’ needs to be defined. Each network class will have a unique  security maturity. This is needed to generate a communication matrix to determine which  dataflows are allowed or not allowed.  Too many network classes increases the ruleset, make the overall concept complex and  obstruct upcoming functions  which merge data of different sources to support AI, Digital-Twin,  and Condition based Maintenance. On the other hand too few network classes reduce security  and resilience. Figure 6 shows an example of a set of networks for one entity.  3.3.4.2 Zone criticality (ZC)  Every zone should be classified according to its risks. Zone criticality represents the security  demands in a simplified expression to define the allowed communication between zones. Zone  criticalities represent the individual network groups based on the maturity of their security and  should cover all zones in the owner’s company.

SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 ANNEX F.6  3.3.4.3 Communication matrix (CM)  The communication matrix defines, at a high-level, authorised and unauthorised  communications. The matrix is unique within a company and valid for all communications and  entities in one company (RU or IM). The communication matrix is the basis of rulesets for  security devices to control dataflows between zones to prevent loops, backdoors or the  bypassing of security measures and is based on levels of ‘zone criticality’ (ZC).  Referring to a castle: the communication matrix is the code of contact on which all inhabitants  agree; it defines who can go to which areas in the castle. Is it allowed to read or write books in  the archive? Who can pass the kings security to enter the princess bedroom?  A communication matrix will be developed based on the following two rules:  • direct communication between zones with well-known risks (e.g. zones with well- known and fixed mounted OT devices) and unknown risks (e.g. office zones with  laptops, printer, internet connectivity) should be refused;  • in general, direct communication is only allowed between zones with the same or a  subsequent zone criticality.  3.3.4.4 Communication matrix (CM) and zone criticality (ZC)  The communication matrix shows, at a high level, which communications between zones are  allowed, restricted or prohibited. This matrix is one of the basics of the final zoning model. It is  also a helpful, simple and easy to understand overview for technicians in their daily business if  systems expand or new functions need to be implemented.  Note: the definition of which book is read only or enabled to write is the result of the ruleset for security devices.  Note: to take care of the different system architectures in Rolling Stock Systems and Landside, two schemes of  Zone criticality are available:  • Zone criticality landside (ZC-L),  • Zone criticality rolling stock (ZC-RS). [Source: CLC/TS 50701:2021: F2.3.x and F2.4.x]  Attention: the final CM and the ZC principles need to be part of the internal ISMS. This is the basis for all (future)  communication flows, systems extensions, new features and firewall rulesets.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  28  The dataflows should be defended and controlled based on the safety and security demands of  the zones. The fine tuning of dataflows is controlled by rules and access lists (e.g. of the  security devices):  • “+”  data flow is allowed in both directions,  • “R”: data flow is restricted to read-only only by data diodes or similar measures,  • “-“: data flow is prohibited.

Task: Defining zones in the proposal zoning model  1) Take all asset groups identified in ZCR 1 and verified in ZCR 2 and try to define a  zone model based on the system and device communications. The high-level  railway zone model can be used as layout for the first attempt.  2) Extend the generic high-level zone model to a company specific model with all  organisational or technical SuCs and zones.  Hint: the following chapter can be used as a checklist.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  29  Figure 10 Example of an individual railway zone model  3) Classify each zone with a zone criticality (defined in the CM).  Figure 11 Example of defining zone criticality in the individual railway zone model  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  30  4) Conduits: place security devices on the boundaries of each zone.  5) Check normal dataflow between zones and their ZC with the validated CM if the  process communication of the essential functions is working well.  6) Check the dataflow for system diagnostics between the zones and their ZC with the  validated CM if the process communication of the essential functions is working  well.  Figure 13 Example 2 of possible communication flow  7) Place means for monitoring management systems (technical domain controller,  network management, NAC, PKI, Syslog & SIEM, etc.) in every organisational SuC to  support the ‘de-centralised approach’ and the ‘modular entity subsystem approach’.  Note: in some cases, functions may not be working. This results in a step back to ZCR 1 or ZCR 3a (depending  on the severity of the challenge) and the redesign or relocation of the zone or document (and finally approved)  expectations.  Figure 12 Example 1 of possible communication flow  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  31  8) Check if the communication flow will work with the relevant devices. It is possible to  merge and/or reduce zones in a second loop if approved by a risk analysis.  9) Check the methods and strategies for patching and updating to all zones and all  devices  10) Check communications with partner companies, other IM and RU or Cloud  connectivity.  11) Check corporate goals and strategies (can be read from the ISMS).  12) Check remote maintenance connection (personal support and configuration of data  transfer) and close all existing connections bypassing the official way and  authorised methods (modem or ISDN, for example).  13) Check authentication, user rights and role mechanisms. Is it possible for each  single device to check the authorisation if a user wants to log in?  14) Check whether the dispatching and operating staff have the awareness to  understand the overall concept and to handle the security mechanisms in the  correct way in order to prevent unknown backdoors.  15) Check whether the dispatching units have sufficient knowledge about functional  processes and the security organisation.  16) Check whether the zoning architecture forces the same security requirements for  backup LAN/WAN connections.  17) Check whether the zoning architecture includes zones for system backups and  individual P-V-LAN’s. Otherwise, the ‘normal’ network must be separated into  different zones to increase resilience, but all backup connections will target into one  backup zone, bypassing the segmentation.  18) Check all zoning relevant controls of ISO27001 that are not listed above.  19) Start merging de-centralised managing and monitoring systems at point 6 if that is  possible. After each merge, check the CM requirements and the administrative  requirements.  20) Note all results and expectations for a zoning design report  The following items should be identified and documented for each defined zone and  conduit:  a. name and/or unique identifier also indicating the type (zone or conduit);  b. accountable organisation(s);  c. definition of logical boundary;  d. definition of physical boundary, if applicable;  e. safety designation;  f. list of all logical access points;  g. list of all physical access points, if applicable;  h. list of dataflows associated with each access point;  i. connected zones or conduits;  j. list of assets and their risk classification and business value.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  32  21) Check restrictions on (external) maintenance access in the ‘(Remote) Maintenance  access’ chapter.  22) Take all asset groups identified in ZCR 1 and verified in ZCR 2 and try to define a  zone model based on the system and device communications. The high-level  railway zone model can be used as a layout for the first attempt.  23) Extend the generic railway model to a company model with all organisational or  technical SuC and zones.  Task: Defining conduits in the proposal zoning model  Conduits represent a zone's gateway or interface enabling it to communicate with other zones.  In general, there are three kinds of zones and each results in a different conduit solution.  • A zone containing a lot of local devices: these OT devices share the security device  on their zone’s conduit. From the economic view, to buy, manage and operate a high- level security device is relatively cheap.  • A zone consists of one (or very few) devices. It called a ‘single system area’ (e.g. PLC  for lightning board in small stations). To secure this device, three options are possible:  (a) Professional security device from network provider in each control enclosure …  very expensive  (b) Industrial security device in each control enclosure … expensive  (c) Embedded security in the ICS/PLC … cheap to buy and operate.  Example PLC:  o If the device doesn’t fulfil the security requirements, it is necessary to add a  mitigating measure such as an industrial firewall in front of the device to  minimise the residual risk.  o If the device has a set of embedded security functions (e.g. SNMPv3, AD  and RADIUS, VPN and PSK, Syslog) and fulfils the requirements, no  additional measures are needed.  • A zone contains safety devices. In this case, the security device must fulfil the specific  demands for safety, e.g. ‘read only’ devices like data diodes of network TAPs or a  special configured firewall with certifications.  Task: Systems without full security functions (legacy, PLC etc.)  All traffic within a security zone is likely trusted (on a practical note: not all industrial devices can  handle the necessary level of cybersecurity). The cybersecurity checks are executed on the  border of the security zones (within the conduit).  Hint: this zoning step takes more than one iteration until it is finalized. Take care about this!  Hint: It is recommending defining a set of security functions and parameters for each group of assets. This helps  the technicians and the vendors to implement and use the correct function and settings. Details see Annex D  Hint: with background knowledge about the essential functions, it is possible to hasten the process instead of  following the next steps and come back from ZCR 4 or ZCR 5 (risk assessment).  Hint: the chosen ‘proposal’ for each conduit IN THIS STEP depends on the amount and security capability of the  devices.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  33  Task: Defining communication lines in the proposal zoning model  Local communication lines are necessary to enable process communication. These lines are  mostly located in a defined or small area, building etc. Normally it is not possible to connect  without special tools, keys and knowledge about the location but it is not necessary to encrypt,  e.g. connecting devices within a closed control enclosure.  WAN Communication lines can be seen as ‘transparent’ for ZC if the security gateways on both  sides of the ‘tunnel’ are managed by the responsible asset owner or owner of the essential  functions.  ‘Transparent’ means:  • there is no possible impact on the dataflow by the provider (e.g. VPN);  • it is theoretically possible to change the provider without any changes (except WAN IP  Address to VPN) or without testing all systems and essential functions behind the  security devices.  Note: conduits don’t need a ZC-Level. Conduits act as perimeter protection for the zone ‘behind’ and must fulfil the  security level of and for the Zone.  Note: measures on local communication lines must be documented and aligned with the CISO.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  34  Figure 14 Example of transparent communication lines between zones  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  35  IP address concept  • Input factors  o Every device interface needs a unique (company net) or NAT (entity net) IP  address.  o Every device with redundant communication (VRRP/HSRP) needs a unique  loopback address.  o Every VLAN needs a unique (company net) or NAT (entity net) IP address  range.  o Every zone needs a unique (company net) or NAT (entity net) IP address  segment.  o Every secure communication line (VPN) needs unique (company net) or NAT  (entity net) IP addresses.  o Sometimes the IP addresses are existing and easy to readdress. Some  systems have a historical background (Token-Ring) or are in 7/24 operations  and readdressing generates a lot of cost.  • Task (IP address ranges may be an example):  Creating an IP address concept based on one of the two general principles:  a) Segmented but flat IP network with central firewall  Example: all IT and OT devices in 10.x.x.x.  b) Mixed hierarchical NAT network with decentralised firewalls (Defines in depth  principle)  Example: IT devices and OT entity forwarding addresses in flat 10.x.x.x, OT  devices in 172.16-32.x.x, backup and local field sub-devices 192.168.x.x.  • Challenge  To avoid IP address conflicts, especially in the overall railway system, an IP address  concept is one of the most important things to do.  Note: the security gateways must fulfil, on both sides, the same SL and the communication must be encrypted for  SL1 or higher.  Hint: it is recommended that the tasks from ‘defining zones in the proposal zoning model’ to ‘systems without full  security functions (legacy, PLC etc.)’ be repeated for an extra iteration to review all topics before going forward.  Hint: a NAT concept for each SuC or entity with a couple of reachable forwarding addresses from the intranet,  makes the concept more flexible, faster, easier and increases the availability in cases of changes. Otherwise, one  change in one entity causes a globally redesign over many Systems within the company!  Hint: to manage devices with redundant connections in case of losing one connection, its recommended to address  the device for management tasks or network management by a separate logical loopback address which is virtual  connected on both interfaces  Hint:  Its highly recommended to reserve one additional IP Segment in every entity for HSRP/VRRP or loopback  addresses!  Hint:  a VPN between zones normally acts company wide. It is highly recommended that one global additional IP  Segment for VPN addresses be reserved!

Input:  • functionally validated proposal zone model and high-level documentation of:  o organisational SuC (or ‘subsystem’ to prevent misunderstandings with  technical SuC),  o zones in the organisational SuC,  o technical SuC such as interlocking systems or substations,  o communication scheme on a high level with conduits and boundaries;  • zones with functionally validated zones criticality (ZC) levels and a communication  matrix (CM);  • a zoning design report.  Note: ‘Zone’ is a group of assets. ‘SL’ is a definition about the power of the perimeter security to protect the group  of assets. So, the SL must apply to the security device on the zone conduit.  Note: at the end, an approval of the CISO or ISO is necessary. It is highly recommended that the following steps  be undertaken as a group made up of the asset owner or owner of the essential function (= ISE) the ISA and  ISO/CISO.  Note: Every change of an IP address causes an interrupt of data and communication. To be on the safe side, the  devices outside the central system shall be configure and restarted local. Readdressing a whole segment means,  to build up a secondary virtual interface to migrate one by one. Keep in mind and plan ONE future-oriented IP  address concept.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  37  Task  The steps for assigning the initial SL-T are as follows:  1. Determine whether specific threats that intend to target the SuC, zone or similar IACS,  automation solutions and products, exist longer than the design lifecycle of the SuC.  In conventional security risk management, a threat is a function of intent and capability.  With respect to cyber risk management, the threat environment is continually and rapidly  changing to the point where the attribution or characterisation of threat agents to a specific  entity is of limited benefit.  2. Evaluate the intention, resources, skills and motivations of threat actors and the  possibility attacks over the design life of the SuC.  3. Assign a minimum-security level target (SL-T) to each security zone. Every conduit on  a zone or SuC should be mapped to an SL between 0 to 4 which defines the strength  of the resistance against hacker attacks.  4. Depending on the location in the company model, this results in a strengthening of the  encryption and security features of the security gateways between each zone and  conduit.  Hint: if no specific threats exist then categorise general threats as either ‘internal’ or ‘external’.  Note: the chosen SL depends on the security needs of the overall railway system. A higher SL may cause problems  in process communications and may require the development of special solutions. This must be clarified with the  system vendor.  Note: system costs increase proportionally with the mapped SL.  Figure 15 Example of defining SL to each zone and conduit  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  38  5. Check whether the chosen SL-T allows the process communication relationships of the  OT systems to operate.  Example:  • Now: the communication between two devices is hardcoded by the system and  has been running for 10 years.  • Plan: separate the devices into two different zones with SL2 at one conduit. SL2  means multifactor authentication is needed.  o Problem: how to integrate an automatic MFA via SMS e.g. in a 10 year  old application?  6. Check if the security devices on the conduits support measures needed to force the  SL-T. If not, replace the device to fulfil the demands of the SL. The feedback is an  input for the risk assessment that follows in ZCR4.  Output:  • definitions of SL-T for each conduit or zone and the minimum-security strength for  the gateway devices on the conduit;  • list of minimum functions for the functional requirements (FR) and system  requirements (SR);  • security vector based on measures for FR and SR;  • records of threat agents;  • records of minimum SL-T for each security zone.

What impact could an attacker have on my system?  3.4.1 Process  For each asset group supporting the essential functions of the SuC, the consequences of losing  the integrity, availability or confidentiality of the asset should be evaluated.  To enable a consistent approach for threat risk assessment between asset owners, system  integrator and product suppliers, it is important that all the stakeholders share the same  references for impact assessment.  Hint: this step of zoning takes more than one iteration until finalised. Take care with it.  Note: the decision steps of ZCR 4 High-level Risk Assessment differ between railway system needs and the generic  standards in 62443-3-2.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  41  Figure 16 High-level risk assessment process (ZCR 4)  3.4.2 Relevant parts of standards  Likelihood assessment  ‘The threat landscape may change suddenly and so experience is of limited use for  cybersecurity. Therefore, the likelihood of an attack can be evaluated only on a qualitative or  semi-quantitative scale. Because of that, the owner of the essential functions should make use  of intelligence reports and other information sources to determine the potential attackers that  they might be targeted by.’ [Source: CLC/TS 50701:2021]  Threat assessment  To build an appropriate cybersecurity strategy, shared between all the stakeholders, the first  step is to identify and agree on a consistent list of generic cybersecurity threats that could  jeopardise the railway application. Agreement on the threat landscape is crucial as  discrepancies in the set of threats considered by the different stakeholders will lead to an  underestimation of risk and a lack of implementation of control measures.  Threat libraries and reports such as the following should be taken as inputs:  • ENISA Threat Landscape Annual report,  • ISO/IEC 27005,  • NIST SP 800-30.  Finally, the threat landscape should:  • be defined or at least approved by the asset owner;  • be updated at least once a year (or according to contractual requirements);  • provide mapping to the input threat libraries or reports;  • provide rationale for threats excluded from consideration [Source: CLC/TS  50701:2021].

What security requirements are needed in order to reach an acceptable  level of risk?  3.5.1 Process  The following paragraphs describe the detailed assessment of risk which should be performed  for each zone and each conduit (or cluster of zones and conduits) and result in a definition of  the required cybersecurity specifications as the central outcome of these activities.  To fulfil the demands of railway environments, ZCR 5 is split into three sub-processes and a  step-back to redraw zones and conduits in ZCR 3 is included in this model.  Figure 17 Detailed high-level risk assessment process (ZCR 5)  3.5.2 Relevant parts of standards  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  44  3.5.3 Design information  In IEC 62443-3-2 ZCR 5.6, different approaches for the derivation of SL-T are described. The  first is based directly on the need for protection against a particular kind of attacker (e.g. hacker,  criminal organisation, states sponsored group), including an estimation of the efforts needed by  an attacker, also known as an attack vector. This approach determines which types of attacks,  by which kinds of attackers, a zone or conduit of the SuC should withstand, considering the  threats and vulnerabilities identified and any legal constraints, resulting directly in a SL-T. But, in  this approach, is it still necessary to check that the risk is acceptable.  Threat risk assessment may not override mandatory requirements for security protection, for  example, by regulation.  SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 CHAPTER 6.4  3.5.4 Additional Guidance  3.5.4.1 Process step 5a: detailed cybersecurity risk assessment  A flowchart of the general process for the detailed assessment of risk by the responsible asset  owner or by the system integrator under contractual agreements, is depicted in figure 18.

The first approach in this chapter describes the detailed assessment of risk, which should be  performed for each zone and each conduit (or cluster of zones and conduits) and result in a  definition of the required cybersecurity specifications, as the central outcome of this activity.  SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 CHAPTER 7  EN 62443-3-2 ALL CHAPTERS  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  46  Input  • list with published security incidents, threats, and vulnerabilities  • list of the likelihoods (depending on entity and company) of incidents, threats and  vulnerabilities;  • records of criticality ratings for each process or utility area and the SuC;  • records of threats;  • security advisories from product suppliers;  • historical data of security events.  In a first step, the identification of the threats and vulnerabilities are detailed. Then for all  identified threats an appropriate principle of risk acceptance is chosen and approved by the  railway duty holder. It is acknowledged that the easiest way to apply the process is, if only one  principle is applied for each zone or conduit, for a complete zone or conduit to be covered by a  code of practice or by a reference system or by an explicit evaluation of risk. But for complex  systems a mixture of principles may be necessary.  Task: identifying threats in a brief  • Record all assets within each process or entity within the SuC in an asset register.  • Record all physically accessible data communications and interfaces of assets as  attributes in the asset register.  • Prior to final design, obtain an independent professional review of credible threats  using competent persons,  who have an appropriate degree of independence.  • Keep records about the credible threats, including threat agents and threat actions,  over the design life of the SuC.  • Describe the threat actions of a threat agent in accordance with the domains of attack  and mechanisms of attack.  • Develop fault trees or attack trees to model the threat actions used by threat actors for  each of the following general security events within the context of the SuC.  Task: The following topics shall be within the scope  • loss of confidentiality –  disclosure of information assets  • loss of integrity  –  unauthorised use of IACS functions  • loss of integrity  –  modifications to IACS or information assets  • loss of availability  –  disruption to IACS functions  • loss of availability  –  destruction of IACS or information assets  After identifying the threats, the vulnerabilities in assets and countermeasures must be  identified.  Task: identifying vulnerabilities in a brief  • Prior to final design, obtain an independent professional review of credible  vulnerabilities.  • List the credible vulnerabilities.  • Revise the fault or attack trees to indicate credible vulnerabilities in the branches.  Task: determining unmitigated cyber risk in a brief  • Record the risks corresponding to the branches from the fault or attack tree in a risk  report.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  47  • Estimate the credible worst-case consequences and likely descriptions in accordance  with the enterprise risk management tool for each risk prior to assessing the  application or effectiveness of existing cybersecurity countermeasures that are not  enabled by default.  • Limit the worst-case consequence to a span of x calendar day(s).  • Determine the unmitigated cyber risk rating for each risk in accordance with the  enterprise risk management system.  • Record the unmitigated cyber risk in the risk report.  Task: determining security level targets in a brief  • Identify the applicable system requirements shown in chapter ‘System Requirements  (SR)’ that provide technical security capabilities and meet the target security levels  expressed by the SL-T vector.  • Identify available countermeasures.  Output:  • a cybersecurity risk validated high level zone model;  • a cybersecurity risk validated zoning design report or other document;  • records of SL-T vector for each security zone;  • cyber-risk reports:  o report of credible vulnerabilities from an independent professional  reviewer  o records of vulnerabilities,  o fault or attack tree drawings with vulnerabilities,  o asset register,  o report of credible threats from an independent professional reviewer,  o records of threat agents and actions,  o fault or attack tree drawings,  o assumed residual risk;  • required cybersecurity specifications (CRS) of the SuC.  3.5.4.3 Process step 5b: identify countermeasures  After determining security level targets, the existing countermeasures should be identified and  evaluated. A zoning model with security boundaries (security gateways) should be available to  identify available security functions or countermeasures and additional countermeasures that  are missing.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  48  Figure 19 Process of identifying countermeasures  3.5.4.4 Cookbook step 5b: identify existing countermeasures  If the residual risk exceeds stakeholder expectations, it is necessary to find additional  countermeasures to increase security maturity, reduce the likelihood of impacts or increase  system resilience. The approach is to allocate cybersecurity requirements on subsystem or  component level first and then refine by requirements.  Additionally, the issue of compensating countermeasures is discussed in the context of  cybersecurity requirements, where these are needed to satisfy a cybersecurity requirement or a  substitute one due to technical constraints or limitations. Compensating countermeasures are  part of the next chapter ‘Process step 5.C: Determine residual cyber risk’.  Input  The complete requirements for all zones and conduits included should be documented in the  notes on the SuC. These include:  • a cybersecurity risk validated high level zone model;  • a cybersecurity risk validated zoning design report or other document;  • a cyber-risk report with assumed residual risk;  • required cybersecurity specifications (CRS) of the SuC;  • the level of tolerable risk;  • directive from the stakeholder against a lower or higher assumed risk;  • records of SL-T vectors for each security zone.  Task: Identifying and evaluating existing countermeasures in a brief:  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  49  • Evaluate the effectiveness of existing technical countermeasures of systems and  networks against the system requirements as identified.  • Record the existing countermeasures and their effectiveness in the risk report.  The key objective of this chapter is the identification (and structuring) of security requirements  for zones and conduits of a given SuC to provide an acceptable level of protection from all  identified threats and known vulnerabilities. The security requirements for a SuC are mainly  based on the system security requirements with additional (company dependent) guidance for  railway applications.  The following topics should be considered:  • system security requirements,  • apportionment of cybersecurity requirements,  • breakdown of system requirements to subsystem level,  • allocation of system requirements at component level,  • specific consideration for the implementation of cybersecurity requirements on  components,  • the requirement to breakdown structures as verification,  • compensating countermeasures.  Output  • list of compensating countermeasures,  • updated CRS with countermeasures and effectiveness.  3.5.4.5 Process step 5c: determine residual cyber risk  After identifying and evaluating existing countermeasures, the residual cyber risk rating taking  existing countermeasures into consideration should be determined.  Figure 20 Process of verifying residual risk against tolerable risk  3.5.4.6 Cookbook step 5c: security measures for identified zones and conduits – how to  protect or mitigate risk  The second approach about countermeasures is based on the difference between unmitigated  cybersecurity risk and acceptable risk. It must be mentioned, as a precondition, that the zones  and conduits to be assessed by a detailed risk assessment should have reached a certain level  of maturity in their architecture and possibly their (planned) implementation. Generally, the  second approach leads to a more appropriate SL-T value but takes more effort. Generally, the  Hint: the compensating countermeasures should be state-of-the-art, verified between asset owner and system  vendor and approved by the system vendor.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  50  detailed risk assessment described here is proactive, i.e. it is not triggered by an incident or  vulnerability.  Input  The input to determine the residual cyber risk rating is:  • the risk report (including the level of tolerable risk),  • a cybersecurity risk validated high-level zone model,  • a cybersecurity risk validated high-level zoning design report or other document,  • a list of compensatory countermeasures,  • approvals from system vendors concerning the mitigating countermeasures.  Task: determining residual cyber risk rating in a brief  • Estimate the credible worst-case consequences and likely descriptions in accordance  with the enterprise risk management system.  • Determine the residual cyber risk in accordance with the enterprise risk management  system focusing on:  o cybersecurity cases,  o cybersecurity verification,  o cybersecurity integration and verification,  o assessment of results,  o cybersecurity validation,  o cybersecurity system acceptance,  o independence,  o objectives.  • Record the residual consequence and likely descriptions and residual cyber risk in the  risk report.  Output  The output from determining the residual cyber risk rating includes:  • risk report with residual consequence and likelihood descriptors and residual cyber  risk.  • required cybersecurity specifications (CRS) of the SuC  The final step of the detailed risk assessment is to collect the cybersecurity requirements for a  zone or conduit related to all threats or vulnerabilities from the various sources:  • requirements stated by using codes of practice (for threats covered by this principle);  • requirements from required cybersecurity specifications for applicable reference  systems (for threats covered by this principle);  • requirements of IEC 62443-3-3 for the derived SL-T for the remaining threats arising  from an explicit evaluation of risk.  In some cases, the requirements may arise from a single source, e.g. if a code of practice or a  reference system is similar to a zone or conduit, but in general requirements from different  sources need to be aligned.  SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 CHAPTER 6 AND 9  Note: the residual cyber risk relates at this point to the ‘current residual risk’.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  51  Residual risk? What risk remains? To be 100% secure is not possible from the technical point  of view, and from the economic point of view it would be a financial nightmare.  The stakeholder and responsible asset owner should confirm all results and measures of risk  analysis. They must decide whether the residual risk is too high (step back in the zoning  process ZCR 5 – mitigating countermeasures) or whether the risk is tolerable.  3.5.5 Domain specific guidance  3.5.5.1 Signalling  No deviations.  3.5.5.2 Rolling stock  No deviations.  3.5.5.3 Fixed installations  3.5.5.4 Office and business  No deviations.  3.6 DOCUMENTATION OF CYBERSECURITY REQUIREMENTS (ZCR 6)  Guiding questions. How can we ensure that a complete change of the project team does not  result in the loss of all knowledge? How should we document our results?  3.6.1 Process  The last ‘project step’ in the zoning process is the documentation. Cybersecurity is a part of the  fast-changing digital environment. That means that incidents and hazards are changing, and  measures must be modified. Documentation is one of the most overlooked processes.  Nevertheless, should incidents occur, it is very important to have an overview of devices,  firmware, models and software that is quickly accessible to plan the next operating steps or  trigger crisis management if necessary  Note: internal networks, also gateways to external networks, might be down should a cybersecurity problem arise or  there is a cyberattack. In such cases, it can happen that access to emergency documents or devices and network  information (Chapter: DOCUMENTATION OF CYBERSECURITY REQUIREMENTS) is not possible via the network.  It can be useful to have a special isolated zone in the company crisis-management environment that collects all  information during normal operations, but can act locally and offline in case of a network shutdown.  Note: we can’t eliminate security risks completely. A residual risk is always present.  Hint: more zones and independent firewalls ensure higher resilience, which results in lower residual risk for each  zone.

Task  • Collect all information into a well-known place or systems such as a risk  management tool.  • Structure it for cyclic internal review or external (NIS) audit.  Output  • Actual documentation of zones, designs, communications, demands, measures  and residual risk that can be found very quickly.  SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 CHAPTER 6.4  3.7 APPROVAL (ZCR 7)  Guiding question. When is the work finished? What must be done in order to get approval for  the system?  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  53  3.7.1 Process  This last step is the formal agreement and approval by all participants, stakeholders, duty  holders etc to commit to the final zone model, the (mitigating) countermeasures and the residual  risk. If resources run out during migration, it results in two weak environments, higher  complexity and a lot of temporary solutions. This culminates in an unknown system overall and  higher risk.  Figure 22 Asset owner approval (ZCR 7)  SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 CHAPTER 6.4  3.7.2 Additional guidance  3.7.2.1 Cookbook step 7: documentation  Input  • final zone model,  • communication flow,  • data flow restrictions,  • secure and alternative ways to maintain the systems,  • planed cost, time and resources.  Task  This approval and commitment is the basis for planning, timing, internal and external human  resources, and financial resources and the ‘Go’ for planning migration operations, especially  where contingency measures are required for 24/7 operations.  Output  • start of operational part of the zoning project,  • HR and financial plan for each entity,  • aligned migration plan for each system group or zone,  • detailed migration plan with system vendors,  • possible breakdowns during migration identified,  • maximum downtime for operation identified,  • define process to enable communication on security gateways,  • TCO Cost.  3.8 MIGRATION (ZCR 8)  Migration is not a part of the (planning) zoning process but is part of the overall zoning project.  This step is only placed here to keep it in mind; however no details are described here. When  this step begins, the theoretical part of zoning is over. From this moment, despite the pre-work  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  54  results of ZCR1 to ZCR 7, a lot of challenges will arise during migration in real 24/7 operations.

Task  Migrate systems and devices.  Output  • a zoned and secure railway network.  3.9 OPERATION / RUN (ZCR 9)  Guiding question. What will I have to do in order to keep my system in a safe and secure  state, after it has been set into operation? What activities should be performed in order to detect  and mitigate attacks?  3.9.1 Process  After migration all devises and systems, the final and endless process of ‘run’ (‘daily business’)  starts. This step is only placed here to keep it in mind; however, no details are described here.  Hint: if something can happen – it will happen. Have a backup plan for each migration concept should migration fail  in order ‘to be able to reverse all steps taken’.

Process  • Monitor advisories and historical data for new and changed vulnerabilities at least  every day.  • Review vulnerabilities based on their common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS).  • Schedule maintenance activities to treat new and changed vulnerabilities within a  defined period depending on the critically of the zone (ZC).  Output  • schedule of maintenance activities;  • a zoned and secure railway network.  Hint: if something can happen – it will happen. Have a crisis plan ready for each SuC.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  57  4. LEGACY SYSTEMS  The system lifecycle and the high cost of OT devices results in a brownfield operation. This  brownfield environment is a mix of new devices in green-field projects, which are integrated into  existing monitoring or control/SCADA systems that worked with older legacy systems.  • Railways always have legacy systems.  • Legacy systems will be part of our daily business in the future.  • Legacy systems are not made less secure through the use of mitigating  measures.  There are many ways to make legacy systems secure. They are dependent on the process and  the functionality of the system. One possible easy way is to handle them like all other ‘device- groups’. This means to identify them and give them their own zones with defending firewalls on  the security devices on the conduit as described in the ‘Steps’ of this cookbook.

To do so,  first the methodology is described. This approach is based on the recently published CENELEC  Technical Specification 50701 (CLC/CLC/TS 50701:2021). The approach is complemented with  additional practical information and hints on how to make the implementation of zoning easier  for a railway operator. It gathers the experience of the European Railway Information Sharing  and Analysis Center and its members, i.e. European infrastructure managers and railway  undertakings.  Each of the steps of the zoning process is explained in detail. The document shows what  standards are required in each step and what processes should be performed. Additionally, the  document discusses the documentation that should be created during each step and guidance  in the form of a ‘cookbook’ is given.  During the zoning process, zoning models are developed over three iterations:  1. “Proposal railway zoning model”: it is used in the first steps, ranging from first collecting  information and designing initial zones (ZCR 1) up to the stage where zones, conduits,  communication lines and security levels (SL) get verified briefly for the first time (ZCR  3). The proposal zone model is generic. It can be aligned with but need not fit the  corporate structure.  2. “High-level railway zoning model”: it contains a concrete and defined risk verified  architecture (ZCR 4) and is implemented via cybersecurity measures (ZCR 5). The  company specific high-level zone model should be orientated to the corporate  structure.  3. “Final railway zoning model”: it is a detailed and verified version of the high-level  model, reflecting the corporate structure within all zones, conduits and communication  lines, the SL ZC and other information (ZCR 6 to ZCR 7).  At the end of this document, the phases after zoning is complete are discussed, i.e. Migration  (ZCR 8) and Operation (ZCR 9). Finally, the issue of legacy systems is commented on briefly.

INTRODUCTION  This document gives the reader additional guidance on the topic of zoning and conduits in the  railway sector. This topic is introduced in a general way in the standard series IEC 62443, as  well as CLC/TS 50701:2021. The concepts from these standards are used as a foundation and  their application is explained in more detail. This document contains an initial chapter, which  provides an overview on the topic of zoning and conduits. Afterwards, each step of the process  is explained in detail. Each of these process steps is described as follows.  • At the beginning a guiding question is defined, which aims at explaining to the reader why this  activity must be performed and what the expected outcome might look like.  • After this, the current step in the process is outlined and the relevant parts of CLC/TS  50701:2021 or the IEC 62443 series are indicated. Should the reader already have some  knowledge of this process step, he can skip the subsequent subsections of the chapter  accordingly, as these provide detailed guidance.  • Following this, design considerations for the process step are shown.  • Then the section that follows provides detailed guidance on how to perform the step and  ensure that the desired results are produced.  • Each section concludes with the identification and explanation of domain specific stipulations,  as well as some hints on implementation.  The document concludes with a quick look at the area of legacy systems.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  10  2. ZONING AND CONDUIT  METHODOLOGY  The following section gives an overview of the process of zoning and conduit methodology.  Each phase is then described in detail in the chapters that follow.  2.1 GENERAL OVERVIEW  ZCR 1: Identify assets and basic process demands:  a) Identify all assets;  b) Create a ‘draft architecture’ or a ‘proposal zone model’ following EN62443-3-2 (chapter  ‘Architecture and Design Principles’).  ZCR 2: Identify global corporate risks through an initial risk assessment  ZCR 3: Perform zoning  a) define the basic system context (networks in the company and their criticality, principal  communication matrix);  b) define zone, conduits, communication lines and ZC-levels;  c) go from draft or proposal zone model to the high-level zone model (following EN  62443-3-3);  d) define proposals for target security level (SL-T) for each conduit (zone and SuC);  e) establish the high-level zone model by verifying proposal zone model.  ZCR 4:  Perform high-level risk assessment with the high-level zone model and the  designated SL for exceeding risk  ZCR 5: Check threats  a) Check the high-level zone model against cybersecurity threats.  b) Identify countermeasures (following EN62443-3-3) and modify the high-level zone  model to become the final zone model.  c) Verify the ‘final zone model’ through a detailed risk assessment.  ZCR 6: Document all information and results  ZCR 7: Get approval from all stakeholders  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  11  The overall process steps to define zones from scratch based on the standard processes in  CLC/TS50701:2021 and EN62443-3-2:2018 are shown below. In this paper, some states are  split for easier explanation.  Figure 1 Zoning and conduit methodology  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  12  Figure 2 Zoning process: overview  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  13  The final zone model depends on existing systems and zones, the result of the threat risk  assessment and the target architecture of each railway operator. Security parameters such as  security levels (SL), zone criticality (ZC) or protection profiles are discussed in separate  chapters and are built upon of this generic base.

ZONING STEPS  3.1 IDENTIFICATION OF ASSETS AND THE SYSTEM UNDER  CONSIDERATION (ZCR 1)  Guiding questions. What assets will be considered? What organisational and technical  boundaries exist? Which process standards must they fulfil? What asset groups, lifecycle  groups and legacy systems exist? How many employees are working on security?  3.1.1 Process  Figure 3 Identification of assets and SuC (ZCR 1)  Figure 3 illustrates the steps to be applied to perform the initial risk assessment as a second  step and to derive a security architecture in ‘zones and conduits’.  3.1.2 Related parts of standards  Overall functional description  The location of the SuC within the model of the railway architecture shows the kind of system to  which the SuC belongs (e.g. rolling stock, signalling, infrastructure etc.) and which main  functions are supported. The identification of the cybersecurity threat to the SuC should be  based on a SuC where the system boundaries and the functionality provided are defined.  Therefore, this identification of the main functions should be detailed by providing information  related to:  • the objective (intended purpose) and the mission profile of the SuC comprising the  definition of the system functions, the system borders and the interfaces;  • the operational scenarios, which define how the SuC will be used and which actors are  interfering or interfacing with the SuC;  • the context of their implementation and use;  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  15  • the planned lifetime and therefore, possibly, necessary system updates to HW and  SW;  • maintenance plans and concepts for the SuC;  • constraints due to the environment which integrates with the SuC [Source: CLC/TS  50701:2021].  SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 CHAPTER 6.2.2  Assets supporting the essential functions  Assets supporting the essential functions of the SuC shall be clearly identified in the definition of  the system along with their relationship with their corresponding essential functions. [Source:  CLC/TS 50701:2021]  SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 CHAPTER 6.2.5  3.1.3 Design information  3.1.3.1 Note for security-architecture in greenfield environments  It is highly recommended that the processes of communication and the process of the essential  functions at a high level be checked with the responsible owner of the essential function before  going forward to ZCR 2 in order to prevent a re-design of the zone model and thus a step back  to ZCR 1 from a later stage.  3.1.3.2 Note for security-architecture in brownfield environments  Should an existing system need to be zoned after it is already in operation, things get a bit  trickier. In general, it is advised to undertake zoning in this case in a pragmatic way by  implementing the PERA model. This means that two clusters with boundary protection devices  (most likely NG-FWs) are applied and a DMZ is built, with a cluster to the north and the other  cluster to the south. After that has been done, all ‘normal’ IT devices are put in a zone north of  the DMZ, while all OT devices are put in a zone south of the DMZ. After that, the communication  is configured in such a way that no direct communication from IT to OT is possible. Also,  depending on the maintenance windows, a more fine-grained approached might be applicable.  3.1.4 Additional guidance  In this section additional guidance is given. Should you be experienced already with the  activities in this step, you can skip this section.  3.1.4.1 Cookbook step 1a: identify assets, communication and SuC  Process  Hint: zoning is similar to a puzzle with 10 000 parts. After emptying the box, you turn all the parts bottom down to  see the surface. Then you separate and group together the parts such as persons, buildings, walls, background.  Sky also a functional grouping such as edge parts or notches. Then you build up the first island, try to locate it in  the frame and move the islands to other places as necessary. Lastly, you connect the islands.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  16  Figure 4 Collecting asset information  Input  All asset and inventory information ‘systems’ independent of their sources (central IT CMDB,  decentralised CMDB, PLC Tools, Excel sheets, etc.)  Task  1) Collect all asset information from all entities and departments. After retrieving all this  information, check again in order to ensure that nothing has been missed.  Identify:  -  all assets, all systems,  -  functionality demands,  -  entity boundaries,  -  interfaces to external companies, RU, IM,  -  cloud environments and mobile network connections.  2) Identify and define organisational or technical SuCs (‘entity subsystems’), for example,  signalling, energy, office, datacentre, industrial, rolling stock (see Figure 7 or Figure 1  Output  High-level documentation of:  - assets and their communication needs;  - asset groups and their critical needs;  - process and organisational or entity boundaries;  - principal communication flow.  Hint: well-known PLC vendors often use proprietary asset management systems to check firmware and for device  parameter (backups) done by the engineering staff. These industrial or decentralised CMDBs are often not  acceptable in the IT environment but they do provide a high actual status concerning many OT devices.  Hint: if all ISE and ISA are supporting the CSA, they can work in parallel and thus speed up the overall process.  Note: there are more bodies to recover and unique systems to explore than you would ever believe. Should you  come across a system for which nobody wants to be responsible, consider whether a system without an owner is  desirable in your organisation. Perhaps shutting it down may result in a new owner for the system stepping up.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  17  3.1.4.2 Cookbook step 1b: group assets into a ‘proposal zone model’  Process  Figure 5 Proposal zone model with all assets and communication information  Input  All asset, inventory, and communication information is from Step 1.A.  Task  1) The railway operator should define an asset model of its railway system. Assets should  be split into groups corresponding to physical areas, entities and levels of functional  criticality.  • Assign the responsible assets to the entity subsystems (signalling: signalling,  command & control, auxiliary, comfort, public interlocking, crossing, RBC,  switches, etc.)  • Group the assets and technical SuC into a draft of zones by their essential  process functions (energy: power plants, substations, switch heating, tunnel  systems, traction mains, etc.).  The resulting model is an input to define the SuC and zones  2)  Identify all physical and logical boundaries of the SuC and each process or utility area.  3) Identify all physical and logical points of access to the SuC and each process or utility  area.  4) Connect zones and conduits between the zones by their essential process functions in  the entity subsystem.  5) Connect the entity subsystems to a corporate model and identify borders (‘place for  firewalls’).  6) Define the critical zone levels and a communication matrix.  Note: a strong collaboration and support between the CSA and all ISE, ISA, ISO and CISO helps to meet this  challenge in a manageable timeframe.  Hint: this step is in general not described in other standards. Grouping assets into a proposal zone model, and  especially knowing the boundaries, makes life easier for the high-level assessment of risk that follows.  Hint: look at the ‘Railway asset model’ chapter.  Note: strong collaboration and support between the CSA and all ISE, ISA, ISO and CISO is necessary to  overcome this challenge in a manageable timeframe.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  18  Output  • A proposal (of a railway system) zone model (architecture draft) and high-level  documentation of:  o organisational SuC (or subsystem to prevent misunderstandings with  technical SuC);  o zones in the organisational SuC;  o technical SuC such as interlocking systems or substations;  o communication scheme at a high level with conduits and boundaries or at  least a record of the boundaries and points of access to the SuC and each  process;  • A high-level description of the SuC to include the name, a high-level description of the  function and the intended usage of the SuC, as well as a description of the equipment  or process under control as it is known at the stage of initial risk assessment;  • At a later stage, during the detailed risk assessment, this SuC description should be  completed to achieve a detailed description of all assets (reference and version).  A simplified example for one entity (SuC) including the main ways for communication:  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  19  Figure 6 Simplified example of a proposal zone model for one entity  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  20  The following figure shows a proposal zone model for a system railway in a standardised and  modular way, including Business-IT and gateways to other entities or the internet and other  RU/IMs at a high level.  Figure 7 Example of a proposal railway system zone model concerning TS50701 (Source:  CLC/TS 50701:2021 -  © CENELEC, reproduced with permission)  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  21  SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 CHAPTER 4.4  EN62443-3-1 CHAPTERS 5 TO 16  3.1.5 Domain specific guidance  3.1.5.1 Signalling  A set of possible assets and requirements can be found in documents from the EULYNX  project.  3.1.5.2 Rolling stock  A set of possible requirements is found in Annex G of CLC/TS 50701:2021.  3.1.5.3 Fixed installations  No deviations.  3.1.5.4 Office and business  For office and business IT, it is most likely that an inventory of assets will exist, either for  accounting purposes or due to tax obligations.  3.2 INITIAL RISK ASSESSMENT (ZCR 2)  Guiding questions: What risks is my system prone to? What will I have to consider in later  stages?  3.2.1 Process  After the assets and SuC are identified, the initial risk assessment should be performed. This  process identifies and prioritises specific processes or utility areas of the SuC by their relative  importance to the asset owners’ business.  For the railway application, at least the following criteria should be considered:  • human health and safety  • operational availability  • financial impact.  Hint:  ZCR2 identify global and company risks.  ZCR4 identify and verify high-level risk by using the proposal zone model  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  22  Figure 8 Initial risk assessment to identify sources of high-level risk (ZCR 2)  3.2.2 Relevant parts of standards  3.2.3 Design information  No additional information.  3.2.4 Additional guidance  3.2.4.1 Cookbook step 2: identify corporate risks  Input  • the draft of the proposal zone model and high-level documentation of:  o organisational SuC (or ‘subsystem’ to prevent misunderstandings with  technical SuC),  o zones in the organisational SuC,  o technical SuC such as interlocking systems or substations,  o communication scheme on a high level with conduits and boundaries, or at  least a record of the boundaries and points of access to the SuC and each  process.  • draft of zone critical (ZC) levels and a communication matrix (CM).  Tasks  1. Perform an initial risk assessment:  • Identify risk scenarios and worst-case consequences for the risk events of loss of  confidentiality, integrity and availability for each process or utility area and the SuC.  The high-level security objectives of confidentiality, integrity and availability are  commonly used within information security and are further developed into seven  foundational requirements by the IEC 62443 series.  SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 CHAPTER 6.3 AND 6.3.1  EN 62443-3-2:2020 CHAPTER 5.3  Note: The worst-case consequence is limited to a span of x calendar day(s), which must be defined in the  enterprise risk management tools.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  23  In addition, impacts that continue beyond a defined number of calendar day(s) should  be considered within plans for business continuity and resilience.  • Assess the description of the consequences and rating for each area of impact (entity)  using the company’s risk criteria as defined in the risk management tool.  • Assess the description and rating of the risk for each identified risk.  • Determine the highest risk rating for each process or entity and the SuC.  2. Validate the draft of the high-level railway system zone model:  • Assign the highest risk rating for each process or entity and the SuC as the critical  rating.  • Note: as likelihood is assumed to be fixed, this document refers to the high-level risk  rating simply as the critical rating.  3. Validate the communication matrix and critical zone levels.  4. Validating all results through an impact evaluation.  The impact evaluation in the initial assessment of risk should identify the worst global  impact in case of loss of the properties of an asset. The global impact should be  evaluated not only at the business level, but also at the environmental, societal, and  human impact levels.  Output  • Negative validation: go back to Step 1.A and redesign the proposal zone model  • Positive validation:  o go forward to ZCR 3 / Step 3 ‘Zoning’  o risk validated:   proposal zone model and high-level documentation for:  • organisational SuC (or ‘subsystem’ to prevent  misunderstandings with technical SuC);  • zones in the organisational SuC;  • technical SuC such as interlocking systems or substations;  • communication scheme on high level with conduits and  boundaries;  • records of the boundaries and points of access to the SuC  and each process;   the documentation shall include at least:  • high level risk matrix,  • high level risk evaluation.  3.3 PARTITIONING OF ZONES AND CONDUITS  (ZCR 3)  Guiding questions. How to do zoning? How can I divide my system using good partitions?  What criteria should I use?  Hint: the detailed risk assessment process does not assume a fixed likelihood.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  24  3.3.1 Process  Figure 9 Partitioning and SuC process (ZCR 3)  SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 CHAPTER 6.4  EN62443-3-2 ALL CHAPTERS  3.3.2 Relevant parts of standards  Criteria for zones and conduits breakdown  Based on the output of the initial risk assessment, the assets should be assigned to consistent  security zones connected by conduits. This means all assets in the same zone and all data sent  by the same conduit share the same or similar cybersecurity requirements.  The following criteria should be used to partition the SuC into zones and conduits:  a. risk to the assets in terms of integrity, availability and confidentiality;  b. type of interfaces or connections to the other parts of the SuC (e.g. wireless);  c.  physical or logical location;  d. access requirements;  e. operational function;  f.  organisation responsibilities for each asset;  g. safety aspects;  h. technology lifecycle, e.g. product lifecycle, obsolescence [Source: CLC/TS 50701:2021].  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  25  Process for breaking down zones and conduits  The objective for grouping the assets into zones and conduits is to identify the assets that share  common cybersecurity requirements and group them to share the means of mitigation. The  following aspects should be considered for the process of defining zones and conduits.  • The business assets (IT) and control assets (OT) should be separated into different  zones.  • Safety-related assets shall be grouped in dedicated zones which are logically or  physically separated from zones which are not safety related. However, if non-safety  assets are allocated to such a zone, the complete zone is considered as safety related.  • Temporarily connected devices should be included in zones separated from assets  that are permanently connected.  • Wireless devices should be included in zones separated from the ones with the wired  devices.  • (Remote) Devices that are permitted to make connections should be grouped into a  separate zone(s).  • Zones should contain the security device protecting the perimeter at the edges of  conduits.  3.3.3 Design information  3.3.3.1 Remote maintenance access  a) With a possible impact on system operations  The following design rules should be considered for maintenance application:  • direct (maintenance) access from business zones or from external sources to OT  zones with higher security demands, e.g. up from ZC4 (depending on the individual ZC  Model) or SL2 without control by an internal security device or similar (e.g. proxy  server), should not be allowed;  • external maintenance access (e.g. via Internet) should be grouped, controlled and  forewarned in a separate internal zone, e.g. maintenance access via a B2B proxy in  the technical DMZ.

[Source: CLC/TS  50701:2021]  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  26  b) Without a possible impact on system operations  The following design rules should be considered for devices communicating with mobile phone  networks so that misconfiguration or sent commands don’t have any impact on normal  operations, e.g. datalogger, sensor values by IoT devices:  • direct (maintenance) access from business zones or external to control zones without  control by an internal security device or similar (e.g. proxy server) is allowed if the  source (sensor, device, IoT-edge) and the sink (collecting server) are in special and  separated zones;  • it is highly recommended, in order to guarantee the integrity of data, to encrypt  communications via unsecure or untrusted networks.  3.3.4 Additional guidance  3.3.4.1 Cookbook step 3a:  defining global surroundings  Before starting to plan zones, basic information on the company and its surroundings needs to  be defined. These basics concern the environment, devices, systems, employees etc. and may  differ for each company.  Task: Define ‘classes of networks’ by the maturity of their security  Firstly a set of ‘network classes’ needs to be defined. Each network class will have a unique  security maturity. This is needed to generate a communication matrix to determine which  dataflows are allowed or not allowed.  Too many network classes increases the ruleset, make the overall concept complex and  obstruct upcoming functions  which merge data of different sources to support AI, Digital-Twin,  and Condition based Maintenance. On the other hand too few network classes reduce security  and resilience. Figure 6 shows an example of a set of networks for one entity.  3.3.4.2 Zone criticality (ZC)  Every zone should be classified according to its risks. Zone criticality represents the security  demands in a simplified expression to define the allowed communication between zones. Zone  criticalities represent the individual network groups based on the maturity of their security and  should cover all zones in the owner’s company.

SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 ANNEX F.6  3.3.4.3 Communication matrix (CM)  The communication matrix defines, at a high-level, authorised and unauthorised  communications. The matrix is unique within a company and valid for all communications and  entities in one company (RU or IM). The communication matrix is the basis of rulesets for  security devices to control dataflows between zones to prevent loops, backdoors or the  bypassing of security measures and is based on levels of ‘zone criticality’ (ZC).  Referring to a castle: the communication matrix is the code of contact on which all inhabitants  agree; it defines who can go to which areas in the castle. Is it allowed to read or write books in  the archive? Who can pass the kings security to enter the princess bedroom?  A communication matrix will be developed based on the following two rules:  • direct communication between zones with well-known risks (e.g. zones with well- known and fixed mounted OT devices) and unknown risks (e.g. office zones with  laptops, printer, internet connectivity) should be refused;  • in general, direct communication is only allowed between zones with the same or a  subsequent zone criticality.  3.3.4.4 Communication matrix (CM) and zone criticality (ZC)  The communication matrix shows, at a high level, which communications between zones are  allowed, restricted or prohibited. This matrix is one of the basics of the final zoning model. It is  also a helpful, simple and easy to understand overview for technicians in their daily business if  systems expand or new functions need to be implemented.  Note: the definition of which book is read only or enabled to write is the result of the ruleset for security devices.  Note: to take care of the different system architectures in Rolling Stock Systems and Landside, two schemes of  Zone criticality are available:  • Zone criticality landside (ZC-L),  • Zone criticality rolling stock (ZC-RS). [Source: CLC/TS 50701:2021: F2.3.x and F2.4.x]  Attention: the final CM and the ZC principles need to be part of the internal ISMS. This is the basis for all (future)  communication flows, systems extensions, new features and firewall rulesets.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  28  The dataflows should be defended and controlled based on the safety and security demands of  the zones. The fine tuning of dataflows is controlled by rules and access lists (e.g. of the  security devices):  • “+”  data flow is allowed in both directions,  • “R”: data flow is restricted to read-only only by data diodes or similar measures,  • “-“: data flow is prohibited.

Task: Defining zones in the proposal zoning model  1) Take all asset groups identified in ZCR 1 and verified in ZCR 2 and try to define a  zone model based on the system and device communications. The high-level  railway zone model can be used as layout for the first attempt.  2) Extend the generic high-level zone model to a company specific model with all  organisational or technical SuCs and zones.  Hint: the following chapter can be used as a checklist.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  29  Figure 10 Example of an individual railway zone model  3) Classify each zone with a zone criticality (defined in the CM).  Figure 11 Example of defining zone criticality in the individual railway zone model  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  30  4) Conduits: place security devices on the boundaries of each zone.  5) Check normal dataflow between zones and their ZC with the validated CM if the  process communication of the essential functions is working well.  6) Check the dataflow for system diagnostics between the zones and their ZC with the  validated CM if the process communication of the essential functions is working  well.  Figure 13 Example 2 of possible communication flow  7) Place means for monitoring management systems (technical domain controller,  network management, NAC, PKI, Syslog & SIEM, etc.) in every organisational SuC to  support the ‘de-centralised approach’ and the ‘modular entity subsystem approach’.  Note: in some cases, functions may not be working. This results in a step back to ZCR 1 or ZCR 3a (depending  on the severity of the challenge) and the redesign or relocation of the zone or document (and finally approved)  expectations.  Figure 12 Example 1 of possible communication flow  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  31  8) Check if the communication flow will work with the relevant devices. It is possible to  merge and/or reduce zones in a second loop if approved by a risk analysis.  9) Check the methods and strategies for patching and updating to all zones and all  devices  10) Check communications with partner companies, other IM and RU or Cloud  connectivity.  11) Check corporate goals and strategies (can be read from the ISMS).  12) Check remote maintenance connection (personal support and configuration of data  transfer) and close all existing connections bypassing the official way and  authorised methods (modem or ISDN, for example).  13) Check authentication, user rights and role mechanisms. Is it possible for each  single device to check the authorisation if a user wants to log in?  14) Check whether the dispatching and operating staff have the awareness to  understand the overall concept and to handle the security mechanisms in the  correct way in order to prevent unknown backdoors.  15) Check whether the dispatching units have sufficient knowledge about functional  processes and the security organisation.  16) Check whether the zoning architecture forces the same security requirements for  backup LAN/WAN connections.  17) Check whether the zoning architecture includes zones for system backups and  individual P-V-LAN’s. Otherwise, the ‘normal’ network must be separated into  different zones to increase resilience, but all backup connections will target into one  backup zone, bypassing the segmentation.  18) Check all zoning relevant controls of ISO27001 that are not listed above.  19) Start merging de-centralised managing and monitoring systems at point 6 if that is  possible. After each merge, check the CM requirements and the administrative  requirements.  20) Note all results and expectations for a zoning design report  The following items should be identified and documented for each defined zone and  conduit:  a. name and/or unique identifier also indicating the type (zone or conduit);  b. accountable organisation(s);  c. definition of logical boundary;  d. definition of physical boundary, if applicable;  e. safety designation;  f. list of all logical access points;  g. list of all physical access points, if applicable;  h. list of dataflows associated with each access point;  i. connected zones or conduits;  j. list of assets and their risk classification and business value.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  32  21) Check restrictions on (external) maintenance access in the ‘(Remote) Maintenance  access’ chapter.  22) Take all asset groups identified in ZCR 1 and verified in ZCR 2 and try to define a  zone model based on the system and device communications. The high-level  railway zone model can be used as a layout for the first attempt.  23) Extend the generic railway model to a company model with all organisational or  technical SuC and zones.  Task: Defining conduits in the proposal zoning model  Conduits represent a zone's gateway or interface enabling it to communicate with other zones.  In general, there are three kinds of zones and each results in a different conduit solution.  • A zone containing a lot of local devices: these OT devices share the security device  on their zone’s conduit. From the economic view, to buy, manage and operate a high- level security device is relatively cheap.  • A zone consists of one (or very few) devices. It called a ‘single system area’ (e.g. PLC  for lightning board in small stations). To secure this device, three options are possible:  (a) Professional security device from network provider in each control enclosure …  very expensive  (b) Industrial security device in each control enclosure … expensive  (c) Embedded security in the ICS/PLC … cheap to buy and operate.  Example PLC:  o If the device doesn’t fulfil the security requirements, it is necessary to add a  mitigating measure such as an industrial firewall in front of the device to  minimise the residual risk.  o If the device has a set of embedded security functions (e.g. SNMPv3, AD  and RADIUS, VPN and PSK, Syslog) and fulfils the requirements, no  additional measures are needed.  • A zone contains safety devices. In this case, the security device must fulfil the specific  demands for safety, e.g. ‘read only’ devices like data diodes of network TAPs or a  special configured firewall with certifications.  Task: Systems without full security functions (legacy, PLC etc.)  All traffic within a security zone is likely trusted (on a practical note: not all industrial devices can  handle the necessary level of cybersecurity). The cybersecurity checks are executed on the  border of the security zones (within the conduit).  Hint: this zoning step takes more than one iteration until it is finalized. Take care about this!  Hint: It is recommending defining a set of security functions and parameters for each group of assets. This helps  the technicians and the vendors to implement and use the correct function and settings. Details see Annex D  Hint: with background knowledge about the essential functions, it is possible to hasten the process instead of  following the next steps and come back from ZCR 4 or ZCR 5 (risk assessment).  Hint: the chosen ‘proposal’ for each conduit IN THIS STEP depends on the amount and security capability of the  devices.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  33  Task: Defining communication lines in the proposal zoning model  Local communication lines are necessary to enable process communication. These lines are  mostly located in a defined or small area, building etc. Normally it is not possible to connect  without special tools, keys and knowledge about the location but it is not necessary to encrypt,  e.g. connecting devices within a closed control enclosure.  WAN Communication lines can be seen as ‘transparent’ for ZC if the security gateways on both  sides of the ‘tunnel’ are managed by the responsible asset owner or owner of the essential  functions.  ‘Transparent’ means:  • there is no possible impact on the dataflow by the provider (e.g. VPN);  • it is theoretically possible to change the provider without any changes (except WAN IP  Address to VPN) or without testing all systems and essential functions behind the  security devices.  Note: conduits don’t need a ZC-Level. Conduits act as perimeter protection for the zone ‘behind’ and must fulfil the  security level of and for the Zone.  Note: measures on local communication lines must be documented and aligned with the CISO.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  34  Figure 14 Example of transparent communication lines between zones  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  35  IP address concept  • Input factors  o Every device interface needs a unique (company net) or NAT (entity net) IP  address.  o Every device with redundant communication (VRRP/HSRP) needs a unique  loopback address.  o Every VLAN needs a unique (company net) or NAT (entity net) IP address  range.  o Every zone needs a unique (company net) or NAT (entity net) IP address  segment.  o Every secure communication line (VPN) needs unique (company net) or NAT  (entity net) IP addresses.  o Sometimes the IP addresses are existing and easy to readdress. Some  systems have a historical background (Token-Ring) or are in 7/24 operations  and readdressing generates a lot of cost.  • Task (IP address ranges may be an example):  Creating an IP address concept based on one of the two general principles:  a) Segmented but flat IP network with central firewall  Example: all IT and OT devices in 10.x.x.x.  b) Mixed hierarchical NAT network with decentralised firewalls (Defines in depth  principle)  Example: IT devices and OT entity forwarding addresses in flat 10.x.x.x, OT  devices in 172.16-32.x.x, backup and local field sub-devices 192.168.x.x.  • Challenge  To avoid IP address conflicts, especially in the overall railway system, an IP address  concept is one of the most important things to do.  Note: the security gateways must fulfil, on both sides, the same SL and the communication must be encrypted for  SL1 or higher.  Hint: it is recommended that the tasks from ‘defining zones in the proposal zoning model’ to ‘systems without full  security functions (legacy, PLC etc.)’ be repeated for an extra iteration to review all topics before going forward.  Hint: a NAT concept for each SuC or entity with a couple of reachable forwarding addresses from the intranet,  makes the concept more flexible, faster, easier and increases the availability in cases of changes. Otherwise, one  change in one entity causes a globally redesign over many Systems within the company!  Hint: to manage devices with redundant connections in case of losing one connection, its recommended to address  the device for management tasks or network management by a separate logical loopback address which is virtual  connected on both interfaces  Hint:  Its highly recommended to reserve one additional IP Segment in every entity for HSRP/VRRP or loopback  addresses!  Hint:  a VPN between zones normally acts company wide. It is highly recommended that one global additional IP  Segment for VPN addresses be reserved!

Input:  • functionally validated proposal zone model and high-level documentation of:  o organisational SuC (or ‘subsystem’ to prevent misunderstandings with  technical SuC),  o zones in the organisational SuC,  o technical SuC such as interlocking systems or substations,  o communication scheme on a high level with conduits and boundaries;  • zones with functionally validated zones criticality (ZC) levels and a communication  matrix (CM);  • a zoning design report.  Note: ‘Zone’ is a group of assets. ‘SL’ is a definition about the power of the perimeter security to protect the group  of assets. So, the SL must apply to the security device on the zone conduit.  Note: at the end, an approval of the CISO or ISO is necessary. It is highly recommended that the following steps  be undertaken as a group made up of the asset owner or owner of the essential function (= ISE) the ISA and  ISO/CISO.  Note: Every change of an IP address causes an interrupt of data and communication. To be on the safe side, the  devices outside the central system shall be configure and restarted local. Readdressing a whole segment means,  to build up a secondary virtual interface to migrate one by one. Keep in mind and plan ONE future-oriented IP  address concept.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  37  Task  The steps for assigning the initial SL-T are as follows:  1. Determine whether specific threats that intend to target the SuC, zone or similar IACS,  automation solutions and products, exist longer than the design lifecycle of the SuC.  In conventional security risk management, a threat is a function of intent and capability.  With respect to cyber risk management, the threat environment is continually and rapidly  changing to the point where the attribution or characterisation of threat agents to a specific  entity is of limited benefit.  2. Evaluate the intention, resources, skills and motivations of threat actors and the  possibility attacks over the design life of the SuC.  3. Assign a minimum-security level target (SL-T) to each security zone. Every conduit on  a zone or SuC should be mapped to an SL between 0 to 4 which defines the strength  of the resistance against hacker attacks.  4. Depending on the location in the company model, this results in a strengthening of the  encryption and security features of the security gateways between each zone and  conduit.  Hint: if no specific threats exist then categorise general threats as either ‘internal’ or ‘external’.  Note: the chosen SL depends on the security needs of the overall railway system. A higher SL may cause problems  in process communications and may require the development of special solutions. This must be clarified with the  system vendor.  Note: system costs increase proportionally with the mapped SL.  Figure 15 Example of defining SL to each zone and conduit  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  38  5. Check whether the chosen SL-T allows the process communication relationships of the  OT systems to operate.  Example:  • Now: the communication between two devices is hardcoded by the system and  has been running for 10 years.  • Plan: separate the devices into two different zones with SL2 at one conduit. SL2  means multifactor authentication is needed.  o Problem: how to integrate an automatic MFA via SMS e.g. in a 10 year  old application?  6. Check if the security devices on the conduits support measures needed to force the  SL-T. If not, replace the device to fulfil the demands of the SL. The feedback is an  input for the risk assessment that follows in ZCR4.  Output:  • definitions of SL-T for each conduit or zone and the minimum-security strength for  the gateway devices on the conduit;  • list of minimum functions for the functional requirements (FR) and system  requirements (SR);  • security vector based on measures for FR and SR;  • records of threat agents;  • records of minimum SL-T for each security zone.

What impact could an attacker have on my system?  3.4.1 Process  For each asset group supporting the essential functions of the SuC, the consequences of losing  the integrity, availability or confidentiality of the asset should be evaluated.  To enable a consistent approach for threat risk assessment between asset owners, system  integrator and product suppliers, it is important that all the stakeholders share the same  references for impact assessment.  Hint: this step of zoning takes more than one iteration until finalised. Take care with it.  Note: the decision steps of ZCR 4 High-level Risk Assessment differ between railway system needs and the generic  standards in 62443-3-2.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  41  Figure 16 High-level risk assessment process (ZCR 4)  3.4.2 Relevant parts of standards  Likelihood assessment  ‘The threat landscape may change suddenly and so experience is of limited use for  cybersecurity. Therefore, the likelihood of an attack can be evaluated only on a qualitative or  semi-quantitative scale. Because of that, the owner of the essential functions should make use  of intelligence reports and other information sources to determine the potential attackers that  they might be targeted by.’ [Source: CLC/TS 50701:2021]  Threat assessment  To build an appropriate cybersecurity strategy, shared between all the stakeholders, the first  step is to identify and agree on a consistent list of generic cybersecurity threats that could  jeopardise the railway application. Agreement on the threat landscape is crucial as  discrepancies in the set of threats considered by the different stakeholders will lead to an  underestimation of risk and a lack of implementation of control measures.  Threat libraries and reports such as the following should be taken as inputs:  • ENISA Threat Landscape Annual report,  • ISO/IEC 27005,  • NIST SP 800-30.  Finally, the threat landscape should:  • be defined or at least approved by the asset owner;  • be updated at least once a year (or according to contractual requirements);  • provide mapping to the input threat libraries or reports;  • provide rationale for threats excluded from consideration [Source: CLC/TS  50701:2021].

What security requirements are needed in order to reach an acceptable  level of risk?  3.5.1 Process  The following paragraphs describe the detailed assessment of risk which should be performed  for each zone and each conduit (or cluster of zones and conduits) and result in a definition of  the required cybersecurity specifications as the central outcome of these activities.  To fulfil the demands of railway environments, ZCR 5 is split into three sub-processes and a  step-back to redraw zones and conduits in ZCR 3 is included in this model.  Figure 17 Detailed high-level risk assessment process (ZCR 5)  3.5.2 Relevant parts of standards  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  44  3.5.3 Design information  In IEC 62443-3-2 ZCR 5.6, different approaches for the derivation of SL-T are described. The  first is based directly on the need for protection against a particular kind of attacker (e.g. hacker,  criminal organisation, states sponsored group), including an estimation of the efforts needed by  an attacker, also known as an attack vector. This approach determines which types of attacks,  by which kinds of attackers, a zone or conduit of the SuC should withstand, considering the  threats and vulnerabilities identified and any legal constraints, resulting directly in a SL-T. But, in  this approach, is it still necessary to check that the risk is acceptable.  Threat risk assessment may not override mandatory requirements for security protection, for  example, by regulation.

The first approach in this chapter describes the detailed assessment of risk, which should be  performed for each zone and each conduit (or cluster of zones and conduits) and result in a  definition of the required cybersecurity specifications, as the central outcome of this activity.  SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 CHAPTER 7  EN 62443-3-2 ALL CHAPTERS  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  46  Input  • list with published security incidents, threats, and vulnerabilities  • list of the likelihoods (depending on entity and company) of incidents, threats and  vulnerabilities;  • records of criticality ratings for each process or utility area and the SuC;  • records of threats;  • security advisories from product suppliers;  • historical data of security events.  In a first step, the identification of the threats and vulnerabilities are detailed. Then for all  identified threats an appropriate principle of risk acceptance is chosen and approved by the  railway duty holder. It is acknowledged that the easiest way to apply the process is, if only one  principle is applied for each zone or conduit, for a complete zone or conduit to be covered by a  code of practice or by a reference system or by an explicit evaluation of risk. But for complex  systems a mixture of principles may be necessary.  Task: identifying threats in a brief  • Record all assets within each process or entity within the SuC in an asset register.  • Record all physically accessible data communications and interfaces of assets as  attributes in the asset register.  • Prior to final design, obtain an independent professional review of credible threats  using competent persons,  who have an appropriate degree of independence.  • Keep records about the credible threats, including threat agents and threat actions,  over the design life of the SuC.  • Describe the threat actions of a threat agent in accordance with the domains of attack  and mechanisms of attack.  • Develop fault trees or attack trees to model the threat actions used by threat actors for  each of the following general security events within the context of the SuC.  Task: The following topics shall be within the scope  • loss of confidentiality –  disclosure of information assets  • loss of integrity  –  unauthorised use of IACS functions  • loss of integrity  –  modifications to IACS or information assets  • loss of availability  –  disruption to IACS functions  • loss of availability  –  destruction of IACS or information assets  After identifying the threats, the vulnerabilities in assets and countermeasures must be  identified.  Task: identifying vulnerabilities in a brief  • Prior to final design, obtain an independent professional review of credible  vulnerabilities.  • List the credible vulnerabilities.  • Revise the fault or attack trees to indicate credible vulnerabilities in the branches.  Task: determining unmitigated cyber risk in a brief  • Record the risks corresponding to the branches from the fault or attack tree in a risk  report.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  47  • Estimate the credible worst-case consequences and likely descriptions in accordance  with the enterprise risk management tool for each risk prior to assessing the  application or effectiveness of existing cybersecurity countermeasures that are not  enabled by default.  • Limit the worst-case consequence to a span of x calendar day(s).  • Determine the unmitigated cyber risk rating for each risk in accordance with the  enterprise risk management system.  • Record the unmitigated cyber risk in the risk report.  Task: determining security level targets in a brief  • Identify the applicable system requirements shown in chapter ‘System Requirements  (SR)’ that provide technical security capabilities and meet the target security levels  expressed by the SL-T vector.  • Identify available countermeasures.  Output:  • a cybersecurity risk validated high level zone model;  • a cybersecurity risk validated zoning design report or other document;  • records of SL-T vector for each security zone;  • cyber-risk reports:  o report of credible vulnerabilities from an independent professional  reviewer  o records of vulnerabilities,  o fault or attack tree drawings with vulnerabilities,  o asset register,  o report of credible threats from an independent professional reviewer,  o records of threat agents and actions,  o fault or attack tree drawings,  o assumed residual risk;  • required cybersecurity specifications (CRS) of the SuC.  3.5.4.3 Process step 5b: identify countermeasures  After determining security level targets, the existing countermeasures should be identified and  evaluated. A zoning model with security boundaries (security gateways) should be available to  identify available security functions or countermeasures and additional countermeasures that  are missing.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  48  Figure 19 Process of identifying countermeasures  3.5.4.4 Cookbook step 5b: identify existing countermeasures  If the residual risk exceeds stakeholder expectations, it is necessary to find additional  countermeasures to increase security maturity, reduce the likelihood of impacts or increase  system resilience. The approach is to allocate cybersecurity requirements on subsystem or  component level first and then refine by requirements.  Additionally, the issue of compensating countermeasures is discussed in the context of  cybersecurity requirements, where these are needed to satisfy a cybersecurity requirement or a  substitute one due to technical constraints or limitations. Compensating countermeasures are  part of the next chapter ‘Process step 5.C: Determine residual cyber risk’.  Input  The complete requirements for all zones and conduits included should be documented in the  notes on the SuC. These include:  • a cybersecurity risk validated high level zone model;  • a cybersecurity risk validated zoning design report or other document;  • a cyber-risk report with assumed residual risk;  • required cybersecurity specifications (CRS) of the SuC;  • the level of tolerable risk;  • directive from the stakeholder against a lower or higher assumed risk;  • records of SL-T vectors for each security zone.  Task: Identifying and evaluating existing countermeasures in a brief:  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  49  • Evaluate the effectiveness of existing technical countermeasures of systems and  networks against the system requirements as identified.  • Record the existing countermeasures and their effectiveness in the risk report.  The key objective of this chapter is the identification (and structuring) of security requirements  for zones and conduits of a given SuC to provide an acceptable level of protection from all  identified threats and known vulnerabilities. The security requirements for a SuC are mainly  based on the system security requirements with additional (company dependent) guidance for  railway applications.  The following topics should be considered:  • system security requirements,  • apportionment of cybersecurity requirements,  • breakdown of system requirements to subsystem level,  • allocation of system requirements at component level,  • specific consideration for the implementation of cybersecurity requirements on  components,  • the requirement to breakdown structures as verification,  • compensating countermeasures.  Output  • list of compensating countermeasures,  • updated CRS with countermeasures and effectiveness.  3.5.4.5 Process step 5c: determine residual cyber risk  After identifying and evaluating existing countermeasures, the residual cyber risk rating taking  existing countermeasures into consideration should be determined.  Figure 20 Process of verifying residual risk against tolerable risk  3.5.4.6 Cookbook step 5c: security measures for identified zones and conduits – how to  protect or mitigate risk  The second approach about countermeasures is based on the difference between unmitigated  cybersecurity risk and acceptable risk. It must be mentioned, as a precondition, that the zones  and conduits to be assessed by a detailed risk assessment should have reached a certain level  of maturity in their architecture and possibly their (planned) implementation. Generally, the  second approach leads to a more appropriate SL-T value but takes more effort. Generally, the  Hint: the compensating countermeasures should be state-of-the-art, verified between asset owner and system  vendor and approved by the system vendor.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  50  detailed risk assessment described here is proactive, i.e. it is not triggered by an incident or  vulnerability.  Input  The input to determine the residual cyber risk rating is:  • the risk report (including the level of tolerable risk),  • a cybersecurity risk validated high-level zone model,  • a cybersecurity risk validated high-level zoning design report or other document,  • a list of compensatory countermeasures,  • approvals from system vendors concerning the mitigating countermeasures.  Task: determining residual cyber risk rating in a brief  • Estimate the credible worst-case consequences and likely descriptions in accordance  with the enterprise risk management system.  • Determine the residual cyber risk in accordance with the enterprise risk management  system focusing on:  o cybersecurity cases,  o cybersecurity verification,  o cybersecurity integration and verification,  o assessment of results,  o cybersecurity validation,  o cybersecurity system acceptance,  o independence,  o objectives.  • Record the residual consequence and likely descriptions and residual cyber risk in the  risk report.  Output  The output from determining the residual cyber risk rating includes:  • risk report with residual consequence and likelihood descriptors and residual cyber  risk.  • required cybersecurity specifications (CRS) of the SuC  The final step of the detailed risk assessment is to collect the cybersecurity requirements for a  zone or conduit related to all threats or vulnerabilities from the various sources:  • requirements stated by using codes of practice (for threats covered by this principle);  • requirements from required cybersecurity specifications for applicable reference  systems (for threats covered by this principle);  • requirements of IEC 62443-3-3 for the derived SL-T for the remaining threats arising  from an explicit evaluation of risk.  In some cases, the requirements may arise from a single source, e.g. if a code of practice or a  reference system is similar to a zone or conduit, but in general requirements from different  sources need to be aligned.  SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 CHAPTER 6 AND 9  Note: the residual cyber risk relates at this point to the ‘current residual risk’.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  51  Residual risk? What risk remains? To be 100% secure is not possible from the technical point  of view, and from the economic point of view it would be a financial nightmare.  The stakeholder and responsible asset owner should confirm all results and measures of risk  analysis. They must decide whether the residual risk is too high (step back in the zoning  process ZCR 5 – mitigating countermeasures) or whether the risk is tolerable.  3.5.5 Domain specific guidance  3.5.5.1 Signalling  No deviations.  3.5.5.2 Rolling stock  No deviations.  3.5.5.3 Fixed installations  3.5.5.4 Office and business  No deviations.  3.6 DOCUMENTATION OF CYBERSECURITY REQUIREMENTS (ZCR 6)  Guiding questions. How can we ensure that a complete change of the project team does not  result in the loss of all knowledge? How should we document our results?  3.6.1 Process  The last ‘project step’ in the zoning process is the documentation. Cybersecurity is a part of the  fast-changing digital environment. That means that incidents and hazards are changing, and  measures must be modified. Documentation is one of the most overlooked processes.  Nevertheless, should incidents occur, it is very important to have an overview of devices,  firmware, models and software that is quickly accessible to plan the next operating steps or  trigger crisis management if necessary  Note: internal networks, also gateways to external networks, might be down should a cybersecurity problem arise or  there is a cyberattack. In such cases, it can happen that access to emergency documents or devices and network  information (Chapter: DOCUMENTATION OF CYBERSECURITY REQUIREMENTS) is not possible via the network.  It can be useful to have a special isolated zone in the company crisis-management environment that collects all  information during normal operations, but can act locally and offline in case of a network shutdown.  Note: we can’t eliminate security risks completely. A residual risk is always present.  Hint: more zones and independent firewalls ensure higher resilience, which results in lower residual risk for each  zone.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  52  Figure 21 Documenting cybersecurity requirements (ZCR 6)  3.6.2 Design information  Collect all information’s from ‘living systems’ instead of archive documents as far as possible.  3.6.3 Additional guidance  3.6.3.1 Cookbook step 6: documentation  Input:  • Functionally validated railway system final zone model and high-level  documentation of:  o organisational SuC (or ‘subsystem’ to prevent misunderstandings with  technical SuC),  o zones in the organisational SuC,  o technical SuC such as interlocking systems or substations,  o communication scheme on a high level with conduits and boundaries,  o location and type of security gateways,  o risk analysis from all zones and conduits with external networks  (Internet, partner companies etc..);  • Functionally validated zone criticality (ZC) levels and a communication matrix  (CM);  • A zoning design report;  • A threat landscape.  Task  • Collect all information into a well-known place or systems such as a risk  management tool.  • Structure it for cyclic internal review or external (NIS) audit.  Output  • Actual documentation of zones, designs, communications, demands, measures  and residual risk that can be found very quickly.  SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 CHAPTER 6.4  3.7 APPROVAL (ZCR 7)  Guiding question. When is the work finished? What must be done in order to get approval for  the system?  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  53  3.7.1 Process  This last step is the formal agreement and approval by all participants, stakeholders, duty  holders etc to commit to the final zone model, the (mitigating) countermeasures and the residual  risk. If resources run out during migration, it results in two weak environments, higher  complexity and a lot of temporary solutions. This culminates in an unknown system overall and  higher risk.  Figure 22 Asset owner approval (ZCR 7)  SOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND REFERENCE  CLC/TS 50701:2021 CHAPTER 6.4  3.7.2 Additional guidance  3.7.2.1 Cookbook step 7: documentation  Input  • final zone model,  • communication flow,  • data flow restrictions,  • secure and alternative ways to maintain the systems,  • planed cost, time and resources.  Task  This approval and commitment is the basis for planning, timing, internal and external human  resources, and financial resources and the ‘Go’ for planning migration operations, especially  where contingency measures are required for 24/7 operations.  Output  • start of operational part of the zoning project,  • HR and financial plan for each entity,  • aligned migration plan for each system group or zone,  • detailed migration plan with system vendors,  • possible breakdowns during migration identified,  • maximum downtime for operation identified,  • define process to enable communication on security gateways,  • TCO Cost.  3.8 MIGRATION (ZCR 8)  Migration is not a part of the (planning) zoning process but is part of the overall zoning project.  This step is only placed here to keep it in mind; however no details are described here. When  this step begins, the theoretical part of zoning is over. From this moment, despite the pre-work  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  54  results of ZCR1 to ZCR 7, a lot of challenges will arise during migration in real 24/7 operations.  Take care that fall-back plans are ready.  3.8.1 Process  Figure 23 Migration and implementation process (ZCR8)  3.8.2 Design information  No special information.  3.8.3 Additional guidance  3.8.3.1 Cookbook step 8: migration  Input  • final zone model  • communication flow  • detailed migration plan for each zone, as agreed with stakeholders, asset owner,  operator and system vendor.  Task  Migrate systems and devices.  Output  • a zoned and secure railway network.  3.9 OPERATION / RUN (ZCR 9)  Guiding question. What will I have to do in order to keep my system in a safe and secure  state, after it has been set into operation? What activities should be performed in order to detect  and mitigate attacks?  3.9.1 Process  After migration all devises and systems, the final and endless process of ‘run’ (‘daily business’)  starts. This step is only placed here to keep it in mind; however, no details are described here.  Hint: if something can happen – it will happen. Have a backup plan for each migration concept should migration fail  in order ‘to be able to reverse all steps taken’.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  55  Figure 24 Operation/Run process (ZCR9)  3.9.2 Design information  If the next two ‘monitor and review’ steps result in new mitigating measures being needed or  changing the system design or architecture of the network becomes necessary, refer to chapter  3.5 (Detailed Risk Assessment ZCR5).  3.9.3 Additional guidance  3.9.3.1 Cookbook step 9a: monitor and review threats  The continuous monitoring and reviewing during the run process are performed in the ‘operate  and maintain’ stage of the asset lifecycle. These activities support submissions to configuration  management unless a tailored application has been approved as defined. Each of the  processes within continuous monitoring and reviewing is explained in the following chapters.  Input:  • records of criticality ratings for each process or utility area and the SuC;  • records of threat agents and actions;  • published security advisories, such as from ENISA, BSI, NIST or national  government sites;  • security advisories from product suppliers;  • historical data of security events.  Process  • Check the environment and the monitoring system periodically.  • Install automatic notification systems should something happen and do all the  things that a network operator would do. Have a look at some hints on the process  found in figure 25 in Chapter 3.9.1  • Monitor advisories and historical data for new and changed threats at least every  day.  • Review threats and scheduled maintenance activities to treat new and changed  threats.  • Repeat the detailed risk assessment for each new or changed threat and at least  annually.  Output:  • a zoned and secure railway network;  • schedule of maintenance activities.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  56  3.9.3.2 Cookbook step 9b: monitor and review vulnerabilities  This process in continuous monitoring and reviewing is the monitoring and reviewing of new and  changed vulnerabilities.  Input  • records of criticality ratings for each process or utility area and the SuC;  • records of vulnerabilities;  • published security advisories, such as from ENISA, BSI, NIST or national government  sites;  • security advisories from product suppliers;  • historical data of security events.  Process  • Monitor advisories and historical data for new and changed vulnerabilities at least  every day.  • Review vulnerabilities based on their common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS).  • Schedule maintenance activities to treat new and changed vulnerabilities within a  defined period depending on the critically of the zone (ZC).  Output  • schedule of maintenance activities;  • a zoned and secure railway network.  Hint: if something can happen – it will happen. Have a crisis plan ready for each SuC.  ZONING AND CONDUITS FOR RAILWAYS  February 2022  57  4. LEGACY SYSTEMS  The system lifecycle and the high cost of OT devices results in a brownfield operation. This  brownfield environment is a mix of new devices in green-field projects, which are integrated into  existing monitoring or control/SCADA systems that worked with older legacy systems.  • Railways always have legacy systems.  • Legacy systems will be part of our daily business in the future.  • Legacy systems are not made less secure through the use of mitigating  measures.  There are many ways to make legacy systems secure. They are dependent on the process and  the functionality of the system. One possible easy way is to handle them like all other ‘device- groups’. This means to identify them and give them their own zones with defending firewalls on  the security devices on the conduit as described in the ‘Steps’ of this cookbook.

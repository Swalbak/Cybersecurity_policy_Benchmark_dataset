With a great impact on citizens’ safety, security and privacy due to  its cyber-physical nature and the inherent autonomy, the threat landscape concerning Industry 4.0 and IoT  is extremely wide.  Following a methodological approach, ENISA has developed this study on Good Practices for Security of the  IoT in the context of Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing. The study makes a series of contributions, most  notably the following:   Defines relevant terminology (i.e. terms such as Industry 4.0, Smart manufacturing, Industrial IoT)  to promote common understanding of relevant cybersecurity scenarios.   Categorizes in a comprehensive taxonomy the Industry 4.0 assets across the manufacturing process  and value chain.   Introduces a detailed Industry 4.0 threat taxonomy based on related risks and attack scenarios.   Maps the identified threats to assets, thus facilitating the deployment of security measures based  on the customized requirements of interested stakeholders.   Lists security measures related to the use of IoT in Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0 and maps  them against the aforementioned threats.  In conducting this study, ENISA identified and extensively analysed the current state of available  documentation on security in IoT, Industrial IoT, Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing. ENISA also collected  input from a number of security experts through a structured questionnaire and a series of interviews.  ENISA considered the security of Industry 4.0 devices and services throughout their lifecycle (from  conception to end-of-life and decommissioning) and paid close attention to issues that are particular to the  requirements of Industry 4.0. Accordingly, the study highlights security measures in three dimensions:   Policies   Organisational measures   Technical measures  One additional noteworthy element of this study is the mapping to existing security initiatives, standards  and schemes. ENISA reviewed more than 150 resources on Industry 4.0 and IoT security and mapped them  against the security measures proposed in this study. This mapping facilitates stakeholders, who are  nowadays faced with a fragmented field, to have a common basis of understanding.  The guidelines and security measures listed in this study aim at improving the cybersecurity posture of  Industry 4.0 organisations that have adopted or plan to adopt Industrial IoT devices and solutions that  enhance automation in industrial operations. These security measures apply to a wide audience spanning  Industrial IoT operators and manufacturers/vendors, which can utilise these measures and  recommendations as a checklist against which to examine their Industry 4.0 security solutions.  The aim of the study is to serve as a reference point to promote collaboration on Industry 4.0 and Industrial  IoT security across the European Union and raise awareness of the relevant threats and risks with a focus on  “security for safety”.  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  07  1. Introduction  In recent years, we have seen a significant and rapid decline in data transfer and storage costs due to the  accelerating shift in the global economy driven by more connectivity, collaboration and sharing. This  development, accompanied by a bimodal IT organisation, supports exponential growth in the smart  connected world, especially in manufacturing. Recent trends include the emergence of Industry 4.0, a  concept that is revolutionising traditional manufacturing and other industries by introducing new  capabilities, such as digitisation, decision-making decentralisation and value chain integration. Industry 4.0  is tightly bound to cyber-physical systems that in turn are enabling intelligent and connected infrastructures  – including Smart Manufacturing infrastructures – by enhancing their quality of service provisioning.  Transforming the industrial landscape, Industry 4.0 with the Internet of Things (IoT) at its core has already  exerted an impact on society, transforming products, customer experience and the labour market. It is  therefore playing a central role within the European Union’s initiatives, becoming the subject of various  studies, programs and regulations1.  The fourth industrial revolution and exponential growth in the quantity of connected devices all over the  world together with the rapidly increasing number of cyber security incidents further stress the need for  strengthening cyber resilience, especially among the industrial operators who are beginning to utilise IoT  solutions. Recent initiatives towards Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing2 are attracting more attention  to aspects related to the security of technical solutions and the safety of citizens who rely on them. This  subject is all the more important since the potential impact exerted by new threats ranges from  compromising physical security to production downtime, spoilage of product, damage to equipment and the  ensuing financial and reputational losses.  Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing, in particular, accelerate the introduction of intelligence, automation  and autonomy in manufacturing and supply chain environments. Accordingly and given the significant  attention and prioritization that has been given to the digitisation of the EU industrial sector, this study has  a focus on security of IoT in the context of Industry 4.0. The topic is of great importance as vendors’ and  users’ / consumers’ awareness of the threats related to the deployment of Smart Manufacturing and  Industry 4.0 is usually limited. At the same time, cyberattacks focusing on industrial assets, such as Safety  Instrumented Systems, using new attack vectors have been recently observed with an increasing frequency.  Objectives  This ENISA study aims at addressing the security and privacy challenges related to the evolution of industrial  systems and services precipitated by the introduction of IoT innovations. The main objectives were to collect  good practices to ensure security of IoT in the context of Industry 4.0/Smart Manufacturing, while mapping  the relevant security and privacy challenges, threats, risks and attack scenarios.  The aim of the study is to serve as a reference point to promote collaboration on Industry 4.0 and Industrial  IoT security across the European Union and raise awareness of the relevant threats and risks with a focus on  “security for safety”.  1 See examples of EU initiatives related to Industry 4.0 concept: https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools- databases/dem/monitor/tags/industry-40  2 See examples of national initiatives for digitizing industry within the EU: https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools- databases/dem/monitor/category/national-initiatives  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  08  An additional important element of the study is to define the notion of Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing  to set the perimeter of the work to be done and serve as the basis for future developments.  Scope  This study outlines good practices for cybersecurity in the IoT applied in an industrial environment. Due to  the extensive landscape of IoT deployments, this study focuses on Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Smart  Manufacturing because they are among the most representative elements of the overall Industry 4.0  landscape3.  In this study ENISA identified and extensively analysed the current state of available documentation on  security in IoT, IIoT, Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing and other related subjects. ENISA also collected  input from a number of security experts through a structured questionnaire and a series of interviews. Based  on a thorough review of existing works, ENISA identified threats and developed possible critical attack  scenarios targeting various domains of Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing. This enabled the Agency to  develop good practices and security measures to ensure security in IoT in Industry 4.0. In this respect, the  study also made it possible to identify gaps in, and barriers to, security adoption.  The study highlights three groups of security measures to address security challenges in technologies, people  and processes. A risk-based and holistic approach to security was undertaken. ENISA considered the security  of IoT devices and services in industrial settings throughout their lifecycle (from conception to end-of-life)  and paid particular attention to the overall supply chain and third party management, which constitute  essential elements of Industry 4.0.  EU and International policy context  With a globally emerging trend of connected things and the increasingly common adoption of IoT concepts  by organisations across the world, cybersecurity of IoT in recent years has become a matter of interest for  the European Commission and other regulation bodies. IoT in Industry and Smart Manufacturing is a specific  subset of IoT cybersecurity.  Being aware of the potential of IoT and the related cyber security challenges, the EU has been striving to  ensure security in the IoT and accelerate development in this area through numerous policy actions that  include the creation of alliances and centres of expertise, development of regulatory documents and launch  of pilot projects. In March 2015, the European Commission launched the Alliance for Internet of Things  Innovation (AIOTI)4 with the objective to create an innovative European IoT ecosystem. It has become the  largest IoT association in Europe illustrating the EU’s intention to collaborate with stakeholders in order to  establish a competitive European IoT market and develop new business models.  Two months later, in May 2015, the EU adopted the Digital Single Market (DSM) Strategy5. In terms of the  IoT, which is one of its five main development areas, the DSM aims to address common issues that may lead  to the deceleration of secure IoT adoption, such as fragmentation of guidelines and lack of interoperability.  In April 2016, to fulfil DSM needs and ensure awareness of its upcoming policy, the European Commission  published a staff working document related to the IoT6. It constitutes part of the \"Digitising European  3 See EC, Fourth Industrial Resolution: https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/fourth-industrial-revolution  4 See The Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation: https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/alliance-internet- things-innovation-aioti  5 See more about Digital Single Market: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/digital-single-market/  6 See European Commission (2016) “Advancing the Internet of Things in Europe”: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016SC0110  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  09  Industry\" initiative and outlines the EU's vision of IoT based on three pillars: a thriving IoT ecosystem, a  human-centred IoT approach and a single market for IoT.  Like the Internet of Things, Cybersecurity is another DSM priority in terms of standards development. It is a  broad concept that, among others, spans cybersecurity in the Internet of Things and cybersecurity in  industrial systems. When it comes to IoT cybersecurity, ENISA developed a document entitled “Baseline  Security Recommendations for IoT”7 in 2017 to address systematically cybersecurity issues that emerged  because of the introduction of IoT concepts8.  Considering EU policy in terms of typical industrial initiatives, the DSM focuses on facilitating coordination  of European, national and regional initiatives, such as the German Industrie 4.09, Dutch Smart Industry10 and  French Industrie du Futur11. In 2016, a relevant communication from the European Commission was issued12.  Through these initiatives, the EU aims to boost innovation and prepare for new products and services.  As IoT and digitisation of industry rely on the exchange, processing and storage of large amounts of data,  the recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)13 must be mentioned when discussing EU policy  actions. Its objective is to protect privacy and personal information. It applies to all organisations, including  Smart Manufacturing companies and the vendors and operators of IoT devices.  Moving from the EU policy landscape to the international context, in 2017 the US IoT Cybersecurity  Improvement Act14 was introduced to address IoT security issues. Even more recently, the governor of  California signed the first IoT cybersecurity law in the United States that is planned to take effect in 2020. It  requires manufacturers to equip connected devices with reasonable security features15. Apart from this  example, the US Department of Homeland Security, NIST and other entities have also worked on addressing  cybersecurity issues associated with IoT and Smart Manufacturing through development of guidelines,  frameworks and other documents. Notable examples of these initiatives include the Department of  Homeland Security’s publication “Strategic Principles for Securing the Internet of Things”16 or NIST’s  “Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile”17.  7 See ENISA (2017) “Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT”:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot/at_download/fullReport  8 Relation of this document to ENISA Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT has been described in Annex A:.  9 See more about Plattform Industrie 4.0: https://www.plattform-i40.de/I40/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html  10 See more about Smart Industry: https://www.smartindustry.nl/  11 See more about Alliance Industrie du Futur: http://www.industrie-dufutur.org/  12 See European Commission (2016) ”Digitizing European Industry.

However, IoT security in the industrial environment is still regarded as a matter for  consideration by regulatory bodies, as Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing concepts utilising IoT are still  in the process of being devised.  Target Audience  This study provides a set of guidelines and security measures to improve the IoT cybersecurity posture of  Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing organisations, namely organisations that have adopted or plan to  adopt Industrial Internet of Things devices and solutions. These security measures apply to a wide audience  spanning IIoT operators and manufacturers/vendors. The list of potentially targeted profiles includes (but is  not limited to) the following:   Industrial IoT experts, software developers and device manufacturers   Industrial IoT operators and users   OT and IT security experts and solution architects   Persons in charge of security within Industry 4.0 organisations (e.g. CISOs)   Members of international Industry 4.0 organisations and security communities   Academic and Research Development Institutions.  In addition, this document may also support discussions at the policy-making level and therefore be of  interest to the potential development of related regulations on Industrial IoT security.  Methodology  The methodology (as depicted in Figure 1) followed to conduct this study consists of the following five tasks.  Figure 1: Methodology adopted for the study  Task 1: Definition of the project scope and identification of experts – The first step consisted of establishing  the scope of the project and selecting subject matter experts whose input and insights were considered for  the development of the report. The members of the ENISA IoTSEC18 (IoT Security) and EICS19 (ENISA Industry  4.0 Cyber Security) Informal Expert Groups as well as selected additional stakeholders formed the pool of  subject matter experts. In total experts from 42 different bodies contributed to the development and  validation of the study.  Task 2: Desktop research – During this step, extensive search for relevant documents in the context of the  project was conducted. The identified sources served as a reference to develop good practices and other  parts of the report.  18 See more about IoT Security Experts Group: https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/iot-security-experts-group-1  19 See more about EICS Experts Group: https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/eics-experts-group  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  11  Task 3: Questionnaire and series of interviews with selected subject matter experts – ENISA developed a  questionnaire covering various Industrial IoT and Industry 4.0 security aspects. The questionnaire was  completed by a group of subject matter experts. Furthermore, a series of interviews with these experts took  place, through which ENISA collected valuable input to prepare this report.  Task 4: Analysis of collected material and report development – The inputs collected from desktop research  and collaboration with stakeholders were thoroughly analysed by ENISA’s experts. Based on this analysis,  the first draft of this report was developed.  Task 5: Review and validation – ENISA once again reached to its subject matter experts, this time to share  the draft of the report with them to obtain comments and feedback. Taking into account the stakeholders’  feedback, the final version of this report was developed and validated by the subject matter experts during  the validation workshop held in The Hague, NL on the 26th of October 2018.  This methodology enabled ENISA to engage actively with the interested stakeholders and:   define terminology (e.g. Industry 4.0, Smart manufacturing, Industrial IoT etc.),   identify the corresponding assets (what kind of assets and where and how they are used across the  manufacturing process and value chain, its path and evolution over time),   identify possible threats, risks and attack scenarios posed against the Industrial IoT,   map identified threats to assets,   list security measures related to the use of IoT in Smart Manufacturing.  Structure  The study is structured as follows:   Chapter 1: Introductory information on the objectives, scope, context, target audience, methodology and  structure of the study.   Chapter 2: Definition of Industry 4.0 and its components with an overview of the concepts discussed and  the related security challenges.   Chapter 3: Threat and risk analysis containing a taxonomy of the threats and examples of Industry  4.0/Smart Manufacturing attack scenarios.   Chapter 4: Description of security measures and good practices mapped to threats, security domains,  standards and other relevant documents.  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  12  2. Industrial IoT: Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing  Definition  This report focuses on the IoT, Industry 4.0, Smart Manufacturing and IIoT, which are relatively new terms.  There is a veritable plethora of definitions for these terms while commonly held definitions are lacking.  Depending on the source and context, the descriptions of these terms may vary significantly. Thus, it is  important to adopt specific definitions and clarify our understanding of those terms. In this study, ENISA  defines IIoT as IoT (as defined in the ENISA Baseline IoT Security Recommendations20) applied in the  industrial environment. Industry 4.0 is, in turn, a much broader concept that encompasses IIoT and Smart  Manufacturing alike.  ENISA defines Industry 4.0 as “a paradigm shift towards digitalised, integrated and smart value chains  enabling distributed decision-making in production by incorporating new cyber-physical technologies such  as IoT”.  Figure 2: Communication relationships in Industry 4.0  Industry 4.0 design principles, often referred to as the fourth industrial revolution, include interoperability,  autonomy, information transparency, technical assistance and distributed decisions21. Recent technological  20 See ENISA (2017) “Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT”:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot/at_download/fullReport  21 See Connected Factory Global (2016) “Manufacturing Control System Cybersecurity: Risk Assessment & Mitigation  Strategies”: http://www.connectedfactoryglobal.com/resources/cybersecurity-report/  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  13  advances that resulted in reversal of the traditional production process logic led to the formation of this  concept, representing a shift towards decentralised production. With the advent of Industry 4.0, a product  is not merely processed by machines – it communicates with its environment providing relevant information  and instructions (referring to the notion of digital twin). No longer isolated, products and production lines  have become integral parts of the overall network.  Contrary to the traditional approach to industry in which a hardware-based structure with a clear  communication hierarchy was prevalent, Industry 4.0 introduced flexible systems whose functions are not  bound to hardware but distributed throughout the network. In these new systems internal communication  can now be observed across an organisation’s hierarchical levels. New types of interactions have been  introduced (see Figure 2) and external interactions between organisations have changed significantly and  become more flexible.22  Industry 4.0 connects production to information and communication technologies. It merges end user data  with machine data and enables machines to communicate with each other. As a result, it has become  possible for components and machines to manage production autonomously in a flexible, efficient and  resource-saving manner. Its benefits include, among others, higher product quality, greater flexibility,  shorter product launch times, new services and business models.23 It is important to note that the flows  depicted in the figure refer to physical goods and data (e.g. exchange of digital twins). Data flows are  bidirectional at least, e.g. customers may provide feedback to the production/manufacturing process.  Figure 3: Smart Manufacturing in Industry 4.0  By introducing a wide array of new capabilities, Industry 4.0 acts as an enabler for a new approach to  manufacturing, namely Smart Manufacturing. This particular concept, focusing on product manufacturing  using new technologies, constitutes only a small part of Industry 4.0, which may be regarded as a superset  22 See Plattform Industrie 4.0 (2016) “Technical Overview: Secure Identities”: https://www.plattform- i40.de/I40/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Publikation/secure-identities.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=9  23 See Plattform Industrie 4.0 (2018) “RAMI4.0 – a reference framework for digitalisation”: https://www.plattform- i40.de/I40/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Publikation/rami40-an-introduction.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  14  encompassing a variety of industrial areas. Figure 3 illustrates how Smart Manufacturing is related to  Industry 4.0 and other technologies in use.  ENISA defines Smart Manufacturing as “next-generation industrial manufacturing processes and systems  built on emerging information and communication technologies in line with Industry 4.0, such as additive  manufacturing, advanced analytics and IT/OT integration”. This new term describes systems that – by using  connected devices and sensors – attempt to maximise capabilities such as cost, delivery, flexibility and  quality by using advanced technologies that promote rapid flow and widespread use of digital information24.  Smart Manufacturing combines some of the functionalities of earlier manufacturing models, while  introducing its own new capabilities included advanced decision-making. Together with collaborative supply  chains, organisations may quickly adapt to market changes and disruptions.  To achieve innovation and the desired enhanced capabilities, Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing benefit  from various technologies (see Figure 4), such as:   IIoT end devices  Devices that have various capabilities, such as sensing, actuating, storing and/or processing data and  that exchange data over the network.   Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication  Technologies that facilitate direct communication between devices in the network without human  assistance.   Big data analytics  Process of examining vast amounts of various types of data sets generated in real time by smart sensors,  devices, log files, video and audio.   Advanced Robotics  Advanced industrial robots designed for complex tasks with smart capabilities, such as the ability to learn  from their errors and improve their performance.   Artificial Intelligence (AI)  Algorithms that enable computers and digital machines to perform tasks typically associated with  intelligent human beings.   Machine Learning (ML)  Algorithms that enable computers to act and improve their ability to predict without being explicitly  programmed.   Predictive Maintenance  Solutions that monitor the condition of equipment predicting when the failure may occur to perform  maintenance effectively at the lowest possible frequency.   Real time monitoring  Technologies that enable collection and aggregation of security data from system components and  monitoring and analysis of events that occur in the network.   Advanced loss analytics  Methods for analysis of various types of losses that may occur in a Smart Manufacturing environment  with the objective to eliminate or reduce them.   Cloud Computing  Solutions enabling access to shared sets of resources such as networks, servers and applications with  minimal requirements concerning managerial effort and service provider interaction.  24 See NIST (2016) “Current Standards Landscape for Smart Manufacturing Systems”:  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2016/NIST.IR.8107.pdf  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  15   Additive Manufacturing  Technologies that enable the creation of objects of various geometric shapes by adding material, e.g. 3D  printing or rapid prototyping.   Augmented reality  Technologies that modify the perception of the real-world environment, for example technologies used  in Smart Manufacturing to improve the efficiency of manual assembly tasks.  Figure 4: Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing capabilities  The notions of Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing are rather complex. Based on the responses received  by the subject matter experts in interviews and analysis of relevant publications, ENISA has identified the  following main elements:   ICS (Industrial Control Systems) – This group consists of control systems, such as SCADA (supervisory  control and data acquisition) and DCS (distributed control systems), as well as other control system  elements and devices, such as PLCs (programmable logic controllers) and HMIs (human machine  interfaces). Various control components within the system cooperate with each other to achieve a  specified control objective, e.g. manufacturing a product or desired state that is within pre-set  parameters such as keeping the flow of a liquid in a pipe within the bounds of the desired flow rate,  pressure or temperature, respectively. Additionally, ICSs may contain remote diagnostics and  maintenance tools.   IIoT End Devices – These devices have various capabilities, such as sensing, actuating, storing and/or  processing information. What distinguishes them from traditional devices such as sensors and actuators  that have been used in industrial applications for years is the fact that IIoT End Devices exchange data  over the network. In Smart Manufacturing environments, by making large amounts of new types of data  available, they contribute to streamlining production.   Manufacturing and business processes – This group consists of activities that lead to achieving a certain  goal, in this case obtaining a final product from raw materials or components. These processes include  technological procedures that may vary considerably depending on the characteristics of the company,  as well as organisational processes, which enable the whole company to operate successfully.  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  16   Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning – In Smart Manufacturing, due to the collection of enormous  amounts of data from industrial process, various ML and AI algorithms are utilised for analysis. Artificial  Intelligence transforms manufacturing by making it easily adaptable without having to spend long hours  to reprogram industrial robots, enabling predictive maintenance and increasing flexibility.25   Control systems communication networks and their components – This group includes networks,  network devices and industrial protocols. Networks play a significant role in a Smart Manufacturing  ecosystem since they allow different nodes to exchange data and information with each other via a data  link. Networks in control systems communication include serial and digital links to transfer inputs and  outputs to/from end devices. Network devices include gateways, routers, switches, etc. Typical examples  of industrial communication protocols include (but are not limited to): e.g. HART26, Modbus TCP/IP27,  OPC28 and OPC-UA29.  Security Challenges  The numerous benefits of adopting Industry 4.0 technologies and making manufacturing Smart go hand in  hand with significant security challenges. A recent survey revealed that stakeholders are becoming aware of  this problem, as 65% of companies believe that OT/ICS cybersecurity risks are more likely with IoT  technologies30. The following detail the generic security challenges that Smart Manufacturing and Industry  4.0 face:   Vulnerable components – Along with the fourth industrial revolution, the new Internet of Things (IoT)  landscape has emerged with millions of connected devices globally. That is why securing IoT in Smart  Manufacturing entails affording protection to an enormous number of connected assets. What is more,  IoT cybersecurity is not an isolated concept; it is interconnected with a number of security disciplines,  e.g. IT security, OT security and physical safety making this landscape even broader. As a result of shifting  from closed to connected cyber-physical systems, Smart Manufacturing companies need to handle the  issue of the typical vulnerabilities in those systems. In industrial environments this may pose a  considerable challenge since most systems of this type were not designed with cybersecurity in mind31  and thus vulnerabilities in this hardware are becoming more and more common32.   Management of processes – In addition to the large attack surface in terms of connected devices, a  multitude of complex processes involved in Smart Manufacturing should also be considered.  Management of processes with cybersecurity in mind poses a challenge for Industry 4.0 companies,  especially since functionality and production efficiency are usually seen as having a higher priority than  cybersecurity.   Increased connectivity – Manufacturing processes need to interact with objects and environments on a  global scale and systems used in Smart Manufacturing need to enable collaboration across multiple  25 See TOPBOTS (2017) “Future Factories: How AI enables smart manufacturing”:  https://medium.com/topbots/future-factories-how-ai-enables-smart-manufacturing-c1405f4ec0e6  26 See HART (Highway Addressable Remote Transducer Protocol):  https://www.fieldcommgroup.org/technologies/hart  27 See MODBUS TCP/IP Specification: http://www.modbus.org/specs.php  28 See OPC (Open Platform Communications): https://opcfoundation.org/about/what-is-opc/  29 See OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA): https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/  30 See Kaspersky Lab (2018) “Worried about IoT, but hit by malware: Kaspersky Lab reveals industrial organization  pain points”: https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2018_ics-cybersecurity  31 See Hongmei He (2017) “Security Challenges on the Way Towards Smart Manufacturing”:  https://www.iotsecurityfoundation.org/security-challenges-on-the-way-towards-smart-manufacturing/  32 See Positive Technologies (2018) “ICS SECURITY: 2017 IN REVIEW”:  https://www.ptsecurity.com/upload/corporate/ww-en/analytics/ICS-Security-2017-eng.pdf  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  17  organisations. One of the biggest challenges for higher connectivity is that security can exert a direct  impact on safety.   IT/OT convergence – Industrial control systems ceased to be isolated once the incorporation of IT  components in the ICS domain become a common practice. Converging with IT network-enabled  organisations simplified the management of complex environments while also introducing new security  risks. Managing IT/OT integration is a significant challenge. The contributing factors include insecure  network connections (internal and external), utilisation of technologies with known vulnerabilities that  introduce previously unknown risks into the OT environment, and insufficient understanding of  requirements for ICS environments. Holistic security must cover digital twin and physical implementation.   Supply chain complexity – Companies that manufacture products or solutions are very rarely able to  produce every part of the product itself and usually need to rely on third parties’ components. Developing  technologically sophisticated products results in an extremely complex supply chain with a large number  of people and organisations involved, thereby making it highly demanding in terms of management. Not  being able to track every component to its source means not being able to ensure product security, which  is only as secure as its weakest link.   Legacy industrial control systems – Legacy hardware is a significant barrier to adoption of the Industrial  Internet of Things by over a third of the respondents according to a recent survey33. Manufacturers build  new systems on top of legacy systems, and this may result in outdated protection measures and contain  unknown vulnerabilities that have been inactive for years. Adding new IoT devices to outdated hardware  raises concerns that it may allow attackers to find a new way to compromise systems.   Insecure protocols – Manufacturing components communicate over private industrial networks using  specific protocols. In modern network environments, these protocols often fail to ensure proper  protection against cyber-threats. According to a recent report, 4 of the 5 least secure protocols are ICS- specific34.   Human factors – Adopting new technologies means that factory workers and engineers have to work  with new types of data, networks and systems in novel ways. They are unaware of the risks associated  with gathering, handling and analysing that data and can thus become an easy target for attackers. This  is becoming all the more disturbing given that the industry most targeted by phishing emails in 2016 was  Manufacturing35.   Unused functionalities – Industrial machines are designed to offer a large number of functions and  services, many of which may not be necessary for operation. In industrial environments, machines or  their selected components often have access to unused functionalities that may considerably expand the  potential attack area and become gateways for the attackers. .   Safety aspects – The presence of actuators that act on the physical world makes safety aspects very  relevant in IoT and Smart Manufacturing. Security for safety emerges as an objective of paramount  importance.   Security updates – Applying security updates to IoT is extremely challenging, since the particularity of the  user interfaces available to users does not allow traditional update mechanisms. Securing those  mechanisms is in itself a daunting task, especially considering Over-The-Air updates. In OT environments  in particular, applying updates may be challenging since this operation needs to be scheduled and  performed during downtime.  33 See World Economic Forum (2015) “Industrial Internet of Things: Unleashing the Potential of Connected Products  and Services”: http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEFUSA_IndustrialInternet_Report2015.pdf  34 See Synopsys (2017) “State of Fuzzing 2017”: https://www.synopsys.com/content/dam/synopsys/sig- assets/reports/state-of-fuzzing-2017.pdf  35 See NTT Security (2017) “Global Threat Intelligence Report 2017”: https://www.nttsecurity.com/en-us/gtir-2017  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  18   Secure product lifecycle – Device security should be a subject of consideration through the product’s  entire lifecycle, even end-of-life/end-of-support of the machine.  High-level reference model  Smart Manufacturing environments consisting of a large number of elements can seem unduly complicated.  To provide a better explanation of this concept, a high-level reference model based on the Purdue Model  (i.e. the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture36 developed by Theodore J. Williams and members of the  Industry-Purdue University Consortium for Computer Integrated Manufacturing, as referenced in ISA-9537)  tailored to the scope of this project has been proposed (see Figure 5).  Figure 5: High-level reference model  The presented concept divides Smart Manufacturing environment into 6 layers. These layers are arranged  in order, with the lowest one being the manufacturing processes (Layer 0), followed by devices, systems and  services (Layers 1-5). Levels 1 and 2 represent OT layers. IIoT devices fall into the Layer 1 of this model. Layer  4 corresponds to the IT part of a corporation, while Layer 3 is an intermediate layer with systems classified  in-between IT and OT. IIoT Platform utilisation was included as part of the Layer 3. The highest layer, which  did not appear in the Purdue Model, is specific for Smart Manufacturing, where external services are  commonly used.  The objective of the reference model is to provide a general overview of relationships between the most  important assets (see section 2.4) and components (see section 2.1). Grey arrows represent simplified  communication paths between larger groups in the model (i.e. on the left of the picture). Additionally, new  36 See The Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture by T.J. Williams:  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166361594900175  37 See ISA95: https://www.isa.org/isa95/  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  19  communication paths introduced by Industry 4.0 and enabled by the incorporation of IIoT devices into the  network, e.g. communication between IIoT devices and direct connection of IIoT devices to IIoT platform,  have been added on top of the model with yellow arrows to emphasise their criticality in terms of security  and privacy. In what follows, we briefly described the levels of the reference model.  Level 0: Manufacturing processes and equipment (machines, robots)  This is the lowest level of the IIoT environment where manufacturing processes executed by smart machines  and robots take place. These processes are measured and controlled by devices and systems in higher layers  of the reference model.  Level 1: IIoT devices – sensors and actuators  This layer comprises IIoT devices that measure system parameters (IIoT sensors) and execute specific actions  (IIoT actuators). Data is transmitted between IIoT devices and control systems (Level 2) as well as IIoT  platform (Level 3). Level 1 also includes SIS.  Level 2: Industrial control devices and systems  These are devices and systems that control the industrial processes (Layer 0) based on information from IIoT  devices (Level 1). They include controllers (PLCs, RTUs), distributed control systems (DCS), operator panels  (HMI) and supervision and control systems (SCADA).  Level 3: Manufacturing operations systems and IIoT Platform  This is an intermediate layer between OT and IT environment. It comprises systems that are used to manage  manufacturing processes, e.g. Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), Historian, Warehouse Management  System (WMS) and Track & Trace systems. These systems communicate with both OT and IT environments.  Distinguishing this layer makes it possible to control this communication and prevents direct communication  between the OT and IT layers. Level 3 of the model also includes an IIoT platform that analyses and manages  data from the manufacturing and control processes provided by IIoT devices. It is closely related to the OT  environment and provides information to the systems in the layer above.  Level 4: Enterprise operations systems  These IT systems support a company’s operations at an enterprise level. They include supply chain and  production management and planning. In contrary to level 2 systems, they do not operate in real-time. This  layer includes the following systems (this list is not meant to be exhaustive): Enterprise Resource Planning  (ERP), Supply Chain Management (SCM), Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP), Customer Relationship  Management (CRM), Material Requirements Planning (MRP), Transaction Processing System (TPS) and  Executive Support System (ESS).  Level 5: Third Parties’ services  As mentioned before, reliance on Third Parties' services is an inherent characteristic of Smart Manufacturing.  For this reason, to better reflect Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing specifics, we decided to place an  additional layer on top of the ISA 95 model to include Third Parties services. These services may take  different forms, e.g. Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service  (IaaS).  Asset taxonomy  To focus on the details of IoT security in Smart Manufacturing it is essential to start from identification and  decomposition of assets of such vast and complex environments. Here we provide an overview of the key  asset groups and assets that need to be protected. Industry 4.0/Smart manufacturing assets are classified  into key groups depicted in Figure 6 and described in Table 1. The levels assigned to each asset group in the  table correspond to the levels defined in section 2.3, i.e. High-level reference model depicted in Figure 5. It  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  20  should be noted that the lowest level of the taxonomy is indicative and not exhaustive. For instance, not all  sensor types or network protocols are listed, just some representative ones.

There are  sensors for many purposes, such as to measure temperature, motion,  vibration etc.  Safety Instrumented  Systems (SIS)  These systems consist of sensors, logic solvers, and final control elements  (actuators) whose objective is to bring the process to a safe state in case of  a violation of predetermined conditions.  Actuators  These devices interact with the environment by moving or controlling a  mechanism or system. In order to do so, they convert energy (e.g. electrical,  hydraulic or pneumatic) into motion.  ICS  Level 2  PLCs  These specialised industrial computers are used to automate control  functions within the industrial network. Typically, they are equipped with  additional plug-in modules, such as Input / Output modules to connect  sensors and actuators.  RTUs  These devices are used typically in substations or remote locations.  Their objective, similar to PLCs, is to monitor field parameters and send data  to the central station.  DCS  These control systems distribute intelligence, i.e. management logic, about  the controlled process instead of relying on a single central unit.  SCADA  These systems are used to collect data from industrial assets and processes,  their visualisation, supervision and control. Such workstations usually  operate on the Windows operating system.  Human Machine  Interfaces  These control panels and dashboards allow the operators to monitor and  control PLCs, RTUs and other electronic devices.  ICS communication  networks &  components  Levels 1 - 3  Routers  These networking devices forward data packets between different networks  in industrial environments and IoT ecosystems.  IIoT Gateways  These network nodes are used to interface with another network from an  IoT environment using different protocols. Gateways may provide protocol  translators, fault isolators, etc., to provide system interoperability.  Switches  These network components filter and forward packets within the local area  network.  Wireless Access Points These components enable wireless devices to connect to a wired network  using Wi-Fi, or related standards.  Firewall These network security devices or systems control network traffic between  networks or between a host and a network based on predetermined rules.  Networks They allow the different nodes of an IoT ecosystem to exchange data and  information with one another, via a data link. There are different kinds of  networks related to their spatial coverage, including e.g. (W)LANs, (W)PANs,  PANs and (W)WANs, among others.  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  23  ASSET GROUP ASSETS DESCRIPTION  Protocols They define the set of rules on how two or more IoT devices communicate  over a given channel. There are many communication protocols, which can  be either wired or wireless.  Power Supply It supplies electric power to an IoT device and its internal components. The  power source can be external and wired or a battery integrated in the device  itself.

User Information This includes information such as name, role, permissions, etc.  Decision Making  Algorithms  Levels 2-5  Artificial Intelligence and  Machine Learning  These terms describe the ability of a machine (e.g. computer, robot, etc.) to  perform tasks typical for intelligent beings. In Smart Manufacturing, where  enormous amounts of data is collected from industrial process, various ML  and AI algorithms can be utilised for analysis.  Cloud Computing  Services38  Levels 3-5  These services enable swift universal network access to a shared set of resources such as networks, servers  and applications with minimal requirement of management effort and service provider interaction.  Big Data Analytics  Levels 3-5  In Smart Manufacturing, this term describes the process of examining vast amounts of various data sets  generated in real time by smart sensors, devices, log files, video and audio. This data is created on all  automation levels including manufacturing plant, transaction applications, etc. Big Data is analysed to  uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, trends and other useful information that can help make  more-informed and deliberate decisions.  Advanced Robotics  Level 0  Smart Robots, Automated  guided vehicles  These sophisticated industrial robots are designed to perform complex tasks  with smart capabilities, such as the ability to learn from errors and improve  their performance.  Real time  monitoring and  security tools  Levels 3-5  SIEM  These applications are utilised to collect and aggregate security data from  various system components and render them in the form of meaningful  information via a single interface.  IDS/IPS  These systems enable automatic monitoring of the events that occur in a  computer system or network and their analysis for signs of possible  incidents. In addition, IPS may execute actions in an attempt to stop  detected incidents.  Software and  Licenses  Levels 2-5  Program (code)  These programs are written for devices within an IIoT ecosystem to achieve  specific technological objectives, including PLC logic, SCADA applications,  HMI applications, industrial robot programs, etc.  38 See ENISA’s study on Cloud Computing, “Towards secure convergence of Cloud and IoT”:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/towards-secure-convergence-of-cloud-and-iot  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  24  ASSET GROUP ASSETS DESCRIPTION  Operating System  This term refers to a system that manages computer hardware resources  and provides common services for other computer programs to run.  Mobile application  These programs run on mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones,  which are used for remote supervision and control of a process (e.g. mobile  SCADA client applications), equipment maintenance and other tasks (e.g.  warehouse inventory).  Antivirus  This term refers to a software that monitors a computer or network to  identify malware, prevent it from infecting devices and clean infected  devices.  Firmware  This term refers to a class of software stored on a device’s read-only memory  and provides instructions on how the device should operate.  During  execution, it cannot be dynamically written or modified.  Servers and  Systems  Levels 3-5  Historians These software systems gather data from industrial devices and store them  in specialized databases.  Application Servers These computers host applications, e.g. user workstations’ applications.  Database Servers These servers are used as repositories for event information provided by  sensors, agents, and management servers.  Enterprise operations  systems (e.g. ERP, CRM)  These systems integrate information from various parts of an organization  (i.e. manufacturing, distribution, financials, human resources, etc.). They  also provide a connection between organization and its customers and  suppliers.  Manufacturing  operations systems  (e.g. MES)  These systems automate production control and process automation using  network computing, bridging the gap between business and plant-floor.  These systems are used for downloading instructions, scheduling and  uploading information on production results.  Mobile devices  Level 3  Tablets, smartphones These portable devices can be operated by hand. They run mobile  applications enabling operators to perform various tasks.  Personnel  All levels39  Operators, maintenance  staff, third parties  This asset group refers to all the individuals who have physical or remote  access to the OT system. People are inseparable elements of manufacturing  environments and hence must be taken into consideration when defining  critical assets in terms of security. All the people with access to an OT  environment can introduce malware to the system (intentionally or  unintentionally), become targets of phishing or cause damage to the system  and compromise its security in a variety of ways. On the other hand, people  require particular protection, as their privacy and physical safety may be  endangered in the event of security incident.  Table 1: Asset taxonomy  Figure 7 provides a view of the criticality of the main assets described in the asset taxonomy, based on the  responses provided by subject matter experts during their interviews. These interviews involved a structured  39 Indicated levels correspond to the concept of layers as explained in subchapter 2.3 High-level reference model.  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  25  questionnaire in which one of the questions referred to an in-depth evaluation of the main IIoT / Smart  Manufacturing assets according to their criticality. The experts could select any number of assets they  considered the most important in terms of cybersecurity of the IIoT ecosystem. The figures presented below  correspond to the percentage of experts who selected a given option.  Figure 7: Asset criticality  The figure shows that stakeholders consider ICS, i.e. PLCs, RTUs, DCS and SCADA systems to be the most  critical assets for Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0. Such a choice comes as no surprise as these systems  control and supervise industrial processes and their functioning is therefore indispensable for proper  execution and safety of production. As the study revealed, in terms of criticality, industrial control systems  are followed by IoT devices, notably IIoT gateways, sensors and actuators. Over half of the respondents  selected each of these types of assets confirming that the introduction of new connected devices to OT  environments is in fact a security challenge and generates a need for additional protection.  Among the other answers provided by the respondents, the human factor (e.g. operators, maintenance staff  and third parties) was highlighted. People were identified as critical assets as they may become targets of  phishing campaigns and their errors can allow malware to penetrate a system. Moreover, stakeholders  noted that, apart from the assets themselves, asset management is of great importance. To secure the assets  properly, companies should be aware of the devices and solutions they have, where they are located and  how secure they are, i.e. what type of protection mechanisms/security measures have been applied.  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  26  3. Threats and risk analysis  Threats taxonomy  Industry 4.0 environments face numerous security challenges caused by a large number of factors and hence  they need to be prepared to handle a wide variety of cybersecurity threats. In addition to threats related to  IoT technologies, Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing companies are likely to be affected by additional  threats, which are typical in OT and IT environments. A good illustration of this is the recent large-scale  ransomware attack called NotPetya40, as more that 50% of the companies hit by this attack were industrial  companies41.  In accordance with with ENISA Threat Taxonomy42, we have developed a threat taxonomy focused on  Industry 4.0, which is depicted in Figure 8 and described in detail in Table 2.  40 See the list of indicative incidents in Annex A:D.  41 See Kaspersky Lab (2017) “More than 50% of organizations attacked by ExPetr (Petya) cryptolocker are industrial  companies”: https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/alerts/2017/06/29/more-than-50-percent-of-organizations-attacked-by- expetr-petya-cryptolocker-are-industrial-companies/  42 See ENISA (2016) “ENISA Threat Taxonomy A tool for structuring threat information”:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat- landscape/etl2015/enisa-threat-taxonomy-a-tool-for-structuring-threat-information  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  27  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  28  Figure 8: Industry 4.0 threat taxonomy  CATEGORY THREAT DESCRIPTION ASSETS AFFECTED  Nefarious  activity / Abuse  Denial of Service  A Denial of Service attack can be bi-directional:  It can target an IIoT system resulting in system  unavailability and production disruption caused  by a massive number of requests sent to the  system.

For each proposed attack  scenario, experts selected their perceived criticality level (not important, of low, medium or high importance  or as crucial). Analysis of the experts’ answers is the source of the results presented in Table 3.  ATTACK SCENARIOS SEVERITY  1. Against the connection between the controller (e.g. DCS, PLC) and the actuators High  2. Against sensors (modification of measured values / states, their reconfiguration,  etc.) High  3.

Highly personalised attacks using Artificial Intelligence Technologies Medium - High  Table 3: IIoT attack scenarios  For each attack scenario, a brief description detailing the potential impact and related threats based on the  Threats taxonomy (section 3.1) can be found below.  1. Against the connection between the controller (e.g. DCS, PLC) and the actuators  This type of attack takes place when an attacker injects and executes code or sends (manipulated) data by a  compromised system using a line that is not monitored.   Impact: Manipulation or loss of control, damage of the batch/product and infrastructure.   Related threats: Internal and external sabotage, manipulation of hardware & software, control device  configuration manipulation.  2. Against sensors (modification of measured values / states, their reconfiguration, etc.)  The measurement data is manipulated in the end devices, e.g. by breaking into the sensor and modifying its  firmware or configuration, such as measurements adjustment etc.  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  33   Impact: Making the wrong operator decisions based on manipulated data. Conducting the process based  on incorrect measurements. Measurements covered by the regulations will not be evaluated properly.   Related threats: Modification of information, sabotage, manipulation of hardware & software,  manipulation of transmitted sensor data.  3. Against actuators (suppressing their state, modifying their configuration)  Manipulation of the actuators’ configuration/parameters making them use wrong configurations, thresholds  or data, and therefore affecting their normal behaviour by sabotaging their normal operation settings.   Impact: It varies depending on the actuators affected. It can affect production processes.   Related threats: Manipulation of hardware & software, failure or malfunction of a sensor / actuator,  failure or malfunction of a control system (PLC, RTU, DCS).  4. Against the information being transmitted via the network  The attack aims to manipulate the data at the network layer (layer 2,3,4 model OSI). At the level of layer  5,6,7 of the OSI model, i.e. controller and control system (DCS, SCADA), data values seem to be correct.  Manipulation can be detected by network layer traffic monitoring.   Impact: It varies depending on the data manipulated. It can affect production process or cause damage  to the process, e.g. manipulation of furnace temperature that can cause explosion.   Related threats: APT, Man-in-the-Middle attack, sabotage, malware.  5. Against IIoT gateways  An attacker tries to compromise an IIoT gateway, potentially compromising the entire environment. It can  be quite successful if weak/vulnerable protocols or default passwords or protocols are used. This type of  attack comprises different stages/phases and it is usually launched in a covert manner. It should be noted  that this type of attack should be taken into account over a device’s entire lifecycle.   Impact: An attacker gains access to the network and data including access to the devices, systems and  network equipment. It can be the first stage of exploitation of the whole system and its components.   Related threats: Password attacks, exploit kits, abuse of personal data, malware and DDoS.  6. Manipulation of remote controller devices (e.g. operating panels, smartphones)  An attacker can break into a device that is far away from the control system (distributed environment). Often  such devices are intended for local control and are not monitored on an ongoing basis. The acquisition of  such a device is a great threat to the possibility of infiltration of the entire network as well as causing damage  to the equipment, where it will take a long time to obtain this information and could therefore magnify the  damage.   Impact: Gaining access to the system and full access to the control layer as well as engineering tools and  changes. It can cause dangerous changes to the IoT environment.   Related threats: Password attacks, software vulnerabilities exploitation, session hijacking, disclosure of  information.  7. Against the Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS)  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  34  One of the most dangerous attacks is against systems that are ultimately supposed to protect the  environment, human life and/or companies against large financial losses. Taking over the control system or  any manipulation of this system can lead to the destruction of the installation or in the least dangerous case  to the unplanned interruption of the process. An example of such attack is the recent Triton attack43.   Impact: Compromise of SIS, manipulation or interruption of SIS may affect many people, cause  environmental issues and even extend to other systems, affecting their operations or even disabling  them.   Related threats: Malware, sabotage, remote controller devices manipulation, APT.  8. Malware  These attacks are carried out by a malicious code that spreads over the network. It can give access to the  victim's data. Since these attacks are malware-based, they can be avoided by updating/patching vulnerable  devices. This can also be done outside the IIoT ecosystem. The problem regarding IIoT is the difficulty to  update/patch the different devices - some of them do not offer the ability to be updated or patched.   Impact: There are many possible targets for malware within IIoT – an attacker could take control of a  smart thermostat in the middle of winter and not turn on the heat, or he or she could hold power grids  or hospitals systems, etc., putting people’s safety at risk.   Related threats: Exploit kits, malware, DDoS, password attacks.  9. DDoS attack with (IoT) botnets  This type of attack does not target IIoT devices themselves, but instead uses them to attack other devices,  not necessarily IIoT devices. Firstly, malware automatically finds vulnerable Internet of Things devices,  infecting and conscripting them into a botnet, which then can be used to mount DDoS attacks, flooding the  target's servers with malicious traffic.   Impact: The target device or service is flooded with malicious traffic, taking it down.   Related threats: Exploit kits, DDoS and malware.  10. Stepping stones attacks (e.g. against the Cloud)  This type of attack is a common way to launch anonymous attacks. They are often used by network intruders  to hide their identities, since they launch attacks not from their own computer but from intermediary hosts  they have previously compromised.   Impact: If an attacker launches a stepping stone attack, he or she could compromise a collection of hosts,  using them as stepping stones to relay attack commands.   Related threats: APT, DDoS, malware.  11. Human error-based and social engineering attacks  43 FireEye (2017) “Attackers Deploy New ICS Attack Framework “TRITON” and Cause Operational Disruption to Critical  Infrastructure”: https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/12/attackers-deploy-new-ics-attack- framework-triton.html  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  35  This type of attack is usually the gateway to launch other types of attacks; it is a means to an end. Attacks or  human-errors are used to gain unauthorised privileged access to a system, which can lead to the installation  of other malicious content or backdoors or even physical access to the devices. It is used as part of an attack,  regardless of whether the target is a single system/device or a whole network or facility. It is difficult to  detect these attacks due to non-technical character, and it is much easier to detect the suspicious actions in  the environment based on very good awareness trainings for employees.   Impact: If successful, the social engineering attack creates an entry point to a system or facilities, in some  cases with elevated privileges. A human error-based attack could cause the system to crash or become  unstable. This attack is commonly used as part of a larger, sophisticated attack, which could be simple  data theft or a complex APT.   Related threats: Erroneous use or administration of devices and systems, unintentional change of data  or configuration in the OT system, physical damage to equipment, theft of intellectual values.  12. Highly personalised attacks using Artificial Intelligence Technologies (AIT)  Attacks to identify patterns for reconciliation or direct attack on IIoT systems. Their main threat is the use of  often potentially insignificant information. With the application of AIT attackers can combine specific data  obtained from the Internet and explicit data to find a hole in the security.   Impact: These attacks can be very personalised and target particular people, e.g. system administrators.  The development of communication throughout the IIoT ecosystem could also be a target. Such an  attack may be the first attack or one of the subsequent phases of an attack.   Related threats: Loss of data, network reconnaissance.  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  36  4. Security measures and good practices  Security Measure categorisation  Development of Security Measures for IoT in Smart Manufacturing was one of the focal points of this study.  The idea behind it was to provide guidelines and recommendations for Operators, Manufacturers and Users  of Industrial IoT that, if applied, can help prevent or properly respond to potential cyberattacks and ensure  overall security and safety of the industrial IoT environment. As part of this study, a considerable effort was  expended to identify all the relevant aspects related to this issue.  Firstly, extensive desktop research was conducted. Thorough analysis of relevant sources (listed in Annex C)  allowed distinguishing frequently mentioned topics in IIoT security. These topics were then aggregated to  create an initial list of security domains. Final set of domains was clarified and adapted based on the  interviews conducted with the stakeholders resulting in a list of 20 domains that provide a comprehensive  view of the Industry 4.0 landscape and indicate areas that require protection.  To organise the domains in a logical manner, they were classified into three main groups:   Policies   Organisational practices   Technical practices  These groups provide a high-level division and are in line with the classification of the ENISA “Baseline  Security Recommendations for IoT” study.  Figure 9: Good practices overview  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  37  Policies  This first group of Security Measures mostly refers to policies and procedures that should be established  within organisations to help ensure a good level of cybersecurity, especially where IIoT solutions are  concerned. In addition, privacy issues have been covered in the context of manufacturers who should ensure  that their solutions do not violate privacy regulations, and operators, who should be sensitised to privacy  related risks and made aware of how to utilise IIoT devices without exposing users’ personal information.  4.2.1 Security by design  Security measures which should be applied from the very beginning of product development.   PS-01: Treat IoT cybersecurity as a cycle, not as an end-to-end process, adopting a security by design  approach from the perspective of the devices and infrastructure at every step of a smart manufacturing  system development lifecycle (SDLC).   PS-02: Address cybersecurity through embedded features of endpoints rather than only at the network  level.   PS-03: Equip, as deemed appropriate after a security and safety assessment, even the most basic  connected devices holding very limited processing capabilities (e.g. actuators, converters) with  identification and authentication features and ensure compatibility with IAM class solutions.   PS-04: Perform risk and threat analysis involving cybersecurity experts from the very early stages of the  design process of the device to find out which security features will be necessary.   PS-05: In each design document include a chapter addressing the security of all the information and  control systems in the industrial environment.  4.2.2 Privacy by design  Security measures related to privacy and protection of personal data. These measures should be applied  from the first stages of product development.   PS-06: Address privacy related issues based on applicable local and international regulations, such as the  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)44.   PS-07: Define the scope of the data that will be processed by the device as well as the objective of this  processing during the design phase, avoiding collecting or unnecessarily providing sensitive data.   PS-08: Establish a physical location of data storage and define between which organisations data will be  transferred restricting access to collected personal data only to authorised individuals.   PS-09: Conduct a Privacy Impact Analysis (PIA) for the data that will be processed by the device.   PS-10: Separate data that can be used to identify an individual from other information and ensure its  security, e.g. through encryption of any personal data transferred within the IIoT environment.  4.2.3 Asset Management  Security measures regarding asset discovery, administration, monitoring and maintenance.   PS-11: Utilise tools supporting asset management that are able dynamically to discover, identify and  enumerate assets specific to the organisation and industrial environment.   PS-12: Ensure that your company has a consistent and up-to-date asset inventory.  44 General Data Protection Regulation, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/2016-05-04  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  38   PS-13: In complex industrial environments with legacy systems, use passive monitoring devices wherever  feasible or precede the implementation with a testing phase if you consider active monitoring tools.   PS-14: Use a centralised asset inventory for the entire computerised environment inside a manufacturing  plant.   PS-15: Consider secure administration of assets with management of the infrastructure and security  devices via a dedicated management network.   PS-16: Introduce a new device into the system only according to an established, accepted and  communicated change management process.   PS-17: Avoid the usage of removable devices disabling the USB ports if there is no accepted business  requirement.  4.2.4 Risk and Threat Management  Security measures regarding the recommended approach to the process of risk and threat management  adapted to Industry 4.0 environment.   PS-18: Adopt an approach to risk management dedicated to Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing  considering new parameters, threats and attack scenarios.   PS-19: For critical infrastructures in manufacturing environments, establish a number of risk management  areas completely aligned with corporate, safety and environmental sides. Assess and characterise  threats, vulnerabilities and protection measures against those risk management areas.   PS-20: Establish risk and threat management process according to the individual needs and security  requirements of your company.   PS-21: Perform risk analysis which includes cybersecurity aspects at least annually. Also, integrate it with  other processes, such as change management, incident handling and vulnerability management. The risk  assessment should cover technical and procedural testing of effectiveness of the security policies and  process.   PS-22: Consider incorporating threat intelligence process within the threat management approach of  your company relying on various sources of information and sharing information with trusted industry  partners, ISACs and CERTs.   PS-23: From an organisational perspective, monitor selected threats and determine their impact on  systems by performing a risk analysis.   PS-24: Regarding the Risk Management process, adopt two different approaches at the same time: top- down, addressing cybersecurity from the organisation-wide perspective, and bottom-up45, providing a  very granular and detailed view on the company’s situation.  Organisational practices  Organisation principles and governance are indispensable factors that are usually critical in terms of  company security. The following Security Measures explain how Smart Manufacturing and other Industry  4.0 companies should operate, what organisational rules and responsibilities they should establish and  follow and what approach they should adopt towards their employees and third party contractors to handle  effectively cybersecurity incidents, manage vulnerabilities and ensure security of IIoT solutions throughout  their lifecycle.  45 See more information on the top-down and bottom-up approach in Annex B:.  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  39  4.3.1 Endpoints lifecycle  Security measures related to security at different stages of product (including end devices and  infrastructure) lifecycle, including the procurement process, supply chain, handover phase, exploitation  and end-of-life.   OP-01: Focus on the security of software and hardware during every stage of the endpoint lifecycle.   OP-02: Take into account security considerations throughout the supply chain.   OP-03: Consider security aspects during the overall procurement process defining security measures and  requirements tailored to particular devices/solutions.   OP-04: Conduct cybersecurity acceptance tests against technical specification during different validation  activities or stages of the product lifecycle.   OP-05: During the handover phase of the project implementation process, properly build and transfer all  cybersecurity documentation, processes and procedures.  4.3.2 Security Architecture  Security measures regarding the architectural-based approach and establishment of security architecture.   OP-06: To ensure security in a computerised ecosystem, adopt a holistic architectural-based approach  and develop a risk-aligned security architecture based on business requirements.   OP-07: While defining security architecture, ensure that it comprises all relevant security aspects – from  organisational to physical implementation issues.   OP-08: Within the security architecture, allocate clear roles and responsibilities for security. Clearly  define and communicate roles for both OT systems and security processes.   OP-09: Integrate compliance enforcement controls to the established Security Architecture and ensure  that all products meet the requirements defined within it.  4.3.3 Incident handling  Security measures regarding the detection and response to incidents that may occur in Industry 4.0  environments.   OP-10: Define cyber incidents relevant for your organisation based on the company's area and range of  operation and classify them according to applicable standards.   OP-11: Consider creation of a Cybersecurity Operations Centre (SOC) consisting of OT and IT cybersecurity  specialists to support cybersecurity incidents dividing them into specific lines of support with appropriate  roles and responsibilities.   OP-12: Establish a process for incidents handling that consists of identification of affected assets,  identification and classification of vulnerabilities, escalation and notification.   OP-13: Detect and investigate promptly every unusual security related event.  4.3.4 Vulnerabilities management  Security measures on the vulnerability management process, related activities and vulnerability disclosure.   OP-14: Define a comprehensive vulnerability management process within the organisation that covers  utilisation of automatic and manual tools resulting from risk analysis.   OP-15: While eliminating vulnerabilities, begin from the most critical ones taking into account criticality  of assets and systems.   OP-16: Establish a comprehensive and well-defined process for disclosure of vulnerabilities.   OP-17: Conduct penetration tests of new IIoT solutions in a controlled environment or before / during  commissioning phase, and also regularly and after an important update of the system.  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  40   OP-18: Establish tight collaboration of OT and IT departments ensuring that their collaboration with  systems business owners, decision-making authorities and other stakeholders is effective as well.  4.3.5 Training and Awareness  Security measures regarding the recommended approach related to security training and raising  awareness of employees working with IIoT devices and systems.   OP-19: Adopt a holistic approach to security training and awareness of the employees, covering  employees on all levels of the organisation and addressing new Industry 4.0 related threats.   OP-20: Provide all newly hired employees with cybersecurity training before the start of the job.   OP-21: Ensure that security training is continuous, regular and frequently updated.   OP-22: Train users of IIoT on the secure usage of their devices explaining to them the technologies  deployed to protect IIoT devices and the ecosystem.   OP-23: Consider communicating with other companies on a sector level including the supply chain and  participate in international security infrastructures formed to enable discussion, cooperation and  intelligence sharing across organisations to improve security awareness.  4.3.6 Third Party Management  Security measures related to third party management and control of third party access.   OP-24: Strictly control access of third parties to a control or production layer only granting access on- demand, in a specified time window, for a specific purpose, and in a least privileged way.   OP-25: Do not provide a direct connection for the vendor to a system in a control or production layer.

Technical practices  Apart from implementing policies and organisational practices, security also needs to be addressed through  the appropriate technical capabilities of IIoT solutions and the environments where they are deployed. The  Technical Security Measures listed below constitute a last piece of the puzzle enabling Industry 4.0 and Smart  Manufacturing companies to improve their level of security. This section provides an overview of what  technical security measures should be implemented in the devices, as well as corresponding solutions and  how they should be implemented. We also discuss recommended methods for Smart Manufacturing  companies to ensure resilience of their infrastructure and continuity of production processes.  4.4.1 Trust and Integrity Management  Security measures that can help ensure the integrity and trustfulness of data and devices.   TM-01: Verify the integrity of the software before starting to run it ensuring that it comes from a reliable  source (signed by the vendor) and that it is obtained in a secure manner.   TM-02: Authorise all IIoT devices within the OT network utilising appropriate methods, e.g. digital  certificates/PKI.   TM-03: Define data exchange channels between IIoT devices in the form of a whitelist and choose only  secure channels whenever possible.   TM-04: Implement application whitelists and review the list at least annually and in case of a change to  the system.

Test the plans periodically and adapt them according to lessons learnt  from tests and actual security incidents.   TM-13: Define critical business and technological processes and determine to what extent they influence  business continuity.   TM-14: Perform threat and risk assessment and develop written procedures on how to return to the  normal – well-defined – state of operation tailored to the assessment’s results.   TM-15: Consider contingency planning preceded by risk analysis. Define contingency plans and test them  executing controlled exercises. Regularly review the plan and adjust it appropriately.   TM-16: In business continuity and recovery plans, include third party aspects.   TM-17: Define important parameters for your company’s business continuity, such as a recovery time  objective (RTO), recovery point objective (RPO), maximum tolerable outage (MTO) and minimum  business continuity objective (MBCO).  4.4.4 Machine-to-Machine security  Security measures regarding key storage, encryption, input validation and protection in Machine-to- Machine communications security.   TM-18: Store long-term service-layer keys (other than public keys) in a server-HSM residing in  infrastructure equipment.   TM-19: Establish a security association with proven and secure cryptographic algorithms between the  communicating entities to provide mutual authentication, integrity and confidentiality.   TM-20: Use communication protocols that include the functionality to detect if all or part of a message  is an unauthorised repeat of an earlier message.   TM-21: Use positive / whitelist input validation to protect against cross-site scripting and command  injection.  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  42  4.4.5 Data Protection  Security measures regarding protection of confidential data on various levels of an organisation and  management of access to data.   TM-22: Protect data at rest (both in volatile and non-volatile memory), in transit and in use.   TM-23: Categorise data related to the OT system based on risk analysis, assess its criticality and define  required security measures that will ensure proper level of security.   TM-24: Grant access to certain categories of data to Third Parties with least privilege and need-to-know  principles in mind and document this access.   TM-25: For data of high confidentiality implement encryption and key management so that the  information can be read only by authorised users and use data loss prevention solutions.   TM-26: Anonymise and secure any direct or indirect personal data processed within the company, e.g.  through role-based access control and encryption, having considered all relevant legal requirements.  4.4.6 Software/Firmware updates  Security measures regarding verification, testing and execution of patches.   TM-27: Verify endpoints' software/firmware authenticity and integrity and ensure tight control over the  update.   TM-28: Verify the source of the update and execute automatic update procedures only if they are based  on the risk analysis.   TM-29: Perform deployment of patches for the IIoT devices only after proving that no negative  consequences exist and test the patches in a test environment before implementing them in production.   TM-30: Allow Third Parties to perform patching only if they guarantee and are able to prove that the  patch has been tested and will not lead to any adverse consequences on the device or if they accept  liability for the update according to an applicable agreement.   TM-31: For control systems that cannot be updated, apply compensating measures.  4.4.7 Access Control  Security measures regarding the control of remote access, authentication, privileges, accounts and physical  access.   TM-32: Segregate remote access, i.e. develop a set of rules for control of the remote communication.   TM-33: Ensure minimal level of authentication for the IIoT devices and systems and ensure that  authorisation allows only for access to a certain segment of the system.   TM-34: Implement / Use multi-factor authentication capability in the IIoT solutions.   TM-35: Change default passwords and usernames during the commissioning / first use. Use strong  passwords and require the setting of a new password after a defined period.   TM-36: Apply the least privilege principle and ensure that in an environment with multiple users, roles  are properly segregated and approved by a proper person.   TM-37: Create individual accounts for every user whenever possible.   TM-38: Implement / Use an account lockout functionality in IIoT devices.   TM-39: In case of extensive and diversified networks with a large number of devices, adopt a Privilege  Access Management (PAM) solution.   TM-40: Within access control, consider aspects of physical access to buildings, areas, rooms and cabinets.  4.4.8 Networks, protocols and encryption  Security measures can help ensure security of communications through proper protocols implementation,  encryption and network segmentation.  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  43   TM-41: Secure communication channels related to IIoT solutions and encrypt communication in case of  important data, where technically possible.   TM-42: Segment industrial plants networks based on a pre-defined zoning model that includes  establishment of De-Militarised Zones (DMZ) and control of traffic between zones, e.g. according to the  Purdue Model.   TM-43: Follow the micro segmentation approach, i.e. build small islands of components within a single  network that communicate only with each other and control the network traffic between segments.   TM-44: If possible, isolate safety networks from business and control networks.   TM-45: For IIoT solutions implement proven-in-use protocols with known security capabilities, based on  standards and technical recommendations.

It serves as a foundation and  point of reference for the current study, which focuses on the in-depth exploration of cybersecurity aspects  within the specific area of IIoT and Industry 4.0.  Because this study relies on Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT, the adopted definitions and  connection with IoT are in line with ENISA’s general approach. Hereafter, the relation of IIoT to IoT is  explained. ENISA defines the Internet of Things (IoT) as “a cyber-physical ecosystem of interconnected  physical and potentially virtual sensors and actuators, which enable intelligent decision making.  Information lies at the heart of IoT, feeding into a continuous cycle of sensing, decision making, and  actions”.  Based on the criteria of business function, as illustrated in Figure 10, the Internet of Things can be divided  into Consumer IoT – which includes smart connected product platforms that add value to an individual  customer and, Industrial IoT - which corresponds to machine connectivity that increases asset performance,  product quality as well as traceability and accountability.  Figure 10: Consumer and Industrial IoT devices  The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) concept is associated with IoT focusing on digitising industries. IoT in  general is a much wider concept that includes a variety of consumer products, while IIoT is specific for IoT  used in OT (Operational Technology) environments. Characterised by similarities in terms of technology, IoT  systems are usually more focused on usability than safety. IIoT systems however need to meet the security  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  46  requirements specific to the OT environments resulting in differences in terms of business drivers and  characteristics46, as described in Table 4.

Safety Instrumented  System (SIS)  November 2017  The purpose of an SIS is to take immediate action when a critical process  goes some other way than planned e.g. if the pressure in a tank rises above  a predetermined level, SIS will activate valves to lower the pressure to  prevent an explosion. Disturbing this failsafe mechanism can have severe  physical consequences, especially in an industrial plant. One of these  systems was attacked in 2017 by Triton – an industry-targeted malware  designed to inflict severe damage. This was the first cyber-attack on a  Safety Instrumented System (SIS) ever recorded. After obtaining remote  access to a workstation, attackers infected SIS with malware. Using Zero- Day vulnerability, Triton managed to install itself on SIS, providing attackers  with full control. However, once in, the attackers “tripped” and triggered  the safety shut down of a process governed by SIS. This alarmed employees,  leading to detection of the malware and stopping the attack before it  caused any serious damage that would most probably have destroyed  infrastructure and halted production. 48 49  NotPetya - ransomware  created to cause damage June 2017  Just 6 weeks after WannaCry, a new global cyberattack emerged. Originally  targeted at Ukraine – its central bank, government and utilities (such as  electrical grids), it managed to disrupt people’s everyday life across the  country. Spreading further, NotPetya (also known as ExPetr, often referred  to as Petya) infected more than 200,000 computers worldwide and affected  mostly industrial companies such as Rosneft, Merck and Maersk. Using an  SMB protocol exploit to achieve initial infection it then tried to steal  credentials and take control of other machines on the network, including  those immune (e.g. patched) to this exploit. This made NotPetya especially  dangerous, as even a single vulnerable device could lead to the compromise  of the whole network. Soon after the infection, NotPetya proceeded to  encrypt files on the computer using an irreversible. This means that once  encrypted, all affected files are lost, which makes the virus work like a  wiper, deleting important data from the system. Combined with the  attackers’ inability to collect ransom, this raised serious speculations  whether NotPetya was really ransomware or a cyber-weapon disguised as  one. 50 51 52 53 54  48 See CyberArk (2018) “Anatomy of the Triton malware attack”: https://www.cyberark.com/threat-research- blog/anatomy-triton-malware-attack/  49 See Sentryo (2018) “Analysis of Triton industrial malware”: https://www.sentryo.net/analysis-triton-malware/  50 See Kaspersky Lab (2017) “More than 50% of organizations attacked by ExPetr (Petya) cryptolocker are industrial  companies”: https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/alerts/2017/06/29/more-than-50-percent-of-organizations-attacked-by- expetr-petya-cryptolocker-are-industrial-companies/  51 See The New York Times (2017) “Cyberattack Hits Ukraine Then Spreads Internationally”:  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/technology/ransomware-hackers.html  52 See CNet (2018) “US: Russia's NotPetya the most destructive cyberattack ever”: https://www.cnet.com/news/uk- said-russia-is-behind-destructive-2017-cyberattack-in-ukraine/  53 See TechRepublic (2017) “NotPetya ransomware outbreak cost Merck more than $300M per quarter”:  https://www.techrepublic.com/article/notpetya-ransomware-outbreak-cost-merck-more-than-300m-per-quarter/  54 See The Register (2018) “IT 'heroes' saved Maersk from NotPetya with ten-day reinstallation bliz”:  https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/25/after_notpetya_maersk_replaced_everything/  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  114  SECURITY INCIDENT DATE DESCRIPTION  WannaCry ransomware  worldwide cyberattack  May 2017  This enormous, worldwide cyberattack infected more than 230,000  computers across 150 countries and affected manufacturers, banks and  governments. Organisations such as Renault and Honda were forced to halt  production, FedEx clients experienced delays on deliveries, and the UK’s  National Health Service was forced to cancel thousands of appointments.  Those are only a few of the confirmed victims of this ransomware, with  many more organisations not admitting to having been infected.  WannaCry, as this virus is called, using two sophisticated exploits in  Microsoft Windows systems managed to spread through the SMB protocol,  installing itself on a vulnerable machine without any user action (such as  opening a malicious e-mail attachment). Once in, it scanned the network  for other targets, infecting all of them, repeating the process and spreading  the infection further into the system. Fortunately, the attack was slowed  down by discovery of a kill-switch – a major flaw in the virus that allowed  researchers to “turn off” its spreading functionality, leaving asset owners  with a few hours to secure their devices and prepare for another wave of  infections. Securing those devices could have been as easy as installing the  security updates released by Microsoft a few months earlier.  Industroyer – second  cyberattack on Ukrainian  power grid  December 17, 2016  The second cyberattack on the Ukrainian power grid came almost exactly a  year after the first one. It shared many similarities with its predecessor but  varied in the method used. This time, attackers used a new malware  specifically designed to attack electrical grids – Industroyer. It targets  widely used communication protocols, providing the attacker with a  backdoor to an industrial control system. Once again, attackers opened  circuit breakers stopping power supply and once again they delayed  recovery by additional means, such as wiping crucial files to make the  system unresponsive. As a result, one fifth of Kiev, the capital of Ukraine,  was left without electricity for an hour. It is suspected that this attack was  a large-scale test, as attackers did not harness the malware’s full potential.  As Industroyer can be slightly modified to target other types of critical  infrastructure, such as water or gas, it is a major threat to industrial control  systems that has been proven to work. 55 56  BrickerBot – permanent  denial of service botnet  November 2016 –  December 2017  An alert was issued by ICS-CERT warning of a new bot attack similar to Mirai.  Named BrickerBot by its creator, it uses brute force in the telnet to gain  access to a device and then puts it in a permanent denial of service state  forcing its owner to reinstall the device or replace it altogether. According  to its creator, BrickerBot “bricked” over 10 million devices in about a year.  57 58  55 See WeLiveSecurity (2017) “Industroyer: Biggest threat to industrial control systems since Stuxnet”:  https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/12/industroyer-biggest-threat-industrial-control-systems-since-stuxnet/  56 See MIT Technology Review (2016) “Ukraine’s Power Grid Gets Hacked Again, a Worrying Sign for Infrastructure  Attacks”: https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603262/ukraines-power-grid-gets-hacked-again-a-worrying-sign-for- infrastructure-attacks/  57 See ICS-CERT (2017) “Alert (ICS-ALERT-17-102-01A) BrickerBot Permanent Denial-of-Service Attack”: https://ics- cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-17-102-01A  58 See BleepingComputer (2017) “BrickerBot Author Retires Claiming to Have Bricked over 10 Million IoT Devices”:  https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/brickerbot-author-retires-claiming-to-have-bricked-over-10- million-iot-devices/  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  115  SECURITY INCIDENT DATE DESCRIPTION  Mirai – IoT botnets attack October 21, 2016  The botnet made of IoT devices infected by Mirai has been associated with  one of the largest Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks ever  performed. The most notable attack was on a DNS service provider called  Dyn. By attacking Dyn with up to 100,000 infected devices across the world,  the attackers managed to disrupt or even disconnect several popular  services, such as Twitter, Netflix or Spotify, at the same time. The way the  malware infected so many devices was simply by utilising the most popular  and vendor provided passwords to gain access to them. Having “recruited”  them, the attackers left the devices almost untouched, seemingly  unaffected by malware. With an army at their disposal, the attackers were  able to order it to flood selected destinations, such as Dyn, exceeding their  bandwidth limits and bringing them down. What is probably the most  troubling about Mirai is that its source code is publicly available, providing  anyone with a way to build a botnet. Every month a new improved variety  of Mirai is discovered. Even though the original Mirai did not specifically  target IIoT devices, a version of it that does can surface any day now.59 60  Cyberattack on a power  grid in Ukraine  December 23, 2015  The cyberattack on the power grid in Ukraine was well planned, carefully  prepared and flawlessly executed. The attackers’ goal was not only to  disturb power supply, but also to delay restoration for as long as possible.  It started similarly to many other attacks, namely with phishing emails  containing malicious Microsoft Office files with embedded malware. This  malware, known as BlackEnergy, allowed the attackers to steal privileged  credentials and perform network reconnaissance, finding out all the  information about the infected system. Then, after as much as 6 months,  attackers remotely seized control over a SCADA system, opening multiple  electricity breakers and leaving about 230 thousand people without  electricity. At the same time, they took a number of steps to prolong the  effect. One, every infected computer’s hard drive was wiped. Two,  uninterruptible power supply (UPS) was compromised resulting in service  outages. Three, they “blew the bridges” by uploading malicious firmware  to gateway devices, making remote recovery impossible. These side-attacks  successfully delayed recovery, leaving people without electricity for up to 6  hours. This attack and the helplessness of the defence served as a wake-up  call to a lot of manufacturers.61  Cyberattack on Kemuri  Water Company’s  water  treatment plant  2015  Kemuri Water Company (KWC) is an alias for an anonymous water company  which experienced a security breach in its water treatment plant in 2015.  Due to major security flaws such as the usage of outdated operating  systems or storing all data on a single “ancient” server (IBM AS/400 from  1988), attackers exploiting vulnerability in an online payments system  gained access to all of KWC’s customers’ data and their ICS. Then, by  manipulating PLCs, attackers changed the amount of chemicals used,  influencing the tap water’s properties. Luckily, this change was harmless as  it is supposed that the attackers’ main goal was to obtain sensitive  59 See Sentryo (2016) “The ‘mirai’ iot botnet, a publically available turn-key threat”: https://www.sentryo.net/the- mirai-iot-botnet-a-publically-available-turn-key-threat-2/  60 See Xage Security (2016) “Mirai and IIoT Security”: https://xage.com/press/mirai-and-iiot-security/  61 See SANS ICS (2016) “Analysis of the Cyber Attack on the Ukrainian Power Grid Defense Use Case”:  https://ics.sans.org/media/E-ISAC_SANS_Ukraine_DUC_5.pdf  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  116  SECURITY INCIDENT DATE DESCRIPTION  customer data and not disturb the water treatment process. Had their goals  been different, it would have posed a serious threat to the public.62  German steel mill attack 2014  This attack, as many others, started with a phishing email opened by a  reckless employee. Once in the corporate network, attackers, using an  unknown technique, moved into the plant network and seized control of  multiple ICS components (including PLCs, HMIs and alarm systems). Then,  manipulating individual systems and causing their failure, attackers  disrupted the safe shutdown of a blast furnace, which resulted in serious  physical damage to the system.63  Havex / Dragonfly – a  Remote Access Trojan  targeted on SCADA, PLC  and DCS systems  2014  In 2014 it was reported that a number of European and US power facilities  were infected with a new malware created by a group known as Dragonfly.  The malware targeting ICSs consisted of two Remote Access Trojans (RATs)  which allowed the attacker to upload, download and execute files from the  infected computer. Its main mission was to collect data and information  about the infected system but with persistent backdoor access it could  easily transform into something more malicious. What is even more  interesting is how this malware infected its victims. Besides phishing emails  and watering hole attacks, it also hacked some ICS vendors software  downloads and planted RATs in them thereby even infecting somewhat  cautious targets.64  Shamoon virus -  Cyberattack on Saudi  Arabian Oil Company  (Saudi Aramco)  August 15, 2012  This attack started with a Saudi Aramco employee from the IT team opening  a malicious phishing email providing a point of entry for the attacker. Once  inside, attackers dropped a virus later known as Shamoon. It immediately  started spreading across Saudi Aramco’s entire IT network, infecting at least  35,000 computers. Then, at a carefully selected date – Saudi Arabia’s  national holiday – the virus began to wipe all the data on the infected  computers replacing it with the image of a burning American Flag. After  that, it proceeded to overwrite the computers’ Master Boot Record making  it unusable. Even though the attack affected only the IT network, leaving  separate ICS completely functional, it had a huge impact on other business  processes, such as loading gasoline trucks.65  Duqu – Stuxnet evolved 2011  Duqu is “nearly identical to Stuxnet, but with a completely different  purpose” according to Symantec. It targets Microsoft Windows, just like  Stuxnet, and uses Microsoft Word to execute code in kernel mode. Once  the machine is infected, Duqu’s purpose is not to destroy it, but rather  gather information useful in future attacks. Other than recording  keystrokes and system information, according to McAfee, Duqu steals  digital certificates that may be used to make future viruses appear more  legitimate. Although there was no code related to industrial control  62 See Sentryo (2017) “The Sentryo Files: Industries Vs.

Vendors allowing them access to customers’ systems for support purposes  sometimes maintain these lists. Once the attacker had these credentials,  he could access the pump’s controlling system and issue commands leading  to its destruction.67  Cyberattacks on Smart  Meters  2010  In 2010, it was reported that power thieves exploiting vulnerability in smart  meters caused PREPA (Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority) to incur costs  of 400 million dollars a year. Only a few things were required to carry out  this attack, namely optical probes, freely available software and physical  access to the meter. Because of its simplicity, many smart meters  recordings were modified resulting in such an enormous loss.68  Stuxnet worm attack on  Natanz nuclear  enrichment lab in Iran  2010  In 2010 workers at the Natanz nuclear facility realised that a strange  number of uranium enriching centrifuges were breaking. After inspection,  it was found that the Stuxnet worm that targets programmable logic  controllers (PLCs) infected their computer systems. It is believed that it was  introduced into the system by a USB drive, from where it targeted  Microsoft Windows and Siemens Step7 software exploiting their  vulnerabilities to gain access to PLCs, modifying the codes and giving  unexpected commands to the PLC while returning unsuspicious feedback.  In this incident, the attackers made centrifuges spin fast enough to tear  themselves apart while giving no warning to operators. Although no official  report was released, it is estimated that Stuxnet ruined almost one fifth of  Iran’s nuclear centrifuges.69  Disruption of multiple  DaimlerChrysler’s car  manufacturing plants by a  Zotob worm  August 16, 2005  Auto manufacturer DaimlerChrysler underwent a cyberattack in 2005  caused by a Zotob worm – a virus that spreads online and exploits the  vulnerabilities of Windows’ Plug and Play service. Despite the separation of  OT and IT networks with a firewall, due to the lack of patching of Windows  2000 servers, the worm spread across the plants and stopped the operation  of 13 DaimlerChrysler’s sites for over an hour. This resulted in huge financial  losses totalling 14 million dollars70.  66 See Symantec (2011) “W32.Duqu The precursor to the next Stuxnet”:  https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_duqu_the_precu rsor_to_the_next_stuxnet.pdf  67 See Computerworld (2011) “Apparent cyberattack destroys pump at Ill. water utility”:  https://www.computerworld.com/article/2497351/cybercrime-hacking/apparent-cyberattack-destroys-pump-at-ill-- water-utility.html  68 See KrebsOnSecurity (2012) “FBI: Smart Meter Hacks Likely to Spread”: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/04/fbi- smart-meter-hacks-likely-to-spread/  69 See Michael Holloway (2015) “Stuxnet Worm Attack on Iranian Nuclear Facilities”:  http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2015/ph241/holloway1/  70 See Sentryo (2017) “The Sentryo Files: Industries Vs.

With a great impact on citizens’ safety, security and privacy due to  its cyber-physical nature and the inherent autonomy, the threat landscape concerning Industry 4.0 and IoT  is extremely wide.  Following a methodological approach, ENISA has developed this study on Good Practices for Security of the  IoT in the context of Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing. The study makes a series of contributions, most  notably the following:   Defines relevant terminology (i.e. terms such as Industry 4.0, Smart manufacturing, Industrial IoT)  to promote common understanding of relevant cybersecurity scenarios.   Categorizes in a comprehensive taxonomy the Industry 4.0 assets across the manufacturing process  and value chain.   Introduces a detailed Industry 4.0 threat taxonomy based on related risks and attack scenarios.   Maps the identified threats to assets, thus facilitating the deployment of security measures based  on the customized requirements of interested stakeholders.   Lists security measures related to the use of IoT in Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0 and maps  them against the aforementioned threats.  In conducting this study, ENISA identified and extensively analysed the current state of available  documentation on security in IoT, Industrial IoT, Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing. ENISA also collected  input from a number of security experts through a structured questionnaire and a series of interviews.  ENISA considered the security of Industry 4.0 devices and services throughout their lifecycle (from  conception to end-of-life and decommissioning) and paid close attention to issues that are particular to the  requirements of Industry 4.0. Accordingly, the study highlights security measures in three dimensions:   Policies   Organisational measures   Technical measures  One additional noteworthy element of this study is the mapping to existing security initiatives, standards  and schemes. ENISA reviewed more than 150 resources on Industry 4.0 and IoT security and mapped them  against the security measures proposed in this study. This mapping facilitates stakeholders, who are  nowadays faced with a fragmented field, to have a common basis of understanding.  The guidelines and security measures listed in this study aim at improving the cybersecurity posture of  Industry 4.0 organisations that have adopted or plan to adopt Industrial IoT devices and solutions that  enhance automation in industrial operations. These security measures apply to a wide audience spanning  Industrial IoT operators and manufacturers/vendors, which can utilise these measures and  recommendations as a checklist against which to examine their Industry 4.0 security solutions.  The aim of the study is to serve as a reference point to promote collaboration on Industry 4.0 and Industrial  IoT security across the European Union and raise awareness of the relevant threats and risks with a focus on  “security for safety”.  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  07  1. Introduction  In recent years, we have seen a significant and rapid decline in data transfer and storage costs due to the  accelerating shift in the global economy driven by more connectivity, collaboration and sharing. This  development, accompanied by a bimodal IT organisation, supports exponential growth in the smart  connected world, especially in manufacturing. Recent trends include the emergence of Industry 4.0, a  concept that is revolutionising traditional manufacturing and other industries by introducing new  capabilities, such as digitisation, decision-making decentralisation and value chain integration. Industry 4.0  is tightly bound to cyber-physical systems that in turn are enabling intelligent and connected infrastructures  – including Smart Manufacturing infrastructures – by enhancing their quality of service provisioning.  Transforming the industrial landscape, Industry 4.0 with the Internet of Things (IoT) at its core has already  exerted an impact on society, transforming products, customer experience and the labour market. It is  therefore playing a central role within the European Union’s initiatives, becoming the subject of various  studies, programs and regulations1.  The fourth industrial revolution and exponential growth in the quantity of connected devices all over the  world together with the rapidly increasing number of cyber security incidents further stress the need for  strengthening cyber resilience, especially among the industrial operators who are beginning to utilise IoT  solutions. Recent initiatives towards Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing2 are attracting more attention  to aspects related to the security of technical solutions and the safety of citizens who rely on them. This  subject is all the more important since the potential impact exerted by new threats ranges from  compromising physical security to production downtime, spoilage of product, damage to equipment and the  ensuing financial and reputational losses.  Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing, in particular, accelerate the introduction of intelligence, automation  and autonomy in manufacturing and supply chain environments. Accordingly and given the significant  attention and prioritization that has been given to the digitisation of the EU industrial sector, this study has  a focus on security of IoT in the context of Industry 4.0. The topic is of great importance as vendors’ and  users’ / consumers’ awareness of the threats related to the deployment of Smart Manufacturing and  Industry 4.0 is usually limited. At the same time, cyberattacks focusing on industrial assets, such as Safety  Instrumented Systems, using new attack vectors have been recently observed with an increasing frequency.  Objectives  This ENISA study aims at addressing the security and privacy challenges related to the evolution of industrial  systems and services precipitated by the introduction of IoT innovations. The main objectives were to collect  good practices to ensure security of IoT in the context of Industry 4.0/Smart Manufacturing, while mapping  the relevant security and privacy challenges, threats, risks and attack scenarios.  The aim of the study is to serve as a reference point to promote collaboration on Industry 4.0 and Industrial  IoT security across the European Union and raise awareness of the relevant threats and risks with a focus on  “security for safety”.  1 See examples of EU initiatives related to Industry 4.0 concept: https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools- databases/dem/monitor/tags/industry-40  2 See examples of national initiatives for digitizing industry within the EU: https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools- databases/dem/monitor/category/national-initiatives  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  08  An additional important element of the study is to define the notion of Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing  to set the perimeter of the work to be done and serve as the basis for future developments.  Scope  This study outlines good practices for cybersecurity in the IoT applied in an industrial environment. Due to  the extensive landscape of IoT deployments, this study focuses on Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Smart  Manufacturing because they are among the most representative elements of the overall Industry 4.0  landscape3.  In this study ENISA identified and extensively analysed the current state of available documentation on  security in IoT, IIoT, Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing and other related subjects. ENISA also collected  input from a number of security experts through a structured questionnaire and a series of interviews. Based  on a thorough review of existing works, ENISA identified threats and developed possible critical attack  scenarios targeting various domains of Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing. This enabled the Agency to  develop good practices and security measures to ensure security in IoT in Industry 4.0. In this respect, the  study also made it possible to identify gaps in, and barriers to, security adoption.  The study highlights three groups of security measures to address security challenges in technologies, people  and processes. A risk-based and holistic approach to security was undertaken. ENISA considered the security  of IoT devices and services in industrial settings throughout their lifecycle (from conception to end-of-life)  and paid particular attention to the overall supply chain and third party management, which constitute  essential elements of Industry 4.0.  EU and International policy context  With a globally emerging trend of connected things and the increasingly common adoption of IoT concepts  by organisations across the world, cybersecurity of IoT in recent years has become a matter of interest for  the European Commission and other regulation bodies. IoT in Industry and Smart Manufacturing is a specific  subset of IoT cybersecurity.  Being aware of the potential of IoT and the related cyber security challenges, the EU has been striving to  ensure security in the IoT and accelerate development in this area through numerous policy actions that  include the creation of alliances and centres of expertise, development of regulatory documents and launch  of pilot projects. In March 2015, the European Commission launched the Alliance for Internet of Things  Innovation (AIOTI)4 with the objective to create an innovative European IoT ecosystem. It has become the  largest IoT association in Europe illustrating the EU’s intention to collaborate with stakeholders in order to  establish a competitive European IoT market and develop new business models.  Two months later, in May 2015, the EU adopted the Digital Single Market (DSM) Strategy5. In terms of the  IoT, which is one of its five main development areas, the DSM aims to address common issues that may lead  to the deceleration of secure IoT adoption, such as fragmentation of guidelines and lack of interoperability.  In April 2016, to fulfil DSM needs and ensure awareness of its upcoming policy, the European Commission  published a staff working document related to the IoT6. It constitutes part of the \"Digitising European  3 See EC, Fourth Industrial Resolution: https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/fourth-industrial-revolution  4 See The Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation: https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/alliance-internet- things-innovation-aioti  5 See more about Digital Single Market: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/digital-single-market/  6 See European Commission (2016) “Advancing the Internet of Things in Europe”: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016SC0110  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  09  Industry\" initiative and outlines the EU's vision of IoT based on three pillars: a thriving IoT ecosystem, a  human-centred IoT approach and a single market for IoT.  Like the Internet of Things, Cybersecurity is another DSM priority in terms of standards development. It is a  broad concept that, among others, spans cybersecurity in the Internet of Things and cybersecurity in  industrial systems. When it comes to IoT cybersecurity, ENISA developed a document entitled “Baseline  Security Recommendations for IoT”7 in 2017 to address systematically cybersecurity issues that emerged  because of the introduction of IoT concepts8.  Considering EU policy in terms of typical industrial initiatives, the DSM focuses on facilitating coordination  of European, national and regional initiatives, such as the German Industrie 4.09, Dutch Smart Industry10 and  French Industrie du Futur11. In 2016, a relevant communication from the European Commission was issued12.  Through these initiatives, the EU aims to boost innovation and prepare for new products and services.  As IoT and digitisation of industry rely on the exchange, processing and storage of large amounts of data,  the recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)13 must be mentioned when discussing EU policy  actions. Its objective is to protect privacy and personal information. It applies to all organisations, including  Smart Manufacturing companies and the vendors and operators of IoT devices.  Moving from the EU policy landscape to the international context, in 2017 the US IoT Cybersecurity  Improvement Act14 was introduced to address IoT security issues. Even more recently, the governor of  California signed the first IoT cybersecurity law in the United States that is planned to take effect in 2020. It  requires manufacturers to equip connected devices with reasonable security features15. Apart from this  example, the US Department of Homeland Security, NIST and other entities have also worked on addressing  cybersecurity issues associated with IoT and Smart Manufacturing through development of guidelines,  frameworks and other documents. Notable examples of these initiatives include the Department of  Homeland Security’s publication “Strategic Principles for Securing the Internet of Things”16 or NIST’s  “Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile”17.  7 See ENISA (2017) “Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT”:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot/at_download/fullReport  8 Relation of this document to ENISA Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT has been described in Annex A:.  9 See more about Plattform Industrie 4.0: https://www.plattform-i40.de/I40/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html  10 See more about Smart Industry: https://www.smartindustry.nl/  11 See more about Alliance Industrie du Futur: http://www.industrie-dufutur.org/  12 See European Commission (2016) ”Digitizing European Industry.

However, IoT security in the industrial environment is still regarded as a matter for  consideration by regulatory bodies, as Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing concepts utilising IoT are still  in the process of being devised.  Target Audience  This study provides a set of guidelines and security measures to improve the IoT cybersecurity posture of  Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing organisations, namely organisations that have adopted or plan to  adopt Industrial Internet of Things devices and solutions. These security measures apply to a wide audience  spanning IIoT operators and manufacturers/vendors. The list of potentially targeted profiles includes (but is  not limited to) the following:   Industrial IoT experts, software developers and device manufacturers   Industrial IoT operators and users   OT and IT security experts and solution architects   Persons in charge of security within Industry 4.0 organisations (e.g. CISOs)   Members of international Industry 4.0 organisations and security communities   Academic and Research Development Institutions.  In addition, this document may also support discussions at the policy-making level and therefore be of  interest to the potential development of related regulations on Industrial IoT security.  Methodology  The methodology (as depicted in Figure 1) followed to conduct this study consists of the following five tasks.  Figure 1: Methodology adopted for the study  Task 1: Definition of the project scope and identification of experts – The first step consisted of establishing  the scope of the project and selecting subject matter experts whose input and insights were considered for  the development of the report. The members of the ENISA IoTSEC18 (IoT Security) and EICS19 (ENISA Industry  4.0 Cyber Security) Informal Expert Groups as well as selected additional stakeholders formed the pool of  subject matter experts. In total experts from 42 different bodies contributed to the development and  validation of the study.  Task 2: Desktop research – During this step, extensive search for relevant documents in the context of the  project was conducted. The identified sources served as a reference to develop good practices and other  parts of the report.  18 See more about IoT Security Experts Group: https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/iot-security-experts-group-1  19 See more about EICS Experts Group: https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/eics-experts-group  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  11  Task 3: Questionnaire and series of interviews with selected subject matter experts – ENISA developed a  questionnaire covering various Industrial IoT and Industry 4.0 security aspects. The questionnaire was  completed by a group of subject matter experts. Furthermore, a series of interviews with these experts took  place, through which ENISA collected valuable input to prepare this report.  Task 4: Analysis of collected material and report development – The inputs collected from desktop research  and collaboration with stakeholders were thoroughly analysed by ENISA’s experts. Based on this analysis,  the first draft of this report was developed.  Task 5: Review and validation – ENISA once again reached to its subject matter experts, this time to share  the draft of the report with them to obtain comments and feedback. Taking into account the stakeholders’  feedback, the final version of this report was developed and validated by the subject matter experts during  the validation workshop held in The Hague, NL on the 26th of October 2018.  This methodology enabled ENISA to engage actively with the interested stakeholders and:   define terminology (e.g. Industry 4.0, Smart manufacturing, Industrial IoT etc.),   identify the corresponding assets (what kind of assets and where and how they are used across the  manufacturing process and value chain, its path and evolution over time),   identify possible threats, risks and attack scenarios posed against the Industrial IoT,   map identified threats to assets,   list security measures related to the use of IoT in Smart Manufacturing.  Structure  The study is structured as follows:   Chapter 1: Introductory information on the objectives, scope, context, target audience, methodology and  structure of the study.   Chapter 2: Definition of Industry 4.0 and its components with an overview of the concepts discussed and  the related security challenges.   Chapter 3: Threat and risk analysis containing a taxonomy of the threats and examples of Industry  4.0/Smart Manufacturing attack scenarios.   Chapter 4: Description of security measures and good practices mapped to threats, security domains,  standards and other relevant documents.

Industrial IoT: Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing  Definition  This report focuses on the IoT, Industry 4.0, Smart Manufacturing and IIoT, which are relatively new terms.  There is a veritable plethora of definitions for these terms while commonly held definitions are lacking.  Depending on the source and context, the descriptions of these terms may vary significantly. Thus, it is  important to adopt specific definitions and clarify our understanding of those terms. In this study, ENISA  defines IIoT as IoT (as defined in the ENISA Baseline IoT Security Recommendations20) applied in the  industrial environment. Industry 4.0 is, in turn, a much broader concept that encompasses IIoT and Smart  Manufacturing alike.  ENISA defines Industry 4.0 as “a paradigm shift towards digitalised, integrated and smart value chains  enabling distributed decision-making in production by incorporating new cyber-physical technologies such  as IoT”.  Figure 2: Communication relationships in Industry 4.0  Industry 4.0 design principles, often referred to as the fourth industrial revolution, include interoperability,  autonomy, information transparency, technical assistance and distributed decisions21. Recent technological  20 See ENISA (2017) “Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT”:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot/at_download/fullReport  21 See Connected Factory Global (2016) “Manufacturing Control System Cybersecurity: Risk Assessment & Mitigation  Strategies”: http://www.connectedfactoryglobal.com/resources/cybersecurity-report/  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  13  advances that resulted in reversal of the traditional production process logic led to the formation of this  concept, representing a shift towards decentralised production. With the advent of Industry 4.0, a product  is not merely processed by machines – it communicates with its environment providing relevant information  and instructions (referring to the notion of digital twin). No longer isolated, products and production lines  have become integral parts of the overall network.  Contrary to the traditional approach to industry in which a hardware-based structure with a clear  communication hierarchy was prevalent, Industry 4.0 introduced flexible systems whose functions are not  bound to hardware but distributed throughout the network. In these new systems internal communication  can now be observed across an organisation’s hierarchical levels. New types of interactions have been  introduced (see Figure 2) and external interactions between organisations have changed significantly and  become more flexible.22  Industry 4.0 connects production to information and communication technologies. It merges end user data  with machine data and enables machines to communicate with each other. As a result, it has become  possible for components and machines to manage production autonomously in a flexible, efficient and  resource-saving manner. Its benefits include, among others, higher product quality, greater flexibility,  shorter product launch times, new services and business models.23 It is important to note that the flows  depicted in the figure refer to physical goods and data (e.g. exchange of digital twins). Data flows are  bidirectional at least, e.g. customers may provide feedback to the production/manufacturing process.  Figure 3: Smart Manufacturing in Industry 4.0  By introducing a wide array of new capabilities, Industry 4.0 acts as an enabler for a new approach to  manufacturing, namely Smart Manufacturing. This particular concept, focusing on product manufacturing  using new technologies, constitutes only a small part of Industry 4.0, which may be regarded as a superset  22 See Plattform Industrie 4.0 (2016) “Technical Overview: Secure Identities”: https://www.plattform- i40.de/I40/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Publikation/secure-identities.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=9  23 See Plattform Industrie 4.0 (2018) “RAMI4.0 – a reference framework for digitalisation”: https://www.plattform- i40.de/I40/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Publikation/rami40-an-introduction.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  14  encompassing a variety of industrial areas. Figure 3 illustrates how Smart Manufacturing is related to  Industry 4.0 and other technologies in use.  ENISA defines Smart Manufacturing as “next-generation industrial manufacturing processes and systems  built on emerging information and communication technologies in line with Industry 4.0, such as additive  manufacturing, advanced analytics and IT/OT integration”. This new term describes systems that – by using  connected devices and sensors – attempt to maximise capabilities such as cost, delivery, flexibility and  quality by using advanced technologies that promote rapid flow and widespread use of digital information24.  Smart Manufacturing combines some of the functionalities of earlier manufacturing models, while  introducing its own new capabilities included advanced decision-making. Together with collaborative supply  chains, organisations may quickly adapt to market changes and disruptions.  To achieve innovation and the desired enhanced capabilities, Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing benefit  from various technologies (see Figure 4), such as:   IIoT end devices  Devices that have various capabilities, such as sensing, actuating, storing and/or processing data and  that exchange data over the network.   Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication  Technologies that facilitate direct communication between devices in the network without human  assistance.   Big data analytics  Process of examining vast amounts of various types of data sets generated in real time by smart sensors,  devices, log files, video and audio.   Advanced Robotics  Advanced industrial robots designed for complex tasks with smart capabilities, such as the ability to learn  from their errors and improve their performance.   Artificial Intelligence (AI)  Algorithms that enable computers and digital machines to perform tasks typically associated with  intelligent human beings.   Machine Learning (ML)  Algorithms that enable computers to act and improve their ability to predict without being explicitly  programmed.   Predictive Maintenance  Solutions that monitor the condition of equipment predicting when the failure may occur to perform  maintenance effectively at the lowest possible frequency.   Real time monitoring  Technologies that enable collection and aggregation of security data from system components and  monitoring and analysis of events that occur in the network.   Advanced loss analytics  Methods for analysis of various types of losses that may occur in a Smart Manufacturing environment  with the objective to eliminate or reduce them.   Cloud Computing  Solutions enabling access to shared sets of resources such as networks, servers and applications with  minimal requirements concerning managerial effort and service provider interaction.  24 See NIST (2016) “Current Standards Landscape for Smart Manufacturing Systems”:  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2016/NIST.IR.8107.pdf  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  15   Additive Manufacturing  Technologies that enable the creation of objects of various geometric shapes by adding material, e.g. 3D  printing or rapid prototyping.   Augmented reality  Technologies that modify the perception of the real-world environment, for example technologies used  in Smart Manufacturing to improve the efficiency of manual assembly tasks.  Figure 4: Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing capabilities  The notions of Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing are rather complex. Based on the responses received  by the subject matter experts in interviews and analysis of relevant publications, ENISA has identified the  following main elements:   ICS (Industrial Control Systems) – This group consists of control systems, such as SCADA (supervisory  control and data acquisition) and DCS (distributed control systems), as well as other control system  elements and devices, such as PLCs (programmable logic controllers) and HMIs (human machine  interfaces). Various control components within the system cooperate with each other to achieve a  specified control objective, e.g. manufacturing a product or desired state that is within pre-set  parameters such as keeping the flow of a liquid in a pipe within the bounds of the desired flow rate,  pressure or temperature, respectively. Additionally, ICSs may contain remote diagnostics and  maintenance tools.   IIoT End Devices – These devices have various capabilities, such as sensing, actuating, storing and/or  processing information. What distinguishes them from traditional devices such as sensors and actuators  that have been used in industrial applications for years is the fact that IIoT End Devices exchange data  over the network. In Smart Manufacturing environments, by making large amounts of new types of data  available, they contribute to streamlining production.   Manufacturing and business processes – This group consists of activities that lead to achieving a certain  goal, in this case obtaining a final product from raw materials or components. These processes include  technological procedures that may vary considerably depending on the characteristics of the company,  as well as organisational processes, which enable the whole company to operate successfully.  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  16   Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning – In Smart Manufacturing, due to the collection of enormous  amounts of data from industrial process, various ML and AI algorithms are utilised for analysis. Artificial  Intelligence transforms manufacturing by making it easily adaptable without having to spend long hours  to reprogram industrial robots, enabling predictive maintenance and increasing flexibility.25   Control systems communication networks and their components – This group includes networks,  network devices and industrial protocols. Networks play a significant role in a Smart Manufacturing  ecosystem since they allow different nodes to exchange data and information with each other via a data  link. Networks in control systems communication include serial and digital links to transfer inputs and  outputs to/from end devices. Network devices include gateways, routers, switches, etc. Typical examples  of industrial communication protocols include (but are not limited to): e.g. HART26, Modbus TCP/IP27,  OPC28 and OPC-UA29.  Security Challenges  The numerous benefits of adopting Industry 4.0 technologies and making manufacturing Smart go hand in  hand with significant security challenges. A recent survey revealed that stakeholders are becoming aware of  this problem, as 65% of companies believe that OT/ICS cybersecurity risks are more likely with IoT  technologies30. The following detail the generic security challenges that Smart Manufacturing and Industry  4.0 face:   Vulnerable components – Along with the fourth industrial revolution, the new Internet of Things (IoT)  landscape has emerged with millions of connected devices globally. That is why securing IoT in Smart  Manufacturing entails affording protection to an enormous number of connected assets. What is more,  IoT cybersecurity is not an isolated concept; it is interconnected with a number of security disciplines,  e.g. IT security, OT security and physical safety making this landscape even broader. As a result of shifting  from closed to connected cyber-physical systems, Smart Manufacturing companies need to handle the  issue of the typical vulnerabilities in those systems. In industrial environments this may pose a  considerable challenge since most systems of this type were not designed with cybersecurity in mind31  and thus vulnerabilities in this hardware are becoming more and more common32.   Management of processes – In addition to the large attack surface in terms of connected devices, a  multitude of complex processes involved in Smart Manufacturing should also be considered.  Management of processes with cybersecurity in mind poses a challenge for Industry 4.0 companies,  especially since functionality and production efficiency are usually seen as having a higher priority than  cybersecurity.   Increased connectivity – Manufacturing processes need to interact with objects and environments on a  global scale and systems used in Smart Manufacturing need to enable collaboration across multiple  25 See TOPBOTS (2017) “Future Factories: How AI enables smart manufacturing”:  https://medium.com/topbots/future-factories-how-ai-enables-smart-manufacturing-c1405f4ec0e6  26 See HART (Highway Addressable Remote Transducer Protocol):  https://www.fieldcommgroup.org/technologies/hart  27 See MODBUS TCP/IP Specification: http://www.modbus.org/specs.php  28 See OPC (Open Platform Communications): https://opcfoundation.org/about/what-is-opc/  29 See OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA): https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/  30 See Kaspersky Lab (2018) “Worried about IoT, but hit by malware: Kaspersky Lab reveals industrial organization  pain points”: https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2018_ics-cybersecurity  31 See Hongmei He (2017) “Security Challenges on the Way Towards Smart Manufacturing”:  https://www.iotsecurityfoundation.org/security-challenges-on-the-way-towards-smart-manufacturing/  32 See Positive Technologies (2018) “ICS SECURITY: 2017 IN REVIEW”:  https://www.ptsecurity.com/upload/corporate/ww-en/analytics/ICS-Security-2017-eng.pdf  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  17  organisations. One of the biggest challenges for higher connectivity is that security can exert a direct  impact on safety.   IT/OT convergence – Industrial control systems ceased to be isolated once the incorporation of IT  components in the ICS domain become a common practice. Converging with IT network-enabled  organisations simplified the management of complex environments while also introducing new security  risks. Managing IT/OT integration is a significant challenge. The contributing factors include insecure  network connections (internal and external), utilisation of technologies with known vulnerabilities that  introduce previously unknown risks into the OT environment, and insufficient understanding of  requirements for ICS environments. Holistic security must cover digital twin and physical implementation.   Supply chain complexity – Companies that manufacture products or solutions are very rarely able to  produce every part of the product itself and usually need to rely on third parties’ components. Developing  technologically sophisticated products results in an extremely complex supply chain with a large number  of people and organisations involved, thereby making it highly demanding in terms of management. Not  being able to track every component to its source means not being able to ensure product security, which  is only as secure as its weakest link.   Legacy industrial control systems – Legacy hardware is a significant barrier to adoption of the Industrial  Internet of Things by over a third of the respondents according to a recent survey33. Manufacturers build  new systems on top of legacy systems, and this may result in outdated protection measures and contain  unknown vulnerabilities that have been inactive for years. Adding new IoT devices to outdated hardware  raises concerns that it may allow attackers to find a new way to compromise systems.   Insecure protocols – Manufacturing components communicate over private industrial networks using  specific protocols. In modern network environments, these protocols often fail to ensure proper  protection against cyber-threats. According to a recent report, 4 of the 5 least secure protocols are ICS- specific34.   Human factors – Adopting new technologies means that factory workers and engineers have to work  with new types of data, networks and systems in novel ways. They are unaware of the risks associated  with gathering, handling and analysing that data and can thus become an easy target for attackers. This  is becoming all the more disturbing given that the industry most targeted by phishing emails in 2016 was  Manufacturing35.   Unused functionalities – Industrial machines are designed to offer a large number of functions and  services, many of which may not be necessary for operation. In industrial environments, machines or  their selected components often have access to unused functionalities that may considerably expand the  potential attack area and become gateways for the attackers. .   Safety aspects – The presence of actuators that act on the physical world makes safety aspects very  relevant in IoT and Smart Manufacturing. Security for safety emerges as an objective of paramount  importance.   Security updates – Applying security updates to IoT is extremely challenging, since the particularity of the  user interfaces available to users does not allow traditional update mechanisms. Securing those  mechanisms is in itself a daunting task, especially considering Over-The-Air updates. In OT environments  in particular, applying updates may be challenging since this operation needs to be scheduled and  performed during downtime.  33 See World Economic Forum (2015) “Industrial Internet of Things: Unleashing the Potential of Connected Products  and Services”: http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEFUSA_IndustrialInternet_Report2015.pdf  34 See Synopsys (2017) “State of Fuzzing 2017”: https://www.synopsys.com/content/dam/synopsys/sig- assets/reports/state-of-fuzzing-2017.pdf  35 See NTT Security (2017) “Global Threat Intelligence Report 2017”: https://www.nttsecurity.com/en-us/gtir-2017  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  18   Secure product lifecycle – Device security should be a subject of consideration through the product’s  entire lifecycle, even end-of-life/end-of-support of the machine.  High-level reference model  Smart Manufacturing environments consisting of a large number of elements can seem unduly complicated.  To provide a better explanation of this concept, a high-level reference model based on the Purdue Model  (i.e. the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture36 developed by Theodore J. Williams and members of the  Industry-Purdue University Consortium for Computer Integrated Manufacturing, as referenced in ISA-9537)  tailored to the scope of this project has been proposed (see Figure 5).  Figure 5: High-level reference model  The presented concept divides Smart Manufacturing environment into 6 layers. These layers are arranged  in order, with the lowest one being the manufacturing processes (Layer 0), followed by devices, systems and  services (Layers 1-5). Levels 1 and 2 represent OT layers. IIoT devices fall into the Layer 1 of this model. Layer  4 corresponds to the IT part of a corporation, while Layer 3 is an intermediate layer with systems classified  in-between IT and OT. IIoT Platform utilisation was included as part of the Layer 3. The highest layer, which  did not appear in the Purdue Model, is specific for Smart Manufacturing, where external services are  commonly used.  The objective of the reference model is to provide a general overview of relationships between the most  important assets (see section 2.4) and components (see section 2.1). Grey arrows represent simplified  communication paths between larger groups in the model (i.e. on the left of the picture). Additionally, new  36 See The Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture by T.J. Williams:  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166361594900175  37 See ISA95: https://www.isa.org/isa95/  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  19  communication paths introduced by Industry 4.0 and enabled by the incorporation of IIoT devices into the  network, e.g. communication between IIoT devices and direct connection of IIoT devices to IIoT platform,  have been added on top of the model with yellow arrows to emphasise their criticality in terms of security  and privacy. In what follows, we briefly described the levels of the reference model.  Level 0: Manufacturing processes and equipment (machines, robots)  This is the lowest level of the IIoT environment where manufacturing processes executed by smart machines  and robots take place. These processes are measured and controlled by devices and systems in higher layers  of the reference model.  Level 1: IIoT devices – sensors and actuators  This layer comprises IIoT devices that measure system parameters (IIoT sensors) and execute specific actions  (IIoT actuators). Data is transmitted between IIoT devices and control systems (Level 2) as well as IIoT  platform (Level 3). Level 1 also includes SIS.  Level 2: Industrial control devices and systems  These are devices and systems that control the industrial processes (Layer 0) based on information from IIoT  devices (Level 1). They include controllers (PLCs, RTUs), distributed control systems (DCS), operator panels  (HMI) and supervision and control systems (SCADA).  Level 3: Manufacturing operations systems and IIoT Platform  This is an intermediate layer between OT and IT environment. It comprises systems that are used to manage  manufacturing processes, e.g. Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), Historian, Warehouse Management  System (WMS) and Track & Trace systems. These systems communicate with both OT and IT environments.  Distinguishing this layer makes it possible to control this communication and prevents direct communication  between the OT and IT layers. Level 3 of the model also includes an IIoT platform that analyses and manages  data from the manufacturing and control processes provided by IIoT devices. It is closely related to the OT  environment and provides information to the systems in the layer above.  Level 4: Enterprise operations systems  These IT systems support a company’s operations at an enterprise level. They include supply chain and  production management and planning. In contrary to level 2 systems, they do not operate in real-time. This  layer includes the following systems (this list is not meant to be exhaustive): Enterprise Resource Planning  (ERP), Supply Chain Management (SCM), Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP), Customer Relationship  Management (CRM), Material Requirements Planning (MRP), Transaction Processing System (TPS) and  Executive Support System (ESS).  Level 5: Third Parties’ services  As mentioned before, reliance on Third Parties' services is an inherent characteristic of Smart Manufacturing.  For this reason, to better reflect Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing specifics, we decided to place an  additional layer on top of the ISA 95 model to include Third Parties services. These services may take  different forms, e.g. Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service  (IaaS).  Asset taxonomy  To focus on the details of IoT security in Smart Manufacturing it is essential to start from identification and  decomposition of assets of such vast and complex environments. Here we provide an overview of the key  asset groups and assets that need to be protected. Industry 4.0/Smart manufacturing assets are classified  into key groups depicted in Figure 6 and described in Table 1. The levels assigned to each asset group in the  table correspond to the levels defined in section 2.3, i.e. High-level reference model depicted in Figure 5. It  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  20  should be noted that the lowest level of the taxonomy is indicative and not exhaustive. For instance, not all  sensor types or network protocols are listed, just some representative ones.

There are  sensors for many purposes, such as to measure temperature, motion,  vibration etc.  Safety Instrumented  Systems (SIS)  These systems consist of sensors, logic solvers, and final control elements  (actuators) whose objective is to bring the process to a safe state in case of  a violation of predetermined conditions.  Actuators  These devices interact with the environment by moving or controlling a  mechanism or system. In order to do so, they convert energy (e.g. electrical,  hydraulic or pneumatic) into motion.  ICS  Level 2  PLCs  These specialised industrial computers are used to automate control  functions within the industrial network. Typically, they are equipped with  additional plug-in modules, such as Input / Output modules to connect  sensors and actuators.  RTUs  These devices are used typically in substations or remote locations.  Their objective, similar to PLCs, is to monitor field parameters and send data  to the central station.  DCS  These control systems distribute intelligence, i.e. management logic, about  the controlled process instead of relying on a single central unit.  SCADA  These systems are used to collect data from industrial assets and processes,  their visualisation, supervision and control. Such workstations usually  operate on the Windows operating system.  Human Machine  Interfaces  These control panels and dashboards allow the operators to monitor and  control PLCs, RTUs and other electronic devices.  ICS communication  networks &  components  Levels 1 - 3  Routers  These networking devices forward data packets between different networks  in industrial environments and IoT ecosystems.  IIoT Gateways  These network nodes are used to interface with another network from an  IoT environment using different protocols. Gateways may provide protocol  translators, fault isolators, etc., to provide system interoperability.  Switches  These network components filter and forward packets within the local area  network.  Wireless Access Points These components enable wireless devices to connect to a wired network  using Wi-Fi, or related standards.  Firewall These network security devices or systems control network traffic between  networks or between a host and a network based on predetermined rules.  Networks They allow the different nodes of an IoT ecosystem to exchange data and  information with one another, via a data link. There are different kinds of  networks related to their spatial coverage, including e.g. (W)LANs, (W)PANs,  PANs and (W)WANs, among others.  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  23  ASSET GROUP ASSETS DESCRIPTION  Protocols They define the set of rules on how two or more IoT devices communicate  over a given channel. There are many communication protocols, which can  be either wired or wireless.  Power Supply It supplies electric power to an IoT device and its internal components. The  power source can be external and wired or a battery integrated in the device  itself.  Information  All levels  Operation and production  data  This includes information about IIoT system operation and production data,  such as sensor data, MES and SCADA data, etc.  Device Information This includes information such as model, type, configuration, firmware  version, status, etc. IP address, physical location, etc. The asset inventory  contains this information about all system devices.  User Information This includes information such as name, role, permissions, etc.  Decision Making  Algorithms  Levels 2-5  Artificial Intelligence and  Machine Learning  These terms describe the ability of a machine (e.g. computer, robot, etc.) to  perform tasks typical for intelligent beings. In Smart Manufacturing, where  enormous amounts of data is collected from industrial process, various ML  and AI algorithms can be utilised for analysis.  Cloud Computing  Services38  Levels 3-5  These services enable swift universal network access to a shared set of resources such as networks, servers  and applications with minimal requirement of management effort and service provider interaction.  Big Data Analytics  Levels 3-5  In Smart Manufacturing, this term describes the process of examining vast amounts of various data sets  generated in real time by smart sensors, devices, log files, video and audio. This data is created on all  automation levels including manufacturing plant, transaction applications, etc. Big Data is analysed to  uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, trends and other useful information that can help make  more-informed and deliberate decisions.  Advanced Robotics  Level 0  Smart Robots, Automated  guided vehicles  These sophisticated industrial robots are designed to perform complex tasks  with smart capabilities, such as the ability to learn from errors and improve  their performance.  Real time  monitoring and  security tools  Levels 3-5  SIEM  These applications are utilised to collect and aggregate security data from  various system components and render them in the form of meaningful  information via a single interface.  IDS/IPS  These systems enable automatic monitoring of the events that occur in a  computer system or network and their analysis for signs of possible  incidents. In addition, IPS may execute actions in an attempt to stop  detected incidents.  Software and  Licenses  Levels 2-5  Program (code)  These programs are written for devices within an IIoT ecosystem to achieve  specific technological objectives, including PLC logic, SCADA applications,  HMI applications, industrial robot programs, etc.  38 See ENISA’s study on Cloud Computing, “Towards secure convergence of Cloud and IoT”:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/towards-secure-convergence-of-cloud-and-iot  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  24  ASSET GROUP ASSETS DESCRIPTION  Operating System  This term refers to a system that manages computer hardware resources  and provides common services for other computer programs to run.  Mobile application  These programs run on mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones,  which are used for remote supervision and control of a process (e.g. mobile  SCADA client applications), equipment maintenance and other tasks (e.g.  warehouse inventory).  Antivirus  This term refers to a software that monitors a computer or network to  identify malware, prevent it from infecting devices and clean infected  devices.  Firmware  This term refers to a class of software stored on a device’s read-only memory  and provides instructions on how the device should operate.  During  execution, it cannot be dynamically written or modified.  Servers and  Systems  Levels 3-5  Historians These software systems gather data from industrial devices and store them  in specialized databases.  Application Servers These computers host applications, e.g. user workstations’ applications.  Database Servers These servers are used as repositories for event information provided by  sensors, agents, and management servers.  Enterprise operations  systems (e.g. ERP, CRM)  These systems integrate information from various parts of an organization  (i.e. manufacturing, distribution, financials, human resources, etc.). They  also provide a connection between organization and its customers and  suppliers.  Manufacturing  operations systems  (e.g. MES)  These systems automate production control and process automation using  network computing, bridging the gap between business and plant-floor.  These systems are used for downloading instructions, scheduling and  uploading information on production results.  Mobile devices  Level 3  Tablets, smartphones These portable devices can be operated by hand. They run mobile  applications enabling operators to perform various tasks.  Personnel  All levels39  Operators, maintenance  staff, third parties  This asset group refers to all the individuals who have physical or remote  access to the OT system. People are inseparable elements of manufacturing  environments and hence must be taken into consideration when defining  critical assets in terms of security. All the people with access to an OT  environment can introduce malware to the system (intentionally or  unintentionally), become targets of phishing or cause damage to the system  and compromise its security in a variety of ways. On the other hand, people  require particular protection, as their privacy and physical safety may be  endangered in the event of security incident.  Table 1: Asset taxonomy  Figure 7 provides a view of the criticality of the main assets described in the asset taxonomy, based on the  responses provided by subject matter experts during their interviews. These interviews involved a structured  39 Indicated levels correspond to the concept of layers as explained in subchapter 2.3 High-level reference model.  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  25  questionnaire in which one of the questions referred to an in-depth evaluation of the main IIoT / Smart  Manufacturing assets according to their criticality. The experts could select any number of assets they  considered the most important in terms of cybersecurity of the IIoT ecosystem. The figures presented below  correspond to the percentage of experts who selected a given option.  Figure 7: Asset criticality  The figure shows that stakeholders consider ICS, i.e. PLCs, RTUs, DCS and SCADA systems to be the most  critical assets for Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0. Such a choice comes as no surprise as these systems  control and supervise industrial processes and their functioning is therefore indispensable for proper  execution and safety of production. As the study revealed, in terms of criticality, industrial control systems  are followed by IoT devices, notably IIoT gateways, sensors and actuators. Over half of the respondents  selected each of these types of assets confirming that the introduction of new connected devices to OT  environments is in fact a security challenge and generates a need for additional protection.  Among the other answers provided by the respondents, the human factor (e.g. operators, maintenance staff  and third parties) was highlighted. People were identified as critical assets as they may become targets of  phishing campaigns and their errors can allow malware to penetrate a system. Moreover, stakeholders  noted that, apart from the assets themselves, asset management is of great importance. To secure the assets  properly, companies should be aware of the devices and solutions they have, where they are located and  how secure they are, i.e. what type of protection mechanisms/security measures have been applied.  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  26  3. Threats and risk analysis  Threats taxonomy  Industry 4.0 environments face numerous security challenges caused by a large number of factors and hence  they need to be prepared to handle a wide variety of cybersecurity threats. In addition to threats related to  IoT technologies, Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing companies are likely to be affected by additional  threats, which are typical in OT and IT environments. A good illustration of this is the recent large-scale  ransomware attack called NotPetya40, as more that 50% of the companies hit by this attack were industrial  companies41.  In accordance with with ENISA Threat Taxonomy42, we have developed a threat taxonomy focused on  Industry 4.0, which is depicted in Figure 8 and described in detail in Table 2.  40 See the list of indicative incidents in Annex A:D.  41 See Kaspersky Lab (2017) “More than 50% of organizations attacked by ExPetr (Petya) cryptolocker are industrial  companies”: https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/alerts/2017/06/29/more-than-50-percent-of-organizations-attacked-by- expetr-petya-cryptolocker-are-industrial-companies/  42 See ENISA (2016) “ENISA Threat Taxonomy A tool for structuring threat information”:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat- landscape/etl2015/enisa-threat-taxonomy-a-tool-for-structuring-threat-information  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  27  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  28  Figure 8: Industry 4.0 threat taxonomy  CATEGORY THREAT DESCRIPTION ASSETS AFFECTED  Nefarious  activity / Abuse  Denial of Service  A Denial of Service attack can be bi-directional:  It can target an IIoT system resulting in system  unavailability and production disruption caused  by a massive number of requests sent to the  system.

For each proposed attack  scenario, experts selected their perceived criticality level (not important, of low, medium or high importance  or as crucial). Analysis of the experts’ answers is the source of the results presented in Table 3.  ATTACK SCENARIOS SEVERITY  1. Against the connection between the controller (e.g. DCS, PLC) and the actuators High  2. Against sensors (modification of measured values / states, their reconfiguration,  etc.) High  3. Against actuators (suppressing their state, modifying the configuration) High - Crucial  4. Against the information transmitted via the network High - Crucial  5. Against IIoT gateways High - Crucial  6. Manipulation of remote controller devices (e.g. operating panels, smartphones) High  7. Against the Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) Crucial  8. Malware High  9. DDoS attack using (IoT) botnets Medium - High  10. Stepping stones attacks (e.g. against the Cloud) Medium  11. Human error-based and social engineering attacks High  12. Highly personalised attacks using Artificial Intelligence Technologies Medium - High  Table 3: IIoT attack scenarios  For each attack scenario, a brief description detailing the potential impact and related threats based on the  Threats taxonomy (section 3.1) can be found below.  1. Against the connection between the controller (e.g. DCS, PLC) and the actuators  This type of attack takes place when an attacker injects and executes code or sends (manipulated) data by a  compromised system using a line that is not monitored.   Impact: Manipulation or loss of control, damage of the batch/product and infrastructure.   Related threats: Internal and external sabotage, manipulation of hardware & software, control device  configuration manipulation.  2. Against sensors (modification of measured values / states, their reconfiguration, etc.)  The measurement data is manipulated in the end devices, e.g. by breaking into the sensor and modifying its  firmware or configuration, such as measurements adjustment etc.  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  33   Impact: Making the wrong operator decisions based on manipulated data. Conducting the process based  on incorrect measurements. Measurements covered by the regulations will not be evaluated properly.   Related threats: Modification of information, sabotage, manipulation of hardware & software,  manipulation of transmitted sensor data.  3. Against actuators (suppressing their state, modifying their configuration)  Manipulation of the actuators’ configuration/parameters making them use wrong configurations, thresholds  or data, and therefore affecting their normal behaviour by sabotaging their normal operation settings.   Impact: It varies depending on the actuators affected. It can affect production processes.   Related threats: Manipulation of hardware & software, failure or malfunction of a sensor / actuator,  failure or malfunction of a control system (PLC, RTU, DCS).  4. Against the information being transmitted via the network  The attack aims to manipulate the data at the network layer (layer 2,3,4 model OSI). At the level of layer  5,6,7 of the OSI model, i.e. controller and control system (DCS, SCADA), data values seem to be correct.  Manipulation can be detected by network layer traffic monitoring.   Impact: It varies depending on the data manipulated. It can affect production process or cause damage  to the process, e.g. manipulation of furnace temperature that can cause explosion.   Related threats: APT, Man-in-the-Middle attack, sabotage, malware.  5. Against IIoT gateways  An attacker tries to compromise an IIoT gateway, potentially compromising the entire environment. It can  be quite successful if weak/vulnerable protocols or default passwords or protocols are used. This type of  attack comprises different stages/phases and it is usually launched in a covert manner. It should be noted  that this type of attack should be taken into account over a device’s entire lifecycle.   Impact: An attacker gains access to the network and data including access to the devices, systems and  network equipment. It can be the first stage of exploitation of the whole system and its components.   Related threats: Password attacks, exploit kits, abuse of personal data, malware and DDoS.  6. Manipulation of remote controller devices (e.g. operating panels, smartphones)  An attacker can break into a device that is far away from the control system (distributed environment). Often  such devices are intended for local control and are not monitored on an ongoing basis. The acquisition of  such a device is a great threat to the possibility of infiltration of the entire network as well as causing damage  to the equipment, where it will take a long time to obtain this information and could therefore magnify the  damage.   Impact: Gaining access to the system and full access to the control layer as well as engineering tools and  changes. It can cause dangerous changes to the IoT environment.   Related threats: Password attacks, software vulnerabilities exploitation, session hijacking, disclosure of  information.  7. Against the Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS)  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  34  One of the most dangerous attacks is against systems that are ultimately supposed to protect the  environment, human life and/or companies against large financial losses. Taking over the control system or  any manipulation of this system can lead to the destruction of the installation or in the least dangerous case  to the unplanned interruption of the process. An example of such attack is the recent Triton attack43.   Impact: Compromise of SIS, manipulation or interruption of SIS may affect many people, cause  environmental issues and even extend to other systems, affecting their operations or even disabling  them.   Related threats: Malware, sabotage, remote controller devices manipulation, APT.  8. Malware  These attacks are carried out by a malicious code that spreads over the network. It can give access to the  victim's data. Since these attacks are malware-based, they can be avoided by updating/patching vulnerable  devices. This can also be done outside the IIoT ecosystem. The problem regarding IIoT is the difficulty to  update/patch the different devices - some of them do not offer the ability to be updated or patched.   Impact: There are many possible targets for malware within IIoT – an attacker could take control of a  smart thermostat in the middle of winter and not turn on the heat, or he or she could hold power grids  or hospitals systems, etc., putting people’s safety at risk.   Related threats: Exploit kits, malware, DDoS, password attacks.  9. DDoS attack with (IoT) botnets  This type of attack does not target IIoT devices themselves, but instead uses them to attack other devices,  not necessarily IIoT devices. Firstly, malware automatically finds vulnerable Internet of Things devices,  infecting and conscripting them into a botnet, which then can be used to mount DDoS attacks, flooding the  target's servers with malicious traffic.   Impact: The target device or service is flooded with malicious traffic, taking it down.   Related threats: Exploit kits, DDoS and malware.  10. Stepping stones attacks (e.g. against the Cloud)  This type of attack is a common way to launch anonymous attacks. They are often used by network intruders  to hide their identities, since they launch attacks not from their own computer but from intermediary hosts  they have previously compromised.   Impact: If an attacker launches a stepping stone attack, he or she could compromise a collection of hosts,  using them as stepping stones to relay attack commands.   Related threats: APT, DDoS, malware.  11. Human error-based and social engineering attacks  43 FireEye (2017) “Attackers Deploy New ICS Attack Framework “TRITON” and Cause Operational Disruption to Critical  Infrastructure”: https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/12/attackers-deploy-new-ics-attack- framework-triton.html  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  35  This type of attack is usually the gateway to launch other types of attacks; it is a means to an end. Attacks or  human-errors are used to gain unauthorised privileged access to a system, which can lead to the installation  of other malicious content or backdoors or even physical access to the devices. It is used as part of an attack,  regardless of whether the target is a single system/device or a whole network or facility. It is difficult to  detect these attacks due to non-technical character, and it is much easier to detect the suspicious actions in  the environment based on very good awareness trainings for employees.   Impact: If successful, the social engineering attack creates an entry point to a system or facilities, in some  cases with elevated privileges. A human error-based attack could cause the system to crash or become  unstable. This attack is commonly used as part of a larger, sophisticated attack, which could be simple  data theft or a complex APT.   Related threats: Erroneous use or administration of devices and systems, unintentional change of data  or configuration in the OT system, physical damage to equipment, theft of intellectual values.  12. Highly personalised attacks using Artificial Intelligence Technologies (AIT)  Attacks to identify patterns for reconciliation or direct attack on IIoT systems. Their main threat is the use of  often potentially insignificant information. With the application of AIT attackers can combine specific data  obtained from the Internet and explicit data to find a hole in the security.   Impact: These attacks can be very personalised and target particular people, e.g. system administrators.  The development of communication throughout the IIoT ecosystem could also be a target. Such an  attack may be the first attack or one of the subsequent phases of an attack.   Related threats: Loss of data, network reconnaissance.  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  36  4. Security measures and good practices  Security Measure categorisation  Development of Security Measures for IoT in Smart Manufacturing was one of the focal points of this study.  The idea behind it was to provide guidelines and recommendations for Operators, Manufacturers and Users  of Industrial IoT that, if applied, can help prevent or properly respond to potential cyberattacks and ensure  overall security and safety of the industrial IoT environment. As part of this study, a considerable effort was  expended to identify all the relevant aspects related to this issue.  Firstly, extensive desktop research was conducted. Thorough analysis of relevant sources (listed in Annex C)  allowed distinguishing frequently mentioned topics in IIoT security. These topics were then aggregated to  create an initial list of security domains. Final set of domains was clarified and adapted based on the  interviews conducted with the stakeholders resulting in a list of 20 domains that provide a comprehensive  view of the Industry 4.0 landscape and indicate areas that require protection.  To organise the domains in a logical manner, they were classified into three main groups:   Policies   Organisational practices   Technical practices  These groups provide a high-level division and are in line with the classification of the ENISA “Baseline  Security Recommendations for IoT” study.  Figure 9: Good practices overview  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  37  Policies  This first group of Security Measures mostly refers to policies and procedures that should be established  within organisations to help ensure a good level of cybersecurity, especially where IIoT solutions are  concerned. In addition, privacy issues have been covered in the context of manufacturers who should ensure  that their solutions do not violate privacy regulations, and operators, who should be sensitised to privacy  related risks and made aware of how to utilise IIoT devices without exposing users’ personal information.  4.2.1 Security by design  Security measures which should be applied from the very beginning of product development.   PS-01: Treat IoT cybersecurity as a cycle, not as an end-to-end process, adopting a security by design  approach from the perspective of the devices and infrastructure at every step of a smart manufacturing  system development lifecycle (SDLC).   PS-02: Address cybersecurity through embedded features of endpoints rather than only at the network  level.   PS-03: Equip, as deemed appropriate after a security and safety assessment, even the most basic  connected devices holding very limited processing capabilities (e.g. actuators, converters) with  identification and authentication features and ensure compatibility with IAM class solutions.   PS-04: Perform risk and threat analysis involving cybersecurity experts from the very early stages of the  design process of the device to find out which security features will be necessary.   PS-05: In each design document include a chapter addressing the security of all the information and  control systems in the industrial environment.  4.2.2 Privacy by design  Security measures related to privacy and protection of personal data. These measures should be applied  from the first stages of product development.   PS-06: Address privacy related issues based on applicable local and international regulations, such as the  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)44.   PS-07: Define the scope of the data that will be processed by the device as well as the objective of this  processing during the design phase, avoiding collecting or unnecessarily providing sensitive data.   PS-08: Establish a physical location of data storage and define between which organisations data will be  transferred restricting access to collected personal data only to authorised individuals.   PS-09: Conduct a Privacy Impact Analysis (PIA) for the data that will be processed by the device.   PS-10: Separate data that can be used to identify an individual from other information and ensure its  security, e.g. through encryption of any personal data transferred within the IIoT environment.  4.2.3 Asset Management  Security measures regarding asset discovery, administration, monitoring and maintenance.   PS-11: Utilise tools supporting asset management that are able dynamically to discover, identify and  enumerate assets specific to the organisation and industrial environment.   PS-12: Ensure that your company has a consistent and up-to-date asset inventory.  44 General Data Protection Regulation, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/2016-05-04  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  38   PS-13: In complex industrial environments with legacy systems, use passive monitoring devices wherever  feasible or precede the implementation with a testing phase if you consider active monitoring tools.   PS-14: Use a centralised asset inventory for the entire computerised environment inside a manufacturing  plant.   PS-15: Consider secure administration of assets with management of the infrastructure and security  devices via a dedicated management network.   PS-16: Introduce a new device into the system only according to an established, accepted and  communicated change management process.   PS-17: Avoid the usage of removable devices disabling the USB ports if there is no accepted business  requirement.  4.2.4 Risk and Threat Management  Security measures regarding the recommended approach to the process of risk and threat management  adapted to Industry 4.0 environment.   PS-18: Adopt an approach to risk management dedicated to Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing  considering new parameters, threats and attack scenarios.   PS-19: For critical infrastructures in manufacturing environments, establish a number of risk management  areas completely aligned with corporate, safety and environmental sides. Assess and characterise  threats, vulnerabilities and protection measures against those risk management areas.   PS-20: Establish risk and threat management process according to the individual needs and security  requirements of your company.   PS-21: Perform risk analysis which includes cybersecurity aspects at least annually. Also, integrate it with  other processes, such as change management, incident handling and vulnerability management.

It serves as a foundation and  point of reference for the current study, which focuses on the in-depth exploration of cybersecurity aspects  within the specific area of IIoT and Industry 4.0.  Because this study relies on Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT, the adopted definitions and  connection with IoT are in line with ENISA’s general approach. Hereafter, the relation of IIoT to IoT is  explained. ENISA defines the Internet of Things (IoT) as “a cyber-physical ecosystem of interconnected  physical and potentially virtual sensors and actuators, which enable intelligent decision making.  Information lies at the heart of IoT, feeding into a continuous cycle of sensing, decision making, and  actions”.  Based on the criteria of business function, as illustrated in Figure 10, the Internet of Things can be divided  into Consumer IoT – which includes smart connected product platforms that add value to an individual  customer and, Industrial IoT - which corresponds to machine connectivity that increases asset performance,  product quality as well as traceability and accountability.  Figure 10: Consumer and Industrial IoT devices  The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) concept is associated with IoT focusing on digitising industries. IoT in  general is a much wider concept that includes a variety of consumer products, while IIoT is specific for IoT  used in OT (Operational Technology) environments. Characterised by similarities in terms of technology, IoT  systems are usually more focused on usability than safety. IIoT systems however need to meet the security  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  46  requirements specific to the OT environments resulting in differences in terms of business drivers and  characteristics46, as described in Table 4.

Safety Instrumented  System (SIS)  November 2017  The purpose of an SIS is to take immediate action when a critical process  goes some other way than planned e.g. if the pressure in a tank rises above  a predetermined level, SIS will activate valves to lower the pressure to  prevent an explosion. Disturbing this failsafe mechanism can have severe  physical consequences, especially in an industrial plant. One of these  systems was attacked in 2017 by Triton – an industry-targeted malware  designed to inflict severe damage. This was the first cyber-attack on a  Safety Instrumented System (SIS) ever recorded. After obtaining remote  access to a workstation, attackers infected SIS with malware. Using Zero- Day vulnerability, Triton managed to install itself on SIS, providing attackers  with full control. However, once in, the attackers “tripped” and triggered  the safety shut down of a process governed by SIS. This alarmed employees,  leading to detection of the malware and stopping the attack before it  caused any serious damage that would most probably have destroyed  infrastructure and halted production. 48 49  NotPetya - ransomware  created to cause damage June 2017  Just 6 weeks after WannaCry, a new global cyberattack emerged. Originally  targeted at Ukraine – its central bank, government and utilities (such as  electrical grids), it managed to disrupt people’s everyday life across the  country. Spreading further, NotPetya (also known as ExPetr, often referred  to as Petya) infected more than 200,000 computers worldwide and affected  mostly industrial companies such as Rosneft, Merck and Maersk. Using an  SMB protocol exploit to achieve initial infection it then tried to steal  credentials and take control of other machines on the network, including  those immune (e.g. patched) to this exploit. This made NotPetya especially  dangerous, as even a single vulnerable device could lead to the compromise  of the whole network. Soon after the infection, NotPetya proceeded to  encrypt files on the computer using an irreversible. This means that once  encrypted, all affected files are lost, which makes the virus work like a  wiper, deleting important data from the system. Combined with the  attackers’ inability to collect ransom, this raised serious speculations  whether NotPetya was really ransomware or a cyber-weapon disguised as  one. 50 51 52 53 54  48 See CyberArk (2018) “Anatomy of the Triton malware attack”: https://www.cyberark.com/threat-research- blog/anatomy-triton-malware-attack/  49 See Sentryo (2018) “Analysis of Triton industrial malware”: https://www.sentryo.net/analysis-triton-malware/  50 See Kaspersky Lab (2017) “More than 50% of organizations attacked by ExPetr (Petya) cryptolocker are industrial  companies”: https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/alerts/2017/06/29/more-than-50-percent-of-organizations-attacked-by- expetr-petya-cryptolocker-are-industrial-companies/  51 See The New York Times (2017) “Cyberattack Hits Ukraine Then Spreads Internationally”:  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/technology/ransomware-hackers.html  52 See CNet (2018) “US: Russia's NotPetya the most destructive cyberattack ever”: https://www.cnet.com/news/uk- said-russia-is-behind-destructive-2017-cyberattack-in-ukraine/  53 See TechRepublic (2017) “NotPetya ransomware outbreak cost Merck more than $300M per quarter”:  https://www.techrepublic.com/article/notpetya-ransomware-outbreak-cost-merck-more-than-300m-per-quarter/  54 See The Register (2018) “IT 'heroes' saved Maersk from NotPetya with ten-day reinstallation bliz”:  https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/25/after_notpetya_maersk_replaced_everything/  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  114  SECURITY INCIDENT DATE DESCRIPTION  WannaCry ransomware  worldwide cyberattack  May 2017  This enormous, worldwide cyberattack infected more than 230,000  computers across 150 countries and affected manufacturers, banks and  governments. Organisations such as Renault and Honda were forced to halt  production, FedEx clients experienced delays on deliveries, and the UK’s  National Health Service was forced to cancel thousands of appointments.  Those are only a few of the confirmed victims of this ransomware, with  many more organisations not admitting to having been infected.  WannaCry, as this virus is called, using two sophisticated exploits in  Microsoft Windows systems managed to spread through the SMB protocol,  installing itself on a vulnerable machine without any user action (such as  opening a malicious e-mail attachment). Once in, it scanned the network  for other targets, infecting all of them, repeating the process and spreading  the infection further into the system. Fortunately, the attack was slowed  down by discovery of a kill-switch – a major flaw in the virus that allowed  researchers to “turn off” its spreading functionality, leaving asset owners  with a few hours to secure their devices and prepare for another wave of  infections. Securing those devices could have been as easy as installing the  security updates released by Microsoft a few months earlier.  Industroyer – second  cyberattack on Ukrainian  power grid  December 17, 2016  The second cyberattack on the Ukrainian power grid came almost exactly a  year after the first one. It shared many similarities with its predecessor but  varied in the method used. This time, attackers used a new malware  specifically designed to attack electrical grids – Industroyer. It targets  widely used communication protocols, providing the attacker with a  backdoor to an industrial control system. Once again, attackers opened  circuit breakers stopping power supply and once again they delayed  recovery by additional means, such as wiping crucial files to make the  system unresponsive. As a result, one fifth of Kiev, the capital of Ukraine,  was left without electricity for an hour. It is suspected that this attack was  a large-scale test, as attackers did not harness the malware’s full potential.  As Industroyer can be slightly modified to target other types of critical  infrastructure, such as water or gas, it is a major threat to industrial control  systems that has been proven to work. 55 56  BrickerBot – permanent  denial of service botnet  November 2016 –  December 2017  An alert was issued by ICS-CERT warning of a new bot attack similar to Mirai.  Named BrickerBot by its creator, it uses brute force in the telnet to gain  access to a device and then puts it in a permanent denial of service state  forcing its owner to reinstall the device or replace it altogether. According  to its creator, BrickerBot “bricked” over 10 million devices in about a year.  57 58  55 See WeLiveSecurity (2017) “Industroyer: Biggest threat to industrial control systems since Stuxnet”:  https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/12/industroyer-biggest-threat-industrial-control-systems-since-stuxnet/  56 See MIT Technology Review (2016) “Ukraine’s Power Grid Gets Hacked Again, a Worrying Sign for Infrastructure  Attacks”: https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603262/ukraines-power-grid-gets-hacked-again-a-worrying-sign-for- infrastructure-attacks/  57 See ICS-CERT (2017) “Alert (ICS-ALERT-17-102-01A) BrickerBot Permanent Denial-of-Service Attack”: https://ics- cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-17-102-01A  58 See BleepingComputer (2017) “BrickerBot Author Retires Claiming to Have Bricked over 10 Million IoT Devices”:  https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/brickerbot-author-retires-claiming-to-have-bricked-over-10- million-iot-devices/  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  115  SECURITY INCIDENT DATE DESCRIPTION  Mirai – IoT botnets attack October 21, 2016  The botnet made of IoT devices infected by Mirai has been associated with  one of the largest Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks ever  performed. The most notable attack was on a DNS service provider called  Dyn. By attacking Dyn with up to 100,000 infected devices across the world,  the attackers managed to disrupt or even disconnect several popular  services, such as Twitter, Netflix or Spotify, at the same time. The way the  malware infected so many devices was simply by utilising the most popular  and vendor provided passwords to gain access to them. Having “recruited”  them, the attackers left the devices almost untouched, seemingly  unaffected by malware. With an army at their disposal, the attackers were  able to order it to flood selected destinations, such as Dyn, exceeding their  bandwidth limits and bringing them down. What is probably the most  troubling about Mirai is that its source code is publicly available, providing  anyone with a way to build a botnet. Every month a new improved variety  of Mirai is discovered. Even though the original Mirai did not specifically  target IIoT devices, a version of it that does can surface any day now.59 60  Cyberattack on a power  grid in Ukraine  December 23, 2015  The cyberattack on the power grid in Ukraine was well planned, carefully  prepared and flawlessly executed. The attackers’ goal was not only to  disturb power supply, but also to delay restoration for as long as possible.  It started similarly to many other attacks, namely with phishing emails  containing malicious Microsoft Office files with embedded malware. This  malware, known as BlackEnergy, allowed the attackers to steal privileged  credentials and perform network reconnaissance, finding out all the  information about the infected system. Then, after as much as 6 months,  attackers remotely seized control over a SCADA system, opening multiple  electricity breakers and leaving about 230 thousand people without  electricity. At the same time, they took a number of steps to prolong the  effect. One, every infected computer’s hard drive was wiped. Two,  uninterruptible power supply (UPS) was compromised resulting in service  outages. Three, they “blew the bridges” by uploading malicious firmware  to gateway devices, making remote recovery impossible. These side-attacks  successfully delayed recovery, leaving people without electricity for up to 6  hours. This attack and the helplessness of the defence served as a wake-up  call to a lot of manufacturers.61  Cyberattack on Kemuri  Water Company’s  water  treatment plant  2015  Kemuri Water Company (KWC) is an alias for an anonymous water company  which experienced a security breach in its water treatment plant in 2015.  Due to major security flaws such as the usage of outdated operating  systems or storing all data on a single “ancient” server (IBM AS/400 from  1988), attackers exploiting vulnerability in an online payments system  gained access to all of KWC’s customers’ data and their ICS. Then, by  manipulating PLCs, attackers changed the amount of chemicals used,  influencing the tap water’s properties. Luckily, this change was harmless as  it is supposed that the attackers’ main goal was to obtain sensitive  59 See Sentryo (2016) “The ‘mirai’ iot botnet, a publically available turn-key threat”: https://www.sentryo.net/the- mirai-iot-botnet-a-publically-available-turn-key-threat-2/  60 See Xage Security (2016) “Mirai and IIoT Security”: https://xage.com/press/mirai-and-iiot-security/  61 See SANS ICS (2016) “Analysis of the Cyber Attack on the Ukrainian Power Grid Defense Use Case”:  https://ics.sans.org/media/E-ISAC_SANS_Ukraine_DUC_5.pdf  Good practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  November 2018  116  SECURITY INCIDENT DATE DESCRIPTION  customer data and not disturb the water treatment process. Had their goals  been different, it would have posed a serious threat to the public.62  German steel mill attack 2014  This attack, as many others, started with a phishing email opened by a  reckless employee. Once in the corporate network, attackers, using an  unknown technique, moved into the plant network and seized control of  multiple ICS components (including PLCs, HMIs and alarm systems). Then,  manipulating individual systems and causing their failure, attackers  disrupted the safe shutdown of a blast furnace, which resulted in serious  physical damage to the system.63  Havex / Dragonfly – a  Remote Access Trojan  targeted on SCADA, PLC  and DCS systems  2014  In 2014 it was reported that a number of European and US power facilities  were infected with a new malware created by a group known as Dragonfly.  The malware targeting ICSs consisted of two Remote Access Trojans (RATs)  which allowed the attacker to upload, download and execute files from the  infected computer. Its main mission was to collect data and information  about the infected system but with persistent backdoor access it could  easily transform into something more malicious. What is even more  interesting is how this malware infected its victims. Besides phishing emails  and watering hole attacks, it also hacked some ICS vendors software  downloads and planted RATs in them thereby even infecting somewhat  cautious targets.64  Shamoon virus -  Cyberattack on Saudi  Arabian Oil Company  (Saudi Aramco)  August 15, 2012  This attack started with a Saudi Aramco employee from the IT team opening  a malicious phishing email providing a point of entry for the attacker. Once  inside, attackers dropped a virus later known as Shamoon. It immediately  started spreading across Saudi Aramco’s entire IT network, infecting at least  35,000 computers. Then, at a carefully selected date – Saudi Arabia’s  national holiday – the virus began to wipe all the data on the infected  computers replacing it with the image of a burning American Flag. After  that, it proceeded to overwrite the computers’ Master Boot Record making  it unusable. Even though the attack affected only the IT network, leaving  separate ICS completely functional, it had a huge impact on other business  processes, such as loading gasoline trucks.65  Duqu – Stuxnet evolved 2011  Duqu is “nearly identical to Stuxnet, but with a completely different  purpose” according to Symantec. It targets Microsoft Windows, just like  Stuxnet, and uses Microsoft Word to execute code in kernel mode. Once  the machine is infected, Duqu’s purpose is not to destroy it, but rather  gather information useful in future attacks. Other than recording  keystrokes and system information, according to McAfee, Duqu steals  digital certificates that may be used to make future viruses appear more  legitimate. Although there was no code related to industrial control  62 See Sentryo (2017) “The Sentryo Files: Industries Vs.

Vendors allowing them access to customers’ systems for support purposes  sometimes maintain these lists. Once the attacker had these credentials,  he could access the pump’s controlling system and issue commands leading  to its destruction.67  Cyberattacks on Smart  Meters  2010  In 2010, it was reported that power thieves exploiting vulnerability in smart  meters caused PREPA (Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority) to incur costs  of 400 million dollars a year. Only a few things were required to carry out  this attack, namely optical probes, freely available software and physical  access to the meter. Because of its simplicity, many smart meters  recordings were modified resulting in such an enormous loss.68  Stuxnet worm attack on  Natanz nuclear  enrichment lab in Iran  2010  In 2010 workers at the Natanz nuclear facility realised that a strange  number of uranium enriching centrifuges were breaking. After inspection,  it was found that the Stuxnet worm that targets programmable logic  controllers (PLCs) infected their computer systems. It is believed that it was  introduced into the system by a USB drive, from where it targeted  Microsoft Windows and Siemens Step7 software exploiting their  vulnerabilities to gain access to PLCs, modifying the codes and giving  unexpected commands to the PLC while returning unsuspicious feedback.  In this incident, the attackers made centrifuges spin fast enough to tear  themselves apart while giving no warning to operators. Although no official  report was released, it is estimated that Stuxnet ruined almost one fifth of  Iran’s nuclear centrifuges.69  Disruption of multiple  DaimlerChrysler’s car  manufacturing plants by a  Zotob worm  August 16, 2005  Auto manufacturer DaimlerChrysler underwent a cyberattack in 2005  caused by a Zotob worm – a virus that spreads online and exploits the  vulnerabilities of Windows’ Plug and Play service. Despite the separation of  OT and IT networks with a firewall, due to the lack of patching of Windows  2000 servers, the worm spread across the plants and stopped the operation  of 13 DaimlerChrysler’s sites for over an hour. This resulted in huge financial  losses totalling 14 million dollars70.  66 See Symantec (2011) “W32.Duqu The precursor to the next Stuxnet”:  https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_duqu_the_precu rsor_to_the_next_stuxnet.pdf  67 See Computerworld (2011) “Apparent cyberattack destroys pump at Ill. water utility”:  https://www.computerworld.com/article/2497351/cybercrime-hacking/apparent-cyberattack-destroys-pump-at-ill-- water-utility.html  68 See KrebsOnSecurity (2012) “FBI: Smart Meter Hacks Likely to Spread”: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/04/fbi- smart-meter-hacks-likely-to-spread/  69 See Michael Holloway (2015) “Stuxnet Worm Attack on Iranian Nuclear Facilities”:  http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2015/ph241/holloway1/  70 See Sentryo (2017) “The Sentryo Files: Industries Vs.

They provide a point-of-entry or gateway to  exploit a system and as such pose potentially severe security risks. Identifying and fixing vulnerabilities is  therefore crucial, and the process of disclosing vulnerabilities is a vital component that cannot be  underestimated. The vulnerability disclosure landscape is complex, with several stakeholders involved that  include vendors, IT security providers, independent researchers, the media, malicious users, governments  and, ultimately, the general public. These stakeholders often have competing interests, which results in a  challenging landscape.  In the specific context of the vulnerability disclosure process, this study seeks to achieve the primary  objectives listed in the following figure (Figure 1).  Figure 1: Primary objectives of the research  We used a mixed-method approach to accomplish the objectives outlined above, which included a focused  literature review, a series of in-depth interviews with key experts in the field, and case studies of four widely  distributed critical vulnerabilities reported in 2014.  Our analysis confirmed that there are a number of pressing challenges associated with the vulnerability  disclosure process. The key challenges we identified are summarised below.   Legal challenges: Individuals who discover a vulnerability often face legal threats when they decide to  report it. These threats can have implications on not only civil and criminal law but also contract law,  licensing, patent law and other types of legislation. Discoverers may find themselves in a grey area due  to the methods used to discover the vulnerability and the way it was disclosed.   Lack of ‘vendor’ maturity: Whereas large companies familiar within the information technology  environment have robust processes in place for vulnerability reporting, other companies are new to the  scene. These may be small companies, or companies which have not previously been part of the  information technology landscape. This could lead to a lack of maturity on the part of these players and  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  08  potentially complicate the vulnerability disclosure eco-system, as less mature companies are ill-prepared  to accept vulnerability reports and act upon them in the interest of the information security community.   Lack of researcher maturity: Just as vendors may lack experience in accepting vulnerability reports, so  some researchers lack experience in reporting vulnerabilities. When such experience is absent,  researchers may approach vendors in a threatening or otherwise non-conducive manner which prevents  fruitful cooperation. Researchers who lack experience may also be unwilling to compromise on, for  example, timelines identified by the vendor.   Incoming vulnerability reports are not always taken into consideration by the vendors. For all sorts of  reasons vendors may choose to disregard reports about a vulnerability on their products and services in  spite of the obvious damage they might suffer from not acting upon validated vulnerability information.  Vulnerabilities reported may be singled out as academic or theoretical and interest for a previously  disregarded vulnerability report might increase only after a security incident has happened when as it  often happens, an ex post analysis is likely to set the record straight.   Vulnerability acquisition for national intelligence purposes: Unpatched vulnerabilities can be used by  criminals but also potentially by national intelligence or law enforcement officials. This means that  sometimes a vulnerability will remain undisclosed for such (national) security purposes. Yet while a  vulnerability remains undisclosed to the vendor, so will the development of a solution remain absent,  leaving users vulnerable.   Users do not implement patches (in a timely manner): Once a vulnerability is disclosed by the vendor,  and a solution such as a patch to be installed via an update is available, the user must implement it. Such  implementation is essential for the vulnerability to be resolved; a lack of implementation leaves users  even more vulnerable since information about the vulnerability is now public. Users have a tendency,  for a variety of reasons, to postpone or to negate patching altogether. This may be because of a lack of  understanding or knowledge. Furthermore, it could be important to keep the average patch application  time as short as possible rather than solely focusing on the disclosure timeline.   Discoverer motivation varies: The motivation for an individual to discover a vulnerability varies. The  motivation of the discoverer can influence the decision s/he makes regarding what to do with the  vulnerability. The increase in bug bounty programmes as well as the growing zero-day market have  increasingly placed a focus on monetary reward. This may lead to over-incentivising the search for  vulnerabilities and may also lead to the expectation that discoverers will always receive a monetary  reward for their discovery.  We also identified a number of good practices for the various stakeholders involved and these have been  summarised below.   Use existing documents: Previous efforts have been made to gather good practices in the area of  vulnerability disclosure as well as to describe how to set up a vulnerability disclosure policy. To prevent  ‘reinvention of the wheel’, these documents should be used by stakeholders and should be leveraged  more by new initiatives. The ISO standards are a prominent example, although their lack of free  availability may hamper their reach.   Communication:  - Vendors should be reachable/have a point of contact: To prevent reporters from having to spend  valuable time and resources looking for the appropriate contact, vendors should have a clear point  of contact to deal with vulnerability reports, and this contact should be reachable.  - Have a policy in place: Vendors should have a policy in place which addresses vulnerability  disclosure and describes how they respond to vulnerability reports. This policy will also indicate to  reporters what information they need to provide as well as give an insight into the process of the  disclosure.  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  09  - Communication with different stakeholders: Communication with stakeholders requires mutual  respect, patience and transparency. Continual communication is essential to acknowledge receipt  of the vulnerability report as well as provide an indication of the next steps.   Information dissemination: Information about the vulnerability as well as its solution, if available,  should be disseminated to inform users of the developments and to provide them with an opportunity  to protect themselves. How much information needs to be disseminated is a topic of discussion among  stakeholders.   Timelines: a timeline should be mutually agreed upon (on a vulnerability-by-vulnerability basis) to  ensure that a vulnerability will be sufficiently addressed by the vendor in a timely manner.   Flexibility: No ‘one size fits all’ approach exists in the area of vulnerability disclosure, so flexibility is  necessary to tailor the vulnerability report as well as the response to the specifics of the vulnerability.  Finally, the synthesis of the various sources reviewed during this study shows that there are several areas  for future consideration. Below, we summarise a series of recommendations for improving the status quo  in the vulnerability disclosure landscape.   The community must facilitate the improvement of vendor maturity: To make progress, vendor  maturity must be improved to ensure that all vendors are able to receive vulnerability reports and  respond to them in a manner which is accepted by the community and which will introduce the smallest  risks with respect to the security of users. In this context the term community refers to different relevant  stakeholders like EU Member States, vendors, security researchers, national CSIRTs and ENISA.  In order to improve vendor maturity, the community must stimulate less mature vendors to introduce a  policy and set up an infrastructure which allows them to accept vulnerability reports.   Internationalisation through policy learning: The global nature of the internet requires a more  transnational approach to the topic of vulnerability disclosure, where successful cases in certain  countries or regions can be used for policy learning purposes in other areas of the world. Simultaneously,  stakeholder gatherings at the transnational level can use their international access to further enhance  such policy learning, and so allow the spread of good practices in vulnerability disclosure.   Introduction of a neutral third party or enhancement of existing coordination centres: The different  interests held by stakeholders – especially reporters and vendors – as well as the growing complexity of  the landscape, both in terms of stakeholders and products, advocates the introduction of a neutral third  party to coordinate vulnerability disclosure. An alternative is to enhance existing coordination centres,  to ensure that power discrepancies as well as potential conflicts of interest will not compromise the  overarching goal of improved information security.   European policy makers and Member States should improve the legal landscape: The legal implications  present many challenges for different stakeholders involved in the vulnerability disclosure process. The  legal landscape must facilitate the improvement of information security and existing legislation must be  adapted according to the latest developments.   Vendors should facilitate trust building, transparency and openness: From a vendor’s perspective, the  stigma associated with acknowledging that one of its products contains a vulnerability could potentially  lead to an unwillingness to recognise the existence of vulnerabilities. Society should therefore move  towards a state where the existence of vulnerabilities is acknowledged and accepted, to facilitate more  openness as a precursor to improved information security.   ENISA should facilitate and advise on ways to improve the vulnerability disclosure landscape: ENISA  could play a facilitating and advisory role in the area of vulnerability disclosure through information  dissemination, providing recommendations, striving for harmonisation, collaborating with the security  researcher community, and demonstrating leadership. From a policy perspective, ENISA could advise  the European Commission about the necessity for transparency from vendors and the potentially  negative impact of copyright law in the EU.  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  10  With our increasing dependence on ICT in everyday life, the exploitation of vulnerabilities discovered in  information systems and networks will continue to pose grave security risks, with potentially damaging  economic and societal impacts. Therefore it becomes all the more important that the various stakeholders  involved in this complex environment attempt to address the various challenges that are encountered in the  vulnerability disclosure landscape together. From the perspective of the security and trust of the end-users  of systems, there is consensus that vulnerabilities must be disclosed in a way that minimises damage.  Although movement towards more and better coordinated vulnerability disclosure has been happening to  some extent for several years now, the landscape is still fragmented in many ways, and there are pertinent  questions that remain unanswered. We explore and address some of these issues in this report. The analysis  we present will be useful for all stakeholders involved in the disclosure of vulnerabilities, including vendors,  researchers, policy makers, Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT) as well as the general  public.

Introduction  1.1 Background of the study  Vulnerabilities are ‘flaws’ or ‘mistakes’ in computer-based systems that may be exploited to compromise  the network and information security of the affected systems. They provide a point-of-entry or gateway for  malicious activities and as such pose several, potentially severe security risks. Remedying vulnerabilities is  therefore crucial and the disclosure process is a significant element that cannot be underestimated. Over  the last few years, there has been a rise in the number of vulnerabilities that have been disclosed to the  general public. In a number of cases, the vulnerabilities that were eventually reported were critical in terms  of their potential or actual impact. In 2014, for example, several ‘high profile’ vulnerabilities were reported  to the public, often via the media. These included, among others, Heartbleed, POODLE, Shellshock and  Sandworm.1 These disclosures carried several consequences and also re-opened the discussion on  vulnerability disclosure procedures in general. Cindee Tran, for example, describes how in the case of the  Shellshock vulnerability ‘within hours of the release of this bug to the general public, attackers reportedly  exploited this vulnerability to create botnets on compromised computers to perform DDoS (distributed denial- of-service) [attacks] and vulnerability scanning.’2 This led the security community to question whether the  manner of disclosure was appropriate, especially since there may be a direct connection between the public  disclosure of the vulnerability and the subsequent exploitation.  The vulnerability disclosure landscape is complex, with several stakeholders involved that include vendors,  IT security providers, independent researchers, the media, malicious users and, ultimately, the general  public. These stakeholders often have competing interests which results in a challenging landscape.  Reflections on some of the challenges involved provide insight into the different perspectives within the  community. Graham, for example, describes how ‘Microsoft forced a self-serving vulnerability disclosure  policy on the industry 10 years ago, but cries foul when Google does the same today.’3 One of the important  points to note is that information security in general, and vulnerability disclosure in particular, ought not to  become caught up in a ‘battle of the giants.’ As Böhme notes, ‘as long as perfectly secure software is not  available, the optimal distribution of vulnerability information is an important factor for the stability of a  “network society”.’4  Thus, the potentially sensitive nature of disclosing vulnerabilities poses a number of pressing questions  which are associated with the existence of diverging and, at times, conflicting interests, as well as with legal  restraints on the actions of stakeholders. Furthermore, digital and software-dependent technologies are  becoming increasingly embedded in everyday life. Therefore it is vital for the economy and society at large  that appropriate procedures are in place for disclosing vulnerabilities. Clearly, from the security perspective  of end-users such as businesses and home users, vulnerability disclosure must occur, but who should do this,  how it should be done, and when it is the right time to go public with vulnerabilities, are crucial questions  that remain to be answered.  1 Chapter 3 examines these four vulnerabilities in more detail.  2 AppSec Consulting. 2015. ‘Zero-day Attacks in 2014.’ As of 7 October 2015: https://www.appsecconsulting.com/blog/zero-day- attacks-in-2014  3 Errata Security. 2015. ‘A Call for Better Vulnerability Response.’ As of 29 May 2015: http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/01/a-call-for- better-vulnerability-response.html#.VWh4ms9VhBe  4 Bohme, Rainer. n.d. ‘A Comparison of Market Approaches  to Software Vulnerability Disclosure’ As of 29 May 2015:  https://www.is.uni-muenster.de/security/publications/Boehme2006_CompVulnMarkets_ETRICS.pdf  https://www.appsecconsulting.com/blog/zero-day-attacks-in-2014 https://www.appsecconsulting.com/blog/zero-day-attacks-in-2014 http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/01/a-call-for-better-vulnerability-response.html%23.VWh4ms9VhBe http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/01/a-call-for-better-vulnerability-response.html%23.VWh4ms9VhBe https://www.is.uni-muenster.de/security/publications/Boehme2006_CompVulnMarkets_ETRICS.pdf  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  12  The pursuit of these answers requires engagement with stakeholders to understand what challenges they  face, what good practices they undertake, and what recommendations they have for improvement. This  study is a first step to lead that process and provide further recommendations about what role ENISA as  independent third party can play.  1.1.1 Objectives of the study  In the specific context of the complex vulnerability disclosure ecosystem, this study seeks to achieve the  primary objectives listed in the following figure (Figure 2).  Figure 2: Primary objectives of the research  The analysis presented in this report will be useful for all stakeholders involved in the disclosure of  vulnerabilities, including vendors, researchers, policy makers, Computer Security Incident Response Teams  (CSIRTs) as well as the general public.  1.1.2 Methodology  In order to accomplish the objectives outlined above, the study relied on desk research and in-depth  interviews with key experts in the field of vulnerability disclosure. A review of the available literature such  as technical reports, company statements, media articles, and blogs, provided the basis for a general  overview of the vulnerability disclosure ecosystem as outlined in chapter 2. In parallel, a set of case studies  were prepared that focused on four widely distributed, critical vulnerabilities reported in 2014. For each  vulnerability examined, the case study describes the whole lifecycle of the disclosure process from discovery  to disclosure, as well as potential impact. The information for the case studies was gathered through  keyword searches on Google, using the name of the vulnerability (e.g. Shellshock) and combinations of  search terms that included disclosure, vulnerability, response and timeline. Sources used for the case studies  mainly included media reports, advisories, and blog posts issued by journalists and vendors.  Both the literature review and the analysis of the case studies built the basis for the core task of the project,  specifically the identification of challenges, good practices and the development of recommendations. In  addition the research team conducted a total of 16 interviews during the course of the project and the team  also received written responses from four additional participants who could not be interviewed in person.  To obtain a range of opinions and insights, the interviewees were selected among experts across the  vulnerability disclosure landscape and included vendors, information security companies, academic experts,  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  13  co-ordinators (e.g. representatives from national computer security incident response teams) and civil  society representatives.  The interviews were used to validate some of the findings from the literature review, and the information  obtained in the interviews were also used to support the four case studies. The interviews which lasted  approximately 45-60 minutes followed a semi-structured format (meaning that not all questions were  covered at each interview). The complete list of interviewees is provided in Annex B and the indicative  interview protocol is provided in Annex C.  To ensure that the interviewees were able to speak freely about their experience and knowledge, the study  team does not attribute specific contributions to the interviewees in order to ensure confidentiality and to  safeguard the sensitive nature of the topic discussed.  1.1.3 Outline of the report  In chapter 2 we present an overview of the vulnerability landscape, focusing on the definitions of  vulnerabilities, statistics related to reported vulnerabilities, and key stakeholders involved in the disclosure  process. Chapter 2 also looks at the different ways in which vulnerabilities can be disclosed. Four case studies  of vulnerabilities reported in 2014 are presented in chapter 3. For each of the cases (Heartbleed, POODLE,  Sandworm and Shellshock) the analysis covers the whole lifecycle of the disclosure process. Chapter 4  investigates the various challenges associated with the disclosure of vulnerabilities. A series of good  practices are presented in chapter 5. The various sources of evidence are analysed in chapter 6, and a list of  recommendations for improvement are presented. Finally, chapter 7 presents some concluding remarks and  highlights some unanswered questions and strategic issues raised by the findings.

Overview of vulnerability landscape  2.1 Introduction  This chapter examines the overall landscape of vulnerability disclosure, by defining the term ‘vulnerability’  and by providing a brief background on the number of reported vulnerabilities (based on historical data  contained in the National Vulnerability Database5). This is followed by an analysis of the different  stakeholders involved in vulnerability disclosure. The chapter ends by examining the different ways in which  vulnerabilities can be disclosed.  2.2 What is a vulnerability?  Any discussion of vulnerability disclosure must begin with a description of what constitutes a security  vulnerability. Table 1 lists the definitions of ‘vulnerability’, compiled from a range of independent sources.  Some definitions are more specific than others; for example, the Microsoft and Symantec definitions draw  a direct connection between a vulnerability and the fundamental principles of information security, i.e.  confidentiality, integrity and availability. In general, the various definitions refer to the following three key  characteristics: (i) the existence of a ‘flaw’ or a ‘weakness’ (i.e. a ‘point of entry’) in a system; (ii) the ability  of a potential threat (e.g. hackers) to have access the flaw; and (iii) the resulting ability to exploit it that may  result in an information security compromise. These main elements of a vulnerability, which could  potentially compromise the security of both software and hardware systems, have also been illustrated in  Figure 3. Examples of the repercussions of vulnerabilities include the unauthorised remote execution of  commands, denial of service attacks6 and in extreme cases the complete shutdown of systems. It is worth  reiterating that there are different degrees of vulnerability severity and associated risks which help to, for  example, prioritise the way in which a detected vulnerability is ‘fixed.’ This is discussed in more detail in the  next section.

The NVD is a publicly accessible ‘U.S. government repository of  standards-based vulnerability management data [that enables] the automation of vulnerability  management, security measurement, and compliance.’16 The NVD makes a comprehensive list of Common  Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs – see Table 1)17 available to the public and attempts to quantify the risks  posed by these vulnerabilities by 'scoring' CVEs based on a series of indicators (e.g. levels of impact and  exploitability). In particular, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) facilitates a metrics-based  technique for disseminating the different characteristics and impacts of vulnerabilities.18  CVSS 'scores' are  computed for almost all reported vulnerabilities. Based on the CVSS scores, the NVD also provides qualitative  ratings of the severity of vulnerabilities using a ‘Low-Medium-High’ rating scale.19 Specifically, vulnerabilities  are categorised as low severity if they have a CVSS score between 0.0 and 3.9; medium severity  vulnerabilities are those with CVSS scores between 4.0 and 6.9. Vulnerabilities are classified as high severity  if they have a CVSS score between 7.0 and 10.0.  Figure 4 presents the historical trend (from 2001 onwards) in the annual number of security vulnerabilities  reported, broken down by their respective CVSS 'Low-Medium-High' ratings. The relative proportions of low,  medium and high severity vulnerabilities are presented in Figure 5. The graphs were generated using data  obtained from the CVE statistics query page on the NVD website.20 The number of vulnerabilities  16 National Institute of Standards and Technology. n.d.- a.

The yearly statistics are also listed in Annex A (both in terms of absolute numbers and  proportions of the total number of vulnerabilities).  There was a general increase in the total number of vulnerabilities reported each year between 2001 and  2006, after which a steady downward trend was observed up to 2011. From 2011 onwards, however, the  total number of vulnerabilities with assigned CVEs has shown an upward swing once again. Notably, the  number of vulnerabilities reported in 2014 is substantially higher than the corresponding figure for 2013,  peaking at just below 8,000 vulnerabilities, an 'all-time high.’ The volume of vulnerabilities reported in 2014  represents a year-on-year increase of approximately 53% relative to 2013.  Figure 4: Yearly (2001-2014) distribution of the number of reported vulnerabilities broken down according to their severity  'rating'; the severity ratings are dependent on the computed NVD CVSS score21  The variation in the annual number of low and medium severity vulnerabilities displays a similar trend to the  total number of vulnerabilities. The trend in the number of high severity vulnerabilities, however, exhibits a  slightly different trend: there is a large increase from 2001 to 2007 (in which as many as 3,158 high severity  vulnerabilities were reported, representing almost 50% of all vulnerabilities reported that year). After 2007,  the number of high severity vulnerabilities reported shows a year-on-year decrease until 2013 in which 1,737  high severity vulnerabilities were reported. 2014 saw a slight reversal in this trend with over 1,900 high  severity vulnerabilities published and a record high of around 5,356 medium severity vulnerabilities. The  medium and high volumes together represented almost 92% of all reported vulnerabilities in 2014 (Figure  5). Interestingly, however, in 2014, the 1,920 high severity vulnerabilities constituted a proportion of slightly  21 The graph was produced using CVE data retrieved from the National Vulnerability Database.  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  18  less than one quarter of all vulnerabilities reported that year. The 2014 figure for the percentage of high  severity vulnerabilities is the lowest percentage across the entire period.22  Figure 5: Yearly (2001-2014) distribution of the proportion of total vulnerabilities reported broken down according to their  severity 'rating'; the severity ratings are dependent on the computed NVD CVSS score23  Finally, Figure 6 presents the yearly distribution of the number of vulnerabilities with CVSS scores exceeding  9.0.24 Between 2001 and 2006 there was a steady increase in the number of these 'critical' vulnerabilities.  In 2007 the number almost doubled to just under 1,000 vulnerabilities. Since 2007, the number of reported  vulnerabilities has varied between approximately 800 and 1,100 each year, with only a very slight decrease  in the overall number since 2012.  22 The share of ‘high’ and ‘medium’ severity vulnerabilities varies across the whole period between approximately 89% and 97% of  all reported vulnerabilities in the corresponding year.  23 The graph was produced using CVE data retrieved from the National Vulnerability Database.  24 Note: these data were retrieved from www.cvedetails.com, which relies on CVE vulnerability data taken from the NVD.  file://///nevis/RE/Projects/In_Progress/15060_Best_practice_guide_on_disclosing_vulnerabilities/WIP/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/nvanderm/Desktop/15067/www  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  19  Figure 6: Yearly distribution (2001-2014) of the number of reported vulnerabilities with a CVSS score greater than 9.025  It is important to note that these statistics provide only a broad indication of the historical trend in the  disclosure of vulnerabilities based on assigned CVE identifiers. There are a number of limitations associated  with simply counting the number of vulnerabilities that have been reported. The numbers do not indicate  whether the vulnerabilities were eventually exploited by attackers, nor do they tell us whether the software  flaws were ever patched by vendors.26 Furthermore, for some vulnerabilities there is not enough information  available to generate CVSS scores (e.g. a vendor discloses a vulnerability but does not provide sufficient data  related to the bug). In these cases the NVD adopts a ‘worst case approach’ and allocates the maximum CVSS  score of 10.27 In addition, the NVD database is not comprehensive as not all vulnerabilities are assigned CVEs  and are therefore not included in the data. Taking these limitations into account, the results need to be  interpreted with caution.  Despite these caveats, the CVSS is a transparent attempt at quantifying the risks associated with  vulnerabilities. By computing CVSS scores for the majority of reported vulnerabilities, the CVSS framework  is able to provide a standard measure of the ‘impact’ of vulnerabilities for industries as well as governments.  As noted on the NVD website, ‘two common uses of CVSS are prioritization of vulnerability remediation  activities and in calculating the severity of vulnerabilities discovered on one's systems.’28  25 The graph was generated using CVE data retrieved from CVE Details.

The topic of vulnerability disclosure brings together several different stakeholders. This section aims to shed  light on the ‘who’s who’ in this field, but simultaneously emphasises how stakeholders may belong to various  subgroups and that stakeholder groups are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In its National Infrastructure  Advisory Council (NIAC) Vulnerability Disclosure Framework, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  identifies four major categories of stakeholder involved in the vulnerability disclosure process.29 These  include (i) discoverers (or finders); (ii) coordinators; (iii) vendors; and (iv) users. Figure 7 summarises the  roles of these four primary participants.  Figure 7: Primary stakeholder categories involved in the vulnerability disclosure process  Additional stakeholders that can be added to these broad categories include the media, national  governments, more specifically law enforcement and national intelligence agencies, and profit-driven  criminals (Figure 8).  29 Chambers, John T. & John W. Thompson. 2004. ‘Vulnerability Disclosure Framework.’ As of 29 May 2015:  http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/vdwgreport.pdf  http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/vdwgreport.pdf  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  21  Figure 8: Additional stakeholder categories involved in the vulnerability disclosure process  There are stakeholders that are included in these groups but which may take on different roles or  perspectives. Examples include vendors or information security companies which engage in vulnerability  reward programmes, or academics who may be classified as discoverers, depending on the role they play.  As such, this list is not meant to be exhaustive, but aims at highlighting the main roles. For the purposes of  this report, a stakeholder is any individual, or group of individuals, which has a role in or influences the  vulnerability disclosure landscape.  2.4.1 Vulnerability disclosure lifecycle and associated roles  The vulnerability disclosure lifecycle commences with a discovery of a flaw. The individual or organisation  that discovers or finds the vulnerability is referenced as discoverer, often also as researcher (yet researcher  is a more specific term and may not include all types of discoverers). On a sidenote: the discoverer may also  be different from the reporter30, mentioned later in this chapter. From the moment of discovery, the  discoverer has a number of options on how to handle the vulnerability. First, the discoverer can report the  vulnerability to the vendor. Christey & Wysopal (2002) define a vendor as ‘an individual or organization who  provides, develops, or maintains software, hardware, or services, possibly for free.’31 Vendors often maintain  research staff who discover vulnerabilities and, as such, can potentially fulfil the role of discoverer in one  scenario and the role of vendor in another. This shows the diversity within each stakeholder category, since  a discoverer within a vendor may have a different interest or perspective compared to an independent  researcher.  A discoverer can also report the vulnerability to a coordinator. This can be the discoverer’s first action, or  the discoverer may wish to reach out to a coordinator after the vendor ignores the report. A coordinator can  be thought of as an intermediate entity that works with the discoverer/reporter and the vendor to ‘fix’ the  vulnerability.  As Christey & Wysopal (2002) note, ‘Coordinators are often well-known third parties.  Coordinators may have resources, credibility, or working relationships that exceed those of the reporter or  vendors.  Coordinators may serve as proxies for reporters, help to verify the reporter's claims, resolve  conflicts, and work with all parties to resolve the vulnerability in a satisfactory manner.’32 Examples of  coordinators used in the past are for example some Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs).33  30 As Christey & Wysopal (2002) note, ‘A Reporter is the individual or organization that informs (or attempts to inform) the Vendor  of the vulnerability.  Note that the Reporter may not have been the initial discoverer of the problem.’ [Christey, Steve & Chris  Wysopal. 2002. ‘Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure.’ As of 12 August 2015:  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-christey-wysopal- vuln-disclosure-00#page-3]  31 Christey, Steve & Chris Wysopal. 2002.  32 Christey, Steve & Chris Wysopal. 2002.  33 The term CSIRT and Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) are generally used interchangeably.  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-christey-wysopal-vuln-disclosure-00#page-3 https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-christey-wysopal-vuln-disclosure-00#page-3  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  22  Coordinators can also represent a diverse category: on the one hand, coordinators can be, as mentioned,  CSIRTs that are able to use their networks and ‘central’ position to capture the attention of the vendors and  ensure vulnerabilities that are critical and reported receive an appropriate response. Also other types of  coordinator exist, which have a commercial interest (examples will be discussed in the section on bug bounty  programmes).  The discoverer can also decide to publicise the vulnerability more broadly, without informing the vendor or  an intermediary, and directly publish the information to users of a product. (The Department of Homeland  Security includes users as a stakeholder in its categorisation as the manner in which the vulnerability is  disclosed and the subsequent potential and likelihood for exploitation ultimately affect their level of  security.34)  From the moment a potential security vulnerability is discovered, there are a number of basic steps involved  in the process of disclosing the vulnerability to the public. The primary steps, illustrated and summarised in  Figure 9, include the following: (i) discovery; (ii) notification; (iii) investigation; (iv) resolution; and (v)  release.35  Figure 9: Key steps involved in the disclosure of security vulnerabilities36  2.4.1.1 Role of the media  The media fulfils a crucial role in the dissemination of information with regard to vulnerability disclosures.  Hill (2014), for example, describes how in the case of the GoToFail vulnerability and the ‘Apple silence’,  journalists and security researchers had to inform the public and respond to its questions regarding the  vulnerability.37 The media, as a result, can be perceived to fulfil a number of roles, which may not be captured  in a more traditional model of vulnerability disclosure processes as described above.  The treatment of vulnerabilities by the media has for sure influenced the vulnerability disclosure landscape,  sometimes in a good way, sometimes not (according to the experts interviewed during this study).  Interviewees indicated how – before answering the questions – distinctions between media outlets as well  as vulnerability reporters must be made since the level of technical knowledge influences the quality of  34 Chambers, John T. & John W. Thompson. 2004.  35 Organization for Internet Safety. 2004. ‘Guidelines for Security Vulnerability Reporting and Response.’ As of 30 September 2015:  https://www.symantec.com/security/OIS_Guidelines%20for%20responsible%20disclosure.pdf  36 Adapted from: https://www.symantec.com/security/OIS_Guidelines%20for%20responsible%20disclosure.pdf  37 Hill, Kashmir. 2014. ‘Apple's Deafening Silence on 'GoToFail' Security Flaw.’ Forbes, February 24. As of 30 September 2015:  http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/02/24/apples-deafening-silence-on-gotofail-security-flaw/  https://www.symantec.com/security/OIS_Guidelines%20for%20responsible%20disclosure.pdf https://www.symantec.com/security/OIS_Guidelines%20for%20responsible%20disclosure.pdf http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/02/24/apples-deafening-silence-on-gotofail-security-flaw/  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  23  reporting. Information security media journalists and outlets, for example, generally maintain a high level of  knowledge and expertise, and by this are in a better position to report accurately on an issue. A general  perception, however, is that media reporting is prone to ‘hyping’ vulnerabilities, especially as a result of a  trend to label vulnerabilities and market them with catchy names and logos. The hype may overshadow the  technical characteristics of the vulnerability and as such worry the public and other stakeholders  unnecessarily. Figure 10 presents a snapshot of some of the headlines that appeared in online media relating  to the case studies included in this report (see Chapter 3).  Figure 10: Example headlines in the global online media relating to the vulnerability case studies included in this report  The positive influence of the media is that the attention devoted to information security in general, and  vulnerability disclosure in particular, has made it a relatively mainstream topic. Interviewees recognised this  as well, describing how the media highlights and pushes the issue of cybersecurity, and improves security  awareness among the public. The media is in a position to reach out to the general public, which can have  two other benefits. Firstly the ability to exert pressure on vendors to take the topic of vulnerability disclosure  seriously. Full disclosure of a vulnerability only has an impact as long as the media is willing to report on the  issue. The second aspect is the ability of the media to inform the public when a vulnerability requires action  on the part of the end-user such as installing a patch.  2.5 Different forms of vulnerability disclosure  How, when, and by whom a vulnerability is disclosed are core topics of debate within the information  security community. Disclosure of vulnerabilities can occur roughly in three different ways. Cencini et al.  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  24  (2005) identify three different types of vulnerability disclosure.38 The first is non-disclosure which is the  easiest to explain but the most difficult to quantify. Non-disclosure means that the discoverer keeps the  vulnerability secret and does not report it, neither to the vendor nor to the public (Figure 11). Non-disclosure  may, however, include the sale of the vulnerability to a third party.  Figure 11: Non-disclosure of vulnerabilities  The second form is full disclosure, which is the opposite of non-disclosure since with full disclosure the  discoverer discloses the vulnerability to the public at large (Figure 12). Full disclosure may not give the  vendor sufficient time and warning to resolve the vulnerability and makes vulnerability information openly  available to malicious potential attackers. Full disclosure does not discriminate among its recipients or  audience.  Figure 12: Full disclosure of vulnerabilities  The third form is responsible disclosure. This is an ambiguous term, especially since it has a normative  connotation of being ‘responsible’ and interpretation varies from stakeholder to stakeholder. As a result the  more recent preference is to use the term coordinated vulnerability disclosure, as it’s perceived as being  more neutral. In both cases, the discoverer reports the vulnerability to the vendor with the intention of  assisting the vendor in resolving the vulnerability (Figure 13). When a resolution is available, the vendor  publishes the vulnerability alongside a patch for users. The knowledge about the vulnerability does not  become public until a solution is available.  Figure 13: Responsible or coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities  There is also limited disclosure, which can also be classified as a variant of responsible and coordinated  vulnerability disclosure. Limited disclosure occurs when only specific parties are informed about a  vulnerability. Coordinated vulnerability disclosure can also include the presence of a third party to lead the  coordination process (Figure 14).  38 Cencini, Andrew, Kevin Yu, and Tony Chan. 2005. ‘Software Vulnerabilities: Full-, Responsible-, and Non-Disclosure.’ As of 9  October 2015:  http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep590/05au/whitepaper_turnin/software_vulnerabilities_by_cencini_yu_chan.pdf  http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep590/05au/whitepaper_turnin/software_vulnerabilities_by_cencini_yu_chan.pdf  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  25  Figure 14: Responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities involving a coordinator  2.5.1 Different opinions about disclosure types and the challenges associated  A variety of arguments exist for and against the adoption of the different existing vulnerability disclosure  forms. Full disclosure is perceived as objectionable since the software vendor(s) may not be aware of the  vulnerability or may not have enough time to develop a solution for it before the disclosure becomes public.  Once the vulnerability has been disclosed to the public, and a solution to patch the vulnerability is not  available (yet), malicious actors are in a position to exploit it.39 This claim against full disclosure, however,  has been criticised by other experts. According to Schneier, full disclosure is a ‘good idea.’ Schneier writes:  ‘Public scrutiny is the only reliable way to improve security, while secrecy only makes us less secure.’40 The  fear that malicious actors may exploit the information provided through full disclosure assumes that they  are not already aware of the vulnerability. The other assumption is that software vendors will indeed spend  time and financial resources to fix the vulnerability. For Schneier, both of these assumptions are false.  Schneier delves into the economics of the matter to explain how there has to be an incentive for software  vendors to fix the vulnerability, which is not necessarily always present. Cavusoglu et al., however, write  ‘[a]lthough immediate public disclosure might provide necessary motivations to vendors that might  otherwise ignore the vulnerability otherwise [sic], it also punishes other vendors that would make an honest  effort to deliver the patch promptly by not providing them adequate time to address the vulnerability.’41  The greatest challenge in the area of vulnerability disclosure is the fundamental difference in opinions  among stakeholders and stakeholder groups. This is precisely why the vulnerability disclosure debate,  despite going on for ages, remains alive. There is an inherent difference of opinion between discoverers,  who prefer to advocate a full disclosure approach, and vendors, who prefer to advocate a ‘responsible’ or  coordinated vulnerability disclosure approach. As an interviewee stated, ‘The reality is that they are actually  both right in their own way. They are both right in terms of their own worst case scenario.’ The challenge  then is to deviate from an extreme point of view and to build in an inherent flexibility which allows one’s  perspective to change according to the specifics of a vulnerability. Not every vulnerability, after all, will fall  into the category of the worst case scenario.  Moreover, attention needs to be devoted to different classes of attack.42 There are opportunistic attacks  which generally rely more heavily on publicly available information about vulnerabilities and exploits.  Perpetrators of these types of attacks are willing to carry out a high number of attacks each with a low  probability of success but a high probability of detection. Attacks of this nature are measurable and their  impact can be quantified to a certain extent. This is in contrast to targeted attacks, where perpetrators prefer  custom-developed solutions, have a base level of operational security, and have access to a range of  software exploits. Moreover, a specific feature of targeted attacks is that the perpetrator has a strategic  target in mind. These types of attacks are difficult or potentially even impossible to measure in a reliable  manner. How individuals think about vulnerability disclosure policy, however, is influenced by their ability  to model and anticipate targeted attacks and associated behaviour. If a user, whether an individual or an  organisation, does not have the ability to model targeted attack behaviour  – perhaps due to a lack of high- quality data – then there is a bias towards a longer public release timeline for the vulnerabilities. As one  interviewee notes, ‘These decisions are designed to reduce harm from opportunistic attacks and assume  that no other attackers have access to the vulnerability information.’ Based on observations from the private  39 See for example Cavusoglu, Hasan, Huseyin Cavusoglu & Srinivasan Raghunathan. n.d. ‘Emerging Issues in Responsible  Vulnerability Disclosure.’ As of 7 October 2015: http://www.infosecon.net/workshop/pdf/65.pdf)  40 Schneier, Bruce. 2007. ‘Schneier: Full Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities a “Damned Good Idea”.’ As of 7 October 2015:  https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2007/01/schneier_full_disclo.html  41 Cavusoglu, Hasan, Huseyin Cavusoglu & Srinivasan Raghunathan. n.d.  42 Written input from respondent.  http://www.infosecon.net/workshop/pdf/65.pdf https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2007/01/schneier_full_disclo.html  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  26  exploit market, there appears to be a growing number of vulnerability discoveries that are already known  by advanced attackers. This is a phenomenon known as ‘bug collision.’ When a vulnerability is already known  by advanced attackers, the level of urgency increases and timelines for public release are shortened.  Arguably many efforts and initiatives that are being introduced aim to facilitate the development of a  common ground to overcome the existing fundamental difference of opinion. Yet, based on the discussion  on types of attacks, it becomes evident that disclosure ought to be tailored to the vulnerability and that  polarised positions should be replaced by a more flexible perspective.  2.5.2 Role of CSIRTs  Direct communication between software vendor and vulnerability reporters may be hampered by distinct  interests both parties hold, as well as the fundamental differences of opinion described above. This is evident  both with respect to independent discoverers as well as with regard to security researchers who may be  employed by a vendor and who report the vulnerability to another vendor. This tension leads to the  introduction of CSIRTs as a potentially important stakeholder that can play a role in coordinating the process  and keeping the public interest at heart. Within the information security community, CERT Coordination  Centre (CERT-CC)43 has held a vulnerability disclosure process for many years. The tradition of CSIRTs acting  as a coordinator appears to be a more recent development in the European Union (EU), although CERT-FI44  was broadly recognised by interviewees as having significant experience in this role. CIRCL, the CSIRT for the  private sector, communes and non-governmental entities in Luxembourg, also maintains a vulnerability  disclosure policy.45  Through knowledge of the vulnerability, CSIRTs are also in a position to (confidentially) notify their  constituents, such as critical infrastructure organisations, to make them aware of the vulnerability and  potentially take steps ahead of the release of a patch. In this way, the vulnerability is disclosed, but to a  select group to ensure malicious actors do not obtain the damaging information.  During the interviews the project team specifically asked the interviewees what role they believed CSIRTs  can play in this area. This section must be prefaced by noting that certain CSIRTs already play an active role  in coordinated vulnerability disclosure. These include – as noted above – CERT-CC based in the United States,  CERT-FI based in Finland and JP-CERT based in Japan. Moreover, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)  in the Netherlands also maintains a role in vulnerability disclosure as it launched a policy in 2013.46  Opinions of the role of CSIRTs differ, depending on the experience of the interviewees. Some interviewees  were sceptical about CSIRTs, mainly due to the CSIRTs’ direct ‘government connection or association’ (see  4.2.5). Interviewees expressed concerns about the potential implications of sharing vulnerability information  with an organisation which is ‘part of the government’ and may not be ‘independent.’ Such scepticism  varied, based on which nation or Member State respondents were speaking of and what their experiences  were with respect to CSIRTs. Other respondents, for example, very clearly indicated that such claims were  unjustified based on their experiences. As indicated by one CSIRT, in its experience the reporter needs to  43 The CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) is the Coordination Centre of the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) for the  Software Engineering Institute (SEI), a non-profit US federally funded research and development centre.  44 CERT-FI is the Finnish national computer security incident response team whose task is to promote security in the information  society. CERT-FI is a part of the Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority.  45 Computer Incidence Response Center Luxemburg (CIRCL). ‘Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure.’ As of 7 October 2015:  https://www.circl.lu/pub/responsible-vulnerability-disclosure/  46 National Cyber Security Centre. 2013b. ‘Responsible Disclosure Guideline.’ As of 7 October 2015:  https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/news/responsible-disclosure-guideline.html  https://www.circl.lu/pub/responsible-vulnerability-disclosure/ https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/news/responsible-disclosure-guideline.html  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  27  feel a certain level of confidence with regard to the CSIRT in its vulnerability coordinator role. Publicly  publishing a disclosure policy helps to gain a certain level of trust from the reporter.  The main role which CSIRTs can play with respect to vulnerabilities is as a ‘coordinator’ of the process. This  could, however, become complicated as expressed by the scepticism of some of the interviewees. As  coordinators of the process, CSIRTs may become involved in certain parts of the vulnerability disclosure  processes, but not all. The CSIRTs that the project team spoke to indicated how they generally encouraged  discoverers to first try to contact the vendor themselves before approaching the CSIRT. Discoverers could  reach out directly to CSIRTs in case they wanted to remain anonymous, did not have the contact information  for the vendor, or if the vulnerability involved multiple vendors or organisations. Discoverers may also  contact CSIRTs if they cannot come to an agreement with the vendor or the vendor ignores their reports.  As one interviewee described it, ‘The dynamic from the software company will change if a third party is  involved. So if it’s just a relationship between the vulnerability researcher and the software company, there  is a higher chance that the software company will be confrontational, and a lower chance that they will  resolve the issue in a timely manner.’  2.5.3 Bug bounty programmes reward reporters  The relationship between discoverers and vendors has evolved over time, but remains complex since they  have different objectives and interests, and as such also often distinct opinions on the severity of the  vulnerability and the necessity to inform the public, and how fast this should be done, if at all. One of the  main developments in bringing vendors and discoverers closer together has been the introduction of bug  bounty programmes, Vulnerability Purchase Programmes (VPPs) and Vulnerability Rewards Programmes,  which have all become commonplace. A bug bounty programme rewards a reporter for reporting a  discovered vulnerability. According to Friis-Jensen (2014), bug bounty programmes have existed since  October 1995 when Netscape offered a cash reward to those who were able to find and subsequently report  security vulnerabilities in Netscape Navigator 2.0 Beta.47  The idea, however, was not adopted by other  software vendors until several years later. IDefense, a company which VeriSign later acquired, introduced  an initiative which offered researchers cash rewards for reporting software vulnerabilities.48 IDefense  functioned as an intermediary between the researchers reporting the vulnerabilities and the software  vendors. TippingPoint in 2005 introduced the Zero-Day Initiative (ZDI), which was a competing programme  to the initiative introduced by IDefense.49 The main goals of the ZDI are:   ‘Extending TippingPoint’s security research organisations (via DVLab’s research team) by leveraging the  methodologies, expertise, and time of others   Encouraging the reporting of zero-day vulnerabilities in a responsible manner to the affected vendors  by financially rewarding researchers   Protect its customers through the TippingPoint Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) while the affected  vendor is working on a patch’50  47 Cobalt. 2014. ‘The History of Bug Bounty Programs.’ Cobalt, 11 April.

ZDI then conducts its own research and  analysis to validate both the identity of the researcher as well as the vulnerability. ZDI proceeds to make a  monetary offer to the researcher. If the researcher accepts, then the researcher receives a prompt payment.  ZDI indicates how subsequently vendors are notified of the vulnerability, while Tippingpoint also develops  an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) filter. The ZDI maintains a specific policy for its vulnerability disclosure  to vendors. The ZDI will try to contact the vendor at least three times via different means, i.e. email, phone  and through an intermediary. However, ‘[if] DVLabs exhausts all reasonable means in order to contact a  vendor, then DVLabs may issue a public advisory disclosing its findings fifteen business days after the initial  contact.’52  Frei describes how both iDefense and the ZDI do not act on all vulnerabilities they receive, but rather appear  to focus on highly critical vulnerabilities that target prevalent software products. As can be seen in Table 2,  the number of public disclosures made by ZDI has seen an increase over the last three years.53  Table 2: Historical trend of the number of public disclosures made through the Zero-day Initiative54  Year Number of disclosures  2012  203  2013  287  2014  427  Besides these ‘intermediary initiatives’, bug bounty programmes initiated by vendors have become more  common since 2004. During that year the Mozilla Foundation introduced cash rewards to researchers who  reported critical vulnerabilities in Firefox. The Mozilla bug bounty programme is still active and now covers  most of its products.55 Currently several other big names, such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft maintain  bug bounty programmes. Facebook has its Whitehat programme, where researchers can report the bugs  they discover. Depending on the severity of the detected vulnerability, Facebook will provide a cash reward  of at least US$500, although there is no pre-determined maximum. The findings from its Whitehat  programme are showcased on the Facebook Bug Bounty page. This page also reports on statistics of the  programme during the previous year. For 2014, Facebook described how:  ‘Submissions increased by 16% to 17,011. We are happy to see that the program is continuing to  produce high quality reports – 61 of last year's eligible bugs were categorized as high severity,  49% more than the previous year.  We've paid out more than $3 million since we got started in 2011, and in 2014 we paid $1.3 million  to 321 researchers across the globe. The average reward in 2014 was $1,788.  51 Zero Day Initiative. n.d.-a.  52 Zero Day Initiative. n.d.-b. ‘Disclosure Policy.’ As of 7 October 2015:  http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/disclosure_policy/  53 Shannon_Sabens. 2015. ‘Milestone today, good times ahead.’ HP Security Research Blog, 12 May.

We now have  123 countries reporting bugs.’56  Besides having individual programmes, certain organisations also contribute to more overarching initiatives  such as the Internet Bug Bounty programme which is dedicated to the discovery of vulnerabilities in  frameworks that are used in many applications.57 Another initiative is HackerOne, a company which provides  a platform designed to streamline vulnerability coordination and bug bounty programmes by enlisting  hackers to improve vendor security.58 It is important to emphasise that HackerOne itself is not a bug bounty  programme, but rather works with vendors who have such programmes. HackerOne’s services are free  unless the vendor or another organisation pays the discoverer for the vulnerability, in which case HackerOne  charges a commission. HackerOne currently has a wide-ranging clientele as well as a large number of  researchers affiliated with the platform. According to Perlroth, HackerOne has about 1,500 users on its  platform and collectively they have fixed around 9,000 vulnerabilities, earning around US$3 million in  bounties.59  Overall, these bug bounty programmes have been welcomed by the information security community  because they bridge the gap between discoverers and vendors. Through these programmes, vulnerability  discovery has become a more structured and rewarding process for both parties, which is more conducive  to effective cooperation. Even so, there is some reluctance with respect to the bug bounty programmes and  paying for vulnerabilities in general (see 4.2.7).  56 Facebook Bug Bounty. n.d. In Facebook Product/Service page.

Instead of money,  United Airlines decided to reward reporters in ‘award miles’:  Severity Examples Maximum payout in award miles  High Remote code execution 1,000,000  Medium  Authentication bypass  Brute-force attacks  Potential for personally identifiable  information (PII) disclosure  Timing attacks  250,000  Low  Cross-site scripting  Cross-site request forgery  Third-party security bugs that affect United  50,000  There are other curious features to the company’s bug bounty programme, especially since it removed from a  flight a researcher who tweeted about a vulnerability in the airline’s Wi-Fi-system only weeks before the  introduction of its programme. United Airlines specifies which vulnerabilities are eligible for submission and which  are not. In light of events with respect to the tweeting researcher, the latter category is particularly worthy of  mention since United Airlines considers the following vulnerabilities ineligible:   ‘Bugs that only affect legacy or unsupported browsers, plugins or operating systems   Bugs on internal sites for United employees or agents (not customer-facing)   Bugs on partner or third-party websites or apps such as:   cruises.united.com   hotels.united.com   hub.united.com   unitedmileageplus.com   vacations.united.com   Bugs on onboard Wi-Fi, entertainment systems or avionics   Insecure cookie settings for non-sensitive cookies   Previously submitted bugs   Self-cross-site scripting   Vulnerabilities that apply only to you or your own account’62  2.5.4 Zero-day market  Besides bug bounty or vulnerability reward programmes, discoverers can also receive financial rewards via  other channels. This can occur through the so-called zero-day market. Sources in the media have previously  described aspects of the zero-day market about which they have been able to acquire information.  60 United. n.d. ‘United Airlines bug bounty program.’ As of 7 October 2015: http://www.united.com/web/en- US/content/contact/bugbounty.aspx  61 Zetter, Kim. 2015a. ‘United Airlines Pays Man A Million Miles for Reporting Bug.’ Wired, 14 July.

Vupen did not act as a participant in the contest, instead the company carried out its activities in the  background. Google offered US$60,000 for the details of their approach, but Vupen refused. Greenberg  quotes Bekrar who states: ‘We wouldn’t share this with Google for even $1 million. We don’t want to give  them any knowledge that can help them in fixing this exploit or other similar exploits. We want to keep this  for our customers.’64 According to Greenberg, the clientele of Vupen consists of government agencies which  acquire the vulnerabilities to infiltrate and disrupt the operations of criminals and intelligence targets. This  situation has led to concerns among civil society groups.65 Concerns exist not only because the zero-day  vulnerabilities could end up in the wrong hands, but also because there may be a lack of oversight regarding  the situations for which intelligence agencies and law enforcement officials use them.  Schneier describes how the market for zero-days has matured substantially over the last few years. He  describes how in 2007 Charlie Miller described his attempts to sell zero-day exploits, and how in 2010 a  survey indicated that the opportunity for a zero-day market was limited. Schneier simultaneously reflects  on how the progression of a zero-day market functions as a game changer with dangerous consequences.  As Schneier writes, ‘I’ve long argued that the process of finding vulnerabilities in software systems increases  overall security. This is because the economics of vulnerability hunting favoured disclosure.’66 The  introduction of the zero-day market, however, changes these dynamics. He indicates how, since the grey  market is more lucrative than the public vulnerabilities market, it will lead to more hackers choosing the  former rather than the latter.  Zero-day vulnerabilities on the grey market are purchased on the assumption that the sale is exclusive and  that the vendor will not be notified of the vulnerability.67 Sometimes, according to Greenberg, the payment  will be made in instalments as long as the vendor has not patched the vulnerability. A vulnerability after all  only maintains its zero-day status as long as no solution is available and disseminated among the users of  the product. Although then it could still have value, as indicated by Ablon et al., as a ‘half-day.’68  The majority of interviewees who mentioned the issue of exploiting vulnerabilities for national intelligence  purposes identified this as a challenge, especially since the zero-day market is able to offer significantly  higher rewards to reporters than can more legitimate efforts such as bug bounty and vulnerability reward  programmes.  63 Greenberg, Andy. 2012. ‘Meet the Hackers Who Sell Spies the Tools to Crack Your PC (And Get Paid Six-Figure Fees).’ Forbes, 21  March.

Case Studies  To determine how vulnerability disclosure works in practice, this section of the report examines in detail the  following four case studies of vulnerabilities:   Heartbleed;69   Sandworm70;   Shellshock71; and   POODLE.72  These four vulnerabilities were selected because (i) they were classified as being high/severe impact; (ii)  they were easy to access and exploit; (iii) they were (consequently) widely distributed; and (iv) they were all  reported in 2014. For each of the case studies, the analysis covers the whole lifecycle of the disclosure  process.  3.1 Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160)  3.1.1 Introduction  The vulnerability known to the public as Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160) provides attackers with the  opportunity to ‘steal’ information which, under normal conditions, would be protected by SSL/TLS  encryption. The seriousness of the Heartbleed bug was broadly recognised, especially since the vulnerability  was located in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. The main purpose of the SSL/TLS  encryption is to provide communication security and privacy over the Internet for applications such as web,  email, instant messaging (IM) and some virtual private networks (VPNs). With the Heartbleed bug security  was compromised since the bug provided anyone on the Internet the opportunity to read retrieved data  from the memory of the systems protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software.73 The  vulnerability exists in all default versions of OpenSSL dating back to March 2012.74 Sapio (2014) describes  the criticality of the vulnerability by indicating how there is a lack of reasonable limits on the type of  information that can be compromised; the ability for attacks to be automated and distributed, which  complicates identification of possible attackers; and the observation that the attack had potentially been ‘in  69 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2014-0160 [National Institute of Standards and Technology. 2015a.  ‘Vulnerability Summary for CVE-2014-0160.’ As of 7 October 2105:  https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014- 0160]  70 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2014-4114 [National Institute of Standards and Technology. 2015b.  ‘Vulnerability Summary for CVE-2014-4114.’ As of 7 October 2105:  https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014- 4114]  71 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2014-6271 [National Institute of Standards and Technology. 2015c.  ‘Vulnerability Summary for CVE-2014-6271.’ As of 7 October 2105:  http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014- 6271]  72 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2014-3566 [National Institute of Standards and Technology. 2015d.  ‘Vulnerability Summary for CVE-2014-3566.’ As of 7 October 2105:  http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014- 3566]  73 Heartbleed.com. 2014. ‘The Heartbleed Bug.’ As of 7 October 2015: http://heartbleed.com/  74 Sapio, Tim. 2014. ‘Heartbleed: Examining the Impact.’ DarkReading, 10 April.

According to the timeline  generated by Grubb (2014), Google researcher Neel Mehta discovered the vulnerability at the latest on 21  March 2014. On that day, two Google employees generated a patch for the vulnerability and distributed it  across services and servers around the world. Several days later, on 2 April 2014, a Finnish IT security testing  company – Codenomicon – also discovered the vulnerability and reported it to the National Cyber Security  Centre (NCSC-FI) in Finland.78  Once the NCSC-FI received a report of the vulnerability, the organisation began to verify, analyse and  approach the authors of OpenSSL as well as software, operating system and appliance vendors that were  potentially affected by the vulnerability. Since the vulnerability had been discovered independently by the  two Google employees, the vulnerability had been publicly disclosed before the work of the NCSC-FI had  been completed.79  On Monday, 7 April 2014, Cloudfare published a blog post entry about Heartbleed. A couple of hours later  the company posted a tweet referring to the blog post. Shortly after, Mehta also tweeted about the  vulnerability. Codenomicon also tweeted and directly linked to the website they created: heartbleed.com.  During the day, the rest of the world was able to read about Heartbleed, and the story about the vulnerability  quickly spread through the media.  The disclosure of Heartbleed was a topic of discussion, especially in the media. As described by Grubb (2014),  ‘Ever since the \"Heartbleed\" flaw in encryption protocol OpenSSL was made public on April 7 in the US there  have been various questions about who knew what and when.’  JPCert describes how it received information about the vulnerability a few days prior to disclosure, from one  of its global counterparts.80 The JPCert team was about to commence the coordination process with  developers when the vulnerability was made public by the OpenSSL team. As indicated in the blog post, this  sequence of events showed the JPCert team that even though they received the information in a confidential  manner, others may have possessed the same information. This is especially true for open-source products.  Uchiyama (2014) writes, ‘The experiences that I had over this past year have shown me that not only are  more and more people looking for vulnerabilities, but this information is moving around at such high speeds  to a variety of parties, where in some cases, have no idea that another particular group has that  information.’81  75 Sapio, Tim, 2014.  76 Sass, Jeff. 2015. ‘The Role of Static Analysis in Heartbleed.’ SANS Institute.

It also provides the developer with more control over the matter.  Figure 15: Timeline for the discovery and disclosure of Heartbleed  3.1.3 Aftermath of disclosure  The media attention garnered by the Heartbleed bug in 2014 caused quite a stir. In his blog post on  Heartbleed, Kaminsky begins by stating ‘we need to take Matthew Green’s advice, start getting serious about  figuring out what software has become Critical Infrastructure to the global economy, and dedicating genuine  resources to supporting that code.  It took three years to find Heartbleed.  We have to move towards a model  of No More Accidental Finds.’82 ENISA published a flash note called the Heartbleed vulnerability a ‘Wake-up  call’ 83 about cyber security, and in particular about existing critical vulnerabilities which are dormant.  Another point of discussion in the aftermath of the Heartbleed disclosure was the question revolving around  the knowledge of, in particular, the National Security Agency (NSA). Michael Daniel, Special Assistant to the  President and the Cybersecurity Coordinator, described in a blog on the White House website how the US  government had no knowledge of the vulnerability prior to its disclosure.84 This was a primary topic of  discussion shortly after the disclosure of the vulnerability when reports in the media revealed allegations  that the NSA was not only aware of the vulnerability but exploited the vulnerability for its own purposes.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) suit against the NSA  82 Kaminsky, Dan. 2014. ‘Be Still My Breaking Heart.’ Dan Kaminsky’s Blog, 10 April.

The company, which was  the primary discoverer according to the timeline publicly available, was labelled as ‘selfish’ by some IT  security experts.86  According to these experts, Google ‘waited’ for a long time to tell the OpenSSL team and  also played ‘favourites’ by being selective in which private corporations it told about the vulnerability.87 An  interviewee described how it mainly involved a ‘circle of friends.’ While there is a lack of clarity about the  exact date Google researchers discovered the vulnerability, based on publicly information which also  includes Google sources reporting to the media, the vulnerability was discovered by Google researchers  sometime between 1 March and 21 March, but not reported to OpenSSL until 1 April 2014.88 This was at the  very least eleven days later. This appears to be at odds with the official Google policy as described in one of  its blogposts: ‘We always report these cases to the affected vendor immediately, and we work closely with  them to drive the issue to resolution.’89  3.1.3.1 Impact  With such a high-profile vulnerability as Heartbleed, the main question after its disclosure became, ‘what is  its impact?’ IBM security systems characterised Heartbleed as ‘one of the most widespread and impactful  security vulnerabilities of all time.’90 Despite the almost instant availability of a solution for Heartbleed, the  vulnerability remained a potential danger for users because of the ‘ubiquity of OpenSSL.’91 Any delay in the  instalment of the patch meant users remained vulnerable. IBM as a result explains how one-day attacks can  be just as dangerous as zero-day vulnerabilities.92 Users, however, are also dependent on third-party  software vendors to find and resolve the vulnerability.93 Despite the popularity roaming around zero-days,  Ablon et al. (2014) write: ‘Zero-days are not as prevalent as some might advertise, but they are bought and  sold on the black market, if one knows where to find them. What is more prevalent on the black market are  “half-days” (or, as one expert calls them, “1-days” or “2-days”), where the software creator may know of the  vulnerability and a patch may be available, but few users are aware and implementing those patches.’94  According to Donohue (2014), IBM began witnessing attacks targeting the Heartbleed vulnerability on the  same day that the exploit Proof of Concept (PoC) emerged. On 8 April 2014, Jared Stafford published the  PoC for a Heartbleed exploit.95 The PoC was quickly modified and improved.96 Donohue continues by  85 Electronic Foundation Frontier (EFF). 2014. ‘EFF Sues NSA, Director of National Intelligence for Zero Day Disclosure Process.’ EFF,  1 July. https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-sues-nsa-director-national-intelligence-zero-day-disclosure-process  86 Grubb, Ben. 2014. ‘Google accused of being selfish and playing favourites over Heartbleed security bug disclosure.’ The Age, 19  April.

At that time, there were more than 300,000 attacks targeting IBM Managed Security  Services (MSS) clients in one day. After 22 April, attacks slowed down, according to IBM; yet, the company  also indicated how nearly half of all affected systems remain unpatched and that it sees some 7,000 attacks  within MSS each day.97 The Pew Research Center surveyed 1,501 adults living in the United States about  Heartbleed and reported how 39% indicated they had changed their passwords or cancelled accounts, but  that 6% believed their personal information had been compromised.98  Approximately a month after the disclosure, several sources reported that half of the servers remained  unpatched and subsequently vulnerable.99  3.1.3.2 Looking ahead  In March 2015, Krebs reported on a ‘security makeover’ introduced by OpenSSL to fix a number of security  defects.100 The disclosure of these updates is particularly relevant in light of the overarching disclosure  debate. One of the founding partners of OpenSSL, Steve Marquess, indicated that the information would be  shared only with major operating system vendors prior to its public release. As quoted in Krebs, Marquess  describes how ‘We’d like to let everyone know so they can be prepared and so forth, but we have been  slowly driven to a pretty brutal policy of no [advance] disclosure.’101 This brutal policy Marquess refers to  links to a blog post he published after the Heartbleed bug reports and the reactions about the less than ideal  manner of disclosure. In this blog post Marquess details the difficulty encountered by the OpenSSL team to  do its work based on limited financial support. As he writes in his opening statement, ‘As has been well  reported in the news of late, the OpenSSL Software Foundation (OSF) is a legal entity created to hustle  money in support of OpenSSL. By “hustle” I mean exactly that: raising revenue by any and all means.’102  3.2 Sandworm (CVE-2014-4114)  3.2.1 Introduction  In early 2014, a group initially dubbed “Quedagh” grabbed the attention of researchers at F-Secure – an  online security and privacy company based in Helsinki, Finland – and ESET – an IT security company  headquartered in Bratislava, Slovakia. Quedagh’s modus operandi was unique as the group utilised a  modified BlackEnergy trojan, usually connected to cybercriminal activities such as DDoS attacks, spam  distribution, and bank fraud, to infiltrate specific government and private businesses in Ukraine and Poland  for the purpose of network discovery, data collection, and remote code execution. According to F-Secure,  the use of this modified BlackEnergy trojan (now known as Black Energy 3 or lite) for politically-oriented  attacks was particularly intriguing as it provided a ‘greater measure of plausible deniability than is afforded  by a custom-made piece of code.’103 The Quedagh campaign was indeed very sophisticated as it drew on  97 Donohue, Brian. 2014.  98 Rainie, Lee & Maeve Duggan. 2014. ‘Heartbleed’s Impact.’ Pew Research Centre, 30 April.

No other  use of this zero-day exploit is known outside the Sandworm context.  iSIGHT Partners contacted the parties and clients they were able to identify, and started collaborating with  Microsoft on 5 September 2014 to deliver the technical analysis of the exploit concerned and the malware  used in the attacks. Both companies furthermore coordinated the tracking of the group’s activities by  monitoring Sandworm’s targeting behaviour and the broader use of this zero-day exploit in the wild.108  As a result of this collaboration, previously unconnected pieces of information began to reveal a  comprehensive picture of what is now known as the Sandworm campaign. On the basis of overlapping  infrastructure, use of traditional crimeware, and unique references to Dune, iSiGHT Partners were able to  trace the genesis of Sandworm to the year 2009. They were also able to connect the group to various other  attacks on NATO in 2013, targeted attacks on the 2014 GlobeSec Meeting in Bratislava, and the ‘Quedagh’  operation.  3.2.2.1 Zero-day (CVE-2014-4114)  The Windows zero-day exploit used by Sandworm exposed a dangerous vulnerability across all supported  Microsoft Windows systems. According to TrendMicro the vulnerability was located in the PACKAGER.DLL  file which is part of the Windows Object Linking and Embedding property (OLE).109 OLE’s basic functionality  is to make content, such as text, images, and programme files created in one programme available in  another. Sandworm, however, used embedded OLE content to weaponise Microsoft Office documents such  as PowerPoint files. Once opened, the PowerPoint presentation would run in animation mode and execute  OLE objects without prompting additional user action.  The embedded OLE container essentially included a URL that linked to an .INF and a .GIF file (which was  actually a renamed .EXE file) which were automatically downloaded once the PowerPoint file was opened.  The .INF file was used to automatically rename the .GIF into an .EXE file, and created a ‘runonce’ entry in the  system registry which would execute the .EXE file once the system rebooted. The then installed BlackEnergy  malware created a backdoor which enabled remote access for the attacker.  104 F-Secure. 2014.  105 Ward, Stephen. 2014. ‘iSIGHT discovers zero-day vulnerability CVE-2014-4114 used in Russian cyber-espionage.’ iSIGHT  Partners Blog, 14 October.

Users could  choose between disabling the WebClient Sevice,112 blocking TCP ports 139 and 445,113 or blocking launching  executables via setup information files.114 Symantec additionally advised businesses and consumers to  ‘exercise caution when opening email attachments, particularly from unknown sources.’115  The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) ranked the Windows OLE Remote Execution  Vulnerability at a 9.3 (High) base score.116 However, as Ross Barrett, Senior Manager at Rapid7 noted,  Microsoft only called the issue ‘important’ with a patching priority two, which is one level down from urgent  patching and the most severe rating.117 Microsoft’s decision was primarily based on the fact that the exploit  would require a user to click on a file. Qualys on the other hand ranked the exploit as severe, explaining that  ‘it is pretty easy to trick a single person into clicking on a file.’118  3.2.3 Aftermath of disclosure  3.2.3.1 Zero-day Redux (CVE 2014-6352)  On 21 October 2014, Haifei Li at McAfee noted in a blog post that Microsoft’s official patch was not robust  enough to close down the entire zero-day vulnerability exposed by Sandworm119.  Indeed, in cooperation with James Forshaw at Google’s Project Zero, Li reported the issue to Microsoft’s  Security Response Center on 17 October 2014 after successfully developing a proof-of-concept for the still  existing vulnerability gap (CVE 2014-6352). Coinciding with Li’s blog post, Microsoft released a temporary  ‘fix it’ patch, but no further details were provided because no permanent patch was yet available to the  public. On 11 November 2014, Microsoft’s Security Advisory for CVE 2014-6352 was finally updated.  Apparently the zero-day vulnerability also extended to OLE objects in webpages when using Internet  110 'Microsoft's 'Patch Tuesday' generally occurs on the second Tuesday of each month.  111 Ward, Stephen. 2014.  112 Impact: Any service depending on Web Client service will not start  113 Ports 139 and 445 are used for additional services such as Common Internet File Systems, DNS Administration, NetBT service  sessions, printer sharing sessions and more.  114 Impact: Applications that rely on the use of .INF files to execute an installer application may not automatically execute.  115 Symantec Security Response. 2014. ‘Sandworm Windows zero-day vulnerability being actively exploited in targeted attacks.’  Symantec Security Response Blog, 14 October.

In essence if a user was logged on with full administrative rights, ‘an attacker could install  programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.’120  On 16 October 2014, TrendMicro uncovered the fact that Sandworm targeted Supervisory Control and Data  Acquisition (SCADA)-centric systems which used the GE Intelligent Platform CIMPLICTY HMI solution suite.  Further investigation by iSIGHT revealed that WinCC and the Siemens HMI were also targeted with a system- specific BlackEnergy payload. Although TrendMicro clarified that they ‘found no indications that this  malware is actually manipulating physical SCADA systems or their resultant data’,121 the intrusions might  have been reconnaissance work for a future attack.122 According to Wolfgang Kandek, Chief Technology  Officer at Qualys, Sandworm was a reminder to system administrators to ensure that user permissions are  set correctly.123  Figure 16: Timeline for the discovery and disclosure of Sandworm  3.3 Shellshock (CVE-2014-6271)  3.3.1 Introduction  CVE-2014-6271124 was a critical remote code execution vulnerability that was discovered in the widely used  GNU Bourne-Again Shell (or Bash) in September 2014.

Shellshock thus represented a highly  significant security concern when it was discovered and subsequently disclosed.  3.3.1.1 Background  The Bash software was written in 1987 by Brian Fox, a computer programmer, who also maintained the  software for the next five years. In 1992, the maintenance of Bash was handed over to Chet Ramey, currently  a Senior Technology Architect at Case Western Reserve University in the United States.128 Ramey has been  voluntarily maintaining the software as a ‘hobby’ since 1992. The bug appears to have been accidentally  introduced in August 1989 by Fox during an update of Bash.129  The types of systems which were potentially vulnerable as a consequence of the bug included devices such  as standard computers, servers and routers. Even industrial products were at serious risk of compromise, as  indicated by advisory alerts issued by large corporations.130 As a result of lying undetected for almost 25  years, some analysts projected that Bash was built into as many as 70% of computer systems that were  connected to the Internet, running into the hundreds of millions.131 Indeed, one estimate noted that around  50% of all web servers around the world are Unix-based, resulting in approximately 500 million of these  systems that were potentially at risk.132 In summary, Shellshock ‘made benign-seeming server requests into  a full command-and-control situation’,133 and it was ’assumed that most server-based architectures [could  have been] affected.’134  3.3.2 Discovery and disclosure  The vulnerability in Bash was discovered on 12 September 2014 by Stephane Chazelas, an IT Manager and  Unix/open source enthusiast based in Edinburgh, United Kingdom. Chazelas detected the bug after  125 Cygwin provides a Unix-like environment for Microsoft Windows based systems.  126 For example, as the command language interpreter on Unix-based systems, Bash allows users to carry out editing, completion,  integer arithmetic, string-related, and input-output-related tasks.

Shellshock  allowed unauthorised access to ‘infected’ machines, thereby enabling attackers to take control of entire  machines.156 Heartbleed, on the other hand, largely permitted hackers to ‘spy’ on infected systems (for  example, steal passwords). To quote a security researcher, ‘Whereas something like Heartbleed was all  about sniffing what was going on, this was about giving you direct access to the system.… The door’s wide  open.’157 Notably, Shellshock was classified as high impact and low complexity in the NVD’s158 CVSS, and was  given the maximum ratings (10) on the 10-point CVSS impact and exploitability scales.159 By permitting the  remote execution of arbitrary code on affected systems, the critical vulnerability allowed (i) unauthorised  disclosure of information; (ii) unauthorised modification; and (iii) disruption of service.160  As the vulnerability lay undiscovered for more than 25 years, millions of computer systems across the globe  had incorporated and built on top of the ‘flawed’ Bash code, thus explaining the widespread ‘fear factor’  associated with its sudden disclosure in September 2014. The immediate aftermath of the disclosure saw  widespread media coverage around the world warning of the looming impact of the vulnerability on  potentially millions of devices.  Immediately after disclosure, some security companies noted parallel increases in traffic related to the  progression of the validating process (by security researchers), testing of environments (by organisations),  and targeted attacks to take advantage of the vulnerability.161 As Tran (2014) reported, ‘Within hours of the  release of this bug to the general public, attackers reportedly exploited this vulnerability to create botnets  on compromised computers to perform DDos (distributed denial-of-service) and vulnerability scanning.’162  For example, within one day of the disclosure, some attackers had taken advantage of the vulnerability and  had built a botnet (called ‘wobpot’) that targeted systems at the US Department of Defense and Akamai, a  leading US-based content delivery network provider and cloud platform.163 Annex D lists sample text from  some of the advisories and alerts that were issued by various organisations around the world within hours  of the disclosure of the vulnerability.  3.4 POODLE (CVE-2014-3566)  3.4.1 Discovery and disclosure  On 14 October 2014, Google Security team member Bodo Möller, in cooperation with Thai Duong and  Krzysztof Kotowicz, published a vulnerability connected to the 18-year-old Security Socket Layer (SSL) 3.0  protocol which they dubbed ‘Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption [POODLE]’.

A subsequent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack,164 similar to BEAST165, then allowed  encrypted traffic to be decrypted by the attacker (Figure 19).  For all practical purposes SSL 3.0 has long been deemed an obsolete and insecure protocol166 which was  widely replaced by its successors: Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0, TLS 1.1, and TLS 1.2. Indeed, SSL’s only  systemic purpose today is to allow for backwards compatibility to guarantee interoperability with legacy  systems (ex. IE6/XP and older) and for providing a smoother user experience.167  The encryption cypher suits in SSL 3.0 are particularly worrisome as SSL 3.0 either uses a RC4 stream cypher  or an AES CBC-mode bloc cypher. According to Bodo et al. both cyphers are deemed unsafe, and in contrast  to other related forms of attack there was no reasonable workaround for POODLE. As a result Bodo et al.  concluded that ‘to achieve secure encryption, SSL 3.0 must be avoided entirely.’168  164 Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack is an attack where the attacker, unbeknownst to the other parties involved in the  communication, relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating  with each other.  165 BEAST (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS), is an exploit that was practically demonstrated by Julian Rizzo and Thai Duoang at the  2011 Ekoparty Security Conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina. BEAST leverages a weakness in the cypher block chaining (CBC) to  exploit  SSL protocol to decrypt and obtain authentication tokens and cookies from HTTPS requests.  166 Weith, Loren. 2006. ‘Differences between SSLv2, SSLv3, and TLS.

Patching SSL 3.0 would have also been a realistic option, but was quickly  dismissed as being neither feasible nor a sufficiently prompt solution to the problem at hand.170  Google’s servers had been supporting TLS FALLBACK SCSV since February 2014.171 Subsequent versions of  their Chrome browser removed SSL 3.0 completely. Microsoft published a Security Advisory on 14 October  and Mozilla offered a ‘SSL Version Control Firefox extension’ to disable SSL 3.0.172 Oracle recommended to  its customers to permanently disable SSL v3.0. Their quarterly Critical Patch Update disabled SSL 3.0 in the  Java Runtime Environment on 20 January. Cisco released a Security Advisory on 15 October while noting that  they are ‘not aware of any malicious use of the vulnerability.’173 IBM offered an update on 20 October which  disabled SSL 3.0 by default for HIS 7.0 and newer.  For all the attention devoted to the vulnerability, POODLE received a relatively low (4.3 – medium) base  score on the NVD’s174 CVSS.175 The relatively low score underlines that POODLE is indeed tied to specific  scenario parameters which limit exposure. First, an attacker would have to be on the same network as the  user in order to exploit the vulnerability (or gain ISP-level interception through DNS poisoning).176 Secondly,  the user must be running JavaScript.177 And thirdly, client and server must support SSL 3.0.178 Only if these  three conditions are met can a network attacker intercept, for example, encrypted HTTPS session cookies to  hijack secure web sessions.  POODLE in essence offered defenders five vectors of mitigation which were almost equally effective in  closing down the vulnerability: (i) disable SSL 3.0 on the client side; (ii) disable SSL 3.0 on the server side; (iii)  disable SSL 3.0 in Java Script; (iv) Install a TLS Fallback on the Client side; and (v) or install a TLS Fallback on  the server side.  169 Chang, Ziv. 2014. ‘POODLE vulnerability puts online transactions at risk.’ TrendLabs Security Intelligence Blog, 15 October.

Along with seriousness, however, as indicated in the quote above, the likelihood  that a vulnerability can and will be exploited is a potential influential factor on manner of disclosure.  3.4.2.2 POODLE bites again (CVE-2014-8730)  While patches to fix the POODLE vulnerability were gradually implemented, by either disabling SSL 3.0 (thus  relying on TLS to avoid the problem) or by installing a TLS FALLBACK SCSV, Brian Smith (formerly of Mozilla)  raised the notion that these fixes do not necessarily resolve the underlying padding problem. On 17 October  Brian wrote that he fixed a bug in NSS back in 2010, ‘where NSS did not verify all the padding bytes in TLS  1.0 records. Thus, any server that is using a version of NSS released prior to June 2010 is likely vulnerable to  POODLE-like attacks even if SSL 3.0 is completely disabled.’181  In essence the problem came down to an implementation flaw in the CBC encryption mode. SSL 3.0, for  example, under-specifies the content of the CBC padding bytes. Implementations can therefore not check  the padding bytes, which open SSL 3.0 up to an Oracle attack. TLS 1.0 specifications on the other hand do  not specify that implementations must check the padding. That requirement was only added in subsequent  TLS versions. ‘Thus, an implementation could completely conform to TLS 1.0 but still [be] vulnerable to  POODLE.’182 To make the problem worse, while TLS 1.1 and 1.2 implementations must check the padding, it  is not necessarily the case ‘that otherwise-working implementations actually conform to that requirement,  and there's no way for the client to check that in a reliable, high-performance, and accurate way.’183  Adam Langley at Google summarised the issue on 8 December by stating that ‘if an SSLv3 decoding function  was used with TLS, then the POODLE attack would work, even against TLS connections.’184 Langley therefore  concluded that ‘everything less than TLS 1.2 with an AEAD cipher suite is cryptographically broken.’185  Independently from Brian Smith, the problem was also investigated by Yngve Nysaeter Pettersen at Vivaldi.  On December 9, Pettersen noted that 3.6% of servers are vulnerable to a POODLE-style attack even if they  disable SSL 3.0. Whether this concerns all global servers, however, remains unreported. The problem  furthermore compounds with 4.24% of TLS 1.2 servers having the same vulnerability, ‘which means no  rollback attack is needed, at all, when attacking these servers.’186  At Qualys, Ivan Ristic added that ‘the impact of this problem is similar to that of POODLE, with the attack  being slightly easier to execute-no need to downgrade modern clients down to SSL 3 first, TLS 1.2 will do just  179 Finkle, Jim. 2014. ‘New Poodle web threat not seen as menacing as Heartbleed, Shellshock.’ Reuters, 15 October.

Langley noted that while his personal connections allowed him to get in touch quickly with F5, it  took him almost 2 weeks to get in touch with the right person at A10.189  Finding solutions to the extended POODLE exploit was more difficult than getting rid of the original POODLE.  Clients could not simply disable the TLS 1.x protocol as 61% of servers still only supported TLS 1.0.190  Additionally, even servers with TLS 1.2 were vulnerable to the extended POODLE issue. Pettersen therefore  offered two solutions: (1) upgrade to a customised TLS version where the issue has been patched; or (2) use  an extension of the TLS protocol which was released by IETF in early 2014, which changed how encryption  and integrity checking was done.191 Vendors picked up on the first solution by releasing Security Advisories  and providing patches for the devices affected. Qualys updated its free online SSL Server test in order to  detect the TLS problem.192 And TrendMicro advised its users to apply the latest Deep Security Update which  helps to detect traffic from POODLE exploits.193  Figure 20: Timeline for the discovery and disclosure of POODLE  187 Ristic, Ivan. 2014. ‘Poodle Bites TLS.’ Qualys Blog, Security Labs, 8 December.

For some of the vulnerabilities presented above, the disclosure was more a  topic of discussion than it was for others. Google played a leading role in at least two of the case studies:  POODLE and Heartbleed. Whereas there appeared to be no criticism of the manner of disclosure with  respect to POODLE, in the context of Heartbleed, Google’s role in the disclosure process was criticised by  some194. Heartbleed, as indicated through the development of a Special Interest Group (SIG), shed extra  focus on the necessity to better coordinate vulnerability disclosure across the complex landscape.  The vendor-to-vendor disclosure for Sandworm appears to have led to few problems based on available  information. Microsoft and iSIGHT cooperated to track the activities of the group actively using Sandworm,  which allowed them to connect information and develop a more comprehensive overview of the situation.  The delayed public disclosure was based on the desire to let the disclosure coincide with Microsoft’s well- known ‘Patch Tuesday’.  When it comes to lessons learned, Seth Geftic, Senior Manager at RSA, concluded that POODLE has taught  us that ‘effective vulnerability management requires organizations to have a process in place to help very  quickly identify affected systems, including the greatest risks to help prioritize remediation. Having the right  tools in place to gain this visibility and quickly identify the vulnerabilities can make all the difference.’195  Geftic further explains that while the vulnerability was in itself not dangerous, it did provide a compelling  case for an intelligence-driven security strategy. Servers and clients must have a way-of-action to react  immediately upon threat intelligence.196  Another common feature displayed by at least three of the four vulnerabilities is the lengthy period it took  to discover some of these vulnerabilities. Ultimately, Shellshock happened because of a programming  mistake in some computer code that went undetected for more than two decades; critical code that was  being maintained by a single individual in their spare time. Heartbleed also went undetected for a number  of years, as did Sandworm. The examples of Shellshock and Heartbleed pose crucial questions about the  seeming over-reliance of the technology industry (and therefore businesses and consumers) on systems and  products whose software has been ‘built and maintained by small teams often made up of volunteers’197  Some experts have ascribed these issues to the ‘lifecycle problem’ in which bugs in software are continually  neglected because ‘people are making mistakes whilst writing code and making further mistakes when  patching the original problems.’198 These fundamental questions require an answer from individuals beyond  the information security community. Arguably, since a large number of stakeholders rely on these  instruments, responsibility for their security should be borne more broadly.  Clearly, as the case studies have illustrated, there are a number of fundamental challenges associated with  the disclosure of vulnerabilities. These are investigated in more detail in Chapter 4.  194 The study team did not have an opportunity to discuss these case studies with Google to also include their perspective on the  matter.  195 Geftic, Seth, 2014.  196 Geftic, Seth, 2014.  197 Lee, Dave. 2014.  198 Lee, Dave. 2014.

Challenges in the vulnerability disclosure landscape  4.1 Introduction  Chapter 2 has already provided an insight into the challenging landscape of vulnerability disclosure. This  chapter provides more information about specific challenges identified by the interviewees of this study.  The first step towards improving vulnerability disclosure is to develop an overview of the challenges that  different stakeholders face. These challenges are, due to competing or conflicting interests, largely  subjective. Yet, as has become evident from the interviewees’ responses, certain challenges are experienced  by specific stakeholders while there are several overarching issues that the broader information security  community faces. Those commonalities offer room for improvement because they are shared challenges.  The analysis presented in this chapter aims to highlight the challenges that have been identified by  interviewees based on their experience. The interviews are therefore the primary source of data for the  content of chapters 4 to 6. For reasons of continuity, the project team has tried to refrain from continually  referring to the interviewees and to do so only sparingly. The analysis has also been supplemented by  information gathered from the literature.  The key findings are summarised in the box below.  Key findings: what are the challenges encountered in the vulnerability disclosure landscape?   Legal challenges: Individuals who discover a vulnerability often face legal threats when they  decide to report it. These threats can have implications on not only civil and criminal law but also  contract law, licensing, patent law and other types of legislation. Discoverers may find themselves  in a grey area due to the methods used to discover the vulnerability and the way the vulnerability  was disclosed.   Lack of vendor ‘maturity’: Whereas large companies familiar within the information technology  environment have robust processes in place for vulnerability reporting, other companies are new  to the scene. These may be small companies, or companies which have not previously been part  of the information technology landscape. This could lead to a lack of maturity on the part of these  players and potentially complicate the vulnerability disclosure eco-system, as less mature  companies are ill-prepared to accept vulnerability reports and act upon them in the interest of the  information security community.   Lack of researcher maturity: Just as vendors may lack experience in accepting vulnerability  reports, so researchers can lack experience in reporting vulnerabilities. When such experience is  absent, researchers may approach vendors in a threatening or otherwise non-conducive manner  which prevents fruitful cooperation. Researchers who lack experience may also be unwilling to  compromise on, for example, timelines identified by the vendor.   Incoming vulnerability reports are not always taken into consideration by the vendors: Due to  subjective reasons, vendors may disregard reports about a vulnerability. Vulnerabilities may be  labelled as academic and theoretical and interest for a previously disregarded vulnerability  report might increase after a security incident has happened.   Vulnerability acquisition for national intelligence purposes: Unpatched vulnerabilities can be  used by criminals but also potentially by national intelligence or law enforcement officials. This  means that sometimes a vulnerability will remain undisclosed for such (national) security  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  50  purposes. Yet while a vulnerability remains undisclosed to the vendor, so will the development of  a solution remain absent, leaving users in general vulnerable.   Users do not implement patches (in a timely manner): Once a vulnerability is disclosed by the  vendor, and a solution such as a patch to be installed via an update is available, the user must  implement it. Such implementation is essential for the vulnerability to be resolved; a lack of  implementation leaves users even more vulnerable since information about the vulnerability is  now public. Users have a tendency, for a variety of reasons, to postpone or to negate patching  altogether. This may be because of a lack of understanding or knowledge. Furthermore, it could  be more important to keep the average patch application time as short as possible rather than  solely focusing on the disclosure timeline.   Discoverer motivation varies: The motivation for an individual to discover a vulnerability varies.  The motivation of the discoverer can influence the decision s/he makes regarding what to do with  the vulnerability. The increase in bug bounty programmes and the growing zero-day market have  increasingly placed a focus on monetary reward. This may lead to over-incentivising the search for  vulnerabilities and may also lead to the expectation that discoverers will always receive a  monetary reward for their discovery.  4.2 Challenges  4.2.1 Legal challenges  The aim of this section is to give the reader a glimpse into some of the legal issues in the context of  vulnerability disclosure (e.g. copyright law). Information provided seeks to provide general guidance to some  of the legal aspects, but not as legal advice as such; certainly it doesn’t constitute an exhaustive analysis of  the issues at hand.  Several interviewees identified legal challenges as a primary issue of concern in the vulnerability landscape.  The main source of such challenges is determined by the activities underpinning the discovery and disclosure  of a vulnerability. Such activities may be formally classified as ‘illegal’ and as such introduce problems when  the discoverer reports the vulnerability. As vendors are trying to protect their intellectual property, these  kind of problems might emerge. Moussouris suggests that ‘When vendors lack a process and ability to  receive, investigate, remediate, and communicate about security vulnerabilities, often the first reaction is to  call in the lawyers.’199 She describes an example where vendors made use of the Digital Millennium  Copyright Act (DMCA)200 to intimidate a security researcher. This particular case concerned security  researcher Mike Davis from IOActive, who along with some colleagues discovered security vulnerabilities in  electronic locks made by CyberLock. Davis and his colleagues tried to contact and disclose their findings to  the company but to no avail. Instead, the researchers received a letter from the company’s law firm, Jones  Day, the day before they planned on publicly releasing the vulnerabilities.201 The lawyers make reference to  a provision in the DMCA which makes it illegal to circumvent digital rights technology designed to protect  copyrighted work. It is perhaps useful to note in this case that the vendor sells physical devices with  199 Moussouris, Katie. 2015. ‘Vulnerability Disclosure Deja Vu: Prosecute Crime Not Research.’ DarkReading, 12 May.

This vendor had not previously been confronted with a situation of  vulnerability disclosure by a reporter. As such, legal challenges introduced are closely connected to the  challenge of vendor maturity (see 4.2.2).  According to interviewees, when a legal team gets involved, the response can often be heavy-handed largely  due to the lack of knowledge of, and sensitivity to, the technical aspects of vulnerabilities. Lawyers may  immediately claim the reporter should not have looked at the code as they attempt to detach the  organisation from accountability. They do not reject the existence of the vulnerabilities discovered or the  insecure nature of the code, rather through legal argumentation they aim to avoid having to repair the code  and patch the vulnerability. This may be due to potentially high costs associated with resolving the  vulnerability.  Another concern identified is the Wassenaar Arrangement,202 a multilateral export control regime that  requires the licensing of dual-use goods and technologies including military equipment, special materials  etc. In December 2014, certain types of intrusion control software were put on the dual-use goods and  technologies list.203 The wording of the control list implies that exploits are within the scope of the list. That  means that anyone operating in the 41 parties204 to the Wassenaar Arrangement would need an export  licence to speak about zero-day exploits or essentially any vulnerability reporting on the internet. The fear  is that the requirement of an export license will not only affect the sale of exploits, but also the existence of  bug bounty programmes. Wassenaar formulates some exemptions, although not for bug bounty  programmes. In contrast to the situation in the United States, the European manner of implementation may  exempt bug bounty programmes. At this moment (status end of 2015), the situation is uncertain.  Overall, various stakeholders have indicated how the present and proposed legal climate in various  jurisdictions does not favour improved security of the information security ecosystem.  A positive example in the EU comes from The Netherlands, where the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)  published its guidance to promote the increase of coordinated disclosure, has made the topic an issue of  public discussion. This led to a response by the Dutch Public Prosecutor’s (DPP) office which sent a letter to  all its departments informing them of the matter205. The letter indicates how the notion of ethical hacking  is not a concept which can be found in criminal law in the Netherlands, nor anywhere else, most likely. The  concept of ethical hacking implies that prior authorization be given by the system owner to the ethical hacker  before testing the security of the systems; such an arrangement can be corroborated by a service contract  directly or indirectly with the ethical hacker and the requesting vendor. While Dutch penal law does not  recognise the concept of ethical hacking, the letter states that ethical motives can play a role in the  determination whether an action constitutes a violation of criminal law. If a hacker finds a vulnerability and  reports this vulnerability to the vendor, then this is in principle ethical hacking. However, if a hacker reports  a vulnerability and there are indications that the hacker has done more, whether intentionally or  unintentionally, then a criminal investigation will probably take place. ‘Done more’ refers for example to  copying of sensitive data or personally identifying information.  202 Wassenaar Arrangement. n.d. ‘Introduction.’ As of 8 October 2015: http://www.wassenaar.org/introduction/index.html  203 European Commission. 2014. ‘Commission updates EU control list on dual use items.’ Trade, Dual Use Control, 22 October.

In the letter there is a clear message that  reporting a vulnerability does not absolve the reporter from subsequent prosecution or legal investigation.  The letter has made the public prosecutor visible in the discussion, as noted by an interviewee, which is  valuable in and of itself. The discoverer community responded positively towards the development because  even if the letter does not provide carte blanche, it has demonstrated to the discoverer community that the  public prosecutor’s office is seriously thinking about the issue and how best to approach it.  In short, the letter instructs public prosecutors to take the following aspects into consideration:  Figure 21: Letter from the Dutch Public Prosecutor’s office on responsible disclosure206  The study team did not find other examples of public prosecutors providing such an explicit explanation of  how they treat vulnerability disclosure cases.  4.2.2 Vendor ‘maturity’ varies  A central theme throughout many of the interviews was the issue of vendor maturity. Having various levels  of vendor maturity presents a challenge. The difference between a mature and a less mature vendor is the  ability of the organisation to cope with receiving a vulnerability report about one of its products. While  discussions around vulnerability disclosure have been taking place for several years and have not  fundamentally changed, new players have nevertheless appeared on the scene. A large number of vendors  have not been privy to the debate as long as others, which means they are now going through the early  phase of discovering how to respond to vulnerability reports. Interviewees mentioned examples of cases  and companies such as car, aeroplane and refrigerator manufacturers, as well as vendors who manufacture  medical devices. The latter point is crucial since, as an interviewee indicated, this goes beyond ‘my credit  206 Openbaar Ministerie. 2013b, 18 March. Letter to: Aan alle parkethoofden, As of 8 October 2015:  https://www.om.nl/publish/pages/22742/03_18_13_beleidsbrief_college_responsible_disclosure.pdf  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  53  card has been stolen’. As another interviewee stated on the topic of vendor maturity, ‘While Microsoft, Cisco,  Oracle, Apple and Google are familiar with that process, perhaps others are not familiar with it. They may  not have a security contact point and do not understand the whole disclosure process.’ There was specific  reference to the rapidly emerging Internet of Things207 domain as an area where immature vendors are at  risk in terms of vulnerability disclosure, because they are ‘new to the scene’ and have not reached a state  where they have the infrastructure in place and the willingness to deal with vulnerability reports.  Size of the vendor also matters as a factor of influence for maturity. One of the biggest challenges is for  discoverers to report a vulnerability to a small company that may not have prior experience of such a  process. Discoverers who do report vulnerabilities to smaller companies often find themselves ‘staring down  the barrel of legal threats’, as an interviewee noted (see 4.2.1).  An associated challenge with lack of vendor maturity is the ability to find the right contact person.  Sometimes organisations end up speaking to someone from the marketing department rather than a more  technically-inclined employee who is able to understand the vulnerability report. For organisations without  security awareness, discoverers are in a difficult position in identifying the right person to speak to when  reporting the vulnerability.  Maturity is required by different stakeholders to engage in vulnerability disclosure in an ethical and timely  fashion. Elaborating on this point, one interviewee stated how the vendor must engage in an open and  nonthreatening way to communicate, and that vendors must have a ‘plan’ (see 5.3.2). This also leads to a  second challenge identified during the interviews: the maturity of discoverers or researchers.  4.2.3 Researcher maturity varies  The challenge of varying levels of maturity also applies to researchers or discoverers of vulnerabilities.  Younger and inexperienced individuals who have not been part of the security community may not know  what to do and how to report a vulnerability. They may be faced with procedural as well as ethical and legal  questions. Recent graduates, as well as other younger or inexperienced reporters, may be unsure of their  options and may report to vendors in a ‘threatening’ way. Less mature discoverers may be unreasonable in  their treatment of timelines as identified by vendors. They may be more inclined to go to full disclosure  without having exhausted all their options; or perhaps they may be induced into selling a vulnerability on  the underground market. Responsiveness has to come from both sides.  Another interviewee echoed the challenge of having different levels of experience among discoverers. There  are several main groups that find vulnerabilities and know how to handle them well. Simultaneously, there  are many researchers who find one or two vulnerabilities per year and remain uncertain about how to handle  them. Moreover, some researchers may also lack the time to contact the project or the vendor and properly  explain the vulnerability.  4.2.4 Incoming vulnerability reports are not always taken into consideration by the vendors  Closely connected to the previous two challenges is that incoming vulnerability disclosure reports are not  taken into consideration by the vendors due to subjective matters. Even with large vendors, vulnerabilities  207 ‘The Internet of Things builds out from today’s internet by creating a pervasive and self-organising network of connected,  identifiable and addressable physical objects, enabling application development in and across key vertical sectors through the use  of embedded chips, sensors, actuators and low-cost miniaturisation.’ [Schindler, Helen R., Jonathan Cave, Neil Robinson, Veronika  Horvath, Petal Hackett, Salil Gunashekar, Maarten Botterman, Simon Forge and Hans Graux. 2012.

This is connected to another challenge mentioned by an interviewee that concerns the cost of rectifying a  vulnerability. He describes a situation where his organisation discovered a vulnerability in a car system which  was not severe, i.e. would not stop the brakes from functioning or similar, but to properly fix the vulnerability  required the recall of all affected cars. Such a recall is a costly endeavour, which means the manufacturer  may decide, based on the severity, to tolerate the vulnerability. Yet to express such tolerance in public may  be deemed unacceptable.  4.2.5 Vulnerability acquisition for national intelligence leaves users vulnerable  During the research for this report, the breach of the Hacking Team208 came to light and served to illuminate  a challenge several of the interviewees identified, albeit to varying degrees. This concerns the allegation that  some governments acquire and use vulnerabilities for national intelligence and/or law enforcement  purposes. According to some interviewees, this activity may pose a threat as vulnerabilities could remain  unresolved, leaving users vulnerable. Further, the suspicions about law enforcement or intelligence use of  vulnerabilities may impact the level of trust placed in national CSIRTs (see 2.5.2). Despite such concerns,  other interviewees recognised that governments may feel it is necessary to exploit vulnerabilities to access  relevant information, if it serves national intelligence or law enforcement purposes. Some may consider this  acceptable, since exploitation of vulnerabilities may intrude on users’ privacy less than, for example,  decryption of internet traffic.  4.2.6 Users do not implement patches (in a timely manner)  Even though the challenge of getting users to actually implement the patches goes beyond the vulnerability  disclosure phase, it is an essential aspect which also contains implications for how vendors handle disclosure.  Despite vendor provision of information about the vulnerability and its solution, some customers still  postpone the application of patches. According to an interviewee, there needs to be more trust in the vendor  by the customer, especially with respect to organisations operating within critical infrastructure sectors, to  apply patches as soon as possible. Any delay in patching enhances the criticality of the vulnerability since  the disclosure has placed the information about the vulnerability in the public domain, allowing any  perpetrator who was previously unaware of the vulnerability to attempt to exploit it (see 3.1.3.1). The  importance of immediate implementation became evident through, for example, Heartbleed, where IBM  security systems explained how one-day attacks can be just as dangerous as zero-day exploits.209 Despite  the existence of a patch, without its implementation users are still vulnerable. And since perpetrators are  aware of the vulnerability and the potential delay of users to immediately implement patches, they could  ‘strike while the iron is hot.’ One interviewee noted that it is more important to keep the average patch  application time as short as possible rather than solely focus on the disclosure timeline. The interviewee  further emphasised that the timeline is ‘completed’ not when vulnerability patches are made available by  vendors, but when they have been applied by users. Therefore, the interviewee recommended that vendors  prioritise an effective application of patches by users over a strict adherence to timelines for patch releases,  in order to minimise patch ‘recalls’ and ensure a comprehensive vulnerability fix. Auto-update was  welcomed by another interviewee precisely because users are prone to delay patching. Yet there may be  other challenges associated with such a feature. Although not mentioned by interviewees, there may be  other reasons for delayed patching of vulnerabilities by users, such as lack of understanding or knowledge,  208 http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/07/massive-leak-reveals-hacking-teams-most-private-moments-in-messy-detail/  209 Donohue, Brian. 2014.  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  55  which means that education may be a suitable means to assist users in patching vulnerabilities in a more  timely manner.  4.2.7 Discoverer motivation varies  The motivation of discoverers varies, which is another challenge in the vulnerability disclosure landscape.  Opinions differ on what drives researchers and others who discover vulnerabilities. According to one  interviewee, there are typically three types of motivators for researchers to discover vulnerabilities. The first  is a willingness to improve the security industry and the overall security ecosystem. Simultaneously,  discoverers in this category will also want to develop a good track record of finding and disclosing  vulnerabilities in order to enter the industry. The second category is more ego-driven. This type of  researcher, according to the interviewee, is more concerned about showing off their skills to the world. The  third group is seduced by the black market of vulnerability retail. Another interviewee recognises the  diversity of reasons why researchers are looking for or discovering vulnerabilities. According to him, the  community needs to be able to cater to all of the reasons that may drive researchers. He, however, believes  that only a few are focused on monetary rewards. This is a point of contention since money does seem to  play a key role. As another interviewee commented, ‘There is a small concern, and I don’t know if this will  bear out, but if it is common practice to always pay for a vulnerability, could that turn the incentives around  and people would be less likely to disclose because they are not getting enough money or because they  cannot find a buyer?’ There is at least anecdotal evidence for this. As described by Perlroth, ‘simply crediting  hackers or sending them swag no longer cuts it.’210 Ramses Martinez, Yahoo’s director of security, said he  started Yahoo’s bounty programme in 2013 after two hackers criticised Yahoo for sending them T-shirts in  exchange for four bugs that could have brought them thousands of dollars on the black market. Martinez  says he now considers bug bounties a “no-brainer”.’211  There are other concerns about paying for vulnerabilities. Through the introduction of bug bounty  programmes and vulnerability reward programmes, as well as the zero-day market, there are financial  incentives to discover and sell vulnerabilities. This may lead to an oversupply of vulnerabilities as the market  develops further. Therefore, caution is advised to avoid over-incentivising the search for vulnerabilities  because it may lead to a high number of ‘minor’ vulnerabilities which once discovered need to be addressed.  The overwhelming number may then divert scarce resources from more critical vulnerabilities which can  cause greater harm.  210 Perlroth, Nicole. 2015.  211 Perlroth, Nicole. 2015.  http://www.zdnet.com/article/yahoo-changes-bug-bounty-policy-following-t-shirt-gate/  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  56  5. Good practices for stakeholders active in vulnerability disclosure  5.1 Introduction  To establish a bridge between challenges and recommendations for improvement, this chapter explores a  selection of good practices identified by interviewees. These good practices are often closely associated with  the challenges and the recommendations for improvement, which means there is some overlap. This chapter  will allow different stakeholders to better understand what practices they can implement with the intent of  improving the overall vulnerability ecosystem. There is a primary focus on vendors and discoverers.  A list of the good practices identified have been summarised in the box below:  Good practices for stakeholders active in the vulnerability disclosure landscape   Use existing documents: Previous efforts have been made to gather good practices in the area of  vulnerability disclosure as well as to describe how to set up a vulnerability disclosure policy. To  prevent reinvention of the wheel, these documents should be used by stakeholders and should be  leveraged more by new initiatives. The ISO standards are a prominent example, although their lack  of free availability may hamper their reach.   Communication  Vendors should be reachable/have a point of contact: To prevent reporters from having to  spend valuable time and resources looking for the appropriate contact, vendors should have a  clear point of contact to deal with vulnerability reports, and this contact should be reachable.  Have a policy in place: Vendors should have a policy in place which addresses vulnerability  disclosure and describes how they respond to vulnerability reports. This policy will also indicate  to reporters what information they need to provide as well as give an insight into the process  of the disclosure.  Communication with different stakeholders: Communication with stakeholders requires  mutual respect, patience and transparency. Continual communication is essential to  acknowledge receipt of the vulnerability report as well as provide an indication of the next  steps.   Information dissemination: Information about the vulnerability as well as its solution, if available,  should be disseminated to inform users of the developments and to provide them with an  opportunity to protect themselves. How much information needs to be disseminated is a topic of  discussion among stakeholders.   Timelines: Timelines vary but a timeline should be mutually agreed upon (on a vulnerability-by- vulnerability basis) to ensure that a vulnerability will be sufficiently addressed by the vendor in a  timely manner.   Flexibility in reporting and disclosing: No one size fits all in the area of vulnerability disclosure, so  flexibility is necessary to tailor the vulnerability report as well as the response to the specifics of  the vulnerability.  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  57  5.2 Use existing documents  When asked about good practices for vulnerability disclosure, several interviewees identified existing  documents which contain good practices. One example is the Organization of Internet Safety (OIS)  document.212 According to an interviewee this provides a ‘pretty good framework’ for how responsible  disclosure ought to be carried out. Simultaneously, though the interviewee recognised the need for  refreshment of the document, he emphasised how the community should not ‘reinvent the wheel’ but  rather use what already exists and share it with stakeholders in a more active manner. Better-known  examples of good practice frameworks for vulnerability disclosure are two International Standards  Organisation (ISO) standards. These are ISO 29147213 and ISO 30111,214 which one interviewee recognised  as ‘good reference documents.’ The intention of both standards is to inform vendors who are in the process  of creating a vulnerability-handling and disclosure scheme. Larger vendors, governments and enterprises  helped to put the standards together. Some interviewees identified the ISO standards and appeared to credit  them with some value, whereas another interviewee stated how the ISO standard has had ‘very little’  impact. Although the interviewee recognised how these good practices, shared by the larger vendors, are  successful, their impact is limited. The value of the ISO standard is in bringing these practices to smaller  vendors, but this comes at a cost. ISO standards are not free and access requires payment of a fee. The  interviewee identified this as a big problem, ‘because in security information technology pretty much all the  standards are free, open, and available. It is thus to ISO’s detriment that its standards are not freely available.  If they were they would be much more usable for smaller organisations.’ Moreover, the interviewee stated  how he did not believe there was a lot of guidance on good practices for vulnerability disclosure. There are  other relevant documents such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Responsible Vulnerability  Disclosure Process;215 vulnerability disclosure processes of experienced organisations may also help to  illuminate some of the aspects for less mature organisations.216  This study aims to therefore enhance the availability of such guidance on good practices and to stimulate  improvement of the vulnerability disclosure situation through the dissemination of such practices as well as  the identification of challenges and associated recommendations for improvement.  212 Organization for Internet Safety. 2004.  213 ISO/IEC 29147:2014 provides guidelines for the ‘disclosure of potential vulnerabilities in products and online services.

Organisations  responsible for engagement with reporters (or potential reporters) of vulnerabilities spend a lot of time and  energy trying to find the right contact. This has led to at least one organisation, according to its own  testimony, sending recorded physical mail to locations so they can obtain a return receipt, which makes it  more difficult for vendors to ignore them.  5.3.2 Have a specific policy in place to deal with the disclosure process  There is a preference to go beyond merely a primary point of contact and for vendors to have a specific  policy in place that details how they handle vulnerabilities which discoverers report to them. It was noted  that such a policy should also include another good practice mentioned, which is communication with the  discoverer (see 5.3.3). A specific policy must at least address the following aspects:   Point of contact   Information required from the reporter   Possible responses from the vendor   Timeline of the process.  Closely related is the necessity – as an organisation – to have good arrangements with suppliers. This is  because sometimes a vulnerability can surface in a third-party system which is outside the user’s direct  control, and to act quickly arrangements with such suppliers and service providers must be in place to  determine how to handle the situation.  5.3.3 Communication with different stakeholders  Communication with the different stakeholders is key in terms of good practice. With respect to discoverers,  communication with the discoverer is crucial to ensure the process does not lead to unexpected outcomes.  Vendors need to be very clear about their expectations with regard to discoverers. Expectations should be  made explicit by companies, preferably through a statement on their website. Once a vulnerability has been  reported to a vendor, the company should respond as soon as possible and then keep the discoverer in the  loop as far as is practicable for the vendor or coordinator, and desirable for the discoverer. The OIS states  that within a maximum of seven calendar days of receiving a finder’s report, the vendor should acknowledge  its receipt.217  Even if a fix is not (yet) available, it is important to communicate the status to the discoverer and to  acknowledge that the organisation is working on the issue.  Just as communication with the discoverer is a  central element, so is communication with the vendor, as well as with other companies.  5.4 Information dissemination must occur, but opinions differ on how much  With respect to users of products, publishing information about vulnerabilities is crucial. Many vendors  worry about publishing vulnerabilities discovered in their products, out of fear that such publication reflects  poorly on them; as if they have made a mistake and criminals or others with malicious intent will take  advantage of it. An interviewee describes how he and his colleagues respond by stating: ‘First you are not  alone, no one writes perfect software. All software has security vulnerabilities. The maturity marker is that  you actually acknowledge them and fix them quickly. And provide your customers with a fix. That is what you  want to be measured on and not the fact that you had 10 bugs or zero-bugs or whatever.’ He goes on to  217 Organization for Internet Safety. 2004.  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  59  state that even if a vendor decides not to take any action or disagrees on the existence of a vulnerability, it  is important to be transparent.  The decision to publish information is driven by the desire to reduce the impact of the vulnerability on  society, whether business or consumers. Yet with users not implementing patches in a timely manner (see  4.2.6), the dilemma becomes how much information to share since it is difficult – as noted by an interviewee  – ‘to share enough to enlighten the public and not to stimulate attackers to use it or let them figure out where  they would get that further intelligence information.’ Another interviewee emphasised the need to provide  only the information that users actually need to determine whether the vulnerability affects them; and to  understand the impact if they decide not to apply the vulnerability patch. Technical details, for example, are  not provided to users because it is not necessary, according to the interviewee. This is, however, a source of  disagreement. Determining the appropriate amount of detail to disclose was also described by another  interviewee as a challenge. According to him, however, the decision how much information to disclose is up  to the researcher rather than the vendor, at least after the vulnerability has been addressed.  Another  interviewee explicitly stated how he would like all open source vendors to provide the technical details about  the vulnerabilities they fix. He describes further how, 'Some vendors operating on the limits of open and  closed source definitions have secretive practices that effectively harm the community's and other vendor's  abilities to assess and report their own versions of those software packages. We are left with \"open\" projects  that are effectively secretive dumps of code with no explanations.’  Information dissemination is therefore considered good practice, but how much, to whom and in what form,  remains an area of discussion. Zetter describes a situation between FireEye and ERNW – both information  security firms. ERNW described in a blogpost in September 2015, according to Zetter, how FireEye issued a  court injunction against ERNW. Even though FireEye agreed that ERNW could disclose its discovery of three  vulnerabilities in FireEye products, the dispute concerns the amount of information ERNW can publicise  about the vulnerabilities.218 Perhaps the question of how much information to disseminate ought to be  carefully assessed on case-by-case basis by each party involved in the process. Arguably, information output  needs to be improved because, as an interviewee indicated, companies are drowning in information.  Information needs to be more tailored. As one interviewee described it, ‘Let’s be clear on what it is. Whether  it’s important or not and what you need to do. Otherwise we are spinning wheels for nobody’s benefit. Just  that difference between do I have to update today, is it real, is it relevant, is it theoretical, do we think it can  get real…we need to distil it down. The world is drowning in information overload.’  5.5 Timelines lead to results  There appears to be a consensus that timelines are a necessary part of vulnerability disclosure and can  therefore be identified as a good practice. Without timelines, certain vendors may not address the  vulnerability at all. Providing vendors with short embargos for the development of a solution keeps them  ‘on top of their game’, since they cannot ‘sit’ on a vulnerability for months without a response. While a  timeline is not a guarantee that a vendor will address the vulnerability, it does often lead to results, i.e. an  actual response from the vendor and subsequent action to address the vulnerability.  It is, however, also important to note that when reporters disclose unfixed vulnerability information upon  the expiration of a timeline, users and customers of corresponding vendors are exposed to increased risk of  attack. Therefore, there needs to be agreement among the vendor community about reasonable timelines  to address a particular vulnerability, and continued collaboration with the reporter in addressing the  vulnerability. Timelines must take into account the different nature of distinct vulnerabilities as well as the  218 Zetter, Kim. 2015c. ‘A Bizarre Twist in the Debate over Vulnerability Disclosures.’ Wired, 11 September. As of 8 October 2015:  http://www.wired.com/2015/09/fireeye-enrw-injunction-bizarre-twist-in-the-debate-over-vulnerability-disclosures/  http://www.wired.com/2015/09/fireeye-enrw-injunction-bizarre-twist-in-the-debate-over-vulnerability-disclosures/  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  60  products in which they are discovered. They must involve regular communication with the reporter to ensure  a degree of flexibility, should unexpected complications arise. As an interviewee said, ‘one timeline for all  type of vendors is unrealistic’ and timelines should be agreed between vendors and reporters on a case-by- case basis. The OIS also testifies to this in its Guidelines for Security Vulnerability Reporting and Response,  when it writes: ‘There is no single universally appropriate timeframe for investigating and remedying security  vulnerabilities.’219 Timelines help facilitate a timely response. Large vendors are reasonably good at  acknowledging vulnerabilities, working to generate solutions, and disclosing the information (see 4.2.2).  Wider adoption of this approach is needed by other organisations and industries to harmonise and  streamline the process.  Project Zero220  Even though this report aims to refrain from endorsing any particular initiative introduced by vendors, some  interviewees specifically identified Google’s Project Zero as a potential example of ‘good practice.’ Project Zero is a  security research team at Google consisting of individuals who are specialised in vulnerability research and software  exploitation. The team’s mission is to ’make 0day hard.’ This is motivated by the observation that (1) software  exploits are increasingly traded in a private market that is not accessible to software vendors and open-source  projects, and that (2) software exploits traded in this manner result in user harm. Project Zero has discovered and  managed disclosure of over 250 security vulnerabilities in a wide variety of products since the team's formation in  July 2014.  The main good practice identified by interviewees about Google’s Project Zero is the clarity, especially with respect  to the Project’s timeline. Project Zero uses a 90-day disclosure deadline on all of its vulnerability reports. If 90 days  elapse without a broadly available patch, then the bug report will automatically become visible to the public. There  are exceptions however. In February 2015, Project Zero updated its policy to include a grace period of 14 days.221  As the team writes in a blogpost, ‘If a 90-day deadline will expire but a vendor lets us know before the deadline that  a patch is scheduled for release on a specific day within 14 days following the deadline, the public disclosure will be  delayed until the availability of the patch. Public disclosure of an unpatched issue now only occurs if a deadline will  be significantly missed (2 weeks+).’222 The Project Zero team believes that on balance this is the optimal approach  for user security. The timeline provides vendors with a ‘fair’ and ‘reasonable’ length of time to engage in the  vulnerability management process but simultaneously acknowledging the urgency introduced by private bug  collisions.  5.6 Flexibility of reporting and disclosing  The timeline discussion has already briefly indicated how flexibility in terms of the way a vulnerability is  reported and subsequently treated is key, since no one size fits all vulnerabilities and their disclosures.  Interestingly, however, flexibility – according to some – should be on the side of the discoverer rather than  the vendor. From this perspective, the discoverer is at liberty to determine what flexibility is required for the  vulnerability. Yet flexibility, just as responsiveness, ought to be a two-way street to ensure there is common  ground for achievement of the ultimate outcome. The discoverer may, for example, be insufficiently aware  of the effort needed to develop a patch, and the implications of its release. Flexibility is also required, for  example, with respect to patching for critical infrastructure sectors, which is more complicated and  therefore requires more time for vendors to develop a patch. Flexibility is also necessary for other  219 Organization for Internet Safety. 2004.  220 For more info: https://cansecwest.com/slides/2015/Project%20Zero%20-%20making%200day%20hard%20- %20Ben%20Hawkes.pdf  221 Evans, Chris, Ben Hawkes, Heather Adkins, Matt Moore, Michael Zalewski & Gerhard Eschelbeck. 2015. ‘Feedback and data- driven updates to Google’s disclosure policy.’ Project Zero, 13 February.  http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/02/feedback-and-data-driven-updates-to.html  222 Evans et al., 2015.  https://cansecwest.com/slides/2015/Project%20Zero%20-%20making%200day%20hard%20-%20Ben%20Hawkes.pdf https://cansecwest.com/slides/2015/Project%20Zero%20-%20making%200day%20hard%20-%20Ben%20Hawkes.pdf http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/02/feedback-and-data-driven-updates-to.html  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  61  stakeholders, such as users or third parties involved in the development and subsequent dispatching of the  patch.

Recommendations for improvement  6.1 Introduction  The exploitation of vulnerabilities discovered in systems will continue to pose security risks, with potentially  damaging economic and societal impacts. Therefore it becomes all the more important that the various  stakeholders involved in this complex environment attempt to address – together – the various challenges  that are encountered in the vulnerability disclosure landscape. From the perspective of the security and trust  of the end-users of systems, there is consensus that vulnerabilities must be disclosed in a way that minimises  damage. Although movement towards more and better coordinated vulnerability disclosure has been  happening to some extent for several years now, the landscape is still ‘fragmented’ in many ways, and there  are pertinent questions that remain unanswered. The synthesis of the various sources of evidence used in  our analysis shows that there are several areas for consideration. This chapter outlines these  recommendations for improving the status quo in the vulnerability disclosure landscape. It is important to  highlight that our intention is not to prescribe detailed and specific actions, but rather to raise the key issues  which require careful consideration by all stakeholders involved in the vulnerability disclosure community.  For every recommendation, the study team has also identified the potential role for ENISA, which is a  determination based on input from interviewees as well as analysis from the team.  The core recommendations for improvement have been summarised in the box below.  Core recommendations for improvement from the analyses   The community must facilitate the improvement of vendor maturity: To make progress, vendor  maturity must be improved to ensure that all vendors are able to receive vulnerability reports and  respond to them in a manner which is accepted by the community and which will introduce the  smallest risks with respect to the security of users. In this context the term community refers to  different relevant stakeholders like EU Member States, vendors, security researchers, national  CSIRTs and ENISA. To improve vendor maturity, the community must stimulate less mature  vendors to introduce a policy and set up an infrastructure which allows them to accept  vulnerability reports.   Internationalisation through policy learning: The global nature of the internet requires a more  transnational approach to the topic of vulnerability disclosure, where successful cases in certain  countries or regions can be used for policy learning purposes in other areas of the world.  Simultaneously, stakeholder gatherings at the transnational level can use their international  access to further enhance such policy learning, and so allow the spread of good practices in  vulnerability disclosure.   Introduction of a neutral third party or enhancement of existing coordination centres: The  different interests held by stakeholders – especially reporters and vendors – as well as the growing  complexity of the landscape, both in terms of stakeholders and products, advocates the  introduction of a neutral third party to coordinate vulnerability disclosure. An alternative is to  enhance existing coordination centres, to ensure that power discrepancies as well as potential  conflicts of interest will not compromise the overarching goal of improved information security.   European policy makers and Member States should improve the legal landscape: The current  legal framework poses challenges for stakeholders involved in the disclosure process, as varying  requirements across jurisdictions need to be aligned, in order to facilitate information security and  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  63  stimulate market growth. In this direction the current legal framework needs to be reviewed for  requirements that pose obstacles rather than facilitating the processing of vulnerabilities.   Vendors should facilitate trust building, transparency and openness: From a vendor’s  perspective, the stigma associated with acknowledging that one of its products contains a  vulnerability could potentially lead to an unwillingness to recognise the existence of  vulnerabilities. Society should therefore move towards a state where the existence of  vulnerabilities is acknowledged and accepted, to facilitate more openness as a precursor to  improved information security.   ENISA could facilitate and advise to improve the vulnerability disclosure landscape: ENISA could  play a facilitating and advisory role in the area of vulnerability disclosure through information  dissemination, providing recommendations, striving for harmonisation, collaborating with the  security researcher community and demonstrating leadership. From a policy perspective, ENISA  could advise the European Commission about the necessity for transparency from vendors and  the negative impact of copyright law in the EU.  6.2 The community must facilitate the improvement of vendor maturity  As noted in Chapter 4, varying levels of vendor maturity is a problem for the overall vulnerability disclosure  landscape. Therefore, one of the recommendations is to improve vendor maturity. Such maturity can be  enhanced practically through implementing some of the good practices identified in Chapter 5. The main  recommendation for vendors is to have a policy in place. This will enhance the level of vendor maturity and  improve communication between stakeholders when vulnerabilities are discovered and reported. A  disclosure policy also improves transparency, enhances the quality of the products sold by vendors, and  stimulates the researchers as well as the broader information security community. Due to the necessity of  having to act quickly, it is essential to have a policy in place, otherwise coordinated vulnerability disclosure  will probably not work. Witnessing more vendors introducing policies and starting to think about how they  receive vulnerability reports is ‘the biggest positive change that we have seen over the last couple of years’,  according to an interviewee. Overall, vendors from different sectors could be encouraged & supported by  the Member States, national CSIRTs, and ENISA to implement a disclosure policy. These include organisations  within sectors that are increasingly more reliant on digital technology such as car manufacturers, airlines  and maritime, plus organisations generally included in the Internet of Things and Industrial Control Systems  domains. Besides private sector organisations, governments also need to have a robust vulnerability  disclosure process in place. Such a policy ought to combine both defensive and offensive elements, while  erring on the side of disclosure. More vendors ought to start practising vulnerability disclosure in any shape  or form, but preferably in a streamlined and harmonised manner through a published and clear policy.  ENISA can potentially assist in improving vendor maturity through Information dissemination about the  vulnerability disclosure process. This includes the development of a vulnerability disclosure policy and the  implementation of such a policy in the organisation.  ENISA could provide leadership, particularly around exploring the issues and perhaps bringing together  information from all stakeholder groups, publishing that information, and providing good practices.  Because of its impartiality and its pan-European reach, bringing common understanding is a step in the  right direction.  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  64  6.3 Internationalisation through policy learning  Due to the global nature of the internet, coordinated vulnerability disclosure needs to be adopted at an  international level. A mechanism needs to implemented to engage in policy learning from countries where  a particular model of coordinated vulnerability disclosure, such as in the Netherlands, has led to positive  results.223  The Global Forum on Cyber Expertise, which began after the Global Conference on Cyber Space  (GCCS) in April 2015 in The Hague, the Netherlands, was suggested as a viable venue in which to do that.224  ENISA was also recommended as an option although its reach may be limited to the EU context.  Simultaneously, the Security Interest Group (SIG) started as part of Forum of Incident Response and Security  Teams (FIRST) could also present a viable alternative, since the SIG gathers various stakeholders to agree a  standard of principles on the topic of coordinated vulnerability disclosure.  223 National Cyber Security Centre. 2015. ‘Introducing Responsible Disclosure: Experiences in the Netherlands: A Best Practice  Guide.’ As of 8 October 2015: https://www.gccs2015.com/sites/default/files/documents/BestPracticeRD-20150409_0.pdf  224 Global Conference on Cyberspace 2015. n.d. ‘Global Forum On Cyber Expertise (GFCE).’ As of 8 October 2015:  https://www.gccs2015.com/gfce  225 ICASI has previously published: Schiffman Mike. 2011. ‘The Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework: An Internet  Consortium for Advancement of Security on the Internet (ICASI) Whitepaper.’ As of 8 October 2015:  http://www.icasi.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/06/cvrf-whitepaper.pdf  226 ICASI. 2015. ‘Current Activities.’ As of 17 August 2015: http://www.icasi.org/current-activities/  FIRST introduces Special Interest Group (SIG) to come to coordination principles  Largely as a result of Heartbleed, the challenge of coordination prompted the introduction of a Special  Interest Group (SIG) as part of FIRST. The Industry Consortium for Advancement of Security on the Internet  (ICASI)225 initiated the SIG because of its belief that all stakeholder communities needed to be involved in  the discussion. The main focus is on developing a consensus on how to improve coordination. ICASI itself  was too limited in its membership. As a result, the initiators turned to FIRST with the request of sponsoring  a SIG on the topic of vulnerability coordination. The SIG has two aims: first to “‘drive the industry towards  more organised and repeatable approaches to vulnerability coordination’; and secondly to ‘routinely share  best practices and exchange protected information around vulnerabilities and mitigations.’226 With  sponsorship from FIRST, the stakeholder communities involved in the SIG are growing: from vendors,  researchers, CSIRTs, open source communities, to bug bounty programmes. Membership is open to  anybody. The SIG currently faces a relative underrepresentation of the open source community. Since  stakeholder engagement is deemed a priority, the SIG seeks to address the problem of disproportionate  representation by targeted outreach.  At the FIRST conference in Berlin in 2015, the SIG ratified two thrusts of effort. The first effort focuses on  improving coordination. This includes elements such as developing an understanding of whom to go to  and who would be a stakeholder that may be impacted. The SIG also aims to research whether there is a  directory, or some type of resource, that a researcher or company could access if they find a vulnerability.  To accomplish this first effort, the SIG wants to explore the possibility of a coordination directory. This  requires the group to gather information on existing directories and whether FIRST can connect to such an  existing directory, or whether it is preferable to establish a new one. Running parallel to that is the second  effort around establishing a set of coordination principles. Once agreed, the principles would be published  with use cases, approximately 3-5, that explore those principles. The use cases are both representative  studies from real-life and hypotheticals created to tease out the complexities of vulnerability disclosure.  The dialogue around the use cases will provide a ‘non-threatening, neutral forum’ while highlighting  potential dissension from various communities on how best to coordinate. The SIG aims to present its  ENISA could use its position and network to strive for harmonisation of vulnerability disclosure processes.  https://www.gccs2015.com/sites/default/files/documents/BestPracticeRD-20150409_0.pdf https://www.gccs2015.com/gfce http://www.icasi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cvrf-whitepaper.pdf http://www.icasi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cvrf-whitepaper.pdf http://www.icasi.org/current-activities/  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  65  6.4 Introduction of a neutral third party or enhancement of existing coordination  centres  The project team’s analysis sees merit in having a neutral third party to whom vulnerabilities can be  reported, especially since certain entities may hold vested interests which can potentially conflict with the  overarching interest of a secure ecosystem. Some interviewees voiced suspicions of reporting vulnerabilities  to certain National CSIRTs, since such CSIRTs are governmental entities which, due to the interest of national  intelligence in vulnerabilities, may be influenced by other government departments. Yet, ‘given the fact that  there is usually a very big power discrepancy between the vendor and the security researcher, I actually  think it makes sense to bring in another party with experience that can help with those discussions.’ This can  be CSIRTs or another party, although certain existing CSIRTs maintain significant experience as coordinators  of vulnerability disclosures.  There is a consensus among interviewees that there are three CSIRTs which have extensive experience with  coordinating vulnerability disclosure. These are CERT-CC in the United States, JP-CERT in Japan and CERT-FI  in Finland. The work carried out by these coordination centers is widely recognized and it is recommended  that since they already have the ‘know-how’, they should continue to lead these activities. Simultaneously,  the involvement of other national-level CSIRTs or third-party vulnerability coordinators would benefit the  ecosystem, since they are able to reach a wider audience. Other benefits include limiting the legal exposure  of the discoverer, allowing the discoverer to (potentially) remain anonymous, and the increased likelihood  of vendors to respond in a timely manner when coordination centers are involved.  The dilemma therefore is whether the introduction of a neutral third party is more desirable than enhancing  existing efforts. As another interviewee commented, ‘Introducing a new institution that would do global co- ordination might be an option but the composition, placement and the process would have to be very  carefully considered.’  6.5 European policy makers and Member States should improve the legal landscape  The legal framework presents many challenges. The overall impression is that existing law, especially the  way legal representatives of vendors interpret and subsequently use such law, adversely affects security.  One of the concerns refers to the legal liability of the vulnerability discoverer. As previously described, the  potential legal threat in the area of criminal law can have a chilling effect. In the Dutch example, the public  prosecutor’s office has tried to illuminate its decision-making process in this area through the publication of  a letter which indicates what questions public prosecutors ask before deciding whether charges will be filed  against a discoverer. Other governments can follow a similar example since it helps the research community  better understand the decision-making process and allows them to critically evaluate their own actions. Even  though the ethical hacker acts on behalf of the system owner he/she cannot escape the legal grey area  altogether, especially since there are no legal provisions – as far as is known – which specifically identify  exceptions for such hacking. As a result, clarity can only be achieved on a case-by-case basis. The Dutch  public prosecutor’s office used case law to arrive at its explanation of how it approaches this type of legal  dilemmas. Case law has set the framework on how to consider potential challenges in the area of  vulnerability disclosure. By using case law, vulnerability disclosure cases can become more predictable for  findings during the FIRST conference in 2016 in Seoul. The form of the final ‘product’ depends on the  process.  ENISA could provide recommendations on how to communicate vulnerability disclosures, particularly in terms  of which companies and vendors must be informed.

This will hopefully lead to less uncertainty about potential legal  consequences.  In the United States, the main challenge in the area of criminal law comes through the Computer Fraud and  Abuse Act (CFAA), which disincentives the reporting of security vulnerabilities.227 . There is criticism about  the vague wording of the CFAA which allows for considerable prosecutorial discretion, leaving researchers  in uncertainty when they discover a vulnerability.228 There is currently discussion about introducing  exemptions to the CFAA for security researchers.229 A similar solution is being discussed for the DMCA.230  Within the EU, member states have different interpretations of how to approach reported vulnerabilities  from a criminal law perspective. As indicated in Chapter 6, the public prosecutor’s office in the Netherlands  has indicated how the office approaches the issue of vulnerability reporting from a criminal law perspective.  Such an approach provides an example that could be used by other EU member states to establish a level of  clarity and transparency, and thus develop a degree of confidence among researchers in determining how  their actions fit within the existing legal framework. Evidence for other Member States being as explicit on  this topic, at least from a public prosecutorial perspective was not identified by the study team during its  research. The overview provided by Biancuzzi does however confirm that many Member States do not have  specific legislation on vulnerability disclosures which means case law and interpretation of the current legal  framework are likely to guide any future steps.231 This can lead to uncertainty unless – as in the Netherlands  – public prosecutors provide insight into how they approach cases of vulnerability disclosure reporting. The  common risks that a vulnerability researcher is facing while seeking for vulnerabilities without prior  authorization could be associated with the abuse of intellectual property rights, breach of licensing as well  as other types of legal liabilities. A similar recommendation was set forth by ENISA in 2013 with respect to  the Directive on attacks against information systems, where the authors write with respect to illegal access:  ‘To reduce legal uncertainty, it could be advisable for countries to publish guidance on the interpretation  and application of the unlawful access provisions, and particularly on the element of intent (i.e. the  unlawfulness – without right) in cases where no security measures were breached, if this is permitted under  national law. This can be done in the form of prosecution guidelines in countries that permit this, and/or in  the form of jurisprudence overviews to show how courts apply the law in reality. Collection and  dissemination of such guidance at the EU level could also help to ensure homogeneous application of the  law across the European territory.’232  227 Kirsch, Cassandra. n.d. ‘The Grey Hat Hacker: Reconciling Cyberspace Reality and the Law.’ As of 8 October 2015:  http://www.nku.edu/content/dam/chaselaw/docs/centersandinstitute/Law---Informatics/Symposium- CLE/Kirsch_Working%20Paper_The%20Grey%20Hat%20Hacker.pdf  228 Ellis, Jen. 2015. ‘How Do We De-Criminalize Security Research?

A critical evaluation of  copyright law must be carried out at the EU level to determine whether amendments have to be made to  ensure the legal climate does not unnecessarily obstruct security research. Alternatively to amendments, if  deemed unnecessary, the current legal framework must be made more accessible and understandable for a  non-legal audience, such as discoverers, to be able to appropriately defend themselves as well as their  interests when receiving legal threats. The EFF, for example, provides an overview of all the applicable areas  of law in the United States with respect to reverse engineering.233 In May 2012, the European Court of Justice  (ECJ) ruled how ‘there is no copyright infringement’ when a software company without access to a program’s  source code ‘studied, observed and tested that program in order to reproduce its functionality in a second  program.’234 Even though in the aforementioned example there was no breach of the copyright legislation,  there could be potential breaches of other legal requirements imposed by means for e.g. contract terms,  confidentiality, privacy, property etc. The ECJ furthermore states, ‘this means that the acts of loading and  running necessary for the use of a copy of a program which has been lawfully acquired, and the act of  correction of its errors, may not be prohibited by contract.’235 Correction of its errors may mean that  vulnerability-related research is exempt from copyright provisions, or rather does not infringe on copyright.  Yet, more clarity is needed to definitely ascertain this and provide legal certainty to discoverers. The decision  was upheld in the United Kingdom by the Court of Appeal in 2014.236 Law is inherently about the appropriate  distribution of rights and responsibilities; as such while vendors have rights, they also have responsibilities,  just as researchers do.  Another challenge refers to the zero-day market, especially in connection to law enforcement and  intelligence. Vulnerabilities are in some cases exploited for security purposes, which leads to an inherent  conflict of interest since their prolonged existence also results in a state of insecurity. A public discussion on  the issue on how society believes vulnerability disclosure ought to take place could be a way forward in this  hard to resolve issue (see 6.6).  6.6 Vendors should facilitate trust building, transparency and openness  There is a general need to engage in trust building, transparency and openness of vulnerability disclosure.  This requires a societal acceptance that vulnerabilities are an inherent aspect of product development. From  a vendor’s perspective, the stigma associated with acknowledging that one of its products contains a  vulnerability could lead to an unwillingness to recognise the existence of vulnerabilities. As one interviewee  described it, ‘A lot of vendors we have talked to are understandably concerned in the beginning about  publishing a problem in their software. They fear that it looks bad, that they made a mistake, and that the  bad guys will find out and hurt their customers with it.’ Therefore, any discussion of vulnerability disclosure  233 Electronic Frontier Foundation. n.d. ‘Coders’ Rights Project Reverse Engineering FAQ.’ As of 8 October 2015:  https://www.eff.org/issues/coders/reverse-engineering-faq#faq4  234 InfoCuria – Case –Law of the Court of Justice. 2012. ‘JUDGMENT OF THE COURT (Grand Chamber).’ As of 8 October 2015:  http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=122362&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=req&dir=&occ=firs t&part=1&cid=564907  235 InfoCuria – Case –Law of the Court of Justice. 2012.  236 Wood, Ian. 2014. ‘UK: Court Of Appeal Upholds High Court Decision In SAS Institute Inc V World Programming Ltd Software  Infringement Case.’ Mondaq, 4 April.

There  should be no need to hide the fact that vulnerabilities exist.  Some interviewees also emphasised the necessity to facilitate openness and transparency about  vulnerability information. Examples may include information sharing platforms such as ISACs, where there  is a particular level of trust among the members to share information about vulnerabilities. To an extent,  therefore, this already occurs across certain platforms. To facilitate such openness, however, there has to  be a sufficient basis for trust as well as a legal commitment from members to respect the non-disclosure  aspect of receiving such information.  There is also the necessity of trust building across different communities. Researchers need to be able to  trust vendors and vice versa, since such trust is the bedrock of being able to cooperate in a manner which  serves the greater good of information security.  237 Simpson, Angela. 2015. ‘Enhancing the digital economy through collaboration on vulnerability research disclosure.’ National  Telecommunications & Information Administration. 9 July.

This vulnerability coordination discussion is one of such attempts. It is hoped  that by opening up the dialogue concerning various aspects of disclosure, participants may come to an agreed  set of principles on which future policies can rely.  To prepare for the multistakeholder processes, the IPTF asked participants to prioritise various identified  cybersecurity issues which appear in need of coordinated action. Among the issues were botnet mitigation,  vulnerability disclosures, consumer security, and distribution of patches. Comments were also requested on  methods and structure of the envisioned processes. Particularly notable were the recommendations by the  Telecommunication Industry Association (TIA), which stated that ‘the most effective solution to ensuring  innovation in cybersecurity solutions is to rely on voluntary use of internationally-accepted standards and  best practices.’238 Further, stakeholders emphasised that IPTF should avoid any redundancy by building on the  existing body of cybersecurity policies and initiatives.  Given the clear suggestions from the participants, it appears unlikely that the IPTF would on the contrary  propose heavier regulations. Besides, the IPTF has previously argued that the traditional regulatory approach  was counterproductive in an ever-evolving digital landscape. While the nature of the solutions that may arise  from the multi-stakeholder meetings remains largely unpredictable, increasing participation and dialogue by  stakeholders is expected to shape an inclusive perspective on cybersecurity.  ENISA could facilitate outreach and collaboration with the security researcher community.  ENISA could advise European governments and enterprises about the need for transparent disclosure of  technical information from all open source vendors.  http://www.ntia.doc.gov/blog/2015/enhancing-digital-economy-through-collaboration-vulnerability-research-disclosure http://www.ntia.doc.gov/blog/2015/enhancing-digital-economy-through-collaboration-vulnerability-research-disclosure http://www.privsecblog.com/2015/07/articles/policy-regulatory-positioning/commerce-dept-reviewing-stakeholders-cybersecurity-comments/ http://www.privsecblog.com/2015/07/articles/policy-regulatory-positioning/commerce-dept-reviewing-stakeholders-cybersecurity-comments/  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  69  To facilitate this, a public debate needs to be had about how society wants to deal with information about  vulnerabilities. This has become a problem which inherently involves a myriad of stakeholders, and an  educated decision about to deal with the challenges is needed.  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  70  7. Conclusions  The discussion and debate on vulnerability disclosure has been around for many years. As one respondent  described, ‘We are approaching the 27th anniversary of the first \"Internet Worm\" (Nov, 1988), and yet the  general form and content of the disclosure debate has changed very little in this time. The fact that as a  community we are still unable to establish a consensus on vulnerability disclosure best practices suggests  that this is an intrinsically difficult problem.’ This difficulty is in large part the result of different interests held  by stakeholders within the vulnerability landscape. The introduction of new players has arguably  complicated the dynamics even further. New players include vendors such as car manufacturers, medical  device manufacturers and others who have only recently entered the information security scene as their  products become increasingly connected to the digital world. So as more mature stakeholders continue to  battle the fundamental differences they have among each other, they are also challenged by newcomers to  share their knowledge in order to develop a more equal level playing field.  Other aspects of an evolving landscape further complicate the vulnerability ecosystem. The media have  begun to play a larger role, which marketing departments of companies have started to cater to in the last  couple of years. Vulnerabilities now have catchy names and logos which may overshadow the severity of the  vulnerability – or lack thereof – and as such exaggerate vulnerabilities leading to confusion among users.  This may create panic among the public and require vendors to devote more resources than necessary. Yet  the media also play an essential role in agenda setting when it comes to information security in general and  vulnerability disclosure in particular. Without their reporting, certain vendors may never devote the  attention to the topic that is required, or users may never find out about the existence of a vulnerability as  well as the way to resolve it. The key, however, is to come to a more nuanced reporting of developments  where information dissemination plays a more important role than drawing readers’ attention with snappy  headlines.  Various initiatives, including this project initiated by ENISA, demonstrate the need to bring different  stakeholders together to discuss the challenges associated with vulnerability disclosure and the ways such  challenges can be addressed. The development of a core set of principles upon which different stakeholders  can agree, and to which they can adhere, can go a long way towards reconciling the existence of distinct and  at times conflicting interests. To facilitate these discussions and build trust, third parties can play an integral  role. In this sense, ENISA can potentially use its standing in the community as well as its expertise in the area  of information security to foster connections and facilitate trust building by reaching out not only to vendors  and to CSIRTs but also to the researcher community.  Even though vulnerability reward programmes are generally perceived as a positive development that has  brought discoverers and vendors closer together, the market must be approached with caution as it can  over-incentivise the search and lead to a flood of vulnerabilities, potentially diverting attention and  resources away from the most critical challenges.  To conclude, one of the primary challenges to focus upon, and the primary recommendation to put forward  with respect to policy development, is the need for an advanced legal landscape to ensure that vulnerability  reporting is not endangered by the unintended consequences of criminal and civil legislation. A critical  evaluation of the legal landscape, both in terms of criminal law as well as copyright legislation, is needed to  ensure security research is appropriately facilitated rather than inappropriately obstructed.

Oracle’s  disclosure policy for instance is just three sentences long,239 while Microsoft provides an eight page  document.240  There are however numerous elements that the majority of vulnerability disclosure policies have in  common.  E.1.1 Security and disclosure philosophy  The first line of a vulnerability disclosure policy usually highlights a company’s security philosophy.  Google for instance starts with: ‘As a provider of software and services for many users, advertisers, and  publishers on the internet, we recognize how important it is to help protect your privacy and security.’241  Other examples include, ‘Lenovo is committed to delivering safe and secure products and services’242, and  Cloudfare states that, ‘we take security, trust and transparency seriously.’243  Template:  When it comes to security, our users come first.  The second phrase reiterates a broad statement regarding the company’s disclosure philosophy.  Facebook notes that, ‘we will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.’244  Symantec highlights that it is ‘committed to resolving security vulnerabilities quickly and carefully.’245 And  Yahoo clarifies that, ‘when we discover previously unknown security vulnerabilities, we immediately address  the risks on our own systems to protect our users.’246  Template:  [xxx] is committed to fix all reported security vulnerabilities quickly and carefully to protect the  security and privacy of our users.  239 Oracle. n.d. ‘Oracle Security Vulnerability Disclosure Policies.’ As of 14 September 2015:  http://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/vulnerability-remediation/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/index.html  240 Microsoft. 2011. ‘Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure at Microsoft.’ As of 14 September 2015:  http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9770197  241 Google. n.d. ‘Google Application Security.’ As of 14 September 2015: https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/  242 Lenovo. 2015. ‘Lenovo Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.’ As of 14 September 2015:  https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/ht103338  243 Cloudfare. n.d. ‘CloudFlare vulnerability disclosure policy.’ As of 14 September 2015: https://www.cloudflare.com/disclosure  244 Facebook. 2015. ‘Whitehat.’ As of 14 September 2015: https://www.facebook.com/whitehat  245 Symantec. n.d. ‘Vulnerability Management Commitment and Disclosure Policy.’ As of 14 September 2015:  https://www.symantec.com/security/  246 Yahoo. 2014. ‘Users First: Our Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.’ As of 14 September 2015:  http://yahoopolicy.tumblr.com/post/104777538533/users-first-our-vulnerability-disclosure-policy  http://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/vulnerability-remediation/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/index.html http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9770197 https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/ https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/ht103338 https://www.cloudflare.com/disclosure https://www.facebook.com/whitehat https://www.symantec.com/security/ http://yahoopolicy.tumblr.com/post/104777538533/users-first-our-vulnerability-disclosure-policy  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  88  E.1.2 Reporting the vulnerability  This paragraph ought to provide security researchers with the necessary contact information and any  additional details they might need to complete a vulnerability report.  Most of the companies surveyed converge on a single uniform format by putting the important contact  information within a bulk of text.  Apple for example writes: ‘to report security or privacy issues that affect Apple products or web servers,  please contact: product-security@apple.com. You can use Apple’s Product Security PGP key to encrypt  sensitive information sent via e-mail.’247 And Google states that ‘if you believe you have discovered a  vulnerability in a Google product, or have a security incident to report go to goo.gl/vulnz to include it in our  Vulnerability Rewards Program. For Chrome vulnerabilities […].’248 Cisco approached the issue very  differently by putting the necessary contact information into a simple table while also mentioning the hours  in operation.249 Additional information such as day’s off, holidays, and a telephone number for emergency  support can further contribute to enhance communication transparency.  Template:  Report a vulnerability  E-mail xxx@xxx.xxx  (e-mails are acknowledged within xx hours)  OpenPGP Key XXXXXXXXX  Hours xx hours a day, x days a week, holidays  Phone Number  (emergency contact)  +x xxxxxxxxxx  Note: Sending a confirmation of receipt email is essential to ensure that the security researcher knowns that  his/her report has been received by your company. You can choose to either do this automatically or add a  disclaimer clarifying your response time (see template).  E.1.3 Attributes of a good report  To receive the necessary information that will help verify and reproduce a security vulnerability in one of  your products, it is critical to clearly state what kind of information you require from the security researcher.  While there are various ways of receiving an incident report, whether it is through a simple email, an online  form, or a word template, it is important not to restrain security researchers in their input methods. Online  forms for example usually do not allow images or video files to be attached, and Word templates might  complicate user input due to possible formatting difficulties. Some companies employ very restrictive  guidelines, such as Symantec which does not accept email attachments.250 Other companies, such as  Facebook, even encourage users to attach their own video files.251 In the end a simple e-mail seems to be  the best solution to maximise user flexibility while avoiding any loss of critical information.  247 Apple. n.d. ‘Apple Product Security.’ As of 15 September 2015: https://www.apple.com/support/security/  248 Google. n.d. ‘Google Application Security.’ As of 14 September 2015: https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/  249 Cisco. n.d. ‘Security Vulnerability Policy.’ As of 14 September 2015:  http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/psirt/security_vulnerability_policy.html  250 Symantec. n.d. ‘Vulnerability Management Commitment and Disclosure Policy.’ As of 14 September 2015:  https://www.symantec.com/security  251 Facebook. 2015. ‘Whitehat.’ As of 14 September 2015: https://www.facebook.com/whitehat  mailto:xxx@xxx.xxx https://www.apple.com/support/security/ https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/ http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/psirt/security_vulnerability_policy.html https://www.symantec.com/security https://www.facebook.com/whitehat  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  89  Template:  Attributes of a good report  Quality before Quantity  Please provide us with a detailed description and a clear and concise step-by-step guide in  English to allow for the reproduction of the security vulnerability.  (include screenshots where necessary)  The step-by-step guide should include:  - xxxxx  - yyyyy  - zzzzzz  E.1.4 Ineligible reports  Please make clear which reports and research methods your company will not accept or permit. For  example, reports on login issues, password problems, spam, and suspected fraud activities ought to be  handled by your support help desk.  Acceptable research methods should also explicitly differentiate between vulnerability scans and ethical  hacks. While the difference is in some cases a grey area, a vulnerability disclosure policy should generally  not enable researchers to hack into your company’s systems. As such, DDoS attacks, brute-force attacks,  malware installation, or making any kind of changes to your system (i.e. copying, deleting, and altering files)  ought to be explicitly forbidden.  Bugcrowd and Facebook provide an exhaustive list of items they are not willing to accept as a security  vulnerability,252 while Lenovo states that ‘all content other than specific security vulnerabilities in our  products or services will be dropped.’253  The Dutch National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) specifically lists  malicious acts that reporters must avoid to be free from any legal prosecution.254  Template:  Ineligible reports  - Login issues and password problems  - Spelling mistakes  - HTTP 404 pages  - Spam or suspected fraud activities  - …  Not permitted acts:  - DDoS attacks  - Brute-Force attacks  252 Bugcrowd. 2015. ‘Standard Disclosure Terms.’ As of 15 September 2015: https://bugcrowd.com/resources/standard-disclosure- terms ; Facebook. 2015. ‘Whitehat.’ As of 14 September 2015: https://www.facebook.com/whitehat  253 Lenovo. 2015. ‘Lenovo Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.’ As of 14 September 2015:  https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/ht103338  254 NCSC. n.d. ‘Responsible Disclosure.’ As of 14 September 2015: https://www.ncsc.nl/english/securityt  https://bugcrowd.com/resources/standard-disclosure-terms https://bugcrowd.com/resources/standard-disclosure-terms https://www.facebook.com/whitehat https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/ht103338 https://www.ncsc.nl/english/securityt  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  90  - Social engineering  - Malware installation  - Making any changes to our system (incl. copying, changing, and deleting data)  - Sharing access with others  …  The xxx@xxx.xxx email is intended for the sole purpose of reporting a security vulnerability.  If you are in need of technical assistance please contact our support help desk:  yyy@yyy.yyy.  E.1.5 Procedural steps and timeline  Depending on a company’s resources and expertise devoted to fixing security vulnerabilities, the layout of  procedural steps and the self-imposition of a timeline widely differs.  Mature companies such as Google and Yahoo are committing themselves to publicly disclose vulnerabilities  within 90 days,255 while CERT/CC adheres to a 45-day deadline ‘regardless of the existence or availability of  patches or workarounds from affected vendors.’256  Companies that are new to the practice of security vulnerability disclosure are advised to NOT impose a 45-  or 90-day timeline upon themselves. Instead the communication ought to focus on ensuring mutual respect  (between your company and the security researcher), transparency, and greater flexibility.  Rapid7, for example, provides a series of steps they are committed to take to address the security  vulnerability while also noting that they ‘will endeavour to keep the reporter apprised of every step in the  process as each step occurs.’257 Symantec on the other hand clearly states that they ‘cannot provide software  security patches according to a set timeline. Each issue requires investigation, resolution, localization, and  testing appropriate to its complexity.’258  Template:  Procedural steps and timeline  - Once we receive your vulnerability report, we will take every necessary step to investigate  and resolve the security issue at hand in a swift and transparent manner.  - While we cannot provide patches according to a fixed timeline, we are committed to keep  you informed at every step of the process.  - We request that you keep all communications regarding the vulnerability confidential, to  ensure mutual trust and the flexibility to work with us towards the release of a patch, while  guaranteeing an adequate timeframe for our customers to deploy said patch.  - We will publicly announce the vulnerability in our release note of the update and will  mention the person/people who reported the vulnerability unless the researcher(s) wishes  to remain anonymous.  255 Yahoo. 2014. ‘Users First: Our Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.’ As of 14 September 2015:  http://yahoopolicy.tumblr.com/post/104777538533/users-first-our-vulnerability-disclosure-policy; Google. n.d. ‘Google  Application Security.’ As of 14 September 2015: https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/  256 CERT/CC. n.d. ‘Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.’ As of 15 September 2015: http://www.cert.org/vulnerability-analysis/vul- disclosure.cfm?  257 Rapid7. n.d. ‘Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.’ As of 15 September 2015: https://www.rapid7.com/disclosure.jsp  258 Symantec. n.d. ‘Vulnerability Management Commitment and Disclosure Policy.’ As of 14 September 2015:  https://www.symantec.com/security  mailto:xxx@xxx.xxx mailto:yyy@yyy.yyy http://yahoopolicy.tumblr.com/post/104777538533/users-first-our-vulnerability-disclosure-policy https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/ http://www.cert.org/vulnerability-analysis/vul-disclosure.cfm http://www.cert.org/vulnerability-analysis/vul-disclosure.cfm https://www.rapid7.com/disclosure.jsp https://www.symantec.com/security  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  91  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vass.

They provide a point-of-entry or gateway to  exploit a system and as such pose potentially severe security risks. Identifying and fixing vulnerabilities is  therefore crucial, and the process of disclosing vulnerabilities is a vital component that cannot be  underestimated. The vulnerability disclosure landscape is complex, with several stakeholders involved that  include vendors, IT security providers, independent researchers, the media, malicious users, governments  and, ultimately, the general public. These stakeholders often have competing interests, which results in a  challenging landscape.  In the specific context of the vulnerability disclosure process, this study seeks to achieve the primary  objectives listed in the following figure (Figure 1).  Figure 1: Primary objectives of the research  We used a mixed-method approach to accomplish the objectives outlined above, which included a focused  literature review, a series of in-depth interviews with key experts in the field, and case studies of four widely  distributed critical vulnerabilities reported in 2014.  Our analysis confirmed that there are a number of pressing challenges associated with the vulnerability  disclosure process. The key challenges we identified are summarised below.   Legal challenges: Individuals who discover a vulnerability often face legal threats when they decide to  report it. These threats can have implications on not only civil and criminal law but also contract law,  licensing, patent law and other types of legislation. Discoverers may find themselves in a grey area due  to the methods used to discover the vulnerability and the way it was disclosed.   Lack of ‘vendor’ maturity: Whereas large companies familiar within the information technology  environment have robust processes in place for vulnerability reporting, other companies are new to the  scene. These may be small companies, or companies which have not previously been part of the  information technology landscape. This could lead to a lack of maturity on the part of these players and  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  08  potentially complicate the vulnerability disclosure eco-system, as less mature companies are ill-prepared  to accept vulnerability reports and act upon them in the interest of the information security community.   Lack of researcher maturity: Just as vendors may lack experience in accepting vulnerability reports, so  some researchers lack experience in reporting vulnerabilities. When such experience is absent,  researchers may approach vendors in a threatening or otherwise non-conducive manner which prevents  fruitful cooperation. Researchers who lack experience may also be unwilling to compromise on, for  example, timelines identified by the vendor.   Incoming vulnerability reports are not always taken into consideration by the vendors. For all sorts of  reasons vendors may choose to disregard reports about a vulnerability on their products and services in  spite of the obvious damage they might suffer from not acting upon validated vulnerability information.  Vulnerabilities reported may be singled out as academic or theoretical and interest for a previously  disregarded vulnerability report might increase only after a security incident has happened when as it  often happens, an ex post analysis is likely to set the record straight.   Vulnerability acquisition for national intelligence purposes: Unpatched vulnerabilities can be used by  criminals but also potentially by national intelligence or law enforcement officials. This means that  sometimes a vulnerability will remain undisclosed for such (national) security purposes. Yet while a  vulnerability remains undisclosed to the vendor, so will the development of a solution remain absent,  leaving users vulnerable.   Users do not implement patches (in a timely manner): Once a vulnerability is disclosed by the vendor,  and a solution such as a patch to be installed via an update is available, the user must implement it. Such  implementation is essential for the vulnerability to be resolved; a lack of implementation leaves users  even more vulnerable since information about the vulnerability is now public. Users have a tendency,  for a variety of reasons, to postpone or to negate patching altogether. This may be because of a lack of  understanding or knowledge. Furthermore, it could be important to keep the average patch application  time as short as possible rather than solely focusing on the disclosure timeline.   Discoverer motivation varies: The motivation for an individual to discover a vulnerability varies. The  motivation of the discoverer can influence the decision s/he makes regarding what to do with the  vulnerability. The increase in bug bounty programmes as well as the growing zero-day market have  increasingly placed a focus on monetary reward. This may lead to over-incentivising the search for  vulnerabilities and may also lead to the expectation that discoverers will always receive a monetary  reward for their discovery.  We also identified a number of good practices for the various stakeholders involved and these have been  summarised below.   Use existing documents: Previous efforts have been made to gather good practices in the area of  vulnerability disclosure as well as to describe how to set up a vulnerability disclosure policy. To prevent  ‘reinvention of the wheel’, these documents should be used by stakeholders and should be leveraged  more by new initiatives. The ISO standards are a prominent example, although their lack of free  availability may hamper their reach.   Communication:  - Vendors should be reachable/have a point of contact: To prevent reporters from having to spend  valuable time and resources looking for the appropriate contact, vendors should have a clear point  of contact to deal with vulnerability reports, and this contact should be reachable.  - Have a policy in place: Vendors should have a policy in place which addresses vulnerability  disclosure and describes how they respond to vulnerability reports. This policy will also indicate to  reporters what information they need to provide as well as give an insight into the process of the  disclosure.  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  09  - Communication with different stakeholders: Communication with stakeholders requires mutual  respect, patience and transparency. Continual communication is essential to acknowledge receipt  of the vulnerability report as well as provide an indication of the next steps.   Information dissemination: Information about the vulnerability as well as its solution, if available,  should be disseminated to inform users of the developments and to provide them with an opportunity  to protect themselves. How much information needs to be disseminated is a topic of discussion among  stakeholders.   Timelines: a timeline should be mutually agreed upon (on a vulnerability-by-vulnerability basis) to  ensure that a vulnerability will be sufficiently addressed by the vendor in a timely manner.   Flexibility: No ‘one size fits all’ approach exists in the area of vulnerability disclosure, so flexibility is  necessary to tailor the vulnerability report as well as the response to the specifics of the vulnerability.  Finally, the synthesis of the various sources reviewed during this study shows that there are several areas  for future consideration. Below, we summarise a series of recommendations for improving the status quo  in the vulnerability disclosure landscape.   The community must facilitate the improvement of vendor maturity: To make progress, vendor  maturity must be improved to ensure that all vendors are able to receive vulnerability reports and  respond to them in a manner which is accepted by the community and which will introduce the smallest  risks with respect to the security of users. In this context the term community refers to different relevant  stakeholders like EU Member States, vendors, security researchers, national CSIRTs and ENISA.  In order to improve vendor maturity, the community must stimulate less mature vendors to introduce a  policy and set up an infrastructure which allows them to accept vulnerability reports.   Internationalisation through policy learning: The global nature of the internet requires a more  transnational approach to the topic of vulnerability disclosure, where successful cases in certain  countries or regions can be used for policy learning purposes in other areas of the world. Simultaneously,  stakeholder gatherings at the transnational level can use their international access to further enhance  such policy learning, and so allow the spread of good practices in vulnerability disclosure.   Introduction of a neutral third party or enhancement of existing coordination centres: The different  interests held by stakeholders – especially reporters and vendors – as well as the growing complexity of  the landscape, both in terms of stakeholders and products, advocates the introduction of a neutral third  party to coordinate vulnerability disclosure. An alternative is to enhance existing coordination centres,  to ensure that power discrepancies as well as potential conflicts of interest will not compromise the  overarching goal of improved information security.   European policy makers and Member States should improve the legal landscape: The legal implications  present many challenges for different stakeholders involved in the vulnerability disclosure process. The  legal landscape must facilitate the improvement of information security and existing legislation must be  adapted according to the latest developments.   Vendors should facilitate trust building, transparency and openness: From a vendor’s perspective, the  stigma associated with acknowledging that one of its products contains a vulnerability could potentially  lead to an unwillingness to recognise the existence of vulnerabilities. Society should therefore move  towards a state where the existence of vulnerabilities is acknowledged and accepted, to facilitate more  openness as a precursor to improved information security.   ENISA should facilitate and advise on ways to improve the vulnerability disclosure landscape: ENISA  could play a facilitating and advisory role in the area of vulnerability disclosure through information  dissemination, providing recommendations, striving for harmonisation, collaborating with the security  researcher community, and demonstrating leadership. From a policy perspective, ENISA could advise  the European Commission about the necessity for transparency from vendors and the potentially  negative impact of copyright law in the EU.  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  10  With our increasing dependence on ICT in everyday life, the exploitation of vulnerabilities discovered in  information systems and networks will continue to pose grave security risks, with potentially damaging  economic and societal impacts. Therefore it becomes all the more important that the various stakeholders  involved in this complex environment attempt to address the various challenges that are encountered in the  vulnerability disclosure landscape together. From the perspective of the security and trust of the end-users  of systems, there is consensus that vulnerabilities must be disclosed in a way that minimises damage.  Although movement towards more and better coordinated vulnerability disclosure has been happening to  some extent for several years now, the landscape is still fragmented in many ways, and there are pertinent  questions that remain unanswered. We explore and address some of these issues in this report. The analysis  we present will be useful for all stakeholders involved in the disclosure of vulnerabilities, including vendors,  researchers, policy makers, Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT) as well as the general  public.

Introduction  1.1 Background of the study  Vulnerabilities are ‘flaws’ or ‘mistakes’ in computer-based systems that may be exploited to compromise  the network and information security of the affected systems. They provide a point-of-entry or gateway for  malicious activities and as such pose several, potentially severe security risks. Remedying vulnerabilities is  therefore crucial and the disclosure process is a significant element that cannot be underestimated. Over  the last few years, there has been a rise in the number of vulnerabilities that have been disclosed to the  general public. In a number of cases, the vulnerabilities that were eventually reported were critical in terms  of their potential or actual impact. In 2014, for example, several ‘high profile’ vulnerabilities were reported  to the public, often via the media. These included, among others, Heartbleed, POODLE, Shellshock and  Sandworm.1 These disclosures carried several consequences and also re-opened the discussion on  vulnerability disclosure procedures in general. Cindee Tran, for example, describes how in the case of the  Shellshock vulnerability ‘within hours of the release of this bug to the general public, attackers reportedly  exploited this vulnerability to create botnets on compromised computers to perform DDoS (distributed denial- of-service) [attacks] and vulnerability scanning.’2 This led the security community to question whether the  manner of disclosure was appropriate, especially since there may be a direct connection between the public  disclosure of the vulnerability and the subsequent exploitation.  The vulnerability disclosure landscape is complex, with several stakeholders involved that include vendors,  IT security providers, independent researchers, the media, malicious users and, ultimately, the general  public. These stakeholders often have competing interests which results in a challenging landscape.  Reflections on some of the challenges involved provide insight into the different perspectives within the  community. Graham, for example, describes how ‘Microsoft forced a self-serving vulnerability disclosure  policy on the industry 10 years ago, but cries foul when Google does the same today.’3 One of the important  points to note is that information security in general, and vulnerability disclosure in particular, ought not to  become caught up in a ‘battle of the giants.’ As Böhme notes, ‘as long as perfectly secure software is not  available, the optimal distribution of vulnerability information is an important factor for the stability of a  “network society”.’4  Thus, the potentially sensitive nature of disclosing vulnerabilities poses a number of pressing questions  which are associated with the existence of diverging and, at times, conflicting interests, as well as with legal  restraints on the actions of stakeholders. Furthermore, digital and software-dependent technologies are  becoming increasingly embedded in everyday life. Therefore it is vital for the economy and society at large  that appropriate procedures are in place for disclosing vulnerabilities. Clearly, from the security perspective  of end-users such as businesses and home users, vulnerability disclosure must occur, but who should do this,  how it should be done, and when it is the right time to go public with vulnerabilities, are crucial questions  that remain to be answered.  1 Chapter 3 examines these four vulnerabilities in more detail.  2 AppSec Consulting. 2015. ‘Zero-day Attacks in 2014.’ As of 7 October 2015: https://www.appsecconsulting.com/blog/zero-day- attacks-in-2014  3 Errata Security. 2015. ‘A Call for Better Vulnerability Response.’ As of 29 May 2015: http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/01/a-call-for- better-vulnerability-response.html#.VWh4ms9VhBe  4 Bohme, Rainer. n.d. ‘A Comparison of Market Approaches  to Software Vulnerability Disclosure’ As of 29 May 2015:  https://www.is.uni-muenster.de/security/publications/Boehme2006_CompVulnMarkets_ETRICS.pdf  https://www.appsecconsulting.com/blog/zero-day-attacks-in-2014 https://www.appsecconsulting.com/blog/zero-day-attacks-in-2014 http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/01/a-call-for-better-vulnerability-response.html%23.VWh4ms9VhBe http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/01/a-call-for-better-vulnerability-response.html%23.VWh4ms9VhBe https://www.is.uni-muenster.de/security/publications/Boehme2006_CompVulnMarkets_ETRICS.pdf  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  12  The pursuit of these answers requires engagement with stakeholders to understand what challenges they  face, what good practices they undertake, and what recommendations they have for improvement. This  study is a first step to lead that process and provide further recommendations about what role ENISA as  independent third party can play.  1.1.1 Objectives of the study  In the specific context of the complex vulnerability disclosure ecosystem, this study seeks to achieve the  primary objectives listed in the following figure (Figure 2).  Figure 2: Primary objectives of the research  The analysis presented in this report will be useful for all stakeholders involved in the disclosure of  vulnerabilities, including vendors, researchers, policy makers, Computer Security Incident Response Teams  (CSIRTs) as well as the general public.  1.1.2 Methodology  In order to accomplish the objectives outlined above, the study relied on desk research and in-depth  interviews with key experts in the field of vulnerability disclosure. A review of the available literature such  as technical reports, company statements, media articles, and blogs, provided the basis for a general  overview of the vulnerability disclosure ecosystem as outlined in chapter 2. In parallel, a set of case studies  were prepared that focused on four widely distributed, critical vulnerabilities reported in 2014. For each  vulnerability examined, the case study describes the whole lifecycle of the disclosure process from discovery  to disclosure, as well as potential impact. The information for the case studies was gathered through  keyword searches on Google, using the name of the vulnerability (e.g. Shellshock) and combinations of  search terms that included disclosure, vulnerability, response and timeline. Sources used for the case studies  mainly included media reports, advisories, and blog posts issued by journalists and vendors.  Both the literature review and the analysis of the case studies built the basis for the core task of the project,  specifically the identification of challenges, good practices and the development of recommendations. In  addition the research team conducted a total of 16 interviews during the course of the project and the team  also received written responses from four additional participants who could not be interviewed in person.  To obtain a range of opinions and insights, the interviewees were selected among experts across the  vulnerability disclosure landscape and included vendors, information security companies, academic experts,  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  13  co-ordinators (e.g. representatives from national computer security incident response teams) and civil  society representatives.  The interviews were used to validate some of the findings from the literature review, and the information  obtained in the interviews were also used to support the four case studies. The interviews which lasted  approximately 45-60 minutes followed a semi-structured format (meaning that not all questions were  covered at each interview). The complete list of interviewees is provided in Annex B and the indicative  interview protocol is provided in Annex C.  To ensure that the interviewees were able to speak freely about their experience and knowledge, the study  team does not attribute specific contributions to the interviewees in order to ensure confidentiality and to  safeguard the sensitive nature of the topic discussed.  1.1.3 Outline of the report  In chapter 2 we present an overview of the vulnerability landscape, focusing on the definitions of  vulnerabilities, statistics related to reported vulnerabilities, and key stakeholders involved in the disclosure  process. Chapter 2 also looks at the different ways in which vulnerabilities can be disclosed. Four case studies  of vulnerabilities reported in 2014 are presented in chapter 3. For each of the cases (Heartbleed, POODLE,  Sandworm and Shellshock) the analysis covers the whole lifecycle of the disclosure process. Chapter 4  investigates the various challenges associated with the disclosure of vulnerabilities. A series of good  practices are presented in chapter 5. The various sources of evidence are analysed in chapter 6, and a list of  recommendations for improvement are presented. Finally, chapter 7 presents some concluding remarks and  highlights some unanswered questions and strategic issues raised by the findings.

Overview of vulnerability landscape  2.1 Introduction  This chapter examines the overall landscape of vulnerability disclosure, by defining the term ‘vulnerability’  and by providing a brief background on the number of reported vulnerabilities (based on historical data  contained in the National Vulnerability Database5). This is followed by an analysis of the different  stakeholders involved in vulnerability disclosure. The chapter ends by examining the different ways in which  vulnerabilities can be disclosed.  2.2 What is a vulnerability?  Any discussion of vulnerability disclosure must begin with a description of what constitutes a security  vulnerability. Table 1 lists the definitions of ‘vulnerability’, compiled from a range of independent sources.  Some definitions are more specific than others; for example, the Microsoft and Symantec definitions draw  a direct connection between a vulnerability and the fundamental principles of information security, i.e.  confidentiality, integrity and availability. In general, the various definitions refer to the following three key  characteristics: (i) the existence of a ‘flaw’ or a ‘weakness’ (i.e. a ‘point of entry’) in a system; (ii) the ability  of a potential threat (e.g. hackers) to have access the flaw; and (iii) the resulting ability to exploit it that may  result in an information security compromise. These main elements of a vulnerability, which could  potentially compromise the security of both software and hardware systems, have also been illustrated in  Figure 3. Examples of the repercussions of vulnerabilities include the unauthorised remote execution of  commands, denial of service attacks6 and in extreme cases the complete shutdown of systems. It is worth  reiterating that there are different degrees of vulnerability severity and associated risks which help to, for  example, prioritise the way in which a detected vulnerability is ‘fixed.’ This is discussed in more detail in the  next section.

This section presents some high-level statistics about reported vulnerabilities based on data contained in  the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The NVD is a publicly accessible ‘U.S. government repository of  standards-based vulnerability management data [that enables] the automation of vulnerability  management, security measurement, and compliance.’16 The NVD makes a comprehensive list of Common  Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs – see Table 1)17 available to the public and attempts to quantify the risks  posed by these vulnerabilities by 'scoring' CVEs based on a series of indicators (e.g. levels of impact and  exploitability). In particular, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) facilitates a metrics-based  technique for disseminating the different characteristics and impacts of vulnerabilities.18  CVSS 'scores' are  computed for almost all reported vulnerabilities. Based on the CVSS scores, the NVD also provides qualitative  ratings of the severity of vulnerabilities using a ‘Low-Medium-High’ rating scale.19 Specifically, vulnerabilities  are categorised as low severity if they have a CVSS score between 0.0 and 3.9; medium severity  vulnerabilities are those with CVSS scores between 4.0 and 6.9. Vulnerabilities are classified as high severity  if they have a CVSS score between 7.0 and 10.0.  Figure 4 presents the historical trend (from 2001 onwards) in the annual number of security vulnerabilities  reported, broken down by their respective CVSS 'Low-Medium-High' ratings. The relative proportions of low,  medium and high severity vulnerabilities are presented in Figure 5.

The yearly statistics are also listed in Annex A (both in terms of absolute numbers and  proportions of the total number of vulnerabilities).  There was a general increase in the total number of vulnerabilities reported each year between 2001 and  2006, after which a steady downward trend was observed up to 2011. From 2011 onwards, however, the  total number of vulnerabilities with assigned CVEs has shown an upward swing once again. Notably, the  number of vulnerabilities reported in 2014 is substantially higher than the corresponding figure for 2013,  peaking at just below 8,000 vulnerabilities, an 'all-time high.’ The volume of vulnerabilities reported in 2014  represents a year-on-year increase of approximately 53% relative to 2013.  Figure 4: Yearly (2001-2014) distribution of the number of reported vulnerabilities broken down according to their severity  'rating'; the severity ratings are dependent on the computed NVD CVSS score21  The variation in the annual number of low and medium severity vulnerabilities displays a similar trend to the  total number of vulnerabilities. The trend in the number of high severity vulnerabilities, however, exhibits a  slightly different trend: there is a large increase from 2001 to 2007 (in which as many as 3,158 high severity  vulnerabilities were reported, representing almost 50% of all vulnerabilities reported that year). After 2007,  the number of high severity vulnerabilities reported shows a year-on-year decrease until 2013 in which 1,737  high severity vulnerabilities were reported. 2014 saw a slight reversal in this trend with over 1,900 high  severity vulnerabilities published and a record high of around 5,356 medium severity vulnerabilities. The  medium and high volumes together represented almost 92% of all reported vulnerabilities in 2014 (Figure  5). Interestingly, however, in 2014, the 1,920 high severity vulnerabilities constituted a proportion of slightly  21 The graph was produced using CVE data retrieved from the National Vulnerability Database.  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  18  less than one quarter of all vulnerabilities reported that year. The 2014 figure for the percentage of high  severity vulnerabilities is the lowest percentage across the entire period.22  Figure 5: Yearly (2001-2014) distribution of the proportion of total vulnerabilities reported broken down according to their  severity 'rating'; the severity ratings are dependent on the computed NVD CVSS score23  Finally, Figure 6 presents the yearly distribution of the number of vulnerabilities with CVSS scores exceeding  9.0.24 Between 2001 and 2006 there was a steady increase in the number of these 'critical' vulnerabilities.  In 2007 the number almost doubled to just under 1,000 vulnerabilities. Since 2007, the number of reported  vulnerabilities has varied between approximately 800 and 1,100 each year, with only a very slight decrease  in the overall number since 2012.  22 The share of ‘high’ and ‘medium’ severity vulnerabilities varies across the whole period between approximately 89% and 97% of  all reported vulnerabilities in the corresponding year.  23 The graph was produced using CVE data retrieved from the National Vulnerability Database.  24 Note: these data were retrieved from www.cvedetails.com, which relies on CVE vulnerability data taken from the NVD.  file://///nevis/RE/Projects/In_Progress/15060_Best_practice_guide_on_disclosing_vulnerabilities/WIP/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/nvanderm/Desktop/15067/www  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  19  Figure 6: Yearly distribution (2001-2014) of the number of reported vulnerabilities with a CVSS score greater than 9.025  It is important to note that these statistics provide only a broad indication of the historical trend in the  disclosure of vulnerabilities based on assigned CVE identifiers. There are a number of limitations associated  with simply counting the number of vulnerabilities that have been reported. The numbers do not indicate  whether the vulnerabilities were eventually exploited by attackers, nor do they tell us whether the software  flaws were ever patched by vendors.26 Furthermore, for some vulnerabilities there is not enough information  available to generate CVSS scores (e.g. a vendor discloses a vulnerability but does not provide sufficient data  related to the bug). In these cases the NVD adopts a ‘worst case approach’ and allocates the maximum CVSS  score of 10.27 In addition, the NVD database is not comprehensive as not all vulnerabilities are assigned CVEs  and are therefore not included in the data. Taking these limitations into account, the results need to be  interpreted with caution.  Despite these caveats, the CVSS is a transparent attempt at quantifying the risks associated with  vulnerabilities. By computing CVSS scores for the majority of reported vulnerabilities, the CVSS framework  is able to provide a standard measure of the ‘impact’ of vulnerabilities for industries as well as governments.  As noted on the NVD website, ‘two common uses of CVSS are prioritization of vulnerability remediation  activities and in calculating the severity of vulnerabilities discovered on one's systems.’28  25 The graph was generated using CVE data retrieved from CVE Details.

The topic of vulnerability disclosure brings together several different stakeholders. This section aims to shed  light on the ‘who’s who’ in this field, but simultaneously emphasises how stakeholders may belong to various  subgroups and that stakeholder groups are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In its National Infrastructure  Advisory Council (NIAC) Vulnerability Disclosure Framework, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  identifies four major categories of stakeholder involved in the vulnerability disclosure process.29 These  include (i) discoverers (or finders); (ii) coordinators; (iii) vendors; and (iv) users. Figure 7 summarises the  roles of these four primary participants.  Figure 7: Primary stakeholder categories involved in the vulnerability disclosure process  Additional stakeholders that can be added to these broad categories include the media, national  governments, more specifically law enforcement and national intelligence agencies, and profit-driven  criminals (Figure 8).  29 Chambers, John T. & John W. Thompson. 2004. ‘Vulnerability Disclosure Framework.’ As of 29 May 2015:  http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/vdwgreport.pdf  http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/vdwgreport.pdf  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  21  Figure 8: Additional stakeholder categories involved in the vulnerability disclosure process  There are stakeholders that are included in these groups but which may take on different roles or  perspectives. Examples include vendors or information security companies which engage in vulnerability  reward programmes, or academics who may be classified as discoverers, depending on the role they play.  As such, this list is not meant to be exhaustive, but aims at highlighting the main roles. For the purposes of  this report, a stakeholder is any individual, or group of individuals, which has a role in or influences the  vulnerability disclosure landscape.  2.4.1 Vulnerability disclosure lifecycle and associated roles  The vulnerability disclosure lifecycle commences with a discovery of a flaw. The individual or organisation  that discovers or finds the vulnerability is referenced as discoverer, often also as researcher (yet researcher  is a more specific term and may not include all types of discoverers). On a sidenote: the discoverer may also  be different from the reporter30, mentioned later in this chapter. From the moment of discovery, the  discoverer has a number of options on how to handle the vulnerability. First, the discoverer can report the  vulnerability to the vendor. Christey & Wysopal (2002) define a vendor as ‘an individual or organization who  provides, develops, or maintains software, hardware, or services, possibly for free.’31 Vendors often maintain  research staff who discover vulnerabilities and, as such, can potentially fulfil the role of discoverer in one  scenario and the role of vendor in another. This shows the diversity within each stakeholder category, since  a discoverer within a vendor may have a different interest or perspective compared to an independent  researcher.  A discoverer can also report the vulnerability to a coordinator. This can be the discoverer’s first action, or  the discoverer may wish to reach out to a coordinator after the vendor ignores the report. A coordinator can  be thought of as an intermediate entity that works with the discoverer/reporter and the vendor to ‘fix’ the  vulnerability.  As Christey & Wysopal (2002) note, ‘Coordinators are often well-known third parties.  Coordinators may have resources, credibility, or working relationships that exceed those of the reporter or  vendors.  Coordinators may serve as proxies for reporters, help to verify the reporter's claims, resolve  conflicts, and work with all parties to resolve the vulnerability in a satisfactory manner.’32 Examples of  coordinators used in the past are for example some Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs).33  30 As Christey & Wysopal (2002) note, ‘A Reporter is the individual or organization that informs (or attempts to inform) the Vendor  of the vulnerability.  Note that the Reporter may not have been the initial discoverer of the problem.’ [Christey, Steve & Chris  Wysopal. 2002. ‘Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure.’ As of 12 August 2015:  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-christey-wysopal- vuln-disclosure-00#page-3]  31 Christey, Steve & Chris Wysopal. 2002.  32 Christey, Steve & Chris Wysopal. 2002.  33 The term CSIRT and Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) are generally used interchangeably.  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-christey-wysopal-vuln-disclosure-00#page-3 https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-christey-wysopal-vuln-disclosure-00#page-3  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  22  Coordinators can also represent a diverse category: on the one hand, coordinators can be, as mentioned,  CSIRTs that are able to use their networks and ‘central’ position to capture the attention of the vendors and  ensure vulnerabilities that are critical and reported receive an appropriate response. Also other types of  coordinator exist, which have a commercial interest (examples will be discussed in the section on bug bounty  programmes).  The discoverer can also decide to publicise the vulnerability more broadly, without informing the vendor or  an intermediary, and directly publish the information to users of a product. (The Department of Homeland  Security includes users as a stakeholder in its categorisation as the manner in which the vulnerability is  disclosed and the subsequent potential and likelihood for exploitation ultimately affect their level of  security.34)  From the moment a potential security vulnerability is discovered, there are a number of basic steps involved  in the process of disclosing the vulnerability to the public. The primary steps, illustrated and summarised in  Figure 9, include the following: (i) discovery; (ii) notification; (iii) investigation; (iv) resolution; and (v)  release.35  Figure 9: Key steps involved in the disclosure of security vulnerabilities36  2.4.1.1 Role of the media  The media fulfils a crucial role in the dissemination of information with regard to vulnerability disclosures.  Hill (2014), for example, describes how in the case of the GoToFail vulnerability and the ‘Apple silence’,  journalists and security researchers had to inform the public and respond to its questions regarding the  vulnerability.37 The media, as a result, can be perceived to fulfil a number of roles, which may not be captured  in a more traditional model of vulnerability disclosure processes as described above.  The treatment of vulnerabilities by the media has for sure influenced the vulnerability disclosure landscape,  sometimes in a good way, sometimes not (according to the experts interviewed during this study).  Interviewees indicated how – before answering the questions – distinctions between media outlets as well  as vulnerability reporters must be made since the level of technical knowledge influences the quality of  34 Chambers, John T. & John W. Thompson. 2004.  35 Organization for Internet Safety. 2004. ‘Guidelines for Security Vulnerability Reporting and Response.’ As of 30 September 2015:  https://www.symantec.com/security/OIS_Guidelines%20for%20responsible%20disclosure.pdf  36 Adapted from: https://www.symantec.com/security/OIS_Guidelines%20for%20responsible%20disclosure.pdf  37 Hill, Kashmir. 2014. ‘Apple's Deafening Silence on 'GoToFail' Security Flaw.’ Forbes, February 24.

Information security media journalists and outlets, for example, generally maintain a high level of  knowledge and expertise, and by this are in a better position to report accurately on an issue. A general  perception, however, is that media reporting is prone to ‘hyping’ vulnerabilities, especially as a result of a  trend to label vulnerabilities and market them with catchy names and logos. The hype may overshadow the  technical characteristics of the vulnerability and as such worry the public and other stakeholders  unnecessarily. Figure 10 presents a snapshot of some of the headlines that appeared in online media relating  to the case studies included in this report (see Chapter 3).  Figure 10: Example headlines in the global online media relating to the vulnerability case studies included in this report  The positive influence of the media is that the attention devoted to information security in general, and  vulnerability disclosure in particular, has made it a relatively mainstream topic. Interviewees recognised this  as well, describing how the media highlights and pushes the issue of cybersecurity, and improves security  awareness among the public. The media is in a position to reach out to the general public, which can have  two other benefits. Firstly the ability to exert pressure on vendors to take the topic of vulnerability disclosure  seriously. Full disclosure of a vulnerability only has an impact as long as the media is willing to report on the  issue. The second aspect is the ability of the media to inform the public when a vulnerability requires action  on the part of the end-user such as installing a patch.  2.5 Different forms of vulnerability disclosure  How, when, and by whom a vulnerability is disclosed are core topics of debate within the information  security community. Disclosure of vulnerabilities can occur roughly in three different ways. Cencini et al.  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  24  (2005) identify three different types of vulnerability disclosure.38 The first is non-disclosure which is the  easiest to explain but the most difficult to quantify. Non-disclosure means that the discoverer keeps the  vulnerability secret and does not report it, neither to the vendor nor to the public (Figure 11). Non-disclosure  may, however, include the sale of the vulnerability to a third party.  Figure 11: Non-disclosure of vulnerabilities  The second form is full disclosure, which is the opposite of non-disclosure since with full disclosure the  discoverer discloses the vulnerability to the public at large (Figure 12). Full disclosure may not give the  vendor sufficient time and warning to resolve the vulnerability and makes vulnerability information openly  available to malicious potential attackers. Full disclosure does not discriminate among its recipients or  audience.  Figure 12: Full disclosure of vulnerabilities  The third form is responsible disclosure. This is an ambiguous term, especially since it has a normative  connotation of being ‘responsible’ and interpretation varies from stakeholder to stakeholder. As a result the  more recent preference is to use the term coordinated vulnerability disclosure, as it’s perceived as being  more neutral. In both cases, the discoverer reports the vulnerability to the vendor with the intention of  assisting the vendor in resolving the vulnerability (Figure 13). When a resolution is available, the vendor  publishes the vulnerability alongside a patch for users. The knowledge about the vulnerability does not  become public until a solution is available.  Figure 13: Responsible or coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities  There is also limited disclosure, which can also be classified as a variant of responsible and coordinated  vulnerability disclosure. Limited disclosure occurs when only specific parties are informed about a  vulnerability. Coordinated vulnerability disclosure can also include the presence of a third party to lead the  coordination process (Figure 14).  38 Cencini, Andrew, Kevin Yu, and Tony Chan. 2005. ‘Software Vulnerabilities: Full-, Responsible-, and Non-Disclosure.’ As of 9  October 2015:  http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep590/05au/whitepaper_turnin/software_vulnerabilities_by_cencini_yu_chan.pdf  http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep590/05au/whitepaper_turnin/software_vulnerabilities_by_cencini_yu_chan.pdf  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  25  Figure 14: Responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities involving a coordinator  2.5.1 Different opinions about disclosure types and the challenges associated  A variety of arguments exist for and against the adoption of the different existing vulnerability disclosure  forms. Full disclosure is perceived as objectionable since the software vendor(s) may not be aware of the  vulnerability or may not have enough time to develop a solution for it before the disclosure becomes public.  Once the vulnerability has been disclosed to the public, and a solution to patch the vulnerability is not  available (yet), malicious actors are in a position to exploit it.39 This claim against full disclosure, however,  has been criticised by other experts. According to Schneier, full disclosure is a ‘good idea.’ Schneier writes:  ‘Public scrutiny is the only reliable way to improve security, while secrecy only makes us less secure.’40 The  fear that malicious actors may exploit the information provided through full disclosure assumes that they  are not already aware of the vulnerability. The other assumption is that software vendors will indeed spend  time and financial resources to fix the vulnerability. For Schneier, both of these assumptions are false.  Schneier delves into the economics of the matter to explain how there has to be an incentive for software  vendors to fix the vulnerability, which is not necessarily always present. Cavusoglu et al., however, write  ‘[a]lthough immediate public disclosure might provide necessary motivations to vendors that might  otherwise ignore the vulnerability otherwise [sic], it also punishes other vendors that would make an honest  effort to deliver the patch promptly by not providing them adequate time to address the vulnerability.’41  The greatest challenge in the area of vulnerability disclosure is the fundamental difference in opinions  among stakeholders and stakeholder groups. This is precisely why the vulnerability disclosure debate,  despite going on for ages, remains alive. There is an inherent difference of opinion between discoverers,  who prefer to advocate a full disclosure approach, and vendors, who prefer to advocate a ‘responsible’ or  coordinated vulnerability disclosure approach. As an interviewee stated, ‘The reality is that they are actually  both right in their own way. They are both right in terms of their own worst case scenario.’ The challenge  then is to deviate from an extreme point of view and to build in an inherent flexibility which allows one’s  perspective to change according to the specifics of a vulnerability. Not every vulnerability, after all, will fall  into the category of the worst case scenario.  Moreover, attention needs to be devoted to different classes of attack.42 There are opportunistic attacks  which generally rely more heavily on publicly available information about vulnerabilities and exploits.  Perpetrators of these types of attacks are willing to carry out a high number of attacks each with a low  probability of success but a high probability of detection. Attacks of this nature are measurable and their  impact can be quantified to a certain extent. This is in contrast to targeted attacks, where perpetrators prefer  custom-developed solutions, have a base level of operational security, and have access to a range of  software exploits. Moreover, a specific feature of targeted attacks is that the perpetrator has a strategic  target in mind. These types of attacks are difficult or potentially even impossible to measure in a reliable  manner. How individuals think about vulnerability disclosure policy, however, is influenced by their ability  to model and anticipate targeted attacks and associated behaviour. If a user, whether an individual or an  organisation, does not have the ability to model targeted attack behaviour  – perhaps due to a lack of high- quality data – then there is a bias towards a longer public release timeline for the vulnerabilities. As one  interviewee notes, ‘These decisions are designed to reduce harm from opportunistic attacks and assume  that no other attackers have access to the vulnerability information.’ Based on observations from the private  39 See for example Cavusoglu, Hasan, Huseyin Cavusoglu & Srinivasan Raghunathan. n.d. ‘Emerging Issues in Responsible  Vulnerability Disclosure.’ As of 7 October 2015: http://www.infosecon.net/workshop/pdf/65.pdf)  40 Schneier, Bruce. 2007. ‘Schneier: Full Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities a “Damned Good Idea”.’ As of 7 October 2015:  https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2007/01/schneier_full_disclo.html  41 Cavusoglu, Hasan, Huseyin Cavusoglu & Srinivasan Raghunathan. n.d.  42 Written input from respondent.  http://www.infosecon.net/workshop/pdf/65.pdf https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2007/01/schneier_full_disclo.html  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  26  exploit market, there appears to be a growing number of vulnerability discoveries that are already known  by advanced attackers. This is a phenomenon known as ‘bug collision.’ When a vulnerability is already known  by advanced attackers, the level of urgency increases and timelines for public release are shortened.  Arguably many efforts and initiatives that are being introduced aim to facilitate the development of a  common ground to overcome the existing fundamental difference of opinion. Yet, based on the discussion  on types of attacks, it becomes evident that disclosure ought to be tailored to the vulnerability and that  polarised positions should be replaced by a more flexible perspective.  2.5.2 Role of CSIRTs  Direct communication between software vendor and vulnerability reporters may be hampered by distinct  interests both parties hold, as well as the fundamental differences of opinion described above. This is evident  both with respect to independent discoverers as well as with regard to security researchers who may be  employed by a vendor and who report the vulnerability to another vendor. This tension leads to the  introduction of CSIRTs as a potentially important stakeholder that can play a role in coordinating the process  and keeping the public interest at heart. Within the information security community, CERT Coordination  Centre (CERT-CC)43 has held a vulnerability disclosure process for many years. The tradition of CSIRTs acting  as a coordinator appears to be a more recent development in the European Union (EU), although CERT-FI44  was broadly recognised by interviewees as having significant experience in this role. CIRCL, the CSIRT for the  private sector, communes and non-governmental entities in Luxembourg, also maintains a vulnerability  disclosure policy.45  Through knowledge of the vulnerability, CSIRTs are also in a position to (confidentially) notify their  constituents, such as critical infrastructure organisations, to make them aware of the vulnerability and  potentially take steps ahead of the release of a patch. In this way, the vulnerability is disclosed, but to a  select group to ensure malicious actors do not obtain the damaging information.  During the interviews the project team specifically asked the interviewees what role they believed CSIRTs  can play in this area. This section must be prefaced by noting that certain CSIRTs already play an active role  in coordinated vulnerability disclosure. These include – as noted above – CERT-CC based in the United States,  CERT-FI based in Finland and JP-CERT based in Japan. Moreover, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)  in the Netherlands also maintains a role in vulnerability disclosure as it launched a policy in 2013.46  Opinions of the role of CSIRTs differ, depending on the experience of the interviewees. Some interviewees  were sceptical about CSIRTs, mainly due to the CSIRTs’ direct ‘government connection or association’ (see  4.2.5). Interviewees expressed concerns about the potential implications of sharing vulnerability information  with an organisation which is ‘part of the government’ and may not be ‘independent.’ Such scepticism  varied, based on which nation or Member State respondents were speaking of and what their experiences  were with respect to CSIRTs. Other respondents, for example, very clearly indicated that such claims were  unjustified based on their experiences. As indicated by one CSIRT, in its experience the reporter needs to  43 The CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) is the Coordination Centre of the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) for the  Software Engineering Institute (SEI), a non-profit US federally funded research and development centre.  44 CERT-FI is the Finnish national computer security incident response team whose task is to promote security in the information  society. CERT-FI is a part of the Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority.  45 Computer Incidence Response Center Luxemburg (CIRCL). ‘Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure.’ As of 7 October 2015:  https://www.circl.lu/pub/responsible-vulnerability-disclosure/  46 National Cyber Security Centre. 2013b. ‘Responsible Disclosure Guideline.’ As of 7 October 2015:  https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/news/responsible-disclosure-guideline.html  https://www.circl.lu/pub/responsible-vulnerability-disclosure/ https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/news/responsible-disclosure-guideline.html  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  27  feel a certain level of confidence with regard to the CSIRT in its vulnerability coordinator role. Publicly  publishing a disclosure policy helps to gain a certain level of trust from the reporter.  The main role which CSIRTs can play with respect to vulnerabilities is as a ‘coordinator’ of the process. This  could, however, become complicated as expressed by the scepticism of some of the interviewees. As  coordinators of the process, CSIRTs may become involved in certain parts of the vulnerability disclosure  processes, but not all. The CSIRTs that the project team spoke to indicated how they generally encouraged  discoverers to first try to contact the vendor themselves before approaching the CSIRT. Discoverers could  reach out directly to CSIRTs in case they wanted to remain anonymous, did not have the contact information  for the vendor, or if the vulnerability involved multiple vendors or organisations. Discoverers may also  contact CSIRTs if they cannot come to an agreement with the vendor or the vendor ignores their reports.  As one interviewee described it, ‘The dynamic from the software company will change if a third party is  involved. So if it’s just a relationship between the vulnerability researcher and the software company, there  is a higher chance that the software company will be confrontational, and a lower chance that they will  resolve the issue in a timely manner.’  2.5.3 Bug bounty programmes reward reporters  The relationship between discoverers and vendors has evolved over time, but remains complex since they  have different objectives and interests, and as such also often distinct opinions on the severity of the  vulnerability and the necessity to inform the public, and how fast this should be done, if at all. One of the  main developments in bringing vendors and discoverers closer together has been the introduction of bug  bounty programmes, Vulnerability Purchase Programmes (VPPs) and Vulnerability Rewards Programmes,  which have all become commonplace. A bug bounty programme rewards a reporter for reporting a  discovered vulnerability. According to Friis-Jensen (2014), bug bounty programmes have existed since  October 1995 when Netscape offered a cash reward to those who were able to find and subsequently report  security vulnerabilities in Netscape Navigator 2.0 Beta.47  The idea, however, was not adopted by other  software vendors until several years later. IDefense, a company which VeriSign later acquired, introduced  an initiative which offered researchers cash rewards for reporting software vulnerabilities.48 IDefense  functioned as an intermediary between the researchers reporting the vulnerabilities and the software  vendors. TippingPoint in 2005 introduced the Zero-Day Initiative (ZDI), which was a competing programme  to the initiative introduced by IDefense.49 The main goals of the ZDI are:   ‘Extending TippingPoint’s security research organisations (via DVLab’s research team) by leveraging the  methodologies, expertise, and time of others   Encouraging the reporting of zero-day vulnerabilities in a responsible manner to the affected vendors  by financially rewarding researchers   Protect its customers through the TippingPoint Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) while the affected  vendor is working on a patch’50  47 Cobalt. 2014. ‘The History of Bug Bounty Programs.’ Cobalt, 11 April.

ZDI then conducts its own research and  analysis to validate both the identity of the researcher as well as the vulnerability. ZDI proceeds to make a  monetary offer to the researcher. If the researcher accepts, then the researcher receives a prompt payment.  ZDI indicates how subsequently vendors are notified of the vulnerability, while Tippingpoint also develops  an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) filter. The ZDI maintains a specific policy for its vulnerability disclosure  to vendors. The ZDI will try to contact the vendor at least three times via different means, i.e. email, phone  and through an intermediary. However, ‘[if] DVLabs exhausts all reasonable means in order to contact a  vendor, then DVLabs may issue a public advisory disclosing its findings fifteen business days after the initial  contact.’52  Frei describes how both iDefense and the ZDI do not act on all vulnerabilities they receive, but rather appear  to focus on highly critical vulnerabilities that target prevalent software products. As can be seen in Table 2,  the number of public disclosures made by ZDI has seen an increase over the last three years.53  Table 2: Historical trend of the number of public disclosures made through the Zero-day Initiative54  Year Number of disclosures  2012  203  2013  287  2014  427  Besides these ‘intermediary initiatives’, bug bounty programmes initiated by vendors have become more  common since 2004. During that year the Mozilla Foundation introduced cash rewards to researchers who  reported critical vulnerabilities in Firefox. The Mozilla bug bounty programme is still active and now covers  most of its products.55 Currently several other big names, such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft maintain  bug bounty programmes. Facebook has its Whitehat programme, where researchers can report the bugs  they discover. Depending on the severity of the detected vulnerability, Facebook will provide a cash reward  of at least US$500, although there is no pre-determined maximum. The findings from its Whitehat  programme are showcased on the Facebook Bug Bounty page. This page also reports on statistics of the  programme during the previous year. For 2014, Facebook described how:  ‘Submissions increased by 16% to 17,011. We are happy to see that the program is continuing to  produce high quality reports – 61 of last year's eligible bugs were categorized as high severity,  49% more than the previous year.  We've paid out more than $3 million since we got started in 2011, and in 2014 we paid $1.3 million  to 321 researchers across the globe. The average reward in 2014 was $1,788.  51 Zero Day Initiative. n.d.-a.  52 Zero Day Initiative. n.d.-b. ‘Disclosure Policy.’ As of 7 October 2015:  http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/disclosure_policy/  53 Shannon_Sabens. 2015. ‘Milestone today, good times ahead.’ HP Security Research Blog, 12 May.

We now have  123 countries reporting bugs.’56  Besides having individual programmes, certain organisations also contribute to more overarching initiatives  such as the Internet Bug Bounty programme which is dedicated to the discovery of vulnerabilities in  frameworks that are used in many applications.57 Another initiative is HackerOne, a company which provides  a platform designed to streamline vulnerability coordination and bug bounty programmes by enlisting  hackers to improve vendor security.58 It is important to emphasise that HackerOne itself is not a bug bounty  programme, but rather works with vendors who have such programmes. HackerOne’s services are free  unless the vendor or another organisation pays the discoverer for the vulnerability, in which case HackerOne  charges a commission. HackerOne currently has a wide-ranging clientele as well as a large number of  researchers affiliated with the platform. According to Perlroth, HackerOne has about 1,500 users on its  platform and collectively they have fixed around 9,000 vulnerabilities, earning around US$3 million in  bounties.59  Overall, these bug bounty programmes have been welcomed by the information security community  because they bridge the gap between discoverers and vendors. Through these programmes, vulnerability  discovery has become a more structured and rewarding process for both parties, which is more conducive  to effective cooperation. Even so, there is some reluctance with respect to the bug bounty programmes and  paying for vulnerabilities in general (see 4.2.7).  56 Facebook Bug Bounty. n.d. In Facebook Product/Service page.

Instead of money,  United Airlines decided to reward reporters in ‘award miles’:  Severity Examples Maximum payout in award miles  High Remote code execution 1,000,000  Medium  Authentication bypass  Brute-force attacks  Potential for personally identifiable  information (PII) disclosure  Timing attacks  250,000  Low  Cross-site scripting  Cross-site request forgery  Third-party security bugs that affect United  50,000  There are other curious features to the company’s bug bounty programme, especially since it removed from a  flight a researcher who tweeted about a vulnerability in the airline’s Wi-Fi-system only weeks before the  introduction of its programme. United Airlines specifies which vulnerabilities are eligible for submission and which  are not. In light of events with respect to the tweeting researcher, the latter category is particularly worthy of  mention since United Airlines considers the following vulnerabilities ineligible:   ‘Bugs that only affect legacy or unsupported browsers, plugins or operating systems   Bugs on internal sites for United employees or agents (not customer-facing)   Bugs on partner or third-party websites or apps such as:   cruises.united.com   hotels.united.com   hub.united.com   unitedmileageplus.com   vacations.united.com   Bugs on onboard Wi-Fi, entertainment systems or avionics   Insecure cookie settings for non-sensitive cookies   Previously submitted bugs   Self-cross-site scripting   Vulnerabilities that apply only to you or your own account’62  2.5.4 Zero-day market  Besides bug bounty or vulnerability reward programmes, discoverers can also receive financial rewards via  other channels. This can occur through the so-called zero-day market. Sources in the media have previously  described aspects of the zero-day market about which they have been able to acquire information.  60 United. n.d. ‘United Airlines bug bounty program.’ As of 7 October 2015: http://www.united.com/web/en- US/content/contact/bugbounty.aspx  61 Zetter, Kim. 2015a. ‘United Airlines Pays Man A Million Miles for Reporting Bug.’ Wired, 14 July.

Vupen did not act as a participant in the contest, instead the company carried out its activities in the  background. Google offered US$60,000 for the details of their approach, but Vupen refused. Greenberg  quotes Bekrar who states: ‘We wouldn’t share this with Google for even $1 million. We don’t want to give  them any knowledge that can help them in fixing this exploit or other similar exploits. We want to keep this  for our customers.’64 According to Greenberg, the clientele of Vupen consists of government agencies which  acquire the vulnerabilities to infiltrate and disrupt the operations of criminals and intelligence targets. This  situation has led to concerns among civil society groups.65 Concerns exist not only because the zero-day  vulnerabilities could end up in the wrong hands, but also because there may be a lack of oversight regarding  the situations for which intelligence agencies and law enforcement officials use them.  Schneier describes how the market for zero-days has matured substantially over the last few years. He  describes how in 2007 Charlie Miller described his attempts to sell zero-day exploits, and how in 2010 a  survey indicated that the opportunity for a zero-day market was limited. Schneier simultaneously reflects  on how the progression of a zero-day market functions as a game changer with dangerous consequences.  As Schneier writes, ‘I’ve long argued that the process of finding vulnerabilities in software systems increases  overall security. This is because the economics of vulnerability hunting favoured disclosure.’66 The  introduction of the zero-day market, however, changes these dynamics. He indicates how, since the grey  market is more lucrative than the public vulnerabilities market, it will lead to more hackers choosing the  former rather than the latter.  Zero-day vulnerabilities on the grey market are purchased on the assumption that the sale is exclusive and  that the vendor will not be notified of the vulnerability.67 Sometimes, according to Greenberg, the payment  will be made in instalments as long as the vendor has not patched the vulnerability. A vulnerability after all  only maintains its zero-day status as long as no solution is available and disseminated among the users of  the product. Although then it could still have value, as indicated by Ablon et al., as a ‘half-day.’68  The majority of interviewees who mentioned the issue of exploiting vulnerabilities for national intelligence  purposes identified this as a challenge, especially since the zero-day market is able to offer significantly  higher rewards to reporters than can more legitimate efforts such as bug bounty and vulnerability reward  programmes.  63 Greenberg, Andy. 2012. ‘Meet the Hackers Who Sell Spies the Tools to Crack Your PC (And Get Paid Six-Figure Fees).’ Forbes, 21  March.

Case Studies  To determine how vulnerability disclosure works in practice, this section of the report examines in detail the  following four case studies of vulnerabilities:   Heartbleed;69   Sandworm70;   Shellshock71; and   POODLE.72  These four vulnerabilities were selected because (i) they were classified as being high/severe impact; (ii)  they were easy to access and exploit; (iii) they were (consequently) widely distributed; and (iv) they were all  reported in 2014. For each of the case studies, the analysis covers the whole lifecycle of the disclosure  process.  3.1 Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160)  3.1.1 Introduction  The vulnerability known to the public as Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160) provides attackers with the  opportunity to ‘steal’ information which, under normal conditions, would be protected by SSL/TLS  encryption. The seriousness of the Heartbleed bug was broadly recognised, especially since the vulnerability  was located in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. The main purpose of the SSL/TLS  encryption is to provide communication security and privacy over the Internet for applications such as web,  email, instant messaging (IM) and some virtual private networks (VPNs). With the Heartbleed bug security  was compromised since the bug provided anyone on the Internet the opportunity to read retrieved data  from the memory of the systems protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software.73 The  vulnerability exists in all default versions of OpenSSL dating back to March 2012.74 Sapio (2014) describes  the criticality of the vulnerability by indicating how there is a lack of reasonable limits on the type of  information that can be compromised; the ability for attacks to be automated and distributed, which  complicates identification of possible attackers; and the observation that the attack had potentially been ‘in  69 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2014-0160 [National Institute of Standards and Technology. 2015a.  ‘Vulnerability Summary for CVE-2014-0160.’ As of 7 October 2105:  https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014- 0160]  70 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2014-4114 [National Institute of Standards and Technology. 2015b.  ‘Vulnerability Summary for CVE-2014-4114.’ As of 7 October 2105:  https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014- 4114]  71 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2014-6271 [National Institute of Standards and Technology. 2015c.  ‘Vulnerability Summary for CVE-2014-6271.’ As of 7 October 2105:  http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014- 6271]  72 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2014-3566 [National Institute of Standards and Technology. 2015d.  ‘Vulnerability Summary for CVE-2014-3566.’ As of 7 October 2105:  http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014- 3566]  73 Heartbleed.com. 2014. ‘The Heartbleed Bug.’ As of 7 October 2015: http://heartbleed.com/  74 Sapio, Tim. 2014. ‘Heartbleed: Examining the Impact.’ DarkReading, 10 April.

According to the timeline  generated by Grubb (2014), Google researcher Neel Mehta discovered the vulnerability at the latest on 21  March 2014. On that day, two Google employees generated a patch for the vulnerability and distributed it  across services and servers around the world. Several days later, on 2 April 2014, a Finnish IT security testing  company – Codenomicon – also discovered the vulnerability and reported it to the National Cyber Security  Centre (NCSC-FI) in Finland.78  Once the NCSC-FI received a report of the vulnerability, the organisation began to verify, analyse and  approach the authors of OpenSSL as well as software, operating system and appliance vendors that were  potentially affected by the vulnerability. Since the vulnerability had been discovered independently by the  two Google employees, the vulnerability had been publicly disclosed before the work of the NCSC-FI had  been completed.79  On Monday, 7 April 2014, Cloudfare published a blog post entry about Heartbleed. A couple of hours later  the company posted a tweet referring to the blog post. Shortly after, Mehta also tweeted about the  vulnerability. Codenomicon also tweeted and directly linked to the website they created: heartbleed.com.  During the day, the rest of the world was able to read about Heartbleed, and the story about the vulnerability  quickly spread through the media.  The disclosure of Heartbleed was a topic of discussion, especially in the media. As described by Grubb (2014),  ‘Ever since the \"Heartbleed\" flaw in encryption protocol OpenSSL was made public on April 7 in the US there  have been various questions about who knew what and when.’  JPCert describes how it received information about the vulnerability a few days prior to disclosure, from one  of its global counterparts.80 The JPCert team was about to commence the coordination process with  developers when the vulnerability was made public by the OpenSSL team. As indicated in the blog post, this  sequence of events showed the JPCert team that even though they received the information in a confidential  manner, others may have possessed the same information. This is especially true for open-source products.  Uchiyama (2014) writes, ‘The experiences that I had over this past year have shown me that not only are  more and more people looking for vulnerabilities, but this information is moving around at such high speeds  to a variety of parties, where in some cases, have no idea that another particular group has that  information.’81  75 Sapio, Tim, 2014.  76 Sass, Jeff. 2015. ‘The Role of Static Analysis in Heartbleed.’ SANS Institute.

It also provides the developer with more control over the matter.  Figure 15: Timeline for the discovery and disclosure of Heartbleed  3.1.3 Aftermath of disclosure  The media attention garnered by the Heartbleed bug in 2014 caused quite a stir. In his blog post on  Heartbleed, Kaminsky begins by stating ‘we need to take Matthew Green’s advice, start getting serious about  figuring out what software has become Critical Infrastructure to the global economy, and dedicating genuine  resources to supporting that code.  It took three years to find Heartbleed.  We have to move towards a model  of No More Accidental Finds.’82 ENISA published a flash note called the Heartbleed vulnerability a ‘Wake-up  call’ 83 about cyber security, and in particular about existing critical vulnerabilities which are dormant.  Another point of discussion in the aftermath of the Heartbleed disclosure was the question revolving around  the knowledge of, in particular, the National Security Agency (NSA). Michael Daniel, Special Assistant to the  President and the Cybersecurity Coordinator, described in a blog on the White House website how the US  government had no knowledge of the vulnerability prior to its disclosure.84 This was a primary topic of  discussion shortly after the disclosure of the vulnerability when reports in the media revealed allegations  that the NSA was not only aware of the vulnerability but exploited the vulnerability for its own purposes.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) suit against the NSA  82 Kaminsky, Dan. 2014. ‘Be Still My Breaking Heart.’ Dan Kaminsky’s Blog, 10 April.

The company, which was  the primary discoverer according to the timeline publicly available, was labelled as ‘selfish’ by some IT  security experts.86  According to these experts, Google ‘waited’ for a long time to tell the OpenSSL team and  also played ‘favourites’ by being selective in which private corporations it told about the vulnerability.87 An  interviewee described how it mainly involved a ‘circle of friends.’ While there is a lack of clarity about the  exact date Google researchers discovered the vulnerability, based on publicly information which also  includes Google sources reporting to the media, the vulnerability was discovered by Google researchers  sometime between 1 March and 21 March, but not reported to OpenSSL until 1 April 2014.88 This was at the  very least eleven days later. This appears to be at odds with the official Google policy as described in one of  its blogposts: ‘We always report these cases to the affected vendor immediately, and we work closely with  them to drive the issue to resolution.’89  3.1.3.1 Impact  With such a high-profile vulnerability as Heartbleed, the main question after its disclosure became, ‘what is  its impact?’ IBM security systems characterised Heartbleed as ‘one of the most widespread and impactful  security vulnerabilities of all time.’90 Despite the almost instant availability of a solution for Heartbleed, the  vulnerability remained a potential danger for users because of the ‘ubiquity of OpenSSL.’91 Any delay in the  instalment of the patch meant users remained vulnerable. IBM as a result explains how one-day attacks can  be just as dangerous as zero-day vulnerabilities.92 Users, however, are also dependent on third-party  software vendors to find and resolve the vulnerability.93 Despite the popularity roaming around zero-days,  Ablon et al.

At that time, there were more than 300,000 attacks targeting IBM Managed Security  Services (MSS) clients in one day. After 22 April, attacks slowed down, according to IBM; yet, the company  also indicated how nearly half of all affected systems remain unpatched and that it sees some 7,000 attacks  within MSS each day.97 The Pew Research Center surveyed 1,501 adults living in the United States about  Heartbleed and reported how 39% indicated they had changed their passwords or cancelled accounts, but  that 6% believed their personal information had been compromised.98  Approximately a month after the disclosure, several sources reported that half of the servers remained  unpatched and subsequently vulnerable.99  3.1.3.2 Looking ahead  In March 2015, Krebs reported on a ‘security makeover’ introduced by OpenSSL to fix a number of security  defects.100 The disclosure of these updates is particularly relevant in light of the overarching disclosure  debate. One of the founding partners of OpenSSL, Steve Marquess, indicated that the information would be  shared only with major operating system vendors prior to its public release. As quoted in Krebs, Marquess  describes how ‘We’d like to let everyone know so they can be prepared and so forth, but we have been  slowly driven to a pretty brutal policy of no [advance] disclosure.’101 This brutal policy Marquess refers to  links to a blog post he published after the Heartbleed bug reports and the reactions about the less than ideal  manner of disclosure. In this blog post Marquess details the difficulty encountered by the OpenSSL team to  do its work based on limited financial support. As he writes in his opening statement, ‘As has been well  reported in the news of late, the OpenSSL Software Foundation (OSF) is a legal entity created to hustle  money in support of OpenSSL. By “hustle” I mean exactly that: raising revenue by any and all means.’102  3.2 Sandworm (CVE-2014-4114)  3.2.1 Introduction  In early 2014, a group initially dubbed “Quedagh” grabbed the attention of researchers at F-Secure – an  online security and privacy company based in Helsinki, Finland – and ESET – an IT security company  headquartered in Bratislava, Slovakia. Quedagh’s modus operandi was unique as the group utilised a  modified BlackEnergy trojan, usually connected to cybercriminal activities such as DDoS attacks, spam  distribution, and bank fraud, to infiltrate specific government and private businesses in Ukraine and Poland  for the purpose of network discovery, data collection, and remote code execution. According to F-Secure,  the use of this modified BlackEnergy trojan (now known as Black Energy 3 or lite) for politically-oriented  attacks was particularly intriguing as it provided a ‘greater measure of plausible deniability than is afforded  by a custom-made piece of code.’103 The Quedagh campaign was indeed very sophisticated as it drew on  97 Donohue, Brian. 2014.  98 Rainie, Lee & Maeve Duggan. 2014. ‘Heartbleed’s Impact.’ Pew Research Centre, 30 April.

No other  use of this zero-day exploit is known outside the Sandworm context.  iSIGHT Partners contacted the parties and clients they were able to identify, and started collaborating with  Microsoft on 5 September 2014 to deliver the technical analysis of the exploit concerned and the malware  used in the attacks. Both companies furthermore coordinated the tracking of the group’s activities by  monitoring Sandworm’s targeting behaviour and the broader use of this zero-day exploit in the wild.108  As a result of this collaboration, previously unconnected pieces of information began to reveal a  comprehensive picture of what is now known as the Sandworm campaign. On the basis of overlapping  infrastructure, use of traditional crimeware, and unique references to Dune, iSiGHT Partners were able to  trace the genesis of Sandworm to the year 2009. They were also able to connect the group to various other  attacks on NATO in 2013, targeted attacks on the 2014 GlobeSec Meeting in Bratislava, and the ‘Quedagh’  operation.  3.2.2.1 Zero-day (CVE-2014-4114)  The Windows zero-day exploit used by Sandworm exposed a dangerous vulnerability across all supported  Microsoft Windows systems. According to TrendMicro the vulnerability was located in the PACKAGER.DLL  file which is part of the Windows Object Linking and Embedding property (OLE).109 OLE’s basic functionality  is to make content, such as text, images, and programme files created in one programme available in  another. Sandworm, however, used embedded OLE content to weaponise Microsoft Office documents such  as PowerPoint files. Once opened, the PowerPoint presentation would run in animation mode and execute  OLE objects without prompting additional user action.  The embedded OLE container essentially included a URL that linked to an .INF and a .GIF file (which was  actually a renamed .EXE file) which were automatically downloaded once the PowerPoint file was opened.  The .INF file was used to automatically rename the .GIF into an .EXE file, and created a ‘runonce’ entry in the  system registry which would execute the .EXE file once the system rebooted. The then installed BlackEnergy  malware created a backdoor which enabled remote access for the attacker.  104 F-Secure. 2014.  105 Ward, Stephen. 2014. ‘iSIGHT discovers zero-day vulnerability CVE-2014-4114 used in Russian cyber-espionage.’ iSIGHT  Partners Blog, 14 October.

Users could  choose between disabling the WebClient Sevice,112 blocking TCP ports 139 and 445,113 or blocking launching  executables via setup information files.114 Symantec additionally advised businesses and consumers to  ‘exercise caution when opening email attachments, particularly from unknown sources.’115  The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) ranked the Windows OLE Remote Execution  Vulnerability at a 9.3 (High) base score.116 However, as Ross Barrett, Senior Manager at Rapid7 noted,  Microsoft only called the issue ‘important’ with a patching priority two, which is one level down from urgent  patching and the most severe rating.117 Microsoft’s decision was primarily based on the fact that the exploit  would require a user to click on a file. Qualys on the other hand ranked the exploit as severe, explaining that  ‘it is pretty easy to trick a single person into clicking on a file.’118  3.2.3 Aftermath of disclosure  3.2.3.1 Zero-day Redux (CVE 2014-6352)  On 21 October 2014, Haifei Li at McAfee noted in a blog post that Microsoft’s official patch was not robust  enough to close down the entire zero-day vulnerability exposed by Sandworm119.  Indeed, in cooperation with James Forshaw at Google’s Project Zero, Li reported the issue to Microsoft’s  Security Response Center on 17 October 2014 after successfully developing a proof-of-concept for the still  existing vulnerability gap (CVE 2014-6352). Coinciding with Li’s blog post, Microsoft released a temporary  ‘fix it’ patch, but no further details were provided because no permanent patch was yet available to the  public. On 11 November 2014, Microsoft’s Security Advisory for CVE 2014-6352 was finally updated.  Apparently the zero-day vulnerability also extended to OLE objects in webpages when using Internet  110 'Microsoft's 'Patch Tuesday' generally occurs on the second Tuesday of each month.  111 Ward, Stephen. 2014.  112 Impact: Any service depending on Web Client service will not start  113 Ports 139 and 445 are used for additional services such as Common Internet File Systems, DNS Administration, NetBT service  sessions, printer sharing sessions and more.  114 Impact: Applications that rely on the use of .INF files to execute an installer application may not automatically execute.  115 Symantec Security Response. 2014. ‘Sandworm Windows zero-day vulnerability being actively exploited in targeted attacks.’  Symantec Security Response Blog, 14 October.

In essence if a user was logged on with full administrative rights, ‘an attacker could install  programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.’120  On 16 October 2014, TrendMicro uncovered the fact that Sandworm targeted Supervisory Control and Data  Acquisition (SCADA)-centric systems which used the GE Intelligent Platform CIMPLICTY HMI solution suite.  Further investigation by iSIGHT revealed that WinCC and the Siemens HMI were also targeted with a system- specific BlackEnergy payload. Although TrendMicro clarified that they ‘found no indications that this  malware is actually manipulating physical SCADA systems or their resultant data’,121 the intrusions might  have been reconnaissance work for a future attack.122 According to Wolfgang Kandek, Chief Technology  Officer at Qualys, Sandworm was a reminder to system administrators to ensure that user permissions are  set correctly.123  Figure 16: Timeline for the discovery and disclosure of Sandworm  3.3 Shellshock (CVE-2014-6271)  3.3.1 Introduction  CVE-2014-6271124 was a critical remote code execution vulnerability that was discovered in the widely used  GNU Bourne-Again Shell (or Bash) in September 2014.

Shellshock thus represented a highly  significant security concern when it was discovered and subsequently disclosed.  3.3.1.1 Background  The Bash software was written in 1987 by Brian Fox, a computer programmer, who also maintained the  software for the next five years. In 1992, the maintenance of Bash was handed over to Chet Ramey, currently  a Senior Technology Architect at Case Western Reserve University in the United States.128 Ramey has been  voluntarily maintaining the software as a ‘hobby’ since 1992. The bug appears to have been accidentally  introduced in August 1989 by Fox during an update of Bash.129  The types of systems which were potentially vulnerable as a consequence of the bug included devices such  as standard computers, servers and routers. Even industrial products were at serious risk of compromise, as  indicated by advisory alerts issued by large corporations.130 As a result of lying undetected for almost 25  years, some analysts projected that Bash was built into as many as 70% of computer systems that were  connected to the Internet, running into the hundreds of millions.131 Indeed, one estimate noted that around  50% of all web servers around the world are Unix-based, resulting in approximately 500 million of these  systems that were potentially at risk.132 In summary, Shellshock ‘made benign-seeming server requests into  a full command-and-control situation’,133 and it was ’assumed that most server-based architectures [could  have been] affected.’134  3.3.2 Discovery and disclosure  The vulnerability in Bash was discovered on 12 September 2014 by Stephane Chazelas, an IT Manager and  Unix/open source enthusiast based in Edinburgh, United Kingdom. Chazelas detected the bug after  125 Cygwin provides a Unix-like environment for Microsoft Windows based systems.  126 For example, as the command language interpreter on Unix-based systems, Bash allows users to carry out editing, completion,  integer arithmetic, string-related, and input-output-related tasks.

Shellshock  allowed unauthorised access to ‘infected’ machines, thereby enabling attackers to take control of entire  machines.156 Heartbleed, on the other hand, largely permitted hackers to ‘spy’ on infected systems (for  example, steal passwords). To quote a security researcher, ‘Whereas something like Heartbleed was all  about sniffing what was going on, this was about giving you direct access to the system.… The door’s wide  open.’157 Notably, Shellshock was classified as high impact and low complexity in the NVD’s158 CVSS, and was  given the maximum ratings (10) on the 10-point CVSS impact and exploitability scales.159 By permitting the  remote execution of arbitrary code on affected systems, the critical vulnerability allowed (i) unauthorised  disclosure of information; (ii) unauthorised modification; and (iii) disruption of service.160  As the vulnerability lay undiscovered for more than 25 years, millions of computer systems across the globe  had incorporated and built on top of the ‘flawed’ Bash code, thus explaining the widespread ‘fear factor’  associated with its sudden disclosure in September 2014. The immediate aftermath of the disclosure saw  widespread media coverage around the world warning of the looming impact of the vulnerability on  potentially millions of devices.  Immediately after disclosure, some security companies noted parallel increases in traffic related to the  progression of the validating process (by security researchers), testing of environments (by organisations),  and targeted attacks to take advantage of the vulnerability.161 As Tran (2014) reported, ‘Within hours of the  release of this bug to the general public, attackers reportedly exploited this vulnerability to create botnets  on compromised computers to perform DDos (distributed denial-of-service) and vulnerability scanning.’162  For example, within one day of the disclosure, some attackers had taken advantage of the vulnerability and  had built a botnet (called ‘wobpot’) that targeted systems at the US Department of Defense and Akamai, a  leading US-based content delivery network provider and cloud platform.163 Annex D lists sample text from  some of the advisories and alerts that were issued by various organisations around the world within hours  of the disclosure of the vulnerability.  3.4 POODLE (CVE-2014-3566)  3.4.1 Discovery and disclosure  On 14 October 2014, Google Security team member Bodo Möller, in cooperation with Thai Duong and  Krzysztof Kotowicz, published a vulnerability connected to the 18-year-old Security Socket Layer (SSL) 3.0  protocol which they dubbed ‘Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption [POODLE]’.

A subsequent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack,164 similar to BEAST165, then allowed  encrypted traffic to be decrypted by the attacker (Figure 19).  For all practical purposes SSL 3.0 has long been deemed an obsolete and insecure protocol166 which was  widely replaced by its successors: Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0, TLS 1.1, and TLS 1.2. Indeed, SSL’s only  systemic purpose today is to allow for backwards compatibility to guarantee interoperability with legacy  systems (ex. IE6/XP and older) and for providing a smoother user experience.167  The encryption cypher suits in SSL 3.0 are particularly worrisome as SSL 3.0 either uses a RC4 stream cypher  or an AES CBC-mode bloc cypher. According to Bodo et al. both cyphers are deemed unsafe, and in contrast  to other related forms of attack there was no reasonable workaround for POODLE. As a result Bodo et al.  concluded that ‘to achieve secure encryption, SSL 3.0 must be avoided entirely.’168  164 Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack is an attack where the attacker, unbeknownst to the other parties involved in the  communication, relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating  with each other.  165 BEAST (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS), is an exploit that was practically demonstrated by Julian Rizzo and Thai Duoang at the  2011 Ekoparty Security Conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina. BEAST leverages a weakness in the cypher block chaining (CBC) to  exploit  SSL protocol to decrypt and obtain authentication tokens and cookies from HTTPS requests.  166 Weith, Loren. 2006. ‘Differences between SSLv2, SSLv3, and TLS.

Patching SSL 3.0 would have also been a realistic option, but was quickly  dismissed as being neither feasible nor a sufficiently prompt solution to the problem at hand.170  Google’s servers had been supporting TLS FALLBACK SCSV since February 2014.171 Subsequent versions of  their Chrome browser removed SSL 3.0 completely. Microsoft published a Security Advisory on 14 October  and Mozilla offered a ‘SSL Version Control Firefox extension’ to disable SSL 3.0.172 Oracle recommended to  its customers to permanently disable SSL v3.0. Their quarterly Critical Patch Update disabled SSL 3.0 in the  Java Runtime Environment on 20 January. Cisco released a Security Advisory on 15 October while noting that  they are ‘not aware of any malicious use of the vulnerability.’173 IBM offered an update on 20 October which  disabled SSL 3.0 by default for HIS 7.0 and newer.  For all the attention devoted to the vulnerability, POODLE received a relatively low (4.3 – medium) base  score on the NVD’s174 CVSS.175 The relatively low score underlines that POODLE is indeed tied to specific  scenario parameters which limit exposure. First, an attacker would have to be on the same network as the  user in order to exploit the vulnerability (or gain ISP-level interception through DNS poisoning).176 Secondly,  the user must be running JavaScript.177 And thirdly, client and server must support SSL 3.0.178 Only if these  three conditions are met can a network attacker intercept, for example, encrypted HTTPS session cookies to  hijack secure web sessions.  POODLE in essence offered defenders five vectors of mitigation which were almost equally effective in  closing down the vulnerability: (i) disable SSL 3.0 on the client side; (ii) disable SSL 3.0 on the server side; (iii)  disable SSL 3.0 in Java Script; (iv) Install a TLS Fallback on the Client side; and (v) or install a TLS Fallback on  the server side.  169 Chang, Ziv. 2014. ‘POODLE vulnerability puts online transactions at risk.’ TrendLabs Security Intelligence Blog, 15 October.

Along with seriousness, however, as indicated in the quote above, the likelihood  that a vulnerability can and will be exploited is a potential influential factor on manner of disclosure.  3.4.2.2 POODLE bites again (CVE-2014-8730)  While patches to fix the POODLE vulnerability were gradually implemented, by either disabling SSL 3.0 (thus  relying on TLS to avoid the problem) or by installing a TLS FALLBACK SCSV, Brian Smith (formerly of Mozilla)  raised the notion that these fixes do not necessarily resolve the underlying padding problem. On 17 October  Brian wrote that he fixed a bug in NSS back in 2010, ‘where NSS did not verify all the padding bytes in TLS  1.0 records. Thus, any server that is using a version of NSS released prior to June 2010 is likely vulnerable to  POODLE-like attacks even if SSL 3.0 is completely disabled.’181  In essence the problem came down to an implementation flaw in the CBC encryption mode. SSL 3.0, for  example, under-specifies the content of the CBC padding bytes. Implementations can therefore not check  the padding bytes, which open SSL 3.0 up to an Oracle attack. TLS 1.0 specifications on the other hand do  not specify that implementations must check the padding. That requirement was only added in subsequent  TLS versions. ‘Thus, an implementation could completely conform to TLS 1.0 but still [be] vulnerable to  POODLE.’182 To make the problem worse, while TLS 1.1 and 1.2 implementations must check the padding, it  is not necessarily the case ‘that otherwise-working implementations actually conform to that requirement,  and there's no way for the client to check that in a reliable, high-performance, and accurate way.’183  Adam Langley at Google summarised the issue on 8 December by stating that ‘if an SSLv3 decoding function  was used with TLS, then the POODLE attack would work, even against TLS connections.’184 Langley therefore  concluded that ‘everything less than TLS 1.2 with an AEAD cipher suite is cryptographically broken.’185  Independently from Brian Smith, the problem was also investigated by Yngve Nysaeter Pettersen at Vivaldi.  On December 9, Pettersen noted that 3.6% of servers are vulnerable to a POODLE-style attack even if they  disable SSL 3.0. Whether this concerns all global servers, however, remains unreported. The problem  furthermore compounds with 4.24% of TLS 1.2 servers having the same vulnerability, ‘which means no  rollback attack is needed, at all, when attacking these servers.’186  At Qualys, Ivan Ristic added that ‘the impact of this problem is similar to that of POODLE, with the attack  being slightly easier to execute-no need to downgrade modern clients down to SSL 3 first, TLS 1.2 will do just  179 Finkle, Jim. 2014. ‘New Poodle web threat not seen as menacing as Heartbleed, Shellshock.’ Reuters, 15 October.

Langley noted that while his personal connections allowed him to get in touch quickly with F5, it  took him almost 2 weeks to get in touch with the right person at A10.189  Finding solutions to the extended POODLE exploit was more difficult than getting rid of the original POODLE.  Clients could not simply disable the TLS 1.x protocol as 61% of servers still only supported TLS 1.0.190  Additionally, even servers with TLS 1.2 were vulnerable to the extended POODLE issue. Pettersen therefore  offered two solutions: (1) upgrade to a customised TLS version where the issue has been patched; or (2) use  an extension of the TLS protocol which was released by IETF in early 2014, which changed how encryption  and integrity checking was done.191 Vendors picked up on the first solution by releasing Security Advisories  and providing patches for the devices affected. Qualys updated its free online SSL Server test in order to  detect the TLS problem.192 And TrendMicro advised its users to apply the latest Deep Security Update which  helps to detect traffic from POODLE exploits.193  Figure 20: Timeline for the discovery and disclosure of POODLE  187 Ristic, Ivan. 2014. ‘Poodle Bites TLS.’ Qualys Blog, Security Labs, 8 December.

For some of the vulnerabilities presented above, the disclosure was more a  topic of discussion than it was for others. Google played a leading role in at least two of the case studies:  POODLE and Heartbleed. Whereas there appeared to be no criticism of the manner of disclosure with  respect to POODLE, in the context of Heartbleed, Google’s role in the disclosure process was criticised by  some194. Heartbleed, as indicated through the development of a Special Interest Group (SIG), shed extra  focus on the necessity to better coordinate vulnerability disclosure across the complex landscape.  The vendor-to-vendor disclosure for Sandworm appears to have led to few problems based on available  information. Microsoft and iSIGHT cooperated to track the activities of the group actively using Sandworm,  which allowed them to connect information and develop a more comprehensive overview of the situation.  The delayed public disclosure was based on the desire to let the disclosure coincide with Microsoft’s well- known ‘Patch Tuesday’.  When it comes to lessons learned, Seth Geftic, Senior Manager at RSA, concluded that POODLE has taught  us that ‘effective vulnerability management requires organizations to have a process in place to help very  quickly identify affected systems, including the greatest risks to help prioritize remediation. Having the right  tools in place to gain this visibility and quickly identify the vulnerabilities can make all the difference.’195  Geftic further explains that while the vulnerability was in itself not dangerous, it did provide a compelling  case for an intelligence-driven security strategy. Servers and clients must have a way-of-action to react  immediately upon threat intelligence.196  Another common feature displayed by at least three of the four vulnerabilities is the lengthy period it took  to discover some of these vulnerabilities. Ultimately, Shellshock happened because of a programming  mistake in some computer code that went undetected for more than two decades; critical code that was  being maintained by a single individual in their spare time. Heartbleed also went undetected for a number  of years, as did Sandworm. The examples of Shellshock and Heartbleed pose crucial questions about the  seeming over-reliance of the technology industry (and therefore businesses and consumers) on systems and  products whose software has been ‘built and maintained by small teams often made up of volunteers’197  Some experts have ascribed these issues to the ‘lifecycle problem’ in which bugs in software are continually  neglected because ‘people are making mistakes whilst writing code and making further mistakes when  patching the original problems.’198 These fundamental questions require an answer from individuals beyond  the information security community. Arguably, since a large number of stakeholders rely on these  instruments, responsibility for their security should be borne more broadly.  Clearly, as the case studies have illustrated, there are a number of fundamental challenges associated with  the disclosure of vulnerabilities. These are investigated in more detail in Chapter 4.  194 The study team did not have an opportunity to discuss these case studies with Google to also include their perspective on the  matter.  195 Geftic, Seth, 2014.  196 Geftic, Seth, 2014.  197 Lee, Dave. 2014.  198 Lee, Dave. 2014.

Challenges in the vulnerability disclosure landscape  4.1 Introduction  Chapter 2 has already provided an insight into the challenging landscape of vulnerability disclosure. This  chapter provides more information about specific challenges identified by the interviewees of this study.  The first step towards improving vulnerability disclosure is to develop an overview of the challenges that  different stakeholders face. These challenges are, due to competing or conflicting interests, largely  subjective. Yet, as has become evident from the interviewees’ responses, certain challenges are experienced  by specific stakeholders while there are several overarching issues that the broader information security  community faces. Those commonalities offer room for improvement because they are shared challenges.  The analysis presented in this chapter aims to highlight the challenges that have been identified by  interviewees based on their experience. The interviews are therefore the primary source of data for the  content of chapters 4 to 6. For reasons of continuity, the project team has tried to refrain from continually  referring to the interviewees and to do so only sparingly. The analysis has also been supplemented by  information gathered from the literature.  The key findings are summarised in the box below.  Key findings: what are the challenges encountered in the vulnerability disclosure landscape?   Legal challenges: Individuals who discover a vulnerability often face legal threats when they  decide to report it. These threats can have implications on not only civil and criminal law but also  contract law, licensing, patent law and other types of legislation. Discoverers may find themselves  in a grey area due to the methods used to discover the vulnerability and the way the vulnerability  was disclosed.   Lack of vendor ‘maturity’: Whereas large companies familiar within the information technology  environment have robust processes in place for vulnerability reporting, other companies are new  to the scene. These may be small companies, or companies which have not previously been part  of the information technology landscape. This could lead to a lack of maturity on the part of these  players and potentially complicate the vulnerability disclosure eco-system, as less mature  companies are ill-prepared to accept vulnerability reports and act upon them in the interest of the  information security community.   Lack of researcher maturity: Just as vendors may lack experience in accepting vulnerability  reports, so researchers can lack experience in reporting vulnerabilities. When such experience is  absent, researchers may approach vendors in a threatening or otherwise non-conducive manner  which prevents fruitful cooperation. Researchers who lack experience may also be unwilling to  compromise on, for example, timelines identified by the vendor.   Incoming vulnerability reports are not always taken into consideration by the vendors: Due to  subjective reasons, vendors may disregard reports about a vulnerability. Vulnerabilities may be  labelled as academic and theoretical and interest for a previously disregarded vulnerability  report might increase after a security incident has happened.   Vulnerability acquisition for national intelligence purposes: Unpatched vulnerabilities can be  used by criminals but also potentially by national intelligence or law enforcement officials. This  means that sometimes a vulnerability will remain undisclosed for such (national) security  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  50  purposes. Yet while a vulnerability remains undisclosed to the vendor, so will the development of  a solution remain absent, leaving users in general vulnerable.   Users do not implement patches (in a timely manner): Once a vulnerability is disclosed by the  vendor, and a solution such as a patch to be installed via an update is available, the user must  implement it. Such implementation is essential for the vulnerability to be resolved; a lack of  implementation leaves users even more vulnerable since information about the vulnerability is  now public. Users have a tendency, for a variety of reasons, to postpone or to negate patching  altogether. This may be because of a lack of understanding or knowledge. Furthermore, it could  be more important to keep the average patch application time as short as possible rather than  solely focusing on the disclosure timeline.   Discoverer motivation varies: The motivation for an individual to discover a vulnerability varies.  The motivation of the discoverer can influence the decision s/he makes regarding what to do with  the vulnerability. The increase in bug bounty programmes and the growing zero-day market have  increasingly placed a focus on monetary reward. This may lead to over-incentivising the search for  vulnerabilities and may also lead to the expectation that discoverers will always receive a  monetary reward for their discovery.  4.2 Challenges  4.2.1 Legal challenges  The aim of this section is to give the reader a glimpse into some of the legal issues in the context of  vulnerability disclosure (e.g. copyright law). Information provided seeks to provide general guidance to some  of the legal aspects, but not as legal advice as such; certainly it doesn’t constitute an exhaustive analysis of  the issues at hand.  Several interviewees identified legal challenges as a primary issue of concern in the vulnerability landscape.  The main source of such challenges is determined by the activities underpinning the discovery and disclosure  of a vulnerability. Such activities may be formally classified as ‘illegal’ and as such introduce problems when  the discoverer reports the vulnerability. As vendors are trying to protect their intellectual property, these  kind of problems might emerge. Moussouris suggests that ‘When vendors lack a process and ability to  receive, investigate, remediate, and communicate about security vulnerabilities, often the first reaction is to  call in the lawyers.’199 She describes an example where vendors made use of the Digital Millennium  Copyright Act (DMCA)200 to intimidate a security researcher. This particular case concerned security  researcher Mike Davis from IOActive, who along with some colleagues discovered security vulnerabilities in  electronic locks made by CyberLock. Davis and his colleagues tried to contact and disclose their findings to  the company but to no avail. Instead, the researchers received a letter from the company’s law firm, Jones  Day, the day before they planned on publicly releasing the vulnerabilities.201 The lawyers make reference to  a provision in the DMCA which makes it illegal to circumvent digital rights technology designed to protect  copyrighted work. It is perhaps useful to note in this case that the vendor sells physical devices with  199 Moussouris, Katie. 2015. ‘Vulnerability Disclosure Deja Vu: Prosecute Crime Not Research.’ DarkReading, 12 May.

This vendor had not previously been confronted with a situation of  vulnerability disclosure by a reporter. As such, legal challenges introduced are closely connected to the  challenge of vendor maturity (see 4.2.2).  According to interviewees, when a legal team gets involved, the response can often be heavy-handed largely  due to the lack of knowledge of, and sensitivity to, the technical aspects of vulnerabilities. Lawyers may  immediately claim the reporter should not have looked at the code as they attempt to detach the  organisation from accountability. They do not reject the existence of the vulnerabilities discovered or the  insecure nature of the code, rather through legal argumentation they aim to avoid having to repair the code  and patch the vulnerability. This may be due to potentially high costs associated with resolving the  vulnerability.  Another concern identified is the Wassenaar Arrangement,202 a multilateral export control regime that  requires the licensing of dual-use goods and technologies including military equipment, special materials  etc. In December 2014, certain types of intrusion control software were put on the dual-use goods and  technologies list.203 The wording of the control list implies that exploits are within the scope of the list. That  means that anyone operating in the 41 parties204 to the Wassenaar Arrangement would need an export  licence to speak about zero-day exploits or essentially any vulnerability reporting on the internet. The fear  is that the requirement of an export license will not only affect the sale of exploits, but also the existence of  bug bounty programmes. Wassenaar formulates some exemptions, although not for bug bounty  programmes. In contrast to the situation in the United States, the European manner of implementation may  exempt bug bounty programmes. At this moment (status end of 2015), the situation is uncertain.  Overall, various stakeholders have indicated how the present and proposed legal climate in various  jurisdictions does not favour improved security of the information security ecosystem.  A positive example in the EU comes from The Netherlands, where the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)  published its guidance to promote the increase of coordinated disclosure, has made the topic an issue of  public discussion. This led to a response by the Dutch Public Prosecutor’s (DPP) office which sent a letter to  all its departments informing them of the matter205. The letter indicates how the notion of ethical hacking  is not a concept which can be found in criminal law in the Netherlands, nor anywhere else, most likely. The  concept of ethical hacking implies that prior authorization be given by the system owner to the ethical hacker  before testing the security of the systems; such an arrangement can be corroborated by a service contract  directly or indirectly with the ethical hacker and the requesting vendor. While Dutch penal law does not  recognise the concept of ethical hacking, the letter states that ethical motives can play a role in the  determination whether an action constitutes a violation of criminal law. If a hacker finds a vulnerability and  reports this vulnerability to the vendor, then this is in principle ethical hacking. However, if a hacker reports  a vulnerability and there are indications that the hacker has done more, whether intentionally or  unintentionally, then a criminal investigation will probably take place. ‘Done more’ refers for example to  copying of sensitive data or personally identifying information.  202 Wassenaar Arrangement. n.d. ‘Introduction.’ As of 8 October 2015: http://www.wassenaar.org/introduction/index.html  203 European Commission. 2014. ‘Commission updates EU control list on dual use items.’ Trade, Dual Use Control, 22 October.

In the letter there is a clear message that  reporting a vulnerability does not absolve the reporter from subsequent prosecution or legal investigation.  The letter has made the public prosecutor visible in the discussion, as noted by an interviewee, which is  valuable in and of itself. The discoverer community responded positively towards the development because  even if the letter does not provide carte blanche, it has demonstrated to the discoverer community that the  public prosecutor’s office is seriously thinking about the issue and how best to approach it.  In short, the letter instructs public prosecutors to take the following aspects into consideration:  Figure 21: Letter from the Dutch Public Prosecutor’s office on responsible disclosure206  The study team did not find other examples of public prosecutors providing such an explicit explanation of  how they treat vulnerability disclosure cases.  4.2.2 Vendor ‘maturity’ varies  A central theme throughout many of the interviews was the issue of vendor maturity. Having various levels  of vendor maturity presents a challenge. The difference between a mature and a less mature vendor is the  ability of the organisation to cope with receiving a vulnerability report about one of its products. While  discussions around vulnerability disclosure have been taking place for several years and have not  fundamentally changed, new players have nevertheless appeared on the scene. A large number of vendors  have not been privy to the debate as long as others, which means they are now going through the early  phase of discovering how to respond to vulnerability reports. Interviewees mentioned examples of cases  and companies such as car, aeroplane and refrigerator manufacturers, as well as vendors who manufacture  medical devices. The latter point is crucial since, as an interviewee indicated, this goes beyond ‘my credit  206 Openbaar Ministerie. 2013b, 18 March. Letter to: Aan alle parkethoofden, As of 8 October 2015:  https://www.om.nl/publish/pages/22742/03_18_13_beleidsbrief_college_responsible_disclosure.pdf  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  53  card has been stolen’. As another interviewee stated on the topic of vendor maturity, ‘While Microsoft, Cisco,  Oracle, Apple and Google are familiar with that process, perhaps others are not familiar with it. They may  not have a security contact point and do not understand the whole disclosure process.’ There was specific  reference to the rapidly emerging Internet of Things207 domain as an area where immature vendors are at  risk in terms of vulnerability disclosure, because they are ‘new to the scene’ and have not reached a state  where they have the infrastructure in place and the willingness to deal with vulnerability reports.  Size of the vendor also matters as a factor of influence for maturity. One of the biggest challenges is for  discoverers to report a vulnerability to a small company that may not have prior experience of such a  process. Discoverers who do report vulnerabilities to smaller companies often find themselves ‘staring down  the barrel of legal threats’, as an interviewee noted (see 4.2.1).  An associated challenge with lack of vendor maturity is the ability to find the right contact person.  Sometimes organisations end up speaking to someone from the marketing department rather than a more  technically-inclined employee who is able to understand the vulnerability report. For organisations without  security awareness, discoverers are in a difficult position in identifying the right person to speak to when  reporting the vulnerability.  Maturity is required by different stakeholders to engage in vulnerability disclosure in an ethical and timely  fashion. Elaborating on this point, one interviewee stated how the vendor must engage in an open and  nonthreatening way to communicate, and that vendors must have a ‘plan’ (see 5.3.2). This also leads to a  second challenge identified during the interviews: the maturity of discoverers or researchers.  4.2.3 Researcher maturity varies  The challenge of varying levels of maturity also applies to researchers or discoverers of vulnerabilities.  Younger and inexperienced individuals who have not been part of the security community may not know  what to do and how to report a vulnerability. They may be faced with procedural as well as ethical and legal  questions. Recent graduates, as well as other younger or inexperienced reporters, may be unsure of their  options and may report to vendors in a ‘threatening’ way. Less mature discoverers may be unreasonable in  their treatment of timelines as identified by vendors. They may be more inclined to go to full disclosure  without having exhausted all their options; or perhaps they may be induced into selling a vulnerability on  the underground market. Responsiveness has to come from both sides.  Another interviewee echoed the challenge of having different levels of experience among discoverers. There  are several main groups that find vulnerabilities and know how to handle them well. Simultaneously, there  are many researchers who find one or two vulnerabilities per year and remain uncertain about how to handle  them. Moreover, some researchers may also lack the time to contact the project or the vendor and properly  explain the vulnerability.  4.2.4 Incoming vulnerability reports are not always taken into consideration by the vendors  Closely connected to the previous two challenges is that incoming vulnerability disclosure reports are not  taken into consideration by the vendors due to subjective matters. Even with large vendors, vulnerabilities  207 ‘The Internet of Things builds out from today’s internet by creating a pervasive and self-organising network of connected,  identifiable and addressable physical objects, enabling application development in and across key vertical sectors through the use  of embedded chips, sensors, actuators and low-cost miniaturisation.’ [Schindler, Helen R., Jonathan Cave, Neil Robinson, Veronika  Horvath, Petal Hackett, Salil Gunashekar, Maarten Botterman, Simon Forge and Hans Graux. 2012.

This is connected to another challenge mentioned by an interviewee that concerns the cost of rectifying a  vulnerability. He describes a situation where his organisation discovered a vulnerability in a car system which  was not severe, i.e. would not stop the brakes from functioning or similar, but to properly fix the vulnerability  required the recall of all affected cars. Such a recall is a costly endeavour, which means the manufacturer  may decide, based on the severity, to tolerate the vulnerability. Yet to express such tolerance in public may  be deemed unacceptable.  4.2.5 Vulnerability acquisition for national intelligence leaves users vulnerable  During the research for this report, the breach of the Hacking Team208 came to light and served to illuminate  a challenge several of the interviewees identified, albeit to varying degrees. This concerns the allegation that  some governments acquire and use vulnerabilities for national intelligence and/or law enforcement  purposes. According to some interviewees, this activity may pose a threat as vulnerabilities could remain  unresolved, leaving users vulnerable. Further, the suspicions about law enforcement or intelligence use of  vulnerabilities may impact the level of trust placed in national CSIRTs (see 2.5.2). Despite such concerns,  other interviewees recognised that governments may feel it is necessary to exploit vulnerabilities to access  relevant information, if it serves national intelligence or law enforcement purposes. Some may consider this  acceptable, since exploitation of vulnerabilities may intrude on users’ privacy less than, for example,  decryption of internet traffic.  4.2.6 Users do not implement patches (in a timely manner)  Even though the challenge of getting users to actually implement the patches goes beyond the vulnerability  disclosure phase, it is an essential aspect which also contains implications for how vendors handle disclosure.  Despite vendor provision of information about the vulnerability and its solution, some customers still  postpone the application of patches. According to an interviewee, there needs to be more trust in the vendor  by the customer, especially with respect to organisations operating within critical infrastructure sectors, to  apply patches as soon as possible. Any delay in patching enhances the criticality of the vulnerability since  the disclosure has placed the information about the vulnerability in the public domain, allowing any  perpetrator who was previously unaware of the vulnerability to attempt to exploit it (see 3.1.3.1). The  importance of immediate implementation became evident through, for example, Heartbleed, where IBM  security systems explained how one-day attacks can be just as dangerous as zero-day exploits.209 Despite  the existence of a patch, without its implementation users are still vulnerable. And since perpetrators are  aware of the vulnerability and the potential delay of users to immediately implement patches, they could  ‘strike while the iron is hot.’ One interviewee noted that it is more important to keep the average patch  application time as short as possible rather than solely focus on the disclosure timeline. The interviewee  further emphasised that the timeline is ‘completed’ not when vulnerability patches are made available by  vendors, but when they have been applied by users. Therefore, the interviewee recommended that vendors  prioritise an effective application of patches by users over a strict adherence to timelines for patch releases,  in order to minimise patch ‘recalls’ and ensure a comprehensive vulnerability fix. Auto-update was  welcomed by another interviewee precisely because users are prone to delay patching. Yet there may be  other challenges associated with such a feature. Although not mentioned by interviewees, there may be  other reasons for delayed patching of vulnerabilities by users, such as lack of understanding or knowledge,  208 http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/07/massive-leak-reveals-hacking-teams-most-private-moments-in-messy-detail/  209 Donohue, Brian. 2014.  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  55  which means that education may be a suitable means to assist users in patching vulnerabilities in a more  timely manner.  4.2.7 Discoverer motivation varies  The motivation of discoverers varies, which is another challenge in the vulnerability disclosure landscape.  Opinions differ on what drives researchers and others who discover vulnerabilities. According to one  interviewee, there are typically three types of motivators for researchers to discover vulnerabilities. The first  is a willingness to improve the security industry and the overall security ecosystem. Simultaneously,  discoverers in this category will also want to develop a good track record of finding and disclosing  vulnerabilities in order to enter the industry. The second category is more ego-driven. This type of  researcher, according to the interviewee, is more concerned about showing off their skills to the world. The  third group is seduced by the black market of vulnerability retail. Another interviewee recognises the  diversity of reasons why researchers are looking for or discovering vulnerabilities. According to him, the  community needs to be able to cater to all of the reasons that may drive researchers. He, however, believes  that only a few are focused on monetary rewards. This is a point of contention since money does seem to  play a key role. As another interviewee commented, ‘There is a small concern, and I don’t know if this will  bear out, but if it is common practice to always pay for a vulnerability, could that turn the incentives around  and people would be less likely to disclose because they are not getting enough money or because they  cannot find a buyer?’ There is at least anecdotal evidence for this. As described by Perlroth, ‘simply crediting  hackers or sending them swag no longer cuts it.’210 Ramses Martinez, Yahoo’s director of security, said he  started Yahoo’s bounty programme in 2013 after two hackers criticised Yahoo for sending them T-shirts in  exchange for four bugs that could have brought them thousands of dollars on the black market. Martinez  says he now considers bug bounties a “no-brainer”.’211  There are other concerns about paying for vulnerabilities. Through the introduction of bug bounty  programmes and vulnerability reward programmes, as well as the zero-day market, there are financial  incentives to discover and sell vulnerabilities. This may lead to an oversupply of vulnerabilities as the market  develops further. Therefore, caution is advised to avoid over-incentivising the search for vulnerabilities  because it may lead to a high number of ‘minor’ vulnerabilities which once discovered need to be addressed.  The overwhelming number may then divert scarce resources from more critical vulnerabilities which can  cause greater harm.  210 Perlroth, Nicole. 2015.  211 Perlroth, Nicole. 2015.  http://www.zdnet.com/article/yahoo-changes-bug-bounty-policy-following-t-shirt-gate/  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  56  5. Good practices for stakeholders active in vulnerability disclosure  5.1 Introduction  To establish a bridge between challenges and recommendations for improvement, this chapter explores a  selection of good practices identified by interviewees. These good practices are often closely associated with  the challenges and the recommendations for improvement, which means there is some overlap. This chapter  will allow different stakeholders to better understand what practices they can implement with the intent of  improving the overall vulnerability ecosystem. There is a primary focus on vendors and discoverers.  A list of the good practices identified have been summarised in the box below:  Good practices for stakeholders active in the vulnerability disclosure landscape   Use existing documents: Previous efforts have been made to gather good practices in the area of  vulnerability disclosure as well as to describe how to set up a vulnerability disclosure policy. To  prevent reinvention of the wheel, these documents should be used by stakeholders and should be  leveraged more by new initiatives. The ISO standards are a prominent example, although their lack  of free availability may hamper their reach.   Communication  Vendors should be reachable/have a point of contact: To prevent reporters from having to  spend valuable time and resources looking for the appropriate contact, vendors should have a  clear point of contact to deal with vulnerability reports, and this contact should be reachable.  Have a policy in place: Vendors should have a policy in place which addresses vulnerability  disclosure and describes how they respond to vulnerability reports. This policy will also indicate  to reporters what information they need to provide as well as give an insight into the process  of the disclosure.  Communication with different stakeholders: Communication with stakeholders requires  mutual respect, patience and transparency. Continual communication is essential to  acknowledge receipt of the vulnerability report as well as provide an indication of the next  steps.   Information dissemination: Information about the vulnerability as well as its solution, if available,  should be disseminated to inform users of the developments and to provide them with an  opportunity to protect themselves. How much information needs to be disseminated is a topic of  discussion among stakeholders.   Timelines: Timelines vary but a timeline should be mutually agreed upon (on a vulnerability-by- vulnerability basis) to ensure that a vulnerability will be sufficiently addressed by the vendor in a  timely manner.   Flexibility in reporting and disclosing: No one size fits all in the area of vulnerability disclosure, so  flexibility is necessary to tailor the vulnerability report as well as the response to the specifics of  the vulnerability.  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  57  5.2 Use existing documents  When asked about good practices for vulnerability disclosure, several interviewees identified existing  documents which contain good practices. One example is the Organization of Internet Safety (OIS)  document.212 According to an interviewee this provides a ‘pretty good framework’ for how responsible  disclosure ought to be carried out. Simultaneously, though the interviewee recognised the need for  refreshment of the document, he emphasised how the community should not ‘reinvent the wheel’ but  rather use what already exists and share it with stakeholders in a more active manner. Better-known  examples of good practice frameworks for vulnerability disclosure are two International Standards  Organisation (ISO) standards. These are ISO 29147213 and ISO 30111,214 which one interviewee recognised  as ‘good reference documents.’ The intention of both standards is to inform vendors who are in the process  of creating a vulnerability-handling and disclosure scheme. Larger vendors, governments and enterprises  helped to put the standards together. Some interviewees identified the ISO standards and appeared to credit  them with some value, whereas another interviewee stated how the ISO standard has had ‘very little’  impact. Although the interviewee recognised how these good practices, shared by the larger vendors, are  successful, their impact is limited. The value of the ISO standard is in bringing these practices to smaller  vendors, but this comes at a cost. ISO standards are not free and access requires payment of a fee. The  interviewee identified this as a big problem, ‘because in security information technology pretty much all the  standards are free, open, and available. It is thus to ISO’s detriment that its standards are not freely available.  If they were they would be much more usable for smaller organisations.’ Moreover, the interviewee stated  how he did not believe there was a lot of guidance on good practices for vulnerability disclosure. There are  other relevant documents such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Responsible Vulnerability  Disclosure Process;215 vulnerability disclosure processes of experienced organisations may also help to  illuminate some of the aspects for less mature organisations.216  This study aims to therefore enhance the availability of such guidance on good practices and to stimulate  improvement of the vulnerability disclosure situation through the dissemination of such practices as well as  the identification of challenges and associated recommendations for improvement.  212 Organization for Internet Safety. 2004.  213 ISO/IEC 29147:2014 provides guidelines for the ‘disclosure of potential vulnerabilities in products and online services.

Organisations  responsible for engagement with reporters (or potential reporters) of vulnerabilities spend a lot of time and  energy trying to find the right contact. This has led to at least one organisation, according to its own  testimony, sending recorded physical mail to locations so they can obtain a return receipt, which makes it  more difficult for vendors to ignore them.  5.3.2 Have a specific policy in place to deal with the disclosure process  There is a preference to go beyond merely a primary point of contact and for vendors to have a specific  policy in place that details how they handle vulnerabilities which discoverers report to them. It was noted  that such a policy should also include another good practice mentioned, which is communication with the  discoverer (see 5.3.3). A specific policy must at least address the following aspects:   Point of contact   Information required from the reporter   Possible responses from the vendor   Timeline of the process.  Closely related is the necessity – as an organisation – to have good arrangements with suppliers. This is  because sometimes a vulnerability can surface in a third-party system which is outside the user’s direct  control, and to act quickly arrangements with such suppliers and service providers must be in place to  determine how to handle the situation.  5.3.3 Communication with different stakeholders  Communication with the different stakeholders is key in terms of good practice. With respect to discoverers,  communication with the discoverer is crucial to ensure the process does not lead to unexpected outcomes.  Vendors need to be very clear about their expectations with regard to discoverers. Expectations should be  made explicit by companies, preferably through a statement on their website. Once a vulnerability has been  reported to a vendor, the company should respond as soon as possible and then keep the discoverer in the  loop as far as is practicable for the vendor or coordinator, and desirable for the discoverer. The OIS states  that within a maximum of seven calendar days of receiving a finder’s report, the vendor should acknowledge  its receipt.217  Even if a fix is not (yet) available, it is important to communicate the status to the discoverer and to  acknowledge that the organisation is working on the issue.  Just as communication with the discoverer is a  central element, so is communication with the vendor, as well as with other companies.  5.4 Information dissemination must occur, but opinions differ on how much  With respect to users of products, publishing information about vulnerabilities is crucial. Many vendors  worry about publishing vulnerabilities discovered in their products, out of fear that such publication reflects  poorly on them; as if they have made a mistake and criminals or others with malicious intent will take  advantage of it. An interviewee describes how he and his colleagues respond by stating: ‘First you are not  alone, no one writes perfect software. All software has security vulnerabilities. The maturity marker is that  you actually acknowledge them and fix them quickly. And provide your customers with a fix. That is what you  want to be measured on and not the fact that you had 10 bugs or zero-bugs or whatever.’ He goes on to  217 Organization for Internet Safety. 2004.  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  59  state that even if a vendor decides not to take any action or disagrees on the existence of a vulnerability, it  is important to be transparent.  The decision to publish information is driven by the desire to reduce the impact of the vulnerability on  society, whether business or consumers. Yet with users not implementing patches in a timely manner (see  4.2.6), the dilemma becomes how much information to share since it is difficult – as noted by an interviewee  – ‘to share enough to enlighten the public and not to stimulate attackers to use it or let them figure out where  they would get that further intelligence information.’ Another interviewee emphasised the need to provide  only the information that users actually need to determine whether the vulnerability affects them; and to  understand the impact if they decide not to apply the vulnerability patch. Technical details, for example, are  not provided to users because it is not necessary, according to the interviewee. This is, however, a source of  disagreement. Determining the appropriate amount of detail to disclose was also described by another  interviewee as a challenge. According to him, however, the decision how much information to disclose is up  to the researcher rather than the vendor, at least after the vulnerability has been addressed.  Another  interviewee explicitly stated how he would like all open source vendors to provide the technical details about  the vulnerabilities they fix. He describes further how, 'Some vendors operating on the limits of open and  closed source definitions have secretive practices that effectively harm the community's and other vendor's  abilities to assess and report their own versions of those software packages. We are left with \"open\" projects  that are effectively secretive dumps of code with no explanations.’  Information dissemination is therefore considered good practice, but how much, to whom and in what form,  remains an area of discussion. Zetter describes a situation between FireEye and ERNW – both information  security firms. ERNW described in a blogpost in September 2015, according to Zetter, how FireEye issued a  court injunction against ERNW. Even though FireEye agreed that ERNW could disclose its discovery of three  vulnerabilities in FireEye products, the dispute concerns the amount of information ERNW can publicise  about the vulnerabilities.218 Perhaps the question of how much information to disseminate ought to be  carefully assessed on case-by-case basis by each party involved in the process. Arguably, information output  needs to be improved because, as an interviewee indicated, companies are drowning in information.  Information needs to be more tailored. As one interviewee described it, ‘Let’s be clear on what it is. Whether  it’s important or not and what you need to do. Otherwise we are spinning wheels for nobody’s benefit. Just  that difference between do I have to update today, is it real, is it relevant, is it theoretical, do we think it can  get real…we need to distil it down. The world is drowning in information overload.’  5.5 Timelines lead to results  There appears to be a consensus that timelines are a necessary part of vulnerability disclosure and can  therefore be identified as a good practice. Without timelines, certain vendors may not address the  vulnerability at all. Providing vendors with short embargos for the development of a solution keeps them  ‘on top of their game’, since they cannot ‘sit’ on a vulnerability for months without a response. While a  timeline is not a guarantee that a vendor will address the vulnerability, it does often lead to results, i.e. an  actual response from the vendor and subsequent action to address the vulnerability.  It is, however, also important to note that when reporters disclose unfixed vulnerability information upon  the expiration of a timeline, users and customers of corresponding vendors are exposed to increased risk of  attack. Therefore, there needs to be agreement among the vendor community about reasonable timelines  to address a particular vulnerability, and continued collaboration with the reporter in addressing the  vulnerability. Timelines must take into account the different nature of distinct vulnerabilities as well as the  218 Zetter, Kim. 2015c. ‘A Bizarre Twist in the Debate over Vulnerability Disclosures.’ Wired, 11 September.

They must involve regular communication with the reporter to ensure  a degree of flexibility, should unexpected complications arise. As an interviewee said, ‘one timeline for all  type of vendors is unrealistic’ and timelines should be agreed between vendors and reporters on a case-by- case basis. The OIS also testifies to this in its Guidelines for Security Vulnerability Reporting and Response,  when it writes: ‘There is no single universally appropriate timeframe for investigating and remedying security  vulnerabilities.’219 Timelines help facilitate a timely response. Large vendors are reasonably good at  acknowledging vulnerabilities, working to generate solutions, and disclosing the information (see 4.2.2).  Wider adoption of this approach is needed by other organisations and industries to harmonise and  streamline the process.  Project Zero220  Even though this report aims to refrain from endorsing any particular initiative introduced by vendors, some  interviewees specifically identified Google’s Project Zero as a potential example of ‘good practice.’ Project Zero is a  security research team at Google consisting of individuals who are specialised in vulnerability research and software  exploitation. The team’s mission is to ’make 0day hard.’ This is motivated by the observation that (1) software  exploits are increasingly traded in a private market that is not accessible to software vendors and open-source  projects, and that (2) software exploits traded in this manner result in user harm. Project Zero has discovered and  managed disclosure of over 250 security vulnerabilities in a wide variety of products since the team's formation in  July 2014.  The main good practice identified by interviewees about Google’s Project Zero is the clarity, especially with respect  to the Project’s timeline. Project Zero uses a 90-day disclosure deadline on all of its vulnerability reports. If 90 days  elapse without a broadly available patch, then the bug report will automatically become visible to the public. There  are exceptions however. In February 2015, Project Zero updated its policy to include a grace period of 14 days.221  As the team writes in a blogpost, ‘If a 90-day deadline will expire but a vendor lets us know before the deadline that  a patch is scheduled for release on a specific day within 14 days following the deadline, the public disclosure will be  delayed until the availability of the patch. Public disclosure of an unpatched issue now only occurs if a deadline will  be significantly missed (2 weeks+).’222 The Project Zero team believes that on balance this is the optimal approach  for user security. The timeline provides vendors with a ‘fair’ and ‘reasonable’ length of time to engage in the  vulnerability management process but simultaneously acknowledging the urgency introduced by private bug  collisions.  5.6 Flexibility of reporting and disclosing  The timeline discussion has already briefly indicated how flexibility in terms of the way a vulnerability is  reported and subsequently treated is key, since no one size fits all vulnerabilities and their disclosures.  Interestingly, however, flexibility – according to some – should be on the side of the discoverer rather than  the vendor. From this perspective, the discoverer is at liberty to determine what flexibility is required for the  vulnerability. Yet flexibility, just as responsiveness, ought to be a two-way street to ensure there is common  ground for achievement of the ultimate outcome. The discoverer may, for example, be insufficiently aware  of the effort needed to develop a patch, and the implications of its release. Flexibility is also required, for  example, with respect to patching for critical infrastructure sectors, which is more complicated and  therefore requires more time for vendors to develop a patch. Flexibility is also necessary for other  219 Organization for Internet Safety. 2004.  220 For more info: https://cansecwest.com/slides/2015/Project%20Zero%20-%20making%200day%20hard%20- %20Ben%20Hawkes.pdf  221 Evans, Chris, Ben Hawkes, Heather Adkins, Matt Moore, Michael Zalewski & Gerhard Eschelbeck. 2015. ‘Feedback and data- driven updates to Google’s disclosure policy.’ Project Zero, 13 February.  http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/02/feedback-and-data-driven-updates-to.html  222 Evans et al., 2015.  https://cansecwest.com/slides/2015/Project%20Zero%20-%20making%200day%20hard%20-%20Ben%20Hawkes.pdf https://cansecwest.com/slides/2015/Project%20Zero%20-%20making%200day%20hard%20-%20Ben%20Hawkes.pdf http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/02/feedback-and-data-driven-updates-to.html  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  61  stakeholders, such as users or third parties involved in the development and subsequent dispatching of the  patch.

Recommendations for improvement  6.1 Introduction  The exploitation of vulnerabilities discovered in systems will continue to pose security risks, with potentially  damaging economic and societal impacts. Therefore it becomes all the more important that the various  stakeholders involved in this complex environment attempt to address – together – the various challenges  that are encountered in the vulnerability disclosure landscape. From the perspective of the security and trust  of the end-users of systems, there is consensus that vulnerabilities must be disclosed in a way that minimises  damage. Although movement towards more and better coordinated vulnerability disclosure has been  happening to some extent for several years now, the landscape is still ‘fragmented’ in many ways, and there  are pertinent questions that remain unanswered. The synthesis of the various sources of evidence used in  our analysis shows that there are several areas for consideration. This chapter outlines these  recommendations for improving the status quo in the vulnerability disclosure landscape. It is important to  highlight that our intention is not to prescribe detailed and specific actions, but rather to raise the key issues  which require careful consideration by all stakeholders involved in the vulnerability disclosure community.  For every recommendation, the study team has also identified the potential role for ENISA, which is a  determination based on input from interviewees as well as analysis from the team.  The core recommendations for improvement have been summarised in the box below.  Core recommendations for improvement from the analyses   The community must facilitate the improvement of vendor maturity: To make progress, vendor  maturity must be improved to ensure that all vendors are able to receive vulnerability reports and  respond to them in a manner which is accepted by the community and which will introduce the  smallest risks with respect to the security of users. In this context the term community refers to  different relevant stakeholders like EU Member States, vendors, security researchers, national  CSIRTs and ENISA. To improve vendor maturity, the community must stimulate less mature  vendors to introduce a policy and set up an infrastructure which allows them to accept  vulnerability reports.   Internationalisation through policy learning: The global nature of the internet requires a more  transnational approach to the topic of vulnerability disclosure, where successful cases in certain  countries or regions can be used for policy learning purposes in other areas of the world.  Simultaneously, stakeholder gatherings at the transnational level can use their international  access to further enhance such policy learning, and so allow the spread of good practices in  vulnerability disclosure.   Introduction of a neutral third party or enhancement of existing coordination centres: The  different interests held by stakeholders – especially reporters and vendors – as well as the growing  complexity of the landscape, both in terms of stakeholders and products, advocates the  introduction of a neutral third party to coordinate vulnerability disclosure. An alternative is to  enhance existing coordination centres, to ensure that power discrepancies as well as potential  conflicts of interest will not compromise the overarching goal of improved information security.   European policy makers and Member States should improve the legal landscape: The current  legal framework poses challenges for stakeholders involved in the disclosure process, as varying  requirements across jurisdictions need to be aligned, in order to facilitate information security and  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  63  stimulate market growth. In this direction the current legal framework needs to be reviewed for  requirements that pose obstacles rather than facilitating the processing of vulnerabilities.   Vendors should facilitate trust building, transparency and openness: From a vendor’s  perspective, the stigma associated with acknowledging that one of its products contains a  vulnerability could potentially lead to an unwillingness to recognise the existence of  vulnerabilities. Society should therefore move towards a state where the existence of  vulnerabilities is acknowledged and accepted, to facilitate more openness as a precursor to  improved information security.   ENISA could facilitate and advise to improve the vulnerability disclosure landscape: ENISA could  play a facilitating and advisory role in the area of vulnerability disclosure through information  dissemination, providing recommendations, striving for harmonisation, collaborating with the  security researcher community and demonstrating leadership. From a policy perspective, ENISA  could advise the European Commission about the necessity for transparency from vendors and  the negative impact of copyright law in the EU.  6.2 The community must facilitate the improvement of vendor maturity  As noted in Chapter 4, varying levels of vendor maturity is a problem for the overall vulnerability disclosure  landscape. Therefore, one of the recommendations is to improve vendor maturity. Such maturity can be  enhanced practically through implementing some of the good practices identified in Chapter 5. The main  recommendation for vendors is to have a policy in place. This will enhance the level of vendor maturity and  improve communication between stakeholders when vulnerabilities are discovered and reported. A  disclosure policy also improves transparency, enhances the quality of the products sold by vendors, and  stimulates the researchers as well as the broader information security community. Due to the necessity of  having to act quickly, it is essential to have a policy in place, otherwise coordinated vulnerability disclosure  will probably not work. Witnessing more vendors introducing policies and starting to think about how they  receive vulnerability reports is ‘the biggest positive change that we have seen over the last couple of years’,  according to an interviewee. Overall, vendors from different sectors could be encouraged & supported by  the Member States, national CSIRTs, and ENISA to implement a disclosure policy. These include organisations  within sectors that are increasingly more reliant on digital technology such as car manufacturers, airlines  and maritime, plus organisations generally included in the Internet of Things and Industrial Control Systems  domains. Besides private sector organisations, governments also need to have a robust vulnerability  disclosure process in place. Such a policy ought to combine both defensive and offensive elements, while  erring on the side of disclosure. More vendors ought to start practising vulnerability disclosure in any shape  or form, but preferably in a streamlined and harmonised manner through a published and clear policy.  ENISA can potentially assist in improving vendor maturity through Information dissemination about the  vulnerability disclosure process. This includes the development of a vulnerability disclosure policy and the  implementation of such a policy in the organisation.  ENISA could provide leadership, particularly around exploring the issues and perhaps bringing together  information from all stakeholder groups, publishing that information, and providing good practices.  Because of its impartiality and its pan-European reach, bringing common understanding is a step in the  right direction.  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  64  6.3 Internationalisation through policy learning  Due to the global nature of the internet, coordinated vulnerability disclosure needs to be adopted at an  international level. A mechanism needs to implemented to engage in policy learning from countries where  a particular model of coordinated vulnerability disclosure, such as in the Netherlands, has led to positive  results.223  The Global Forum on Cyber Expertise, which began after the Global Conference on Cyber Space  (GCCS) in April 2015 in The Hague, the Netherlands, was suggested as a viable venue in which to do that.224  ENISA was also recommended as an option although its reach may be limited to the EU context.  Simultaneously, the Security Interest Group (SIG) started as part of Forum of Incident Response and Security  Teams (FIRST) could also present a viable alternative, since the SIG gathers various stakeholders to agree a  standard of principles on the topic of coordinated vulnerability disclosure.  223 National Cyber Security Centre. 2015. ‘Introducing Responsible Disclosure: Experiences in the Netherlands: A Best Practice  Guide.’ As of 8 October 2015: https://www.gccs2015.com/sites/default/files/documents/BestPracticeRD-20150409_0.pdf  224 Global Conference on Cyberspace 2015. n.d. ‘Global Forum On Cyber Expertise (GFCE).’ As of 8 October 2015:  https://www.gccs2015.com/gfce  225 ICASI has previously published: Schiffman Mike. 2011. ‘The Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework: An Internet  Consortium for Advancement of Security on the Internet (ICASI) Whitepaper.’ As of 8 October 2015:  http://www.icasi.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/06/cvrf-whitepaper.pdf  226 ICASI. 2015. ‘Current Activities.’ As of 17 August 2015: http://www.icasi.org/current-activities/  FIRST introduces Special Interest Group (SIG) to come to coordination principles  Largely as a result of Heartbleed, the challenge of coordination prompted the introduction of a Special  Interest Group (SIG) as part of FIRST. The Industry Consortium for Advancement of Security on the Internet  (ICASI)225 initiated the SIG because of its belief that all stakeholder communities needed to be involved in  the discussion. The main focus is on developing a consensus on how to improve coordination. ICASI itself  was too limited in its membership. As a result, the initiators turned to FIRST with the request of sponsoring  a SIG on the topic of vulnerability coordination. The SIG has two aims: first to “‘drive the industry towards  more organised and repeatable approaches to vulnerability coordination’; and secondly to ‘routinely share  best practices and exchange protected information around vulnerabilities and mitigations.’226 With  sponsorship from FIRST, the stakeholder communities involved in the SIG are growing: from vendors,  researchers, CSIRTs, open source communities, to bug bounty programmes. Membership is open to  anybody. The SIG currently faces a relative underrepresentation of the open source community. Since  stakeholder engagement is deemed a priority, the SIG seeks to address the problem of disproportionate  representation by targeted outreach.  At the FIRST conference in Berlin in 2015, the SIG ratified two thrusts of effort. The first effort focuses on  improving coordination. This includes elements such as developing an understanding of whom to go to  and who would be a stakeholder that may be impacted. The SIG also aims to research whether there is a  directory, or some type of resource, that a researcher or company could access if they find a vulnerability.  To accomplish this first effort, the SIG wants to explore the possibility of a coordination directory. This  requires the group to gather information on existing directories and whether FIRST can connect to such an  existing directory, or whether it is preferable to establish a new one. Running parallel to that is the second  effort around establishing a set of coordination principles. Once agreed, the principles would be published  with use cases, approximately 3-5, that explore those principles. The use cases are both representative  studies from real-life and hypotheticals created to tease out the complexities of vulnerability disclosure.  The dialogue around the use cases will provide a ‘non-threatening, neutral forum’ while highlighting  potential dissension from various communities on how best to coordinate. The SIG aims to present its  ENISA could use its position and network to strive for harmonisation of vulnerability disclosure processes.  https://www.gccs2015.com/sites/default/files/documents/BestPracticeRD-20150409_0.pdf https://www.gccs2015.com/gfce http://www.icasi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cvrf-whitepaper.pdf http://www.icasi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cvrf-whitepaper.pdf http://www.icasi.org/current-activities/  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  65  6.4 Introduction of a neutral third party or enhancement of existing coordination  centres  The project team’s analysis sees merit in having a neutral third party to whom vulnerabilities can be  reported, especially since certain entities may hold vested interests which can potentially conflict with the  overarching interest of a secure ecosystem. Some interviewees voiced suspicions of reporting vulnerabilities  to certain National CSIRTs, since such CSIRTs are governmental entities which, due to the interest of national  intelligence in vulnerabilities, may be influenced by other government departments. Yet, ‘given the fact that  there is usually a very big power discrepancy between the vendor and the security researcher, I actually  think it makes sense to bring in another party with experience that can help with those discussions.’ This can  be CSIRTs or another party, although certain existing CSIRTs maintain significant experience as coordinators  of vulnerability disclosures.  There is a consensus among interviewees that there are three CSIRTs which have extensive experience with  coordinating vulnerability disclosure. These are CERT-CC in the United States, JP-CERT in Japan and CERT-FI  in Finland. The work carried out by these coordination centers is widely recognized and it is recommended  that since they already have the ‘know-how’, they should continue to lead these activities. Simultaneously,  the involvement of other national-level CSIRTs or third-party vulnerability coordinators would benefit the  ecosystem, since they are able to reach a wider audience. Other benefits include limiting the legal exposure  of the discoverer, allowing the discoverer to (potentially) remain anonymous, and the increased likelihood  of vendors to respond in a timely manner when coordination centers are involved.  The dilemma therefore is whether the introduction of a neutral third party is more desirable than enhancing  existing efforts. As another interviewee commented, ‘Introducing a new institution that would do global co- ordination might be an option but the composition, placement and the process would have to be very  carefully considered.’  6.5 European policy makers and Member States should improve the legal landscape  The legal framework presents many challenges. The overall impression is that existing law, especially the  way legal representatives of vendors interpret and subsequently use such law, adversely affects security.  One of the concerns refers to the legal liability of the vulnerability discoverer. As previously described, the  potential legal threat in the area of criminal law can have a chilling effect. In the Dutch example, the public  prosecutor’s office has tried to illuminate its decision-making process in this area through the publication of  a letter which indicates what questions public prosecutors ask before deciding whether charges will be filed  against a discoverer. Other governments can follow a similar example since it helps the research community  better understand the decision-making process and allows them to critically evaluate their own actions. Even  though the ethical hacker acts on behalf of the system owner he/she cannot escape the legal grey area  altogether, especially since there are no legal provisions – as far as is known – which specifically identify  exceptions for such hacking. As a result, clarity can only be achieved on a case-by-case basis. The Dutch  public prosecutor’s office used case law to arrive at its explanation of how it approaches this type of legal  dilemmas. Case law has set the framework on how to consider potential challenges in the area of  vulnerability disclosure. By using case law, vulnerability disclosure cases can become more predictable for  findings during the FIRST conference in 2016 in Seoul. The form of the final ‘product’ depends on the  process.  ENISA could provide recommendations on how to communicate vulnerability disclosures, particularly in terms  of which companies and vendors must be informed.  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  66  discoverers and other stakeholders involved. This will hopefully lead to less uncertainty about potential legal  consequences.  In the United States, the main challenge in the area of criminal law comes through the Computer Fraud and  Abuse Act (CFAA), which disincentives the reporting of security vulnerabilities.227 . There is criticism about  the vague wording of the CFAA which allows for considerable prosecutorial discretion, leaving researchers  in uncertainty when they discover a vulnerability.228 There is currently discussion about introducing  exemptions to the CFAA for security researchers.229 A similar solution is being discussed for the DMCA.230  Within the EU, member states have different interpretations of how to approach reported vulnerabilities  from a criminal law perspective. As indicated in Chapter 6, the public prosecutor’s office in the Netherlands  has indicated how the office approaches the issue of vulnerability reporting from a criminal law perspective.  Such an approach provides an example that could be used by other EU member states to establish a level of  clarity and transparency, and thus develop a degree of confidence among researchers in determining how  their actions fit within the existing legal framework. Evidence for other Member States being as explicit on  this topic, at least from a public prosecutorial perspective was not identified by the study team during its  research. The overview provided by Biancuzzi does however confirm that many Member States do not have  specific legislation on vulnerability disclosures which means case law and interpretation of the current legal  framework are likely to guide any future steps.231 This can lead to uncertainty unless – as in the Netherlands  – public prosecutors provide insight into how they approach cases of vulnerability disclosure reporting. The  common risks that a vulnerability researcher is facing while seeking for vulnerabilities without prior  authorization could be associated with the abuse of intellectual property rights, breach of licensing as well  as other types of legal liabilities. A similar recommendation was set forth by ENISA in 2013 with respect to  the Directive on attacks against information systems, where the authors write with respect to illegal access:  ‘To reduce legal uncertainty, it could be advisable for countries to publish guidance on the interpretation  and application of the unlawful access provisions, and particularly on the element of intent (i.e. the  unlawfulness – without right) in cases where no security measures were breached, if this is permitted under  national law. This can be done in the form of prosecution guidelines in countries that permit this, and/or in  the form of jurisprudence overviews to show how courts apply the law in reality.

A critical evaluation of  copyright law must be carried out at the EU level to determine whether amendments have to be made to  ensure the legal climate does not unnecessarily obstruct security research. Alternatively to amendments, if  deemed unnecessary, the current legal framework must be made more accessible and understandable for a  non-legal audience, such as discoverers, to be able to appropriately defend themselves as well as their  interests when receiving legal threats. The EFF, for example, provides an overview of all the applicable areas  of law in the United States with respect to reverse engineering.233 In May 2012, the European Court of Justice  (ECJ) ruled how ‘there is no copyright infringement’ when a software company without access to a program’s  source code ‘studied, observed and tested that program in order to reproduce its functionality in a second  program.’234 Even though in the aforementioned example there was no breach of the copyright legislation,  there could be potential breaches of other legal requirements imposed by means for e.g. contract terms,  confidentiality, privacy, property etc. The ECJ furthermore states, ‘this means that the acts of loading and  running necessary for the use of a copy of a program which has been lawfully acquired, and the act of  correction of its errors, may not be prohibited by contract.’235 Correction of its errors may mean that  vulnerability-related research is exempt from copyright provisions, or rather does not infringe on copyright.  Yet, more clarity is needed to definitely ascertain this and provide legal certainty to discoverers. The decision  was upheld in the United Kingdom by the Court of Appeal in 2014.236 Law is inherently about the appropriate  distribution of rights and responsibilities; as such while vendors have rights, they also have responsibilities,  just as researchers do.  Another challenge refers to the zero-day market, especially in connection to law enforcement and  intelligence. Vulnerabilities are in some cases exploited for security purposes, which leads to an inherent  conflict of interest since their prolonged existence also results in a state of insecurity. A public discussion on  the issue on how society believes vulnerability disclosure ought to take place could be a way forward in this  hard to resolve issue (see 6.6).  6.6 Vendors should facilitate trust building, transparency and openness  There is a general need to engage in trust building, transparency and openness of vulnerability disclosure.  This requires a societal acceptance that vulnerabilities are an inherent aspect of product development. From  a vendor’s perspective, the stigma associated with acknowledging that one of its products contains a  vulnerability could lead to an unwillingness to recognise the existence of vulnerabilities. As one interviewee  described it, ‘A lot of vendors we have talked to are understandably concerned in the beginning about  publishing a problem in their software. They fear that it looks bad, that they made a mistake, and that the  bad guys will find out and hurt their customers with it.’ Therefore, any discussion of vulnerability disclosure  233 Electronic Frontier Foundation. n.d. ‘Coders’ Rights Project Reverse Engineering FAQ.’ As of 8 October 2015:  https://www.eff.org/issues/coders/reverse-engineering-faq#faq4  234 InfoCuria – Case –Law of the Court of Justice. 2012. ‘JUDGMENT OF THE COURT (Grand Chamber).’ As of 8 October 2015:  http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=122362&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=req&dir=&occ=firs t&part=1&cid=564907  235 InfoCuria – Case –Law of the Court of Justice. 2012.  236 Wood, Ian. 2014. ‘UK: Court Of Appeal Upholds High Court Decision In SAS Institute Inc V World Programming Ltd Software  Infringement Case.’ Mondaq, 4 April.

There  should be no need to hide the fact that vulnerabilities exist.  Some interviewees also emphasised the necessity to facilitate openness and transparency about  vulnerability information. Examples may include information sharing platforms such as ISACs, where there  is a particular level of trust among the members to share information about vulnerabilities. To an extent,  therefore, this already occurs across certain platforms. To facilitate such openness, however, there has to  be a sufficient basis for trust as well as a legal commitment from members to respect the non-disclosure  aspect of receiving such information.  There is also the necessity of trust building across different communities. Researchers need to be able to  trust vendors and vice versa, since such trust is the bedrock of being able to cooperate in a manner which  serves the greater good of information security.  237 Simpson, Angela. 2015. ‘Enhancing the digital economy through collaboration on vulnerability research disclosure.’ National  Telecommunications & Information Administration. 9 July.

This vulnerability coordination discussion is one of such attempts. It is hoped  that by opening up the dialogue concerning various aspects of disclosure, participants may come to an agreed  set of principles on which future policies can rely.  To prepare for the multistakeholder processes, the IPTF asked participants to prioritise various identified  cybersecurity issues which appear in need of coordinated action. Among the issues were botnet mitigation,  vulnerability disclosures, consumer security, and distribution of patches. Comments were also requested on  methods and structure of the envisioned processes. Particularly notable were the recommendations by the  Telecommunication Industry Association (TIA), which stated that ‘the most effective solution to ensuring  innovation in cybersecurity solutions is to rely on voluntary use of internationally-accepted standards and  best practices.’238 Further, stakeholders emphasised that IPTF should avoid any redundancy by building on the  existing body of cybersecurity policies and initiatives.  Given the clear suggestions from the participants, it appears unlikely that the IPTF would on the contrary  propose heavier regulations. Besides, the IPTF has previously argued that the traditional regulatory approach  was counterproductive in an ever-evolving digital landscape. While the nature of the solutions that may arise  from the multi-stakeholder meetings remains largely unpredictable, increasing participation and dialogue by  stakeholders is expected to shape an inclusive perspective on cybersecurity.  ENISA could facilitate outreach and collaboration with the security researcher community.  ENISA could advise European governments and enterprises about the need for transparent disclosure of  technical information from all open source vendors.  http://www.ntia.doc.gov/blog/2015/enhancing-digital-economy-through-collaboration-vulnerability-research-disclosure http://www.ntia.doc.gov/blog/2015/enhancing-digital-economy-through-collaboration-vulnerability-research-disclosure http://www.privsecblog.com/2015/07/articles/policy-regulatory-positioning/commerce-dept-reviewing-stakeholders-cybersecurity-comments/ http://www.privsecblog.com/2015/07/articles/policy-regulatory-positioning/commerce-dept-reviewing-stakeholders-cybersecurity-comments/  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  69  To facilitate this, a public debate needs to be had about how society wants to deal with information about  vulnerabilities. This has become a problem which inherently involves a myriad of stakeholders, and an  educated decision about to deal with the challenges is needed.  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  70  7. Conclusions  The discussion and debate on vulnerability disclosure has been around for many years. As one respondent  described, ‘We are approaching the 27th anniversary of the first \"Internet Worm\" (Nov, 1988), and yet the  general form and content of the disclosure debate has changed very little in this time. The fact that as a  community we are still unable to establish a consensus on vulnerability disclosure best practices suggests  that this is an intrinsically difficult problem.’ This difficulty is in large part the result of different interests held  by stakeholders within the vulnerability landscape. The introduction of new players has arguably  complicated the dynamics even further. New players include vendors such as car manufacturers, medical  device manufacturers and others who have only recently entered the information security scene as their  products become increasingly connected to the digital world. So as more mature stakeholders continue to  battle the fundamental differences they have among each other, they are also challenged by newcomers to  share their knowledge in order to develop a more equal level playing field.  Other aspects of an evolving landscape further complicate the vulnerability ecosystem. The media have  begun to play a larger role, which marketing departments of companies have started to cater to in the last  couple of years. Vulnerabilities now have catchy names and logos which may overshadow the severity of the  vulnerability – or lack thereof – and as such exaggerate vulnerabilities leading to confusion among users.  This may create panic among the public and require vendors to devote more resources than necessary. Yet  the media also play an essential role in agenda setting when it comes to information security in general and  vulnerability disclosure in particular. Without their reporting, certain vendors may never devote the  attention to the topic that is required, or users may never find out about the existence of a vulnerability as  well as the way to resolve it. The key, however, is to come to a more nuanced reporting of developments  where information dissemination plays a more important role than drawing readers’ attention with snappy  headlines.  Various initiatives, including this project initiated by ENISA, demonstrate the need to bring different  stakeholders together to discuss the challenges associated with vulnerability disclosure and the ways such  challenges can be addressed. The development of a core set of principles upon which different stakeholders  can agree, and to which they can adhere, can go a long way towards reconciling the existence of distinct and  at times conflicting interests. To facilitate these discussions and build trust, third parties can play an integral  role. In this sense, ENISA can potentially use its standing in the community as well as its expertise in the area  of information security to foster connections and facilitate trust building by reaching out not only to vendors  and to CSIRTs but also to the researcher community.  Even though vulnerability reward programmes are generally perceived as a positive development that has  brought discoverers and vendors closer together, the market must be approached with caution as it can  over-incentivise the search and lead to a flood of vulnerabilities, potentially diverting attention and  resources away from the most critical challenges.  To conclude, one of the primary challenges to focus upon, and the primary recommendation to put forward  with respect to policy development, is the need for an advanced legal landscape to ensure that vulnerability  reporting is not endangered by the unintended consequences of criminal and civil legislation. A critical  evaluation of the legal landscape, both in terms of criminal law as well as copyright legislation, is needed to  ensure security research is appropriately facilitated rather than inappropriately obstructed.

Oracle’s  disclosure policy for instance is just three sentences long,239 while Microsoft provides an eight page  document.240  There are however numerous elements that the majority of vulnerability disclosure policies have in  common.  E.1.1 Security and disclosure philosophy  The first line of a vulnerability disclosure policy usually highlights a company’s security philosophy.  Google for instance starts with: ‘As a provider of software and services for many users, advertisers, and  publishers on the internet, we recognize how important it is to help protect your privacy and security.’241  Other examples include, ‘Lenovo is committed to delivering safe and secure products and services’242, and  Cloudfare states that, ‘we take security, trust and transparency seriously.’243  Template:  When it comes to security, our users come first.  The second phrase reiterates a broad statement regarding the company’s disclosure philosophy.  Facebook notes that, ‘we will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.’244  Symantec highlights that it is ‘committed to resolving security vulnerabilities quickly and carefully.’245 And  Yahoo clarifies that, ‘when we discover previously unknown security vulnerabilities, we immediately address  the risks on our own systems to protect our users.’246  Template:  [xxx] is committed to fix all reported security vulnerabilities quickly and carefully to protect the  security and privacy of our users.  239 Oracle. n.d. ‘Oracle Security Vulnerability Disclosure Policies.’ As of 14 September 2015:  http://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/vulnerability-remediation/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/index.html  240 Microsoft. 2011. ‘Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure at Microsoft.’ As of 14 September 2015:  http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9770197  241 Google. n.d. ‘Google Application Security.’ As of 14 September 2015: https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/  242 Lenovo. 2015. ‘Lenovo Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.’ As of 14 September 2015:  https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/ht103338  243 Cloudfare. n.d. ‘CloudFlare vulnerability disclosure policy.’ As of 14 September 2015: https://www.cloudflare.com/disclosure  244 Facebook. 2015. ‘Whitehat.’ As of 14 September 2015: https://www.facebook.com/whitehat  245 Symantec. n.d. ‘Vulnerability Management Commitment and Disclosure Policy.’ As of 14 September 2015:  https://www.symantec.com/security/  246 Yahoo. 2014. ‘Users First: Our Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.’ As of 14 September 2015:  http://yahoopolicy.tumblr.com/post/104777538533/users-first-our-vulnerability-disclosure-policy  http://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/vulnerability-remediation/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/index.html http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9770197 https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/ https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/ht103338 https://www.cloudflare.com/disclosure https://www.facebook.com/whitehat https://www.symantec.com/security/ http://yahoopolicy.tumblr.com/post/104777538533/users-first-our-vulnerability-disclosure-policy  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  88  E.1.2 Reporting the vulnerability  This paragraph ought to provide security researchers with the necessary contact information and any  additional details they might need to complete a vulnerability report.  Most of the companies surveyed converge on a single uniform format by putting the important contact  information within a bulk of text.  Apple for example writes: ‘to report security or privacy issues that affect Apple products or web servers,  please contact: product-security@apple.com. You can use Apple’s Product Security PGP key to encrypt  sensitive information sent via e-mail.’247 And Google states that ‘if you believe you have discovered a  vulnerability in a Google product, or have a security incident to report go to goo.gl/vulnz to include it in our  Vulnerability Rewards Program. For Chrome vulnerabilities […].’248 Cisco approached the issue very  differently by putting the necessary contact information into a simple table while also mentioning the hours  in operation.249 Additional information such as day’s off, holidays, and a telephone number for emergency  support can further contribute to enhance communication transparency.  Template:  Report a vulnerability  E-mail xxx@xxx.xxx  (e-mails are acknowledged within xx hours)  OpenPGP Key XXXXXXXXX  Hours xx hours a day, x days a week, holidays  Phone Number  (emergency contact)  +x xxxxxxxxxx  Note: Sending a confirmation of receipt email is essential to ensure that the security researcher knowns that  his/her report has been received by your company. You can choose to either do this automatically or add a  disclaimer clarifying your response time (see template).  E.1.3 Attributes of a good report  To receive the necessary information that will help verify and reproduce a security vulnerability in one of  your products, it is critical to clearly state what kind of information you require from the security researcher.  While there are various ways of receiving an incident report, whether it is through a simple email, an online  form, or a word template, it is important not to restrain security researchers in their input methods. Online  forms for example usually do not allow images or video files to be attached, and Word templates might  complicate user input due to possible formatting difficulties. Some companies employ very restrictive  guidelines, such as Symantec which does not accept email attachments.250 Other companies, such as  Facebook, even encourage users to attach their own video files.251 In the end a simple e-mail seems to be  the best solution to maximise user flexibility while avoiding any loss of critical information.  247 Apple. n.d. ‘Apple Product Security.’ As of 15 September 2015: https://www.apple.com/support/security/  248 Google. n.d. ‘Google Application Security.’ As of 14 September 2015: https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/  249 Cisco. n.d. ‘Security Vulnerability Policy.’ As of 14 September 2015:  http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/psirt/security_vulnerability_policy.html  250 Symantec. n.d. ‘Vulnerability Management Commitment and Disclosure Policy.’ As of 14 September 2015:  https://www.symantec.com/security  251 Facebook. 2015. ‘Whitehat.’ As of 14 September 2015: https://www.facebook.com/whitehat  mailto:xxx@xxx.xxx https://www.apple.com/support/security/ https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/ http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/psirt/security_vulnerability_policy.html https://www.symantec.com/security https://www.facebook.com/whitehat  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  89  Template:  Attributes of a good report  Quality before Quantity  Please provide us with a detailed description and a clear and concise step-by-step guide in  English to allow for the reproduction of the security vulnerability.  (include screenshots where necessary)  The step-by-step guide should include:  - xxxxx  - yyyyy  - zzzzzz  E.1.4 Ineligible reports  Please make clear which reports and research methods your company will not accept or permit. For  example, reports on login issues, password problems, spam, and suspected fraud activities ought to be  handled by your support help desk.  Acceptable research methods should also explicitly differentiate between vulnerability scans and ethical  hacks. While the difference is in some cases a grey area, a vulnerability disclosure policy should generally  not enable researchers to hack into your company’s systems. As such, DDoS attacks, brute-force attacks,  malware installation, or making any kind of changes to your system (i.e. copying, deleting, and altering files)  ought to be explicitly forbidden.  Bugcrowd and Facebook provide an exhaustive list of items they are not willing to accept as a security  vulnerability,252 while Lenovo states that ‘all content other than specific security vulnerabilities in our  products or services will be dropped.’253  The Dutch National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) specifically lists  malicious acts that reporters must avoid to be free from any legal prosecution.254  Template:  Ineligible reports  - Login issues and password problems  - Spelling mistakes  - HTTP 404 pages  - Spam or suspected fraud activities  - …  Not permitted acts:  - DDoS attacks  - Brute-Force attacks  252 Bugcrowd. 2015. ‘Standard Disclosure Terms.’ As of 15 September 2015: https://bugcrowd.com/resources/standard-disclosure- terms ; Facebook. 2015. ‘Whitehat.’ As of 14 September 2015: https://www.facebook.com/whitehat  253 Lenovo. 2015. ‘Lenovo Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.’ As of 14 September 2015:  https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/ht103338  254 NCSC. n.d. ‘Responsible Disclosure.’ As of 14 September 2015: https://www.ncsc.nl/english/securityt  https://bugcrowd.com/resources/standard-disclosure-terms https://bugcrowd.com/resources/standard-disclosure-terms https://www.facebook.com/whitehat https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/ht103338 https://www.ncsc.nl/english/securityt  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  90  - Social engineering  - Malware installation  - Making any changes to our system (incl. copying, changing, and deleting data)  - Sharing access with others  …  The xxx@xxx.xxx email is intended for the sole purpose of reporting a security vulnerability.  If you are in need of technical assistance please contact our support help desk:  yyy@yyy.yyy.  E.1.5 Procedural steps and timeline  Depending on a company’s resources and expertise devoted to fixing security vulnerabilities, the layout of  procedural steps and the self-imposition of a timeline widely differs.  Mature companies such as Google and Yahoo are committing themselves to publicly disclose vulnerabilities  within 90 days,255 while CERT/CC adheres to a 45-day deadline ‘regardless of the existence or availability of  patches or workarounds from affected vendors.’256  Companies that are new to the practice of security vulnerability disclosure are advised to NOT impose a 45-  or 90-day timeline upon themselves. Instead the communication ought to focus on ensuring mutual respect  (between your company and the security researcher), transparency, and greater flexibility.  Rapid7, for example, provides a series of steps they are committed to take to address the security  vulnerability while also noting that they ‘will endeavour to keep the reporter apprised of every step in the  process as each step occurs.’257 Symantec on the other hand clearly states that they ‘cannot provide software  security patches according to a set timeline. Each issue requires investigation, resolution, localization, and  testing appropriate to its complexity.’258  Template:  Procedural steps and timeline  - Once we receive your vulnerability report, we will take every necessary step to investigate  and resolve the security issue at hand in a swift and transparent manner.  - While we cannot provide patches according to a fixed timeline, we are committed to keep  you informed at every step of the process.  - We request that you keep all communications regarding the vulnerability confidential, to  ensure mutual trust and the flexibility to work with us towards the release of a patch, while  guaranteeing an adequate timeframe for our customers to deploy said patch.  - We will publicly announce the vulnerability in our release note of the update and will  mention the person/people who reported the vulnerability unless the researcher(s) wishes  to remain anonymous.  255 Yahoo. 2014. ‘Users First: Our Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.’ As of 14 September 2015:  http://yahoopolicy.tumblr.com/post/104777538533/users-first-our-vulnerability-disclosure-policy; Google. n.d. ‘Google  Application Security.’ As of 14 September 2015: https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/  256 CERT/CC. n.d. ‘Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.’ As of 15 September 2015: http://www.cert.org/vulnerability-analysis/vul- disclosure.cfm?  257 Rapid7. n.d. ‘Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.’ As of 15 September 2015: https://www.rapid7.com/disclosure.jsp  258 Symantec. n.d. ‘Vulnerability Management Commitment and Disclosure Policy.’ As of 14 September 2015:  https://www.symantec.com/security  mailto:xxx@xxx.xxx mailto:yyy@yyy.yyy http://yahoopolicy.tumblr.com/post/104777538533/users-first-our-vulnerability-disclosure-policy https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/ http://www.cert.org/vulnerability-analysis/vul-disclosure.cfm http://www.cert.org/vulnerability-analysis/vul-disclosure.cfm https://www.rapid7.com/disclosure.jsp https://www.symantec.com/security  Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure  Creation date: November 15  91  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vass.

They provide a point-of-entry or gateway to exploit a system and as such pose potentially severe security risks. Fixing vulnerabilities is therefore crucial and the process of disclosing vulnerabilities is a vital component that cannot be underestimated."

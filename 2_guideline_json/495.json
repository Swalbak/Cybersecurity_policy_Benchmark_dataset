The use of new technologies brings new opportunities for  enhanced business performance and operations, but also introduces several information security and privacy  risks. Addressing these risks plays a significant role in business success and development nowadays, as  growing security threats1 may potentially disrupt business continuity and cause monetary, reputational, as  well as other types of losses to SMEs.  In parallel, new information security and privacy standards are being drafted and proposed to support  organizations to integrate best practices into their procedures and mitigate risks. To this end, a wide and  effective adoption of information security and privacy related standards by SMEs across Europe can be a  beneficial factor for fostering their growth, competitiveness and innovation.  In this context, ENISA has carried out this project under its Work Program 20152, with the objective of  providing a set of relevant recommendations regarding how to increase the adoption of information security  and privacy standards in SMEs. These recommendations are targeted to EU and MS policy makers; standards  developing organizations; and professional, industry and small businesses associations.  To reach relevant conclusions, an extensive analysis was conducted in order to investigate the status of  security and privacy standard adoption in European SMEs, the main drivers that can motivate SMEs towards  the adoption of these standards and, especially, the perceived existing barriers for SMEs in this area. The  methodology of the study consisted in interviews with subject matter experts and analysis of available studies  in the area. The report identifies as well existing information security and privacy standards that can be used  by European SMEs, presenting a list of standards that could be considered for adoption by SMEs, along with  descriptions of these standards.  Key findings  The analysis conducted for this study, based on the interviews with subject matter experts and review of  available studies, shows that, despite rising concerns on information security risks, the level of SMEs  information security and privacy standard adoption is relatively low. The main existing drivers and barriers  that contribute to the limited uptake of information security and privacy standards in European SMEs have  been identified to be the following:  I. Drivers  Mitigating information security risks   Threats to information security and privacy, varying from inadvertent events to deliberate attacks,  pose significant risks to any organization nowadays.   Adoption of information security and privacy standards is an effective means to mitigate these risks.  Increasing consumer trust  1 ENISA Threat Landscape 2014: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-  environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014  2 ENISA Work Programme 2015: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-  programme-2015  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programme-2015 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programme-2015  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  07   Users are becoming more concerned when handling their data to businesses and trust is becoming a  relevant decision factor.   Adoption of standards indicates to customers that the organisation is committed to enforce security  mechanisms for protecting their data.  Proactively demonstrating commitment towards regulatory compliance   In many cases SMEs need to demonstrate compliance with information security and privacy  requirements derived by national or EU legislation.   Implementing, maintaining and enforcing internal policies through the use of standards as a  supporting tool is an effective mean to proactively show a commitment with regulations.  Achieving competitive advantage   Proof of compliance to an acknowledged standard provides reassurance both to providers and  business customers.   This constitutes a possible competitive advantage when dealing with corporate clients both from the  private and public spheres.  II. Barriers  Barriers related to knowledge and engagement   SMEs are in general not aware of the available standards that may assist them mitigate technology  risks and there are limited single points of reference that SMEs can use.   Standards implementation requires commitment of resources that otherwise an SME would allocate  into more transparent business activities.   Management does not yet perceive clearly how implementing these standards adds business value  to their organisation and there is a prevailing perception that cyber-attacks are mainly threatening  large enterprises.   The design of standards is mainly driven from larger size organisations and thus many standards are  not easily scalable for use by SMEs.  Barriers related to available capabilities and resources   In SMEs that assume the ICT function internally, an employee is responsible for security along with  his/her other ICT operational responsibilities, which leads to limited dedication for ICT security.   Meanwhile, in SMEs where it is outsourced, the lack of internal knowledge hardens the negotiation  with providers on security features or contracts.   Implementation of information security and privacy standards can be demanding in terms of financial  resources and getting the necessary budget can be a challenging task.   Many SMEs do not have still a solid foundation of effective information security risk management.  Barriers related to shortage of standards in specific areas   There are limited European or international standards designed to assist small organizations towards  ensuring appropriate protection of personal data.  Barriers related to implementation aspects   Many statements of the standards are challenging for SMEs in order to clearly identify the tasks and  activities that must be conducted.   There is a lack of adequate implementation guidelines with specific detailed steps on how to apply  each information security and privacy requirement.   Standards rely on processes that might not yet be implemented in a small organization and standard  adoption will require the design or reengineering of internal core processes.  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  08  Recommendations  Based on the analysis from the findings on enabling factors and barriers to pursuing standard adoption, the  study proposes the following key recommendations to improve the information security and privacy  standardisation level in the European SME community:  Increasing knowledge and engagement   EU public administrations should develop centralized catalogues with extended information of  existing information security and privacy standards that are scalable for, and applicable by, SMEs.   Public and private information security awareness organizations at all EU levels should create specific  campaigns targeting SMEs on how information security and privacy standards can help them protect  their core business assets and processes.   Organizations developing information security standards should promote the participation in the  development process of SMEs coming from a variety of sectors.  Driving adoption and compliance   EU public administrations and/or industrial organizations should promote the development of  certification schemes targeted at SMEs to boost information security and privacy standard adoption.   EU public administrations should promote the establishment of voluntary reference standards that  presume conformity with regulations in the area of information security and privacy.   EU public administrations should assess enforcing standard compliance for contracts related to their  information supply chain or to personal data handling.  Facilitating implementation   Standard developing organizations should consider creating security and privacy standards targeting  specifically SMEs which take into account their specific features and processes.   Public and private information security organizations could support SMEs by developing easy to  follow implementation guidelines focusing on the scoping and initial stages of implementation.   Standards applicable by SMEs could incorporate maturity levels with different sets of requirements  to facilitate a phased implementation.   SMEs should be incited to deploy security by default configurations to facilitate later standard  adoption, and software vendors can support SME by ensuring secure default configurations in  products targeting small organizations.  Increasing capabilities   SMEs should be encouraged to designate an Information Security Officer to ensure ownership of the  information security and data protection functions.   Member States should create professional training programs to provide foundation training for  Information Security Officers.   Public administrations at all EU levels should provide incentives to SMEs to adopt security and privacy  standards.  Fostering cooperation   International, European and national SDOs, as well as industry associations, should work together  towards developing a harmonized plan to create information security and privacy standards  specifically designed for SMEs.  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  09  1 Introduction  The European Commission defines micro, small and medium-sized enterprises as enterprises which employ  fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding 50 million euro, and/or an annual  balance sheet total not exceeding 43 million euro3. SMEs comprise more than 99% of all European businesses.  In the past five years, they have created around 85% of new jobs and provided two-thirds of the total private  sector employment in the EU4.  Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have paramount importance for the innovation, growth and  development of the economy, both at the European and national level and they are a priority focus sector  for governments’ economic policy. The prominence of their role and growth has been recognised by the  European Institutions and the Member States through multiple policy actions aiming to promote SMEs'  development, by helping them to tackle the obstacles and problems that obstruct their business  development.  Nowadays, SMEs are increasingly dependent on their information systems and networks to provide services  to customers and meet their business objectives. If micro enterprises are excluded, the vast majority of SMEs  relies on some form of information system and many of them already have an online presence. Electronic  communication networks, interconnected information systems and digital services are an essential part of  an increasing number of SMEs5.  In parallel with the growing ICT adoption by SMEs, emerging information security and privacy threats are  becoming an increasing concern. Due to the constant and evolving threat landscape and the progressively  developing corporate risk exposure, SMEs nowadays face significant information security risks that threaten  their business6. SMEs need to implement formal information security processes, technical mechanisms and  organisational measures. Without such safeguards, SMEs may be severely impacted by inadvertent threats  or deliberate attacks on their information systems and networks, which could ultimately lead to negative  business effects.  To support organizations in adopting best security practices, a significant number of information security and  privacy standards have been developed and published during the last decade by international or European  standard developing organisations, professional or expert associations (See Annex A for a comprehensive list  of information security and privacy standards). These standards aim to assist organisations to effectively  manage and strengthen their information security safeguards, and reduce risks in acceptable levels, all the  while maintaining a competitive advantage in today’s online world and ensuring protection of business  assets.  There are many drivers for SMEs to pursue the adoption of an information security or privacy standard. Yet  their level of standard adoption in this area is still low and their uptake is not largely perceived as a priority.  The analysis conducted for this study, through interviews with subject matter experts and research on  available studies, shows that there are several perceived barriers for SMEs to embrace standards in the  security and privacy field, and that the low standard adoption rate can be improved by undertaking specific  actions to overcome these barriers. One of the primary barriers is that there is a limited awareness in the  3 EC. 2015. The new SME definition - User guide and model declaration.

Implementing information security and privacy standards is perceived as being challenging by SMEs. This  might be partially caused by SMEs’ specific needs and characteristics not having been largely taken into  consideration during the standards development process, making many standards complex for SMEs with  simple internal procedures. SMEs primarily use standards as guidance and the maturity and rigour levels are  very likely to vary considerably from one organization to another.  Although SMEs have already taken some steps, there is still a long way towards a wide adoption of  information security and privacy standards as a means to mitigate the risks introduced by the velocity and  complexity of business and technology changes, and of cyber threats. SMEs should be encouraged to take  bolder proactive steps in order to deal with and prevent information security and privacy threats and attacks.  Prioritising their efforts towards adopting information security and privacy standards can enhance their  visibility, add value and provide a competitive advantage to their organisation, which will enable them to  achieve and maintain a robust security posture.  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  11  2 Drivers for pursuing information security and privacy standards  Mitigating information security risks   Threats to information security and privacy, varying from inadvertent events to  deliberate attacks, pose significant risks to any organization nowadays.   Adoption of information security and privacy standards is an effective means to  mitigate these risks.  The fast-growing and increasingly more complex cyber threat landscape poses a greater risk than ever to  organisations, including small and medium organizations. Use of new technologies provides opportunities  for enhanced business performance but also introduces potential security risks that must be mitigated.  Threats to information security and privacy, varying from inadvertent events to deliberate attacks, pose  significant risks to any organization nowadays. Without safeguards, SMEs may suffer severe impact on their  information systems and networks, which can ultimately lead to negative business effects. Adoption of  information security and privacy standards is an effective means to mitigate these risks.  Increasing consumer trust   Users are becoming more concerned when handling their data to businesses and  trust is becoming a relevant decision factor.   Adoption of standards indicates to customers that the organisation is committed  to enforce security mechanisms for protecting their data.  According to the Eurostat 2014 information security barometer7, concerns among internet users on risks  associated with online transactions are raising; especially mistrust on how their personal data are used and  the security of online payments. Users are becoming more concerned when handing their data to businesses  and trust is becoming a relevant decision factor that can give an advantage to well-prepared organizations.  Increasing customers’ confidence is emerging as a significant driver for adopting information security and  privacy standards in enterprises. Adoption of standards indicates to customers that the organisation is  committed to enforce security mechanisms for protecting their data and in this way it might create added  value for an SME. Moreover, whenever personal data are involved, customer expectations are met, since  they feel that their personal information is well protected, and as a result trust is generated.  Proactively demonstrating commitment towards regulatory compliance   In many cases SMEs need to demonstrate compliance with information security  and privacy requirements derived by national or EU legislation.   Implementing, maintaining and enforcing internal policies through the use of  standards as a supporting tool is an effective means to proactively show a  commitment with regulations.  In many cases SMEs need to demonstrate compliance with information security and privacy requirements  derived by national or European legislation, industry specific regulations and contractual obligations. Failure  7 Special Eurobarometer 423 Cybersecurity Report (2015):  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_423_en.pdf  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_423_en.pdf  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  12  to comply with these requirements may have negative impact and long-term consequences to the business  of the SMEs. These consequences are very transparent to management and as a result they are committed  and support efforts towards compliance. The specific compliance requirements are in many cases aligned  with information security and privacy standards controls. Implementing, maintaining and enforcing internal  policies through the use of standards as a supporting tool is an effective means to proactively show a  commitment with regulations in the area of information security and privacy.  Achieving competitive advantage   Proof of compliance to an acknowledged standard provides reassurance both to  providers and business customers.   This constitutes a possible competitive advantage when dealing with corporate  clients both from the private and public spheres.  Finally, standards can offer a significant competitive edge to SMEs by facilitating the improvement of the  products and services they offer. Proof of compliance to an acknowledged standard provides reassurance  both to providers and business customers, adds credibility to the organization and increases confidence by  demonstrating commitment to protecting the information assets handed to the SME by customers. When an  SME adopts an information security standard, customers will likely have more assurance in establishing and  maintaining business relationships with the organisation, and this can constitute a possible competitive  advantage when dealing with corporate clients both from the private and public spheres.  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  13  3 Barriers to SME adoption of information security and privacy  standards  Barriers related to knowledge and engagement  Knowledge of applicable standards   SMEs are not in general aware of the available standards that may assist them  mitigate technology risks   There are limited single points of reference that SMEs can use.   SMEs face difficulties with the identification of the standards that will meet their  specific business objectives or those they should comply with due to sectorial  requirements.  Several information security and privacy standards have been developed and published by international or  European standards development organizations and by industry associations during the last years. There are  limited single points of reference, at an EU or MS level, that SMEs can use in order to identify which standard  is the most suitable for them and better covers their business needs and requirements. SMEs are not largely  aware of the available standards that may assist them mitigate technology risks; the majority of SMEs are  only familiar with a limited number of standards (e.g. the ISO/IEC 27000 series).  Moreover, security requirements are spread in numerous different standards and documents. SMEs face  difficulties with the identification of the standards that will meet their specific business objectives and needs,  or even those they should comply with due to sectorial requirements. Thus, SMEs must identify relevant  standards, aggregate and correlate requirements in order to identify overlaps and inter-dependencies. This  makes it complex for SMEs to determine which standards are suitable for them, taking into consideration all  business, legal, regulatory and contractual requirements and obligations.  For example, SMEs that store, process or transmit cardholder and customer/personal data may not be aware  of specific obligations, as defined by relevant standards (e.g. PCI Data Security Standard8). Although PCI DSS  must be implemented by all entities that store, process or transmit cardholder data from major credit card  companies, small merchants and service providers are not required to explicitly validate compliance.  However in the event of a security breach, they may be subject to penalties if it is proved they were not  compliant.  Management commitment   Standards implementation requires commitment of resources that otherwise an  SME would allocate into business activities with a more transparent return of  investment.   Management does not yet perceive clearly how implementing these standards  adds business value to their organisation.  8 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS):  https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/  https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  14  In today’s economic environment, SMEs need to focus their efforts on staying competitive within their core  operations, further expanding into other territories and markets, and surviving in the current dynamic  business atmosphere. Achievement of growth (e.g. new markets, customers, products, higher revenue),  innovation (e.g. use of new technologies to interact with customers in more efficient and effective ways) and  corporate governance, in order to provide stakeholders with confidence, are usually the top priorities for  European SMEs. Moreover, SMEs need to achieve growth with limited resources, which they need to allocate  carefully by taking into account strict time and budget considerations.  Meanwhile, information security and privacy risks are transforming into a relevant issue in all organizations  which require management’s attention and commitment. Indeed, adoption of new technologies impacts  every aspect of business function; it is therefore becoming increasingly visible that technology risks are  threatening the core business processes and they must be effectively managed and mitigated.  Information security risks had historically been assigned as the sole responsibility of the IT department and  were not considered a strategic business risk requiring an organisation-wide attention. But information  security has in the last years been recognized to add a strategic value to the strategy pyramid of  organizations, rather than as a necessary evil to protect the information assets from potential attackers and  exposure risks.  However, many SMEs still choose to take a reactive approach, as opposed to a proactive approach (i.e.  respond to a security incident after it has happened and not act in order to prevent it). Furthermore, adoption  of information security and privacy standards requires commitment in terms of time and resources that  otherwise an SME would allocate into business activities with more transparent return of investment. It is  difficult for management to perceive clearly how implementing these standards adds business value and  provides competitive advantage to their organisation.  By contrast, for SMEs operating in regulated environments it is easier to engage management, gain their  attention and commitment, and acquire the necessary budget. Without this compliance driving force, experts  perceive that there is not enough motivation for adopting information security and privacy standards; making  it difficult for IT and/or security professionals to convince management in that particular direction.  Perceptions on cyber threats targeting SMEs   There is a prevailing, but wrongful, perception that cyber-attacks are mainly  threatening large enterprises.   Recent reports indicate that every type of business, regardless of its size, is a  potential target of a cyber-attack.  There is a concern among experts participating in the study about the prevailing perception that cyber- attacks are mainly threatening large enterprises and SMEs remain largely unaffected from these threats since  they do not store, process or transfer information as critical as larger organizations. Indeed, according to a  2013 survey conducted among small business by the US National Small Bussiness Associaton9, only 30% of  small business were very concerned about being vulnerable to a cyber attack, while 60% were only somewhat  concerned. Because of this misconception, many SMEs consider that information security standards are  designed mainly for the large enterprises and they don’t grasp the added value of adopting them.  However this is not the case; recent reports indicate that every type of business, regardless of its size, is a  potential target of a cyber-attack.  The UK Government Information Security Breaches Survey10 indicates that,  9 2013 Small business technology survey, US National Small Bussiness Associaton, http://www.nsba.biz/wp- content/uploads/2013/09/Technology-Survey-2013.pdf  10 HM Government (2015) 2015 Information Security Breaches Surveyhttp://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs- technical-report-blue-digital.pdf  http://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs-technical-report-blue-digital.pdf http://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs-technical-report-blue-digital.pdf  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  15  among the survey participants, 90% of large organizations suffered a security breach in 2015, with this figure  standing at 74% for small organizations. Since large enterprises usually have a stronger security culture with  robust security controls, less determined malicious attackers may be discouraged by the protection  mechanisms that are in place, targeting instead SMEs, which offer less resistance.  Contribution in the development process   The design of standards is mainly driven from larger size organisations and is  oriented to cover their multiple processes.   Many standards are not easily scalable for use by SMEs.   Non-technological SMEs do not participate extensively in the standards  development and review processes.  Non-technological SMEs do not participate extensively in the standards’ development and review process,  and thus their particular business needs and objectives are not largely taken into account. The design of  standards is mainly driven from larger size organisations and is oriented to cover their multiple processes. As  a direct consequence, standards assume that organisations have a thorough understanding of all technical  and non-technical terms, as well as enough resources (both financial and non-financial), to implement the  requirements. Hence, many standards are not instantiated for use by SMEs with simpler procedures in place.  Although standard developing organizations (SDOs) make an effort to engage SMEs in their activities, it is  difficult for non-technological SMEs to participate, due to a combined lack of available resources and  expertise. For example, although 25% of ETSI members are SMEs11, most of them are related to the  information technology sector, which means they have extensively more information security capabilities  than the average SME. This leads to the average SMEs’ characteristics, nature and capabilities not being  largely taken into consideration during the development phase of standards.  Barriers related to available capabilities and resources  Cybersecurity capabilities  While SMEs rely increasingly on ICT systems to support their business processes, their size only justifies the  employment of a small number of dedicated individuals for ICT functions, if any at all. Some SMEs decide to  internalize the ICT services while others opt to outsource them. Regardless of the ICT management model  selected, the ultimate responsibility over protecting corporate and client information contained in  information systems remains within the SME.  11 European Telecommunications Standards Institute: http://www.etsi.org/index.php/membership   In SMEs that assume the ICT function internally, an employee is responsible for  information security along with his/her other ICT operational and time pressing  responsibilities.   In SMEs that outsource the ICT function, the lack of internal knowledge in  information security complicates the negotiation with providers on custom  security features or contracts.   Various multidisciplinary security roles are usually required to manage these  standards, and this goes beyond the capacity and expertise of SMEs.  http://www.etsi.org/index.php/membership  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  16  If the ICT function is assumed internally, usually an employee is responsible for information security along  with other ICT related responsibilities. These individuals are already in charge of governance, design,  implementation and monitoring the whole ICT infrastructure; thus it comes as an added effort for them to  manage the organisation’s security aspects. It is understandable that the top priority for these employees is  to maintain the availability of information systems and networks that support the business operations, hence  security processes are somehow overlooked.  When SMEs decide to outsource ICT services to specialized companies, they also face difficulties, as the lack  of internal knowledge in information security complicates the negotiation with providers on custom security  features or contracts. SMEs typically acquire standardised, off-the-shelf, services and products under fixed,  boilerplate, contracts and SLAs. Moreover, SMEs in many cases are not largely aware of specific security  products and solutions that could assist them secure their data and business information.  Limited access to information security capabilities can constitute one of the most critical vulnerabilities for  an SME, exposing the organisation to several risks. This absence of capabilities might manifest itself, for  example, in difficulties in the interpretation of the technical focused aspects of standards. Standards in many  cases contain fairly general statements that actually require a degree of specialised knowledge to translate  into a specific context. Even in the case of outsourced services, understanding of information security  requirements is necessary to draft and enforce appropriate contract clauses with suppliers.  Finally, one of the first actions required to adopt information security and privacy standards is to allocate  information security roles and responsibilities to specific employees. Indeed, various multidisciplinary  security roles are usually required to manage these standards, and this usually goes beyond the human  resource capacity of the average SME.  Budget and resources   Implementation of information security and privacy standards can be demanding  in terms of financial resources and getting the necessary budget from  management can be a challenging task.   In many cases SMEs need to seek the assistance of an experienced consultant in  order to support them, which adds financial costs to the process.  The lack of budget for information security seems to be one of the largest impediments for adopting  standards. Implementation of information security and privacy standards can be demanding in terms of  financial resources and getting the necessary budget from management can be a very a challenging task,  especially if compliance with these standards may not be perceived to be on the top priorities for small  businesses managers.  In the last years, the change of the allocated budget for information security has been relatively positive,  with studies such as the EY Global Information Security Survey12 finding that around 50% of organizations  planned to increase their information security budget in 2015. However, the year-on-year increase of  information security budgets is more visible in large organisations, and less pronounced in SMEs. For  example, the UK Government Information Security Breaches Survey13 found that while 42% of UK large  businesses planned to increase their information security budget in 2015, this figure is reduced to 7% in the  case of small businesses.  12 EY Global Information Security Survey 2014: https://webforms.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-global-  information-security-survey-2014/$FILE/EY-global-information-security-survey-2014.pdf  13 HM Government (2015) 2015 Information Security Breaches Surveyhttp://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs-  technical-report-blue-digital.pdf  https://webforms.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-global-information-security-survey-2014/$FILE/EY-global-information-security-survey-2014.pdf https://webforms.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-global-information-security-survey-2014/$FILE/EY-global-information-security-survey-2014.pdf https://webforms.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-global-information-security-survey-2014/$FILE/EY-global-information-security-survey-2014.pdf http://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs-technical-report-blue-digital.pdf http://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs-technical-report-blue-digital.pdf  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  17  In many cases SMEs seek assistance of an experienced consultant in order to support them on the design and  implementation phases of standards. Active guidance from external consultants may also be required during  the first steps of the operation of a new information security model in order to ensure future compliance.  Additionally, organisations usually need to acquire technical and software solutions in order to comply with  the technical requirements of the standards. Finally, there is a shortage of knowledge in SMEs regarding  relevant products, scalable to their size, which can help them meet the security and privacy requirements of  the standards, while meeting their business needs.  There are some additional costs that, albeit small compared to the previously mentioned activities, cannot  be overlooked. First, the existence of fees that some SDOs request to provide access to the standard’s  documentation. In some cases, the small budget required for purchasing a standard is not easily accepted by  management. Moreover, implementation of a standard might be followed by certification from a third-party  assessor (which needs to be renewed periodically); thus introducing additional costs that need to fit in the  overall business strategy of the company.  Finally, implementation of standards is also time-consuming. Limited staff to assist with the deployment, as  well as maintenance of compliance, makes the whole adoption process a lengthy task. Consequently, SMEs  may allocate resources into business activities with a more transparent return of investment.  Risk management   Many SMEs do not have still a solid foundation of effective information security  risk management, and there are limited available risk management frameworks  scalable to small organizations.   The risk environment of the organization must be known in order to determine  the applicable standards.  A primary objective of any SME is to achieve growth, however, this must be performed, as within any  organization, inside appropriate risk and control boundaries. With information security being an emerging  field, small organizations may not apply the same degree of rigorousness to assess the information security  risks as they would for financial, legal, regulatory or operational risks. Furthermore, many SMEs operate in  sectors where there is no strong culture of risk management to build upon. Due to these factors, many small  and medium enterprises do not still have a solid foundation of effective information security risk  management.  SMEs are slowly, but gradually, becoming aware of the potential impact of disrupted business services due  to technology incidents, as well as how risk management can protect them from threats and vulnerabilities  applicable to their information assets. According to the UK Government 2015 Information Security Breaches  Survey15, only 49% of SMEs participating in the survey had conducted a security risk assessment in the  previous year.  Prior to selecting and implementing any specific standard, SMEs, as any organization, must identify the  existing information security and privacy risks they are exposed to. Indeed, standard adoption can be a  helpful tool to develop a structured approach to mitigate risks, however the risk environment of the  organization must be known in order to determine the best applicable standards. There are, however, limited  available risk management frameworks and implementations guidelines scalable to small organizations that  can enable and support them in this area.  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  18  Barriers related to shortage of standards in specific areas  Specific privacy standards   In the last years, there has been a shift in the perception for enterprises on the  importance of protecting personal data.   There are limited European or international standards designed to assist small  organizations towards ensuring appropriate protection of personal data.  In the past, SMEs were not largely aware of the risks posed to their customers’ data, resulting from the lack  of privacy preserving controls. However, in the last years, there has been a shift in the perception of the  importance of protecting personal data. The 2015 UK Government Information Security Breaches Survey14  found that the single, largest driver for information security expenditure in enterprises is protecting customer  information, followed by protecting the organization reputation; with these two factors together accounting  for more than half of the responses.  This would support the notion that SMEs consider privacy protection as a competitive advantage that will  mitigate business risks and enhance customers’ trust. But there is still some work to be done in order to make  SMEs fully conscious on the risks and the value of protecting customers’ data for their business.  Another important aspect to consider when discussing the relevance of privacy protection in SMEs are the  EU and Member States personal data protection legal frameworks. The regulatory requirements have  become more mature over the years, even addressing specific industry sectors, and European SMEs need to  be compliant with their national personal data protection laws. The Proposed General Data Protection  Regulation15, will further develop the privacy protection legal framework in the EU, introducing a harmonised  approach across EU Member States.  Yet, the ongoing issue for organizations is that they do not have enough guidance on which specific controls  they should implement in order to be compliant with personal data protection laws. Even in regulated  industry sectors, enterprises find it sometimes challenging to translate into concrete measures the specific  privacy requirements they must comply with. This problem becomes more pressing for SMEs, as they have  limited ICT governance.  Regulations focus on the objective and standards can support them by providing guidance on the means to  achieve it. However, only a limited number of standards with regards to privacy have been developed and  published, and no specific implementation guidelines have been further analysed and developed in depth,  compared to the situation for information security controls. Aside from the ISO/IEC 29100:2011 [34] and the  CEN CWA 16113:2010 [44], which provide a general privacy framework, there are limited European or  international standards designed to assist organisations all types of organizations, especially small ones,  towards ensuring appropriate protection of personal data.  14 HM Government (2015) 2015 Information Security Breaches Survey.  http://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs-technical-report-blue-digital.pdf  15 Proposal for a Regulation on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on  the free movement of such data. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52012PC0011  http://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs-technical-report-blue-digital.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52012PC0011  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  19  Barriers related to implementation aspects  Standards’ complexity   Many statements of the standards are challenging for SMEs in order to clearly  identify the tasks and activities that must be conducted.   SMEs do not fully realize the rationale behind many security and privacy  requirements.   SMEs are largely unaware of the flexibility that standards provide with regards to  the implementation and monitoring of controls.  One relevant barrier to information security and privacy standards adoption in SMEs is that these standards  have been generally documented in a way that makes it difficult for non-technological SMEs to comprehend.  Standards tend to be framed in terms that are most directly applicable to large scale and enterprise  organisations. There is a concern among experts that the language used contains terms that are too complex  for small organizations and this is hardening the early stages of the adoption process.  There is a perception that, in general, SMEs do not fully realize the rationale behind many security and privacy  requirements, either related or unrelated to technology. Indeed, if technology aspects are excluded, the  information security and privacy organizational processes, as dictated by standards, are considered by  experts quite elaborate and challenging by SMEs, depicting complex business processes that do not map the  SMEs environment.  Furthermore, SMEs are generally unaware of the flexibility that standards provide with regards to the  implementation and monitoring of controls. Current standards do not clearly depict the flexibility offered,  resulting sometimes in misinterpretations. SMEs seem to be failing in appropriately tailoring the standards  based on their business needs and the applicable legal, regulatory and contractual requirements.  Guidance on scope   SMEs generally interpret differently what activities must be performed in order to  achieve compliance.   There is a lack of adequate implementation guidelines with specific detailed steps  on how to apply each information security and privacy requirement.  Another critical factor that hardens the adoption process and is highly associated with the complexity of  standards is that SMEs quite often tend to interpret standards in very different ways based on their own  perspective and understanding. In fact, typically there is more than one interpretation for each information  security and privacy requirement in standards, but not all interpretations are equally suitable for every  organization. It is not uncommon for SMEs to interpret differently what activities must be performed in order  to achieve compliance.  Consequently, a challenge for SMEs is not just to know what they need to do, but also how they must do it,  with regard to their business context. Experts believe SMEs face difficulties to understand how standards  operate in detail and how standards can be further customized and combined in order to meet their specific  business needs.  Besides, there is a lack of adequate implementation guidelines with specific detailed steps on how to apply  each information security and privacy requirement (i.e. translating it to specific technological and  organizational controls). As a result, experts interviewed stated that SMEs many times either do more than  they can afford or of what is needed in order to achieve compliance and may end up either under protecting,  or overprotecting their information assets and allocating more resources than required.  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  20  Organisational and procedural controls   Organizations are still more familiar with technical aspects of information  security, rather than organisational and procedural ones.   Standards rely on processes that might not yet be implemented in a small  organization   Standard adoption will require the design or reengineering of internal core  processes.  Aside from the deployment of technical controls, conformity to information security standards also calls for  organizational and procedural changes that will complement the required controls. In the past, information  security was regarded more as a technical issue and as such many organizations are still more familiar with  technical aspects rather than organisational and procedural ones. Most SMEs have usually implemented, at  least, the basic infrastructure and software components required for protecting their business assets (i.e.  firewalls, anti-virus protection mechanisms etc.).  But nowadays there is a clear consensus that information security transcends technology and also involves  organizational and procedural aspects. Indeed, most security and data breaches are caused by human errors,  misconfiguration and/or failure of information systems and network components (according to IBM's  recent Security Services 2014 Cyber Security Intelligence Index report16, 95% of security incidents involve  human error as a contributing factor).  As such, SMEs do not require only guidelines for deploying security products and technical controls. They  also need support to design, implement and maintain clear, structured, effective and realistic organisational  and procedural mechanisms to ensure adequate levels of conformity with information security standards.  Furthermore, the complete set of processes covered in some standards is not scalable to small organizations,  and these standards rely on processes that might not yet be implemented, or being conducted in an informal  way, in a small organization (e.g. asset management, capacity management, etc.). Thus, standard adoption  will require the design or reengineering of internal core processes. There is an associated effort to all  organizational changes, which may introduce additional management overhead in order to tailor the  implementation. A small organization may need additional guidance on how to make these changes,  communicate them and put them into practice.  There is an associated effort to all organizational changes, and a small organization may need additional  guidance on how to make these changes, communicate them and put them into practice. There is an  associated effort to all organizational changes, and a small organization may need additional guidance on  how to make these changes, communicate them and put them into practice.  16 IBM (2015) Security Services 2014 Cyber Security Intelligence Index.  http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/se-cyberindex2014/se-cyberindex2014-pdf.pdf  http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/se-cyberindex2014/se-cyberindex2014-pdf.pdf  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  21  4 Recommendations for increasing the level of adoption of  standards  Based on the interviews with experts and the available existing research - conducted to assess the level of  standards adoption in SMEs and the main existing barriers to adopt standards - the study proposes a series  of recommendations in order to facilitate the adoption process of information security and privacy standards  by small and medium businesses. The following sections elaborate on specific measures on how SMEs could  be effectively and efficiently supported to cope with the perceived barriers to the standards’ adoption  process.  The proposed recommendations have been grouped in five domains:   Increasing knowledge and engagement: Making SMEs more familiar with the standards that they can  apply, as well as of the benefits they can obtain by implementing them.   Driving adoption and compliance: Providing mechanisms to foster standard adoption by SMEs  through certification and regulatory compliance.   Facilitating implementation: Making standards more easily deployable by SMEs by adapting to their  specific characteristics.   Increasing capabilities: Increasing cybersecurity capabilities in SMEs in order to make them ready for  standard adoption.   Fostering cooperation: Creating a common strategy among stakeholders towards a global strategy  for improving information security and privacy standardization for SMEs.  Recommendations are targeted at EU and MS public administrations; international or European SDOs;  professional, industry and small business associations, and future interested parties; such as insurance  companies. They identify areas where standards can be further improved and develop adequate strategies  and instruments that could be introduced to support SMEs in the adoption of standards in these fields.  Table 1 Recommendations to increase the level information security and privacy adoption in SMEs  Increasing knowledge  and engagement   Developing information security and privacy standards catalogues   Raising general awareness on the benefits of adopting standards   Increasing SME participation in the development and review process  Driving adoption and  compliance   Defining certification schemes   Promoting regulatory compliance through standard adoption  Facilitating  implementation   Creating standards specifically targeting SMEs   Developing implementation guidelines   Implementing a phased approach during the adoption process   Promoting security and privacy by design  Increasing capabilities  Creating ownership of the information security function   Providing support for standard adoption  Fostering cooperation  Promoting international, European and national collaboration  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  22  Increasing knowledge and engagement  Developing information security and privacy standards catalogues   EU Institutions and Member States should develop centralized catalogues with  extended information of existing information security and privacy standards  that are scalable for, and applicable by, SMEs.   Standards catalogues should include information on existing certification  schemes and auditing processes for each identified standard.  As a prerequisite to increase adoption, SMEs should be well informed about the published information  security and privacy standards along with all the relevant details and accompanying information (e.g. how to  reach them, what are the primary benefits and objectives, what are the specific implementation  requirements etc.). SMEs should be able to reach the appropriate level of knowledge of existing standards  and to perform an analysis and conclude on the standards that are most relevant to them.  To facilitate this process for SMEs, the development of centralised catalogues/inventories of all published  information security and privacy standards that are scalable for, and applicable by, SMEs would be very  beneficial. These catalogues, at an EU or Member State level, would serve as a point of reference with the  objective to assist SMEs to identify standards and clearly describe compliance requirements, facilitating the  early steps of the adoption process.  The catalogues should be comprehensive, including all relevant available standards at international,  European or industry level that are scalable for SMEs, and explicative, featuring a high level description of  the specific security and privacy requirements that must be implemented to comply with the specific  standards. In addition, the inventories should depict areas of overlaps and dependencies between the several  standards in order for the SMEs to identify how standards are complementary and interconnected.  Moreover, an added value to catalogues would be to include information about the certification and auditing  process that can be undertaken to prove compliance with the each specific standard (e.g. more accessible  information about accredited organisations that provide certification services, how to find them, what  services they provide, etc.).  Raising general awareness on the benefits of adopting standards   Public and private information security awareness organizations at all EU levels  should create specific campaigns targeting SMEs on how information security  and privacy standards can help them protect their core businesses.   All stakeholders in the information security domain should collaborate to find  effective ways to reach SMEs, especially at the management level.  General awareness, and specific engagement at the management level of SMEs, should be further enhanced  in order to ensure the successful buy-in of the standards adoption process. SMEs should have access to  substantiated information both on (a) the risks and the potential impact as a result of security incidents (e.g.  negative affect of consumers’ trust, damage of reputation, loss of revenue, financial penalties, loss of  competitive advantage etc.) and (b) the benefits and the business value of standards for their organisation.  Only that way SMEs will integrate the real value of adopting an information security and privacy standard for  their business. The security and privacy culture must be enforced with a top down approach within the  organisation.  Public administrations in Member States, International or European SDOs, professional, industry and small  business associations, such as National Chambers of Commerce, can assist in that particular direction by  planning, organising and delivering appropriate awareness initiatives and campaigns with regards to benefits  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  23  of information security and privacy standards, targeting directly SMEs. The main objective of the initiatives  should be to strengthen the confidence of SMEs to take up implementation of standards and make them  aware of the real business value and benefits. These activities should have defined clear vision and objectives,  effective communication plans and measurable metrics in order to assess effectiveness of the program.  Moreover, campaigns should be conducted over an extended amount of time, on a regular basis and focus  primarily on the executive level of SMEs.  Fulfilment of the awareness gap is a real challenge. The SME universe is large, heterogeneous and not always  easy to approach through a single channel. Awareness and engagement cannot be resolved by one single  entity, it must be an industry-wide collaboration. As such, more interaction and collaboration among the  aforementioned organisations, and especially among the small business and sectorial associations, is  considered as prerequisite in order to ensure the success of the campaigns.  Increasing SME participation in the development and review process   Standards development organizations publishing information security  standards should promote the participation in the development process of  SMEs from a variety of sectors.   Small businesses associations should be engaged as an effective broker to  include SMEs needs in the standard development process.  Although SMEs are currently actively involved in the standard development process in European SDO’s (for  example, a quarter of ETSI members are SMEs17), their representation is mostly comprised of SMEs in the ICT  sector. Information technology SMEs constitute a particular case among SMEs, as they are much more aware  of the importance of information security and how it relates to their business needs.  In order to have a broader view of the SME specific environment, SMEs from other sectors should be  incentivized to have a more active role in the design and development phases of the standards. A possible  method to increase involvement is to encourage SMEs to participate in the standards’ review process to  provide their feedback and comments, bringing that way together key stakeholders from SME sectors around  EU, to reach a common and unified approach.  Finally, as individual SMEs may be difficult to engage directly, due to their limited resources, a viable  alternative would be to promote the involvement of small businesses associations, which are well aware of  the specificities of SMEs, in these activities. This way there will be an alignment between the particular  business needs of the SMEs and the objectives of the standards.  Driving adoption and compliance  Defining certification schemes   EU governments and information security organizations should promote the  development of certification schemes targeted for SMEs to boost information  security and privacy standard adoption.   SMEs certification schemes should incorporate maturity ratings and different  levels of certification.  17 ETSI SMEs portal: http://www.etsi.org/about/who-we-are/smes  http://www.etsi.org/about/who-we-are/smes  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  24  An effective method to recognize efforts in adoption of information security and privacy standards in SMEs  would be the development of third party certification schemes for SMEs, with assessment and certification  activities performed by accredited external certification bodies. The schemes should incorporate the  requirements of the SME specific standard(s) and provide different levels of assessment and certification  based on the phases of the adoption process that characterizes each standard. Moreover, the introduction  of maturity ratings in the certification scheme could further assist organizations to identify the exact  compliance level they like to achieve, drive adoption of next certification levels and provide to their  customers and other stakeholders confidence and transparency on the organization’s information security  management.  Such certification schemes could follow the European common framework for accreditation under EC  Regulation 765/200818, applied already in the ISO 27001 certification scheme19, or could be based on an  industry led framework, such as the Cloud Security Alliance STAR certification20 for security assurance in the  cloud. These schemes could evolve to a competitive differentiator for SMEs and drive rapid adoption of the  standard within the next years. Finally, it is important that the total cost of certification process should be  affordable to SMEs.  Some steps in this direction have already been taken at a Member State level. For example, the Cyber  Essentials Scheme21, developed by the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, is a framework  targeted at SMEs. The document “Cyber Essential Scheme: Requirements for basic technical protection from  cyber-attacks”22 provides a set of technology focused requirements, using a simplified language, that can be  applied by small organizations, focusing on five domains (boundary firewalls and internet gateways, secure  configuration, access control, malware protection and patch management). The scheme offers two levels or  certification, cyber essentials and cyber essentials plus, which support the phased approach as a mean to  facilitate compliance.  Promoting regulatory compliance through standard adoption   EU public administrations should promote the establishment of voluntary  reference standards that presume conformity with regulations in the area of  information security and privacy.   EU public administrations should assess enforcing standard compliance for  contracts related to their information supply chain or to personal data  handling.  In order to foster adoption, SMEs covering specific criteria (e.g. operating in specific markets, providing  certain information products and services, storing, processing or transferring customer personal information)  18 Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the  requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and repealing  Regulation (EEC) No 339/93 (Text with EEA relevance). http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:l33248  19 ISO 27001 information security management standard. http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-  standards/iso27001.htm  20 Cloud Security Alliance STAR certification. https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/  21 Cyber Essentials Scheme. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-essentials-scheme-overview  22 Cyber Essentials Scheme - Requirements for basic technical protection from cyber-attacks.  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/317481/Cyber_Essentials_Requi rements.pdf  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=celex:32008R0765 http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso27001.htm http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso27001.htm https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/ https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-essentials-scheme-overview https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/317481/Cyber_Essentials_Requirements.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/317481/Cyber_Essentials_Requirements.pdf  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  25  could be driven to voluntary comply and be certified against specific information security and privacy  standards, as a method to proactively demonstrate regulatory compliance. This would create, as a secondary  effect, confidence to customers, key stakeholders and other interested parties that their information assets  and the information that the SMEs manage on their behalf is adequately protected.  An approach to drive this adoption would be to promote the establishment of voluntary reference standards.  Adoption of reference standards is not compulsory for organizations, but compliance is presumed when  conformity with the reference standard is met. This model poses benefits for all interested stakeholders.  From a regulator point of view, it provides flexibility with regards to setting technical requirements that might  be too detailed or dynamic to fit in the regulatory lifecycle. Furthermore, it facilitates achieving  harmonization in the market and facilitates compliance. From the perspective of the organization adopting  the standard, it greatly helps to increase customer confidence by demonstrating proactive compliance with  the existing regulatory framework. An example of this approach can be observed in Regulation (EU)  No 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market23.  The proposed EU General Data Protection Regulation24, foresees as well the possibility of establishing  voluntary certification mechanisms to help data subjects to quickly assess the level of data protection of  relevant products and services. Although the details regarding how this certification scheme will be  implemented and which standards will be used to assess compliance are not yet determined, this provision  is expected to foster adoption of personal data protection standards by EU organizations. Indeed, proving  compliance will be advantageous for an organization because of the growing concern among European users  of how their personal data are handled, and furthermore because of the reputation for the European data  protection regulatory framework to be one of the strictest and most advanced globally.  Another possible model to drive adoption is by enforcing compliance for certain contracts with the public  administration, as is the case for the UK Cyber Essentials Scheme. The UK Government (through its  “Procurement Policy Notice on the use of Cyber Essentials Scheme certification”25) encourages achieving this  certification for Central Government contracts that involve handling of personal data and provision of certain  IT products and services. Although a Cyber Essentials certification is not compulsory for organizations,  providers will need to prove by a third party assessment that they meet the information security  requirements set in the scheme, making conformance with the scheme the most effective way to prove  compliance.  23 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the  internal market.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  24 Proposal for a Regulation on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on  the free movement of such data.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52012PC0011  25 UK Cyber Essentials Scheme Procurement Policy.  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/368247/Cyber_Essentials_Sche me_draft_PPN_28_10.pdf  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52012PC0011  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  26  Facilitating implementation  Creating standards specifically targeting SMEs   Standards developing organizations should consider creating security and privacy  standards targeting specifically SMEs.   Security awareness organizations should develop recommendations on security  practices that can be easily applied by SMEs.   A further step in the development of standards for SMEs should be to take into  account specific requirements for different business sectors.  A critical recommendation to facilitate the adoption process is to design and develop specific standards that  meet the needs and capabilities of SMEs. These standards should be oriented and be applicable to SMEs  through the incorporation of their specific requirements; thus imposing lower financial and non-financial  adoption costs. Standards that are specifically developed for SMEs are generally expected to have a greater  adoption rate by the SME community.  The scheme of the existing standards should be reengineered in order to ensure that the proposed process  can be mapped to those of an average SME. Critical areas of existing standards, where more in depth  explanation is required, should be identified and further elaborated. Specifications from existing standards  should be analysed and modified appropriately in order to be applicable to the organisation of the SME  community. Security requirements on these standards could be more straightforward and structured (e.g.  like SANS top 20 critical security controls26). Furthermore, the new standards should take into consideration  the organisational structure and characteristics of SMEs (e.g. most of the actions and activities are conducted  by a limited number of human resources).  Finally, since the SME sector is encompassed by various organisations with many specificities, different  business needs and priorities, as well as various legal, regulatory and contractual security and privacy  requirements (e.g. size, industry), a further step in this direction could be taken by classifying SMEs and  developing standards targeted for each specific category to accommodate diversity.  Generalised security and privacy profiles (e.g. business needs, size, industry, etc.) could be defined to enable  SMEs to roughly match themselves to a profile in order to get an indication of the security requirements that  they should implement. Since the SME sector is composed by diverse entities, organisations could be  classified and assigned to one or several specific profiles.  Developing implementation guidelines   Standards development and information security awareness organizations  should develop easy to follow implementation guidelines.   Business associations should consider creating programs to enhance  information security capabilities with advice for SMEs on how to implement  standards.   Guidelines should focus on the initial stages of implementation, especially on  customised scoping.  Current information security and privacy standards are perceived as complex for SMEs to implement,  especially for small enterprises, and additional external guidance would be beneficial. A helpful support  action would be the development, by International or European SDOs, or professional and industry  26 SANS top 20 critical security controls. https://www.sans.org/critical-security-controls/  https://www.sans.org/critical-security-controls/  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  27  associations, of clear, structured and easy to use implementation guidelines and best practices handbooks  with realistic and concrete examples using simple terms and easily translatable language.  The main objective of these documents would be to enable SME personnel with general ICT knowledge and  skills to understand the specific activities and tasks that must be conducted in order to achieve compliance  with each security and privacy requirement of the standards. It is essential that these sources provide  reliable, up-to-date and detailed information to guide SMEs to implement the requirements step by step.  Moreover, implementation guidelines should also encompass information with regards to exact security  processes and procedures that must be in place to ensure adequate security safeguards (e.g. awareness, log  monitoring, vulnerability management etc.). These guidelines should contemplate both internalized and  outsourced ICT services models, providing advice to increase governance of ICT security in outsourced  models.  Special emphasis and attention should be given to the initial scoping and planning phases of the adoption  process. Although most standards are flexible, usually SMEs face some difficulties to appropriately customise  the standards based on their business needs and the applicable legal, regulatory and contractual  requirements. As such, further guidance should also be provided on how to identify the exact range of the  scope during the implementation of the standards as well as how to get the most out of the flexibility that  standards provide. SMEs should be assisted in the customisation and interpretation of the standards to the  point that they are economically, technically and financially relevant to their business.  Small Businesses Associations are well positioned to provide SMEs with advice and assistance towards  adopting and implementation standards. With this objective, stakeholders in information security area, such  as governments and information security industry entities, should support small business associations in the  development of more information security and privacy capabilities and expertise.  As an example, the French national information security agency (ANSSI) in partnership with the general  confederation of small and medium enterprises (Confédération Générale du patronat des Petites et  Moyennes Entreprises - CGMP), has published a reference guide of 12 good information security practices  (Guide des bonnes pratiques de l'informatique27). The guide is written in easy to understand language and  includes examples and clear implementation guidelines.  Implementing a phased approach during the adoption process   SMEs should perform an information security risk assessment before engaging in  the adoption of specific security and privacy standards.   Standards applicable by SMEs should incorporate maturity levels with different sets  of requirements to facilitate a phased implementation.  Recommending the implementation of a phased approach during the implementation of information  securityand privacy standards can facilitate adoption. As an initial step, it is critical for SMEs to perform a risk  analysis and assessment process prior to engaging in the adoption of any standard. Only upon completion of  risk assessment activities and determination of the organisation’s risk environment, SMEs should be in the  position to develop their own security strategy, define the exact scope of standardisation and conclude on  the most suitable and appropriate standards that should be implemented in order to effective mitigate  identified risks.  A phased approached could be enforced by incorporating a maturity rating scale in the standards. Standards  could have specific maturity levels defined for each profile. Each maturity level would have certain security  27 Guide CGPME: les bonnes pratiques de l'informatique. http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/guide/guide-des-bonnes-  pratiques-de-linformatique/  http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/guide/guide-des-bonnes-pratiques-de-linformatique/ http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/guide/guide-des-bonnes-pratiques-de-linformatique/  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  28  and privacy requirements (ranging from the easiest to the most difficult as the level increases) that should  be implemented in order to reach the specific level, be certified and advance to the next one. The first level  should only cover basic controls and quick wins that are easy for SMEs to implement and, therefore, comply  with in order to add a layer of protection to their information assets.  As the maturity level increase the safeguards would become more advanced, sophisticated and hence  difficult to implement and maintain compliance with. The maturity rating scale would assist SMEs to  comprehend their current maturity level in terms of information security and privacy capabilities, address  gaps with the standards and develop a roadmap to reach desired levels. Finally, in order for SMEs to be able  to monitor deployment effectiveness and efficiency, identify gaps and encourage controls improvement,  specific metrics should also be defined for each maturity level.  Promoting security and privacy by design   SMEs should be encouraged to implement security by default configurations to  facilitate later standard adoption.   Software vendors should implement security and privacy default configurations  in products targeting small organizations.  One of the key factors for facilitating the adoption process of standards is to focus on the information security  and privacy from the beginning of an information system design model. SMEs can adopt the security by  design approach as they setup, configure and implement their corporate infrastructures, information  systems and networks. Specific guidelines should be developed indicating and accommodating the means by  which secure architecture can be taken into consideration during the early stages of an SME establishment.  Overall, integrating information security and privacy principles and controls in the early stages of  implementation can create efficiencies and make compliance with standards much easier in the future  phases. As such, organisations across the SME sector will be able to achieve a consistent and common  security maturity level through the implementation of basic security and privacy safeguards that adequately  protect corporate and customers’ information assets, prevent a large percentage of cyber-attacks and overall  lower information security and privacy risks.  To support SMEs, software vendors should be encouraged to provide products targeted to small  organizations that offer appropriate default security configurations, facilitating the installation and  maintenance process for staff with general information knowledge. Although most software products  available nowadays in the market come with the possibility to establish granularity in the security features  that can be configured, interfaces and options may be difficult to understand for non-specialized staff. For  SMEs that outsource their ICT services, clear guidelines on security aspects to consider of contracting third  party services would be very helpful.  In the case of privacy, further steps should be taken by software vendors to provide systems that ensure that  customer information is protected with a sufficient level of granularity. Privacy controls, aligned with  European regulations, are still not fully translatable in all available software products targeting small  organizations.  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  29  Increasing capabilities  Creating ownership of the information security function   SMEs should be encouraged to designate an Information Security Officer to  ensure ownership of the information security and data protection  functions.   Member States should create professional training programs to provide  foundation training for Information Security Officers.  SMEs should be encouraged to assign a specific role to a resource that will carry out the security  responsibilities required to protect the critical business information assets, emphasising more on the  organisational and procedural aspects of information security and privacy. Even if this resource has only part  time dedication, and regardless on whether the ICT services are assumed internally or externally, the  allocation of responsibility to a specific employee of the organization is an effective way to ensure ownership  of the information security functions.  The information security officer should be responsible of designing and implementing a strategy that is  aligned with corporate goals and objectives. He/she should also be responsible for managing all security- related interactions within the organisation, as well as those external to the organisation, such as providers  of ICT services. As information security officer, he/she must also ensure that appropriate procedural,  technical and physical security controls are in place, directly or through appropriate contracts and SLAs.  Finally, he/she should have adequate information security skills and expertise to comprehend and enact the  guidance that standards require.  Member States should promote the creation of professional training programs on information security and  privacy principles for employees that will take up this role in small organizations. Taking into consideration  that these individuals do not necessarily have extensive technical or legal foundation on the area, and their  dedication will be on a part time basis, these programs should be designed for security and data protection  officers to understand the risks, principles and rationale behind the existing and proposed security measures.  Providing support for standards adoption   Public administrations at all EU levels should provide incentives to SMEs to adopt  security and privacy standards.   Public and private organizations in the area of professional training should develop  programs to enhance information security skills of SME staff.  SMEs could be assisted in order to overcome the obstacle of financial cost in implementing standards and  achieving certifications. Economic incentives can be provided with programs directly managed by public  administrations at the EU and member state level and/or through professional, industry and small business  associations at a national level. These incentives may include, but not limited to:   Reduced cost/free direct access to standards for SMEs.   Funding (e.g. credits, grants, subsidies or tax incentives) associated to standard adoption and third  party certification.   Affordable access for SMEs to professional training on information security standard  implementation.  Among the above, it is critical to provide incentives for training SME personnel on information security and  privacy in order to further develop their skills and therefore the overall cybersecurity capacity of the  organization. These initiatives may include well organised seminars, trainings, hands-on labs, workshops that  are delivered by several different delivery methods such as live or virtual, classroom-style, guided study, etc.  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  30  Fostering cooperation  Promoting international, European and national collaboration   International, European and national SDOs, as well as industry associations,  should work together towards developing a harmonized plan to create  information security and privacy standards specifically designed for SMEs.  Strong, clear and flexible international cooperation and collaboration between extended communities of  cyber security stakeholders is required in order to drive and foster adoption of standardization for the SME  sector. This entails efforts at the national, European and international level. European and international SDOs  should work together with SME professional and industry associations in order to develop an effective and  concrete plan as well as a harmonized approach towards creating and driving adoption of standards  specifically designed for SMEs.  A European wide approach in this field to ensure harmonization can be positive for the advancement of the  Digital Single Market28. European SMEs should be able to adopt European information and privacy standards  that are easily recognized throughout Europe by their potential customers. Furthermore, standards that  prove compliance with European regulations, especially in the area of data protection, can be perceived by  EU costumers a proactive way to enhance their trust. Additionally, further emphasis should be given to  engage business, professional and industry associations in this cooperation for standardization, to ensure  that the exchange of relevant information on topics related to information security and privacy  standardization takes into consideration the specific needs of the SME community.  28 European Comission 10 priorities: Digital Single Market: http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  31  Annex A: Existing information Security and Privacy Standards for  SMEs  In order to understand the availability of information security and privacy standards that can be applied by  SMEs, the study gathered and analysed information regarding existing standards in these areas. For this  purpose, a desk research was conducted in order to identify what specific published standards are related  to information security and privacy and can be adopted by SMEs. The main sources for research were:   International or European SDOs, professional associations, industry associations etc.   Specific standards targeting SMEs.   Standards for codes of practices, for securing business processes, for procuring secure products,  for regulatory compliance etc.  The outcome of the research is the following list of well-known information security and privacy standards  that are categorised in terms of:   The context of each standard (i.e. risk management, privacy, business continuity etc.).   The industry each standard refers to (i.e. health, financial services etc.).  Further information about the description of each specific standards can be found in Annex B.

The use of new technologies brings new opportunities for  enhanced business performance and operations, but also introduces several information security and privacy  risks. Addressing these risks plays a significant role in business success and development nowadays, as  growing security threats1 may potentially disrupt business continuity and cause monetary, reputational, as  well as other types of losses to SMEs.  In parallel, new information security and privacy standards are being drafted and proposed to support  organizations to integrate best practices into their procedures and mitigate risks. To this end, a wide and  effective adoption of information security and privacy related standards by SMEs across Europe can be a  beneficial factor for fostering their growth, competitiveness and innovation.  In this context, ENISA has carried out this project under its Work Program 20152, with the objective of  providing a set of relevant recommendations regarding how to increase the adoption of information security  and privacy standards in SMEs. These recommendations are targeted to EU and MS policy makers; standards  developing organizations; and professional, industry and small businesses associations.  To reach relevant conclusions, an extensive analysis was conducted in order to investigate the status of  security and privacy standard adoption in European SMEs, the main drivers that can motivate SMEs towards  the adoption of these standards and, especially, the perceived existing barriers for SMEs in this area. The  methodology of the study consisted in interviews with subject matter experts and analysis of available studies  in the area. The report identifies as well existing information security and privacy standards that can be used  by European SMEs, presenting a list of standards that could be considered for adoption by SMEs, along with  descriptions of these standards.  Key findings  The analysis conducted for this study, based on the interviews with subject matter experts and review of  available studies, shows that, despite rising concerns on information security risks, the level of SMEs  information security and privacy standard adoption is relatively low. The main existing drivers and barriers  that contribute to the limited uptake of information security and privacy standards in European SMEs have  been identified to be the following:  I. Drivers  Mitigating information security risks   Threats to information security and privacy, varying from inadvertent events to deliberate attacks,  pose significant risks to any organization nowadays.   Adoption of information security and privacy standards is an effective means to mitigate these risks.  Increasing consumer trust  1 ENISA Threat Landscape 2014: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-  environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014  2 ENISA Work Programme 2015: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-  programme-2015  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programme-2015 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programme-2015  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  07   Users are becoming more concerned when handling their data to businesses and trust is becoming a  relevant decision factor.   Adoption of standards indicates to customers that the organisation is committed to enforce security  mechanisms for protecting their data.  Proactively demonstrating commitment towards regulatory compliance   In many cases SMEs need to demonstrate compliance with information security and privacy  requirements derived by national or EU legislation.   Implementing, maintaining and enforcing internal policies through the use of standards as a  supporting tool is an effective mean to proactively show a commitment with regulations.  Achieving competitive advantage   Proof of compliance to an acknowledged standard provides reassurance both to providers and  business customers.   This constitutes a possible competitive advantage when dealing with corporate clients both from the  private and public spheres.  II. Barriers  Barriers related to knowledge and engagement   SMEs are in general not aware of the available standards that may assist them mitigate technology  risks and there are limited single points of reference that SMEs can use.   Standards implementation requires commitment of resources that otherwise an SME would allocate  into more transparent business activities.   Management does not yet perceive clearly how implementing these standards adds business value  to their organisation and there is a prevailing perception that cyber-attacks are mainly threatening  large enterprises.   The design of standards is mainly driven from larger size organisations and thus many standards are  not easily scalable for use by SMEs.  Barriers related to available capabilities and resources   In SMEs that assume the ICT function internally, an employee is responsible for security along with  his/her other ICT operational responsibilities, which leads to limited dedication for ICT security.   Meanwhile, in SMEs where it is outsourced, the lack of internal knowledge hardens the negotiation  with providers on security features or contracts.   Implementation of information security and privacy standards can be demanding in terms of financial  resources and getting the necessary budget can be a challenging task.   Many SMEs do not have still a solid foundation of effective information security risk management.  Barriers related to shortage of standards in specific areas   There are limited European or international standards designed to assist small organizations towards  ensuring appropriate protection of personal data.  Barriers related to implementation aspects   Many statements of the standards are challenging for SMEs in order to clearly identify the tasks and  activities that must be conducted.   There is a lack of adequate implementation guidelines with specific detailed steps on how to apply  each information security and privacy requirement.   Standards rely on processes that might not yet be implemented in a small organization and standard  adoption will require the design or reengineering of internal core processes.  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  08  Recommendations  Based on the analysis from the findings on enabling factors and barriers to pursuing standard adoption, the  study proposes the following key recommendations to improve the information security and privacy  standardisation level in the European SME community:  Increasing knowledge and engagement   EU public administrations should develop centralized catalogues with extended information of  existing information security and privacy standards that are scalable for, and applicable by, SMEs.   Public and private information security awareness organizations at all EU levels should create specific  campaigns targeting SMEs on how information security and privacy standards can help them protect  their core business assets and processes.   Organizations developing information security standards should promote the participation in the  development process of SMEs coming from a variety of sectors.  Driving adoption and compliance   EU public administrations and/or industrial organizations should promote the development of  certification schemes targeted at SMEs to boost information security and privacy standard adoption.   EU public administrations should promote the establishment of voluntary reference standards that  presume conformity with regulations in the area of information security and privacy.   EU public administrations should assess enforcing standard compliance for contracts related to their  information supply chain or to personal data handling.  Facilitating implementation   Standard developing organizations should consider creating security and privacy standards targeting  specifically SMEs which take into account their specific features and processes.   Public and private information security organizations could support SMEs by developing easy to  follow implementation guidelines focusing on the scoping and initial stages of implementation.   Standards applicable by SMEs could incorporate maturity levels with different sets of requirements  to facilitate a phased implementation.   SMEs should be incited to deploy security by default configurations to facilitate later standard  adoption, and software vendors can support SME by ensuring secure default configurations in  products targeting small organizations.  Increasing capabilities   SMEs should be encouraged to designate an Information Security Officer to ensure ownership of the  information security and data protection functions.   Member States should create professional training programs to provide foundation training for  Information Security Officers.   Public administrations at all EU levels should provide incentives to SMEs to adopt security and privacy  standards.  Fostering cooperation   International, European and national SDOs, as well as industry associations, should work together  towards developing a harmonized plan to create information security and privacy standards  specifically designed for SMEs.  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  09  1 Introduction  The European Commission defines micro, small and medium-sized enterprises as enterprises which employ  fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding 50 million euro, and/or an annual  balance sheet total not exceeding 43 million euro3. SMEs comprise more than 99% of all European businesses.  In the past five years, they have created around 85% of new jobs and provided two-thirds of the total private  sector employment in the EU4.  Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have paramount importance for the innovation, growth and  development of the economy, both at the European and national level and they are a priority focus sector  for governments’ economic policy. The prominence of their role and growth has been recognised by the  European Institutions and the Member States through multiple policy actions aiming to promote SMEs'  development, by helping them to tackle the obstacles and problems that obstruct their business  development.  Nowadays, SMEs are increasingly dependent on their information systems and networks to provide services  to customers and meet their business objectives. If micro enterprises are excluded, the vast majority of SMEs  relies on some form of information system and many of them already have an online presence. Electronic  communication networks, interconnected information systems and digital services are an essential part of  an increasing number of SMEs5.  In parallel with the growing ICT adoption by SMEs, emerging information security and privacy threats are  becoming an increasing concern. Due to the constant and evolving threat landscape and the progressively  developing corporate risk exposure, SMEs nowadays face significant information security risks that threaten  their business6. SMEs need to implement formal information security processes, technical mechanisms and  organisational measures. Without such safeguards, SMEs may be severely impacted by inadvertent threats  or deliberate attacks on their information systems and networks, which could ultimately lead to negative  business effects.  To support organizations in adopting best security practices, a significant number of information security and  privacy standards have been developed and published during the last decade by international or European  standard developing organisations, professional or expert associations (See Annex A for a comprehensive list  of information security and privacy standards). These standards aim to assist organisations to effectively  manage and strengthen their information security safeguards, and reduce risks in acceptable levels, all the  while maintaining a competitive advantage in today’s online world and ensuring protection of business  assets.  There are many drivers for SMEs to pursue the adoption of an information security or privacy standard. Yet  their level of standard adoption in this area is still low and their uptake is not largely perceived as a priority.  The analysis conducted for this study, through interviews with subject matter experts and research on  available studies, shows that there are several perceived barriers for SMEs to embrace standards in the  security and privacy field, and that the low standard adoption rate can be improved by undertaking specific  actions to overcome these barriers. One of the primary barriers is that there is a limited awareness in the  3 EC. 2015. The new SME definition - User guide and model declaration.

Implementing information security and privacy standards is perceived as being challenging by SMEs. This  might be partially caused by SMEs’ specific needs and characteristics not having been largely taken into  consideration during the standards development process, making many standards complex for SMEs with  simple internal procedures. SMEs primarily use standards as guidance and the maturity and rigour levels are  very likely to vary considerably from one organization to another.  Although SMEs have already taken some steps, there is still a long way towards a wide adoption of  information security and privacy standards as a means to mitigate the risks introduced by the velocity and  complexity of business and technology changes, and of cyber threats. SMEs should be encouraged to take  bolder proactive steps in order to deal with and prevent information security and privacy threats and attacks.  Prioritising their efforts towards adopting information security and privacy standards can enhance their  visibility, add value and provide a competitive advantage to their organisation, which will enable them to  achieve and maintain a robust security posture.  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  11  2 Drivers for pursuing information security and privacy standards  Mitigating information security risks   Threats to information security and privacy, varying from inadvertent events to  deliberate attacks, pose significant risks to any organization nowadays.   Adoption of information security and privacy standards is an effective means to  mitigate these risks.  The fast-growing and increasingly more complex cyber threat landscape poses a greater risk than ever to  organisations, including small and medium organizations. Use of new technologies provides opportunities  for enhanced business performance but also introduces potential security risks that must be mitigated.  Threats to information security and privacy, varying from inadvertent events to deliberate attacks, pose  significant risks to any organization nowadays. Without safeguards, SMEs may suffer severe impact on their  information systems and networks, which can ultimately lead to negative business effects. Adoption of  information security and privacy standards is an effective means to mitigate these risks.  Increasing consumer trust   Users are becoming more concerned when handling their data to businesses and  trust is becoming a relevant decision factor.   Adoption of standards indicates to customers that the organisation is committed  to enforce security mechanisms for protecting their data.  According to the Eurostat 2014 information security barometer7, concerns among internet users on risks  associated with online transactions are raising; especially mistrust on how their personal data are used and  the security of online payments. Users are becoming more concerned when handing their data to businesses  and trust is becoming a relevant decision factor that can give an advantage to well-prepared organizations.  Increasing customers’ confidence is emerging as a significant driver for adopting information security and  privacy standards in enterprises. Adoption of standards indicates to customers that the organisation is  committed to enforce security mechanisms for protecting their data and in this way it might create added  value for an SME. Moreover, whenever personal data are involved, customer expectations are met, since  they feel that their personal information is well protected, and as a result trust is generated.  Proactively demonstrating commitment towards regulatory compliance   In many cases SMEs need to demonstrate compliance with information security  and privacy requirements derived by national or EU legislation.   Implementing, maintaining and enforcing internal policies through the use of  standards as a supporting tool is an effective means to proactively show a  commitment with regulations.  In many cases SMEs need to demonstrate compliance with information security and privacy requirements  derived by national or European legislation, industry specific regulations and contractual obligations. Failure  7 Special Eurobarometer 423 Cybersecurity Report (2015):  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_423_en.pdf  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_423_en.pdf  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  12  to comply with these requirements may have negative impact and long-term consequences to the business  of the SMEs. These consequences are very transparent to management and as a result they are committed  and support efforts towards compliance. The specific compliance requirements are in many cases aligned  with information security and privacy standards controls. Implementing, maintaining and enforcing internal  policies through the use of standards as a supporting tool is an effective means to proactively show a  commitment with regulations in the area of information security and privacy.  Achieving competitive advantage   Proof of compliance to an acknowledged standard provides reassurance both to  providers and business customers.   This constitutes a possible competitive advantage when dealing with corporate  clients both from the private and public spheres.  Finally, standards can offer a significant competitive edge to SMEs by facilitating the improvement of the  products and services they offer. Proof of compliance to an acknowledged standard provides reassurance  both to providers and business customers, adds credibility to the organization and increases confidence by  demonstrating commitment to protecting the information assets handed to the SME by customers. When an  SME adopts an information security standard, customers will likely have more assurance in establishing and  maintaining business relationships with the organisation, and this can constitute a possible competitive  advantage when dealing with corporate clients both from the private and public spheres.  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  13  3 Barriers to SME adoption of information security and privacy  standards  Barriers related to knowledge and engagement  Knowledge of applicable standards   SMEs are not in general aware of the available standards that may assist them  mitigate technology risks   There are limited single points of reference that SMEs can use.   SMEs face difficulties with the identification of the standards that will meet their  specific business objectives or those they should comply with due to sectorial  requirements.  Several information security and privacy standards have been developed and published by international or  European standards development organizations and by industry associations during the last years. There are  limited single points of reference, at an EU or MS level, that SMEs can use in order to identify which standard  is the most suitable for them and better covers their business needs and requirements. SMEs are not largely  aware of the available standards that may assist them mitigate technology risks; the majority of SMEs are  only familiar with a limited number of standards (e.g. the ISO/IEC 27000 series).  Moreover, security requirements are spread in numerous different standards and documents. SMEs face  difficulties with the identification of the standards that will meet their specific business objectives and needs,  or even those they should comply with due to sectorial requirements. Thus, SMEs must identify relevant  standards, aggregate and correlate requirements in order to identify overlaps and inter-dependencies. This  makes it complex for SMEs to determine which standards are suitable for them, taking into consideration all  business, legal, regulatory and contractual requirements and obligations.  For example, SMEs that store, process or transmit cardholder and customer/personal data may not be aware  of specific obligations, as defined by relevant standards (e.g. PCI Data Security Standard8). Although PCI DSS  must be implemented by all entities that store, process or transmit cardholder data from major credit card  companies, small merchants and service providers are not required to explicitly validate compliance.  However in the event of a security breach, they may be subject to penalties if it is proved they were not  compliant.  Management commitment   Standards implementation requires commitment of resources that otherwise an  SME would allocate into business activities with a more transparent return of  investment.   Management does not yet perceive clearly how implementing these standards  adds business value to their organisation.  8 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS):  https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/  https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  14  In today’s economic environment, SMEs need to focus their efforts on staying competitive within their core  operations, further expanding into other territories and markets, and surviving in the current dynamic  business atmosphere. Achievement of growth (e.g. new markets, customers, products, higher revenue),  innovation (e.g. use of new technologies to interact with customers in more efficient and effective ways) and  corporate governance, in order to provide stakeholders with confidence, are usually the top priorities for  European SMEs. Moreover, SMEs need to achieve growth with limited resources, which they need to allocate  carefully by taking into account strict time and budget considerations.  Meanwhile, information security and privacy risks are transforming into a relevant issue in all organizations  which require management’s attention and commitment. Indeed, adoption of new technologies impacts  every aspect of business function; it is therefore becoming increasingly visible that technology risks are  threatening the core business processes and they must be effectively managed and mitigated.  Information security risks had historically been assigned as the sole responsibility of the IT department and  were not considered a strategic business risk requiring an organisation-wide attention. But information  security has in the last years been recognized to add a strategic value to the strategy pyramid of  organizations, rather than as a necessary evil to protect the information assets from potential attackers and  exposure risks.  However, many SMEs still choose to take a reactive approach, as opposed to a proactive approach (i.e.  respond to a security incident after it has happened and not act in order to prevent it). Furthermore, adoption  of information security and privacy standards requires commitment in terms of time and resources that  otherwise an SME would allocate into business activities with more transparent return of investment. It is  difficult for management to perceive clearly how implementing these standards adds business value and  provides competitive advantage to their organisation.  By contrast, for SMEs operating in regulated environments it is easier to engage management, gain their  attention and commitment, and acquire the necessary budget. Without this compliance driving force, experts  perceive that there is not enough motivation for adopting information security and privacy standards; making  it difficult for IT and/or security professionals to convince management in that particular direction.  Perceptions on cyber threats targeting SMEs   There is a prevailing, but wrongful, perception that cyber-attacks are mainly  threatening large enterprises.   Recent reports indicate that every type of business, regardless of its size, is a  potential target of a cyber-attack.  There is a concern among experts participating in the study about the prevailing perception that cyber- attacks are mainly threatening large enterprises and SMEs remain largely unaffected from these threats since  they do not store, process or transfer information as critical as larger organizations. Indeed, according to a  2013 survey conducted among small business by the US National Small Bussiness Associaton9, only 30% of  small business were very concerned about being vulnerable to a cyber attack, while 60% were only somewhat  concerned. Because of this misconception, many SMEs consider that information security standards are  designed mainly for the large enterprises and they don’t grasp the added value of adopting them.  However this is not the case; recent reports indicate that every type of business, regardless of its size, is a  potential target of a cyber-attack.  The UK Government Information Security Breaches Survey10 indicates that,  9 2013 Small business technology survey, US National Small Bussiness Associaton, http://www.nsba.biz/wp- content/uploads/2013/09/Technology-Survey-2013.pdf  10 HM Government (2015) 2015 Information Security Breaches Surveyhttp://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs- technical-report-blue-digital.pdf  http://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs-technical-report-blue-digital.pdf http://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs-technical-report-blue-digital.pdf  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  15  among the survey participants, 90% of large organizations suffered a security breach in 2015, with this figure  standing at 74% for small organizations. Since large enterprises usually have a stronger security culture with  robust security controls, less determined malicious attackers may be discouraged by the protection  mechanisms that are in place, targeting instead SMEs, which offer less resistance.  Contribution in the development process   The design of standards is mainly driven from larger size organisations and is  oriented to cover their multiple processes.   Many standards are not easily scalable for use by SMEs.   Non-technological SMEs do not participate extensively in the standards  development and review processes.  Non-technological SMEs do not participate extensively in the standards’ development and review process,  and thus their particular business needs and objectives are not largely taken into account. The design of  standards is mainly driven from larger size organisations and is oriented to cover their multiple processes. As  a direct consequence, standards assume that organisations have a thorough understanding of all technical  and non-technical terms, as well as enough resources (both financial and non-financial), to implement the  requirements. Hence, many standards are not instantiated for use by SMEs with simpler procedures in place.  Although standard developing organizations (SDOs) make an effort to engage SMEs in their activities, it is  difficult for non-technological SMEs to participate, due to a combined lack of available resources and  expertise. For example, although 25% of ETSI members are SMEs11, most of them are related to the  information technology sector, which means they have extensively more information security capabilities  than the average SME. This leads to the average SMEs’ characteristics, nature and capabilities not being  largely taken into consideration during the development phase of standards.  Barriers related to available capabilities and resources  Cybersecurity capabilities  While SMEs rely increasingly on ICT systems to support their business processes, their size only justifies the  employment of a small number of dedicated individuals for ICT functions, if any at all. Some SMEs decide to  internalize the ICT services while others opt to outsource them. Regardless of the ICT management model  selected, the ultimate responsibility over protecting corporate and client information contained in  information systems remains within the SME.  11 European Telecommunications Standards Institute: http://www.etsi.org/index.php/membership   In SMEs that assume the ICT function internally, an employee is responsible for  information security along with his/her other ICT operational and time pressing  responsibilities.   In SMEs that outsource the ICT function, the lack of internal knowledge in  information security complicates the negotiation with providers on custom  security features or contracts.   Various multidisciplinary security roles are usually required to manage these  standards, and this goes beyond the capacity and expertise of SMEs.  http://www.etsi.org/index.php/membership  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  16  If the ICT function is assumed internally, usually an employee is responsible for information security along  with other ICT related responsibilities. These individuals are already in charge of governance, design,  implementation and monitoring the whole ICT infrastructure; thus it comes as an added effort for them to  manage the organisation’s security aspects. It is understandable that the top priority for these employees is  to maintain the availability of information systems and networks that support the business operations, hence  security processes are somehow overlooked.  When SMEs decide to outsource ICT services to specialized companies, they also face difficulties, as the lack  of internal knowledge in information security complicates the negotiation with providers on custom security  features or contracts. SMEs typically acquire standardised, off-the-shelf, services and products under fixed,  boilerplate, contracts and SLAs. Moreover, SMEs in many cases are not largely aware of specific security  products and solutions that could assist them secure their data and business information.  Limited access to information security capabilities can constitute one of the most critical vulnerabilities for  an SME, exposing the organisation to several risks. This absence of capabilities might manifest itself, for  example, in difficulties in the interpretation of the technical focused aspects of standards. Standards in many  cases contain fairly general statements that actually require a degree of specialised knowledge to translate  into a specific context. Even in the case of outsourced services, understanding of information security  requirements is necessary to draft and enforce appropriate contract clauses with suppliers.  Finally, one of the first actions required to adopt information security and privacy standards is to allocate  information security roles and responsibilities to specific employees. Indeed, various multidisciplinary  security roles are usually required to manage these standards, and this usually goes beyond the human  resource capacity of the average SME.  Budget and resources   Implementation of information security and privacy standards can be demanding  in terms of financial resources and getting the necessary budget from  management can be a challenging task.   In many cases SMEs need to seek the assistance of an experienced consultant in  order to support them, which adds financial costs to the process.  The lack of budget for information security seems to be one of the largest impediments for adopting  standards. Implementation of information security and privacy standards can be demanding in terms of  financial resources and getting the necessary budget from management can be a very a challenging task,  especially if compliance with these standards may not be perceived to be on the top priorities for small  businesses managers.  In the last years, the change of the allocated budget for information security has been relatively positive,  with studies such as the EY Global Information Security Survey12 finding that around 50% of organizations  planned to increase their information security budget in 2015. However, the year-on-year increase of  information security budgets is more visible in large organisations, and less pronounced in SMEs. For  example, the UK Government Information Security Breaches Survey13 found that while 42% of UK large  businesses planned to increase their information security budget in 2015, this figure is reduced to 7% in the  case of small businesses.  12 EY Global Information Security Survey 2014: https://webforms.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-global-  information-security-survey-2014/$FILE/EY-global-information-security-survey-2014.pdf  13 HM Government (2015) 2015 Information Security Breaches Surveyhttp://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs-  technical-report-blue-digital.pdf  https://webforms.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-global-information-security-survey-2014/$FILE/EY-global-information-security-survey-2014.pdf https://webforms.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-global-information-security-survey-2014/$FILE/EY-global-information-security-survey-2014.pdf https://webforms.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-global-information-security-survey-2014/$FILE/EY-global-information-security-survey-2014.pdf http://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs-technical-report-blue-digital.pdf http://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs-technical-report-blue-digital.pdf  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  17  In many cases SMEs seek assistance of an experienced consultant in order to support them on the design and  implementation phases of standards. Active guidance from external consultants may also be required during  the first steps of the operation of a new information security model in order to ensure future compliance.  Additionally, organisations usually need to acquire technical and software solutions in order to comply with  the technical requirements of the standards. Finally, there is a shortage of knowledge in SMEs regarding  relevant products, scalable to their size, which can help them meet the security and privacy requirements of  the standards, while meeting their business needs.  There are some additional costs that, albeit small compared to the previously mentioned activities, cannot  be overlooked. First, the existence of fees that some SDOs request to provide access to the standard’s  documentation. In some cases, the small budget required for purchasing a standard is not easily accepted by  management. Moreover, implementation of a standard might be followed by certification from a third-party  assessor (which needs to be renewed periodically); thus introducing additional costs that need to fit in the  overall business strategy of the company.  Finally, implementation of standards is also time-consuming. Limited staff to assist with the deployment, as  well as maintenance of compliance, makes the whole adoption process a lengthy task. Consequently, SMEs  may allocate resources into business activities with a more transparent return of investment.  Risk management   Many SMEs do not have still a solid foundation of effective information security  risk management, and there are limited available risk management frameworks  scalable to small organizations.   The risk environment of the organization must be known in order to determine  the applicable standards.  A primary objective of any SME is to achieve growth, however, this must be performed, as within any  organization, inside appropriate risk and control boundaries. With information security being an emerging  field, small organizations may not apply the same degree of rigorousness to assess the information security  risks as they would for financial, legal, regulatory or operational risks. Furthermore, many SMEs operate in  sectors where there is no strong culture of risk management to build upon. Due to these factors, many small  and medium enterprises do not still have a solid foundation of effective information security risk  management.  SMEs are slowly, but gradually, becoming aware of the potential impact of disrupted business services due  to technology incidents, as well as how risk management can protect them from threats and vulnerabilities  applicable to their information assets. According to the UK Government 2015 Information Security Breaches  Survey15, only 49% of SMEs participating in the survey had conducted a security risk assessment in the  previous year.  Prior to selecting and implementing any specific standard, SMEs, as any organization, must identify the  existing information security and privacy risks they are exposed to. Indeed, standard adoption can be a  helpful tool to develop a structured approach to mitigate risks, however the risk environment of the  organization must be known in order to determine the best applicable standards. There are, however, limited  available risk management frameworks and implementations guidelines scalable to small organizations that  can enable and support them in this area.  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  18  Barriers related to shortage of standards in specific areas  Specific privacy standards   In the last years, there has been a shift in the perception for enterprises on the  importance of protecting personal data.   There are limited European or international standards designed to assist small  organizations towards ensuring appropriate protection of personal data.  In the past, SMEs were not largely aware of the risks posed to their customers’ data, resulting from the lack  of privacy preserving controls. However, in the last years, there has been a shift in the perception of the  importance of protecting personal data. The 2015 UK Government Information Security Breaches Survey14  found that the single, largest driver for information security expenditure in enterprises is protecting customer  information, followed by protecting the organization reputation; with these two factors together accounting  for more than half of the responses.  This would support the notion that SMEs consider privacy protection as a competitive advantage that will  mitigate business risks and enhance customers’ trust. But there is still some work to be done in order to make  SMEs fully conscious on the risks and the value of protecting customers’ data for their business.  Another important aspect to consider when discussing the relevance of privacy protection in SMEs are the  EU and Member States personal data protection legal frameworks. The regulatory requirements have  become more mature over the years, even addressing specific industry sectors, and European SMEs need to  be compliant with their national personal data protection laws. The Proposed General Data Protection  Regulation15, will further develop the privacy protection legal framework in the EU, introducing a harmonised  approach across EU Member States.  Yet, the ongoing issue for organizations is that they do not have enough guidance on which specific controls  they should implement in order to be compliant with personal data protection laws. Even in regulated  industry sectors, enterprises find it sometimes challenging to translate into concrete measures the specific  privacy requirements they must comply with. This problem becomes more pressing for SMEs, as they have  limited ICT governance.  Regulations focus on the objective and standards can support them by providing guidance on the means to  achieve it. However, only a limited number of standards with regards to privacy have been developed and  published, and no specific implementation guidelines have been further analysed and developed in depth,  compared to the situation for information security controls. Aside from the ISO/IEC 29100:2011 [34] and the  CEN CWA 16113:2010 [44], which provide a general privacy framework, there are limited European or  international standards designed to assist organisations all types of organizations, especially small ones,  towards ensuring appropriate protection of personal data.  14 HM Government (2015) 2015 Information Security Breaches Survey.  http://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs-technical-report-blue-digital.pdf  15 Proposal for a Regulation on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on  the free movement of such data. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52012PC0011  http://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/2015-isbs-technical-report-blue-digital.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52012PC0011  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  19  Barriers related to implementation aspects  Standards’ complexity   Many statements of the standards are challenging for SMEs in order to clearly  identify the tasks and activities that must be conducted.   SMEs do not fully realize the rationale behind many security and privacy  requirements.   SMEs are largely unaware of the flexibility that standards provide with regards to  the implementation and monitoring of controls.  One relevant barrier to information security and privacy standards adoption in SMEs is that these standards  have been generally documented in a way that makes it difficult for non-technological SMEs to comprehend.  Standards tend to be framed in terms that are most directly applicable to large scale and enterprise  organisations. There is a concern among experts that the language used contains terms that are too complex  for small organizations and this is hardening the early stages of the adoption process.  There is a perception that, in general, SMEs do not fully realize the rationale behind many security and privacy  requirements, either related or unrelated to technology. Indeed, if technology aspects are excluded, the  information security and privacy organizational processes, as dictated by standards, are considered by  experts quite elaborate and challenging by SMEs, depicting complex business processes that do not map the  SMEs environment.  Furthermore, SMEs are generally unaware of the flexibility that standards provide with regards to the  implementation and monitoring of controls. Current standards do not clearly depict the flexibility offered,  resulting sometimes in misinterpretations. SMEs seem to be failing in appropriately tailoring the standards  based on their business needs and the applicable legal, regulatory and contractual requirements.  Guidance on scope   SMEs generally interpret differently what activities must be performed in order to  achieve compliance.   There is a lack of adequate implementation guidelines with specific detailed steps  on how to apply each information security and privacy requirement.  Another critical factor that hardens the adoption process and is highly associated with the complexity of  standards is that SMEs quite often tend to interpret standards in very different ways based on their own  perspective and understanding. In fact, typically there is more than one interpretation for each information  security and privacy requirement in standards, but not all interpretations are equally suitable for every  organization. It is not uncommon for SMEs to interpret differently what activities must be performed in order  to achieve compliance.  Consequently, a challenge for SMEs is not just to know what they need to do, but also how they must do it,  with regard to their business context. Experts believe SMEs face difficulties to understand how standards  operate in detail and how standards can be further customized and combined in order to meet their specific  business needs.  Besides, there is a lack of adequate implementation guidelines with specific detailed steps on how to apply  each information security and privacy requirement (i.e. translating it to specific technological and  organizational controls). As a result, experts interviewed stated that SMEs many times either do more than  they can afford or of what is needed in order to achieve compliance and may end up either under protecting,  or overprotecting their information assets and allocating more resources than required.  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  20  Organisational and procedural controls   Organizations are still more familiar with technical aspects of information  security, rather than organisational and procedural ones.   Standards rely on processes that might not yet be implemented in a small  organization   Standard adoption will require the design or reengineering of internal core  processes.  Aside from the deployment of technical controls, conformity to information security standards also calls for  organizational and procedural changes that will complement the required controls. In the past, information  security was regarded more as a technical issue and as such many organizations are still more familiar with  technical aspects rather than organisational and procedural ones. Most SMEs have usually implemented, at  least, the basic infrastructure and software components required for protecting their business assets (i.e.  firewalls, anti-virus protection mechanisms etc.).  But nowadays there is a clear consensus that information security transcends technology and also involves  organizational and procedural aspects. Indeed, most security and data breaches are caused by human errors,  misconfiguration and/or failure of information systems and network components (according to IBM's  recent Security Services 2014 Cyber Security Intelligence Index report16, 95% of security incidents involve  human error as a contributing factor).  As such, SMEs do not require only guidelines for deploying security products and technical controls. They  also need support to design, implement and maintain clear, structured, effective and realistic organisational  and procedural mechanisms to ensure adequate levels of conformity with information security standards.  Furthermore, the complete set of processes covered in some standards is not scalable to small organizations,  and these standards rely on processes that might not yet be implemented, or being conducted in an informal  way, in a small organization (e.g. asset management, capacity management, etc.). Thus, standard adoption  will require the design or reengineering of internal core processes. There is an associated effort to all  organizational changes, which may introduce additional management overhead in order to tailor the  implementation. A small organization may need additional guidance on how to make these changes,  communicate them and put them into practice.  There is an associated effort to all organizational changes, and a small organization may need additional  guidance on how to make these changes, communicate them and put them into practice. There is an  associated effort to all organizational changes, and a small organization may need additional guidance on  how to make these changes, communicate them and put them into practice.  16 IBM (2015) Security Services 2014 Cyber Security Intelligence Index.  http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/se-cyberindex2014/se-cyberindex2014-pdf.pdf  http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/se-cyberindex2014/se-cyberindex2014-pdf.pdf  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  21  4 Recommendations for increasing the level of adoption of  standards  Based on the interviews with experts and the available existing research - conducted to assess the level of  standards adoption in SMEs and the main existing barriers to adopt standards - the study proposes a series  of recommendations in order to facilitate the adoption process of information security and privacy standards  by small and medium businesses. The following sections elaborate on specific measures on how SMEs could  be effectively and efficiently supported to cope with the perceived barriers to the standards’ adoption  process.  The proposed recommendations have been grouped in five domains:   Increasing knowledge and engagement: Making SMEs more familiar with the standards that they can  apply, as well as of the benefits they can obtain by implementing them.   Driving adoption and compliance: Providing mechanisms to foster standard adoption by SMEs  through certification and regulatory compliance.   Facilitating implementation: Making standards more easily deployable by SMEs by adapting to their  specific characteristics.   Increasing capabilities: Increasing cybersecurity capabilities in SMEs in order to make them ready for  standard adoption.   Fostering cooperation: Creating a common strategy among stakeholders towards a global strategy  for improving information security and privacy standardization for SMEs.  Recommendations are targeted at EU and MS public administrations; international or European SDOs;  professional, industry and small business associations, and future interested parties; such as insurance  companies. They identify areas where standards can be further improved and develop adequate strategies  and instruments that could be introduced to support SMEs in the adoption of standards in these fields.  Table 1 Recommendations to increase the level information security and privacy adoption in SMEs  Increasing knowledge  and engagement   Developing information security and privacy standards catalogues   Raising general awareness on the benefits of adopting standards   Increasing SME participation in the development and review process  Driving adoption and  compliance   Defining certification schemes   Promoting regulatory compliance through standard adoption  Facilitating  implementation   Creating standards specifically targeting SMEs   Developing implementation guidelines   Implementing a phased approach during the adoption process   Promoting security and privacy by design  Increasing capabilities  Creating ownership of the information security function   Providing support for standard adoption  Fostering cooperation  Promoting international, European and national collaboration  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  22  Increasing knowledge and engagement  Developing information security and privacy standards catalogues   EU Institutions and Member States should develop centralized catalogues with  extended information of existing information security and privacy standards  that are scalable for, and applicable by, SMEs.   Standards catalogues should include information on existing certification  schemes and auditing processes for each identified standard.  As a prerequisite to increase adoption, SMEs should be well informed about the published information  security and privacy standards along with all the relevant details and accompanying information (e.g. how to  reach them, what are the primary benefits and objectives, what are the specific implementation  requirements etc.). SMEs should be able to reach the appropriate level of knowledge of existing standards  and to perform an analysis and conclude on the standards that are most relevant to them.  To facilitate this process for SMEs, the development of centralised catalogues/inventories of all published  information security and privacy standards that are scalable for, and applicable by, SMEs would be very  beneficial. These catalogues, at an EU or Member State level, would serve as a point of reference with the  objective to assist SMEs to identify standards and clearly describe compliance requirements, facilitating the  early steps of the adoption process.  The catalogues should be comprehensive, including all relevant available standards at international,  European or industry level that are scalable for SMEs, and explicative, featuring a high level description of  the specific security and privacy requirements that must be implemented to comply with the specific  standards. In addition, the inventories should depict areas of overlaps and dependencies between the several  standards in order for the SMEs to identify how standards are complementary and interconnected.  Moreover, an added value to catalogues would be to include information about the certification and auditing  process that can be undertaken to prove compliance with the each specific standard (e.g. more accessible  information about accredited organisations that provide certification services, how to find them, what  services they provide, etc.).  Raising general awareness on the benefits of adopting standards   Public and private information security awareness organizations at all EU levels  should create specific campaigns targeting SMEs on how information security  and privacy standards can help them protect their core businesses.   All stakeholders in the information security domain should collaborate to find  effective ways to reach SMEs, especially at the management level.  General awareness, and specific engagement at the management level of SMEs, should be further enhanced  in order to ensure the successful buy-in of the standards adoption process. SMEs should have access to  substantiated information both on (a) the risks and the potential impact as a result of security incidents (e.g.  negative affect of consumers’ trust, damage of reputation, loss of revenue, financial penalties, loss of  competitive advantage etc.) and (b) the benefits and the business value of standards for their organisation.  Only that way SMEs will integrate the real value of adopting an information security and privacy standard for  their business. The security and privacy culture must be enforced with a top down approach within the  organisation.  Public administrations in Member States, International or European SDOs, professional, industry and small  business associations, such as National Chambers of Commerce, can assist in that particular direction by  planning, organising and delivering appropriate awareness initiatives and campaigns with regards to benefits  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  23  of information security and privacy standards, targeting directly SMEs. The main objective of the initiatives  should be to strengthen the confidence of SMEs to take up implementation of standards and make them  aware of the real business value and benefits. These activities should have defined clear vision and objectives,  effective communication plans and measurable metrics in order to assess effectiveness of the program.  Moreover, campaigns should be conducted over an extended amount of time, on a regular basis and focus  primarily on the executive level of SMEs.  Fulfilment of the awareness gap is a real challenge. The SME universe is large, heterogeneous and not always  easy to approach through a single channel. Awareness and engagement cannot be resolved by one single  entity, it must be an industry-wide collaboration. As such, more interaction and collaboration among the  aforementioned organisations, and especially among the small business and sectorial associations, is  considered as prerequisite in order to ensure the success of the campaigns.  Increasing SME participation in the development and review process   Standards development organizations publishing information security  standards should promote the participation in the development process of  SMEs from a variety of sectors.   Small businesses associations should be engaged as an effective broker to  include SMEs needs in the standard development process.  Although SMEs are currently actively involved in the standard development process in European SDO’s (for  example, a quarter of ETSI members are SMEs17), their representation is mostly comprised of SMEs in the ICT  sector. Information technology SMEs constitute a particular case among SMEs, as they are much more aware  of the importance of information security and how it relates to their business needs.  In order to have a broader view of the SME specific environment, SMEs from other sectors should be  incentivized to have a more active role in the design and development phases of the standards. A possible  method to increase involvement is to encourage SMEs to participate in the standards’ review process to  provide their feedback and comments, bringing that way together key stakeholders from SME sectors around  EU, to reach a common and unified approach.  Finally, as individual SMEs may be difficult to engage directly, due to their limited resources, a viable  alternative would be to promote the involvement of small businesses associations, which are well aware of  the specificities of SMEs, in these activities. This way there will be an alignment between the particular  business needs of the SMEs and the objectives of the standards.  Driving adoption and compliance  Defining certification schemes   EU governments and information security organizations should promote the  development of certification schemes targeted for SMEs to boost information  security and privacy standard adoption.   SMEs certification schemes should incorporate maturity ratings and different  levels of certification.  17 ETSI SMEs portal: http://www.etsi.org/about/who-we-are/smes  http://www.etsi.org/about/who-we-are/smes  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  24  An effective method to recognize efforts in adoption of information security and privacy standards in SMEs  would be the development of third party certification schemes for SMEs, with assessment and certification  activities performed by accredited external certification bodies. The schemes should incorporate the  requirements of the SME specific standard(s) and provide different levels of assessment and certification  based on the phases of the adoption process that characterizes each standard. Moreover, the introduction  of maturity ratings in the certification scheme could further assist organizations to identify the exact  compliance level they like to achieve, drive adoption of next certification levels and provide to their  customers and other stakeholders confidence and transparency on the organization’s information security  management.  Such certification schemes could follow the European common framework for accreditation under EC  Regulation 765/200818, applied already in the ISO 27001 certification scheme19, or could be based on an  industry led framework, such as the Cloud Security Alliance STAR certification20 for security assurance in the  cloud. These schemes could evolve to a competitive differentiator for SMEs and drive rapid adoption of the  standard within the next years. Finally, it is important that the total cost of certification process should be  affordable to SMEs.  Some steps in this direction have already been taken at a Member State level. For example, the Cyber  Essentials Scheme21, developed by the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, is a framework  targeted at SMEs. The document “Cyber Essential Scheme: Requirements for basic technical protection from  cyber-attacks”22 provides a set of technology focused requirements, using a simplified language, that can be  applied by small organizations, focusing on five domains (boundary firewalls and internet gateways, secure  configuration, access control, malware protection and patch management). The scheme offers two levels or  certification, cyber essentials and cyber essentials plus, which support the phased approach as a mean to  facilitate compliance.  Promoting regulatory compliance through standard adoption   EU public administrations should promote the establishment of voluntary  reference standards that presume conformity with regulations in the area of  information security and privacy.   EU public administrations should assess enforcing standard compliance for  contracts related to their information supply chain or to personal data  handling.  In order to foster adoption, SMEs covering specific criteria (e.g. operating in specific markets, providing  certain information products and services, storing, processing or transferring customer personal information)  18 Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the  requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and repealing  Regulation (EEC) No 339/93 (Text with EEA relevance). http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:l33248  19 ISO 27001 information security management standard. http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-  standards/iso27001.htm  20 Cloud Security Alliance STAR certification. https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/  21 Cyber Essentials Scheme. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-essentials-scheme-overview  22 Cyber Essentials Scheme - Requirements for basic technical protection from cyber-attacks.  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/317481/Cyber_Essentials_Requi rements.pdf  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=celex:32008R0765 http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso27001.htm http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso27001.htm https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/ https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-essentials-scheme-overview https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/317481/Cyber_Essentials_Requirements.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/317481/Cyber_Essentials_Requirements.pdf  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  25  could be driven to voluntary comply and be certified against specific information security and privacy  standards, as a method to proactively demonstrate regulatory compliance. This would create, as a secondary  effect, confidence to customers, key stakeholders and other interested parties that their information assets  and the information that the SMEs manage on their behalf is adequately protected.  An approach to drive this adoption would be to promote the establishment of voluntary reference standards.  Adoption of reference standards is not compulsory for organizations, but compliance is presumed when  conformity with the reference standard is met. This model poses benefits for all interested stakeholders.  From a regulator point of view, it provides flexibility with regards to setting technical requirements that might  be too detailed or dynamic to fit in the regulatory lifecycle. Furthermore, it facilitates achieving  harmonization in the market and facilitates compliance. From the perspective of the organization adopting  the standard, it greatly helps to increase customer confidence by demonstrating proactive compliance with  the existing regulatory framework. An example of this approach can be observed in Regulation (EU)  No 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market23.  The proposed EU General Data Protection Regulation24, foresees as well the possibility of establishing  voluntary certification mechanisms to help data subjects to quickly assess the level of data protection of  relevant products and services. Although the details regarding how this certification scheme will be  implemented and which standards will be used to assess compliance are not yet determined, this provision  is expected to foster adoption of personal data protection standards by EU organizations. Indeed, proving  compliance will be advantageous for an organization because of the growing concern among European users  of how their personal data are handled, and furthermore because of the reputation for the European data  protection regulatory framework to be one of the strictest and most advanced globally.  Another possible model to drive adoption is by enforcing compliance for certain contracts with the public  administration, as is the case for the UK Cyber Essentials Scheme. The UK Government (through its  “Procurement Policy Notice on the use of Cyber Essentials Scheme certification”25) encourages achieving this  certification for Central Government contracts that involve handling of personal data and provision of certain  IT products and services. Although a Cyber Essentials certification is not compulsory for organizations,  providers will need to prove by a third party assessment that they meet the information security  requirements set in the scheme, making conformance with the scheme the most effective way to prove  compliance.  23 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the  internal market.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  24 Proposal for a Regulation on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on  the free movement of such data.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52012PC0011  25 UK Cyber Essentials Scheme Procurement Policy.  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/368247/Cyber_Essentials_Sche me_draft_PPN_28_10.pdf  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52012PC0011  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  26  Facilitating implementation  Creating standards specifically targeting SMEs   Standards developing organizations should consider creating security and privacy  standards targeting specifically SMEs.   Security awareness organizations should develop recommendations on security  practices that can be easily applied by SMEs.   A further step in the development of standards for SMEs should be to take into  account specific requirements for different business sectors.  A critical recommendation to facilitate the adoption process is to design and develop specific standards that  meet the needs and capabilities of SMEs. These standards should be oriented and be applicable to SMEs  through the incorporation of their specific requirements; thus imposing lower financial and non-financial  adoption costs. Standards that are specifically developed for SMEs are generally expected to have a greater  adoption rate by the SME community.  The scheme of the existing standards should be reengineered in order to ensure that the proposed process  can be mapped to those of an average SME. Critical areas of existing standards, where more in depth  explanation is required, should be identified and further elaborated. Specifications from existing standards  should be analysed and modified appropriately in order to be applicable to the organisation of the SME  community. Security requirements on these standards could be more straightforward and structured (e.g.  like SANS top 20 critical security controls26). Furthermore, the new standards should take into consideration  the organisational structure and characteristics of SMEs (e.g. most of the actions and activities are conducted  by a limited number of human resources).  Finally, since the SME sector is encompassed by various organisations with many specificities, different  business needs and priorities, as well as various legal, regulatory and contractual security and privacy  requirements (e.g. size, industry), a further step in this direction could be taken by classifying SMEs and  developing standards targeted for each specific category to accommodate diversity.  Generalised security and privacy profiles (e.g. business needs, size, industry, etc.) could be defined to enable  SMEs to roughly match themselves to a profile in order to get an indication of the security requirements that  they should implement. Since the SME sector is composed by diverse entities, organisations could be  classified and assigned to one or several specific profiles.  Developing implementation guidelines   Standards development and information security awareness organizations  should develop easy to follow implementation guidelines.   Business associations should consider creating programs to enhance  information security capabilities with advice for SMEs on how to implement  standards.   Guidelines should focus on the initial stages of implementation, especially on  customised scoping.  Current information security and privacy standards are perceived as complex for SMEs to implement,  especially for small enterprises, and additional external guidance would be beneficial. A helpful support  action would be the development, by International or European SDOs, or professional and industry  26 SANS top 20 critical security controls. https://www.sans.org/critical-security-controls/  https://www.sans.org/critical-security-controls/  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  27  associations, of clear, structured and easy to use implementation guidelines and best practices handbooks  with realistic and concrete examples using simple terms and easily translatable language.  The main objective of these documents would be to enable SME personnel with general ICT knowledge and  skills to understand the specific activities and tasks that must be conducted in order to achieve compliance  with each security and privacy requirement of the standards. It is essential that these sources provide  reliable, up-to-date and detailed information to guide SMEs to implement the requirements step by step.  Moreover, implementation guidelines should also encompass information with regards to exact security  processes and procedures that must be in place to ensure adequate security safeguards (e.g. awareness, log  monitoring, vulnerability management etc.). These guidelines should contemplate both internalized and  outsourced ICT services models, providing advice to increase governance of ICT security in outsourced  models.  Special emphasis and attention should be given to the initial scoping and planning phases of the adoption  process. Although most standards are flexible, usually SMEs face some difficulties to appropriately customise  the standards based on their business needs and the applicable legal, regulatory and contractual  requirements. As such, further guidance should also be provided on how to identify the exact range of the  scope during the implementation of the standards as well as how to get the most out of the flexibility that  standards provide. SMEs should be assisted in the customisation and interpretation of the standards to the  point that they are economically, technically and financially relevant to their business.  Small Businesses Associations are well positioned to provide SMEs with advice and assistance towards  adopting and implementation standards. With this objective, stakeholders in information security area, such  as governments and information security industry entities, should support small business associations in the  development of more information security and privacy capabilities and expertise.  As an example, the French national information security agency (ANSSI) in partnership with the general  confederation of small and medium enterprises (Confédération Générale du patronat des Petites et  Moyennes Entreprises - CGMP), has published a reference guide of 12 good information security practices  (Guide des bonnes pratiques de l'informatique27). The guide is written in easy to understand language and  includes examples and clear implementation guidelines.  Implementing a phased approach during the adoption process   SMEs should perform an information security risk assessment before engaging in  the adoption of specific security and privacy standards.   Standards applicable by SMEs should incorporate maturity levels with different sets  of requirements to facilitate a phased implementation.  Recommending the implementation of a phased approach during the implementation of information  securityand privacy standards can facilitate adoption. As an initial step, it is critical for SMEs to perform a risk  analysis and assessment process prior to engaging in the adoption of any standard. Only upon completion of  risk assessment activities and determination of the organisation’s risk environment, SMEs should be in the  position to develop their own security strategy, define the exact scope of standardisation and conclude on  the most suitable and appropriate standards that should be implemented in order to effective mitigate  identified risks.  A phased approached could be enforced by incorporating a maturity rating scale in the standards. Standards  could have specific maturity levels defined for each profile. Each maturity level would have certain security  27 Guide CGPME: les bonnes pratiques de l'informatique. http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/guide/guide-des-bonnes-  pratiques-de-linformatique/  http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/guide/guide-des-bonnes-pratiques-de-linformatique/ http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/guide/guide-des-bonnes-pratiques-de-linformatique/  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  28  and privacy requirements (ranging from the easiest to the most difficult as the level increases) that should  be implemented in order to reach the specific level, be certified and advance to the next one. The first level  should only cover basic controls and quick wins that are easy for SMEs to implement and, therefore, comply  with in order to add a layer of protection to their information assets.  As the maturity level increase the safeguards would become more advanced, sophisticated and hence  difficult to implement and maintain compliance with. The maturity rating scale would assist SMEs to  comprehend their current maturity level in terms of information security and privacy capabilities, address  gaps with the standards and develop a roadmap to reach desired levels. Finally, in order for SMEs to be able  to monitor deployment effectiveness and efficiency, identify gaps and encourage controls improvement,  specific metrics should also be defined for each maturity level.  Promoting security and privacy by design   SMEs should be encouraged to implement security by default configurations to  facilitate later standard adoption.   Software vendors should implement security and privacy default configurations  in products targeting small organizations.  One of the key factors for facilitating the adoption process of standards is to focus on the information security  and privacy from the beginning of an information system design model. SMEs can adopt the security by  design approach as they setup, configure and implement their corporate infrastructures, information  systems and networks. Specific guidelines should be developed indicating and accommodating the means by  which secure architecture can be taken into consideration during the early stages of an SME establishment.  Overall, integrating information security and privacy principles and controls in the early stages of  implementation can create efficiencies and make compliance with standards much easier in the future  phases. As such, organisations across the SME sector will be able to achieve a consistent and common  security maturity level through the implementation of basic security and privacy safeguards that adequately  protect corporate and customers’ information assets, prevent a large percentage of cyber-attacks and overall  lower information security and privacy risks.  To support SMEs, software vendors should be encouraged to provide products targeted to small  organizations that offer appropriate default security configurations, facilitating the installation and  maintenance process for staff with general information knowledge. Although most software products  available nowadays in the market come with the possibility to establish granularity in the security features  that can be configured, interfaces and options may be difficult to understand for non-specialized staff. For  SMEs that outsource their ICT services, clear guidelines on security aspects to consider of contracting third  party services would be very helpful.  In the case of privacy, further steps should be taken by software vendors to provide systems that ensure that  customer information is protected with a sufficient level of granularity. Privacy controls, aligned with  European regulations, are still not fully translatable in all available software products targeting small  organizations.  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  29  Increasing capabilities  Creating ownership of the information security function   SMEs should be encouraged to designate an Information Security Officer to  ensure ownership of the information security and data protection  functions.   Member States should create professional training programs to provide  foundation training for Information Security Officers.  SMEs should be encouraged to assign a specific role to a resource that will carry out the security  responsibilities required to protect the critical business information assets, emphasising more on the  organisational and procedural aspects of information security and privacy. Even if this resource has only part  time dedication, and regardless on whether the ICT services are assumed internally or externally, the  allocation of responsibility to a specific employee of the organization is an effective way to ensure ownership  of the information security functions.  The information security officer should be responsible of designing and implementing a strategy that is  aligned with corporate goals and objectives. He/she should also be responsible for managing all security- related interactions within the organisation, as well as those external to the organisation, such as providers  of ICT services. As information security officer, he/she must also ensure that appropriate procedural,  technical and physical security controls are in place, directly or through appropriate contracts and SLAs.  Finally, he/she should have adequate information security skills and expertise to comprehend and enact the  guidance that standards require.  Member States should promote the creation of professional training programs on information security and  privacy principles for employees that will take up this role in small organizations. Taking into consideration  that these individuals do not necessarily have extensive technical or legal foundation on the area, and their  dedication will be on a part time basis, these programs should be designed for security and data protection  officers to understand the risks, principles and rationale behind the existing and proposed security measures.  Providing support for standards adoption   Public administrations at all EU levels should provide incentives to SMEs to adopt  security and privacy standards.   Public and private organizations in the area of professional training should develop  programs to enhance information security skills of SME staff.  SMEs could be assisted in order to overcome the obstacle of financial cost in implementing standards and  achieving certifications. Economic incentives can be provided with programs directly managed by public  administrations at the EU and member state level and/or through professional, industry and small business  associations at a national level. These incentives may include, but not limited to:   Reduced cost/free direct access to standards for SMEs.   Funding (e.g. credits, grants, subsidies or tax incentives) associated to standard adoption and third  party certification.   Affordable access for SMEs to professional training on information security standard  implementation.  Among the above, it is critical to provide incentives for training SME personnel on information security and  privacy in order to further develop their skills and therefore the overall cybersecurity capacity of the  organization. These initiatives may include well organised seminars, trainings, hands-on labs, workshops that  are delivered by several different delivery methods such as live or virtual, classroom-style, guided study, etc.  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  30  Fostering cooperation  Promoting international, European and national collaboration   International, European and national SDOs, as well as industry associations,  should work together towards developing a harmonized plan to create  information security and privacy standards specifically designed for SMEs.  Strong, clear and flexible international cooperation and collaboration between extended communities of  cyber security stakeholders is required in order to drive and foster adoption of standardization for the SME  sector. This entails efforts at the national, European and international level. European and international SDOs  should work together with SME professional and industry associations in order to develop an effective and  concrete plan as well as a harmonized approach towards creating and driving adoption of standards  specifically designed for SMEs.  A European wide approach in this field to ensure harmonization can be positive for the advancement of the  Digital Single Market28. European SMEs should be able to adopt European information and privacy standards  that are easily recognized throughout Europe by their potential customers. Furthermore, standards that  prove compliance with European regulations, especially in the area of data protection, can be perceived by  EU costumers a proactive way to enhance their trust. Additionally, further emphasis should be given to  engage business, professional and industry associations in this cooperation for standardization, to ensure  that the exchange of relevant information on topics related to information security and privacy  standardization takes into consideration the specific needs of the SME community.  28 European Comission 10 priorities: Digital Single Market: http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/  Information security and privacy standards for SMEs  December 2015  31  Annex A: Existing information Security and Privacy Standards for  SMEs  In order to understand the availability of information security and privacy standards that can be applied by  SMEs, the study gathered and analysed information regarding existing standards in these areas. For this  purpose, a desk research was conducted in order to identify what specific published standards are related  to information security and privacy and can be adopted by SMEs. The main sources for research were:   International or European SDOs, professional associations, industry associations etc.   Specific standards targeting SMEs.   Standards for codes of practices, for securing business processes, for procuring secure products,  for regulatory compliance etc.  The outcome of the research is the following list of well-known information security and privacy standards  that are categorised in terms of:   The context of each standard (i.e. risk management, privacy, business continuity etc.).   The industry each standard refers to (i.e. health, financial services etc.).

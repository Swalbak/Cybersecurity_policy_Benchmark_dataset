This online EU-wide survey on the topic of ICT Security Certification has been singled out as a suitable  instrument to consult with stakeholders and seek structured feedback against the currently envisaged  policy options. On the background, in April 2017 the Commission presented a set of tentative policy  approaches as follows:   Option 0 - Do nothing: No EU policy initiative or action – baseline scenario   Option 1 - Soft law approach: Commission to encourage and support national or industry initiatives   Option 2 - Extension of SOGIS agreement: Legislative proposal making MS participation to the  SOG-IS agreement mandatory   Option 3 - European certification framework: EU-wide framework with its own scope, functioning  and governance rules  This survey has been broadly publicised, albeit within the confined boundaries of the certification  stakeholders’ community, along with a number of prospective respondents from competent Member State  agencies, vendors, manufacturers and consumer associations that were all invited to participate. The  survey was structured across five main thematic pillars, namely i) current situation and open issues, ii)  future evolution, iii) sectors and technologies, iv) policy options and envisioned features and v) roles and  competencies for the policy stakeholders.  Survey respondents reflected and responded on the need to design and deploy ICT security certification at  the EU level as the current ICT security certification landscape incommodes mutual recognition across  Member States.  The aspects of costs, duration, transparency and support during the lifecycle of a  product’s certification were also highlighted as present barriers featured in the current landscape, along  with  different security baselines and levels of assurance concerning the criticality or the impact of each  sector, such as Internet of Things and Industrial Control Systems. To meet the expectation of reducing  internal market fragmentation and improving trust in the security of ICT products and services in the EU,  the respondents were mostly in favour of a general European certification general framework.  Following the analysis of the responses it has become clear that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to  certification and labelling. The respondents agreed that the processes and tools used for security  certification should be improved to ensure the required flexibility to adapt to different market situations,  particularly by allowing different level of assurances according to market needs.  For high assurance  sectors SOG-IS MRA was perceived as a suitable paradigm to build upon and create a platform to consult  further among participants while for lower assurance sectors, self-certification could complement the  overall framework.  Overall, any procedures implemented need to mitigate risk and allow for forthcoming technologies to take  root in the EU ; the prevailing approach should be supported  by an adequate amount of resources, in  order to ensure appropriate coordination and support, at the level of EU Institutions and Bodies, notably at  the level of the EUROPEAN Commission with support from an EU Agency such as ENISA.  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  05  1. Background  Trustworthiness and security of information technology products can be enhanced by putting in place a  certification framework. In the EU, a common scheme would support the recognition of security  certification across Member States, an essential pillar towards achieving trust and security required to  promote the Digital Single Market. The European Commission, has emphasized on the need to develop a  proposal for a European ICT security certification framework as stated in Commissions’ COM(2016) 4101.  ENISA, within the scope of its Programming Document 2017-20192, has continued supporting the  European Commission and the Member States in their efforts to identify a way forward on ICT security  products  certification, which on one hand seeks to boost competition and on the other to promote mutual  recognition or harmonisation of certification practices up to a certain level. The Agency, has engaged in a  number of activities in pursuit of this goal. This online EU-wide survey on the topic of ICT Security  Certification has been deemed being a suitable instrument to consult with stakeholders and seek  structured feedback against set policy options. On the background, in April 20173 the Commission  presented a set of tentative policy approaches as follows:   Option 0 - Do nothing: No EU policy initiative or action – baseline scenario   Option 1 - Soft law approach: Commission to encourage and support national or industry initiatives   Option 2 - Extension of SOGIS agreement: Legislative proposal making MS participation to the  SOG-IS agreement mandatory   Option 3 - European certification framework: EU-wide framework with its own scope, functioning  and governance rules  These four options have been reflected in the survey.  With this survey ENISA and the European Commission have aimed to actively consult with industry  representatives and experts from Member States on the subject-matter area, complementing the  outcomes and findings of studies and consultation workshops organized. This survey serves the purpose of  consulting with stakeholders to come up with an approach that serves the interests of the bulk of  stakeholders across the EU.  While quantitative research aims to quantifying attitudes, opinions or other defined variables in order to  generalize input from a sample population, while qualitative research is focused on explaining the reasons,  the opinions, and the options ofa sample population ’s behavior. This report relies on a combination of  both research strategies was followed and a self-completion questionnaire was used to support the survey  outcomes.  The survey comprises 14 closed questions, the majority of which are based on multiple choice questions;  the participants were also asked to provide comments and feedback in relation to ICT security certification  on open-ended subquestions. This survey was carried outin Q2 2017.  1 https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-410-EN-F1-1.PDF  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-programming-document-2017-2019  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/ict-security-certification-april-2017/workshop-on-a-european-ict-security- certification-framework  https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-410-EN-F1-1.PDF https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-programming-document-2017-2019 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/ict-security-certification-april-2017/workshop-on-a-european-ict-security-certification-framework https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/ict-security-certification-april-2017/workshop-on-a-european-ict-security-certification-framework  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  06  2. Analysis of results  This survey has been broadly publicised, albeit within the boundaries of the certification stakeholders’  community, and a number of prospective respondents was invited to join and respond; specifically  invitations to respond were sent to 28 agencies from Member States, 24 vendors and manufacturers from  the private sector, and 4 consumer associations.  The questions presented to the respondents are available under Annex A. To facilitate the presentation of  the results the survey questions have been grouped across five thematic areas, namely:   Current Situation and open issues are covered by questions 2, 3 and 4   Future evolution are covered by questions 5 and 6   Sectors and technologies are covered by questions 7 and 8   Policy Options and envisioned features are covered by questions 9 through to 13   Roles and competencies for the policy stakeholders are covered by question 14  The full set of questions can be found in Annex A and the question with the responses given in Annex B. In  total 33 participants provided full responses; the following tables  display the survey results that derived  from the number of responses collected for each answer option per question. A concise overview of the  respondents’ composition is presented hereinafter:  Figure 1: Respondents’ composition  43%  27%  9%  0% 3%  18% National authority / Agency  Manufacturer / provider of ICT of ICT products and services  User / Customer / Consumer of ICT products and services  Manufacturer of testing equipment  Security certification laboratory  Other (Please specify)  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  07  TYPE OF ORGANISATION RESPONSES  National authority / Agency 14  Manufacturer / provider of ICT of ICT products (both hardware and software) and services 9  User / Customer / Consumer of ICT products (both hardware and software) and services 3  Manufacturer of testing equipment 0  Security certification laboratory 1  Other (Please specify) 6  Table 1: Type of organisation  Current Situation in ICT Security Certification  All survey participants agreed on the need to design and deploy ICT security certification, although some  suggested that it should be limited to the Member States’ or to the industry sectorial level concerned. All  respondents agreed on the need to leverage on certification to mitigate cybersecurity risks. The majority of  the participants (57,5%) is aware of multiple existing ICT security certification schemes across EU Member  States for the same product or service and they provided examples thereto.  AWARENESS OF THE EXISTENCE OF MULTIPLE ICT SECURITY CERTIFICATION  SCHEMES ACROSS EU MEMBER STATES FOR THE SAME PRODUCT/SERVICE  RESPONSES  Yes 19  No 12  Don’t know  2  Table 2: Multiple ICT security certification schemes across EU Member States for the same product/service  Some of the examples provided by the respondents include the following:   National ICT Security Certification Schemes,   SOG-IS MRA   Certification against International Standards   Sector specific certification schemes   Market driven certification schemes  A smaller percentage (36,3%) of the respondents suggest that they were not aware of multiple ICT security  schemes across EU, but they expressed their preparedness to accept one; at least, the survey reveals,  these respondents have acknowledged the need to have ICT security certification schemes at large.  Examples provided by the respondents include:   Privacy and Personal Data protection  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  08   IoT   Industrial Control Systems   Telecom,   Health   Aerospace   Cloud security   ICT products and services  When dealing with ICT security certification procedures, the respondents indicated that the main problems  they encounter are the following:   Costs (mentioned by 72,7% of respondents)   Duration of the process (supported by 57,5% of respondents)   Lack of mutual recognition of certificates across Member States (supported by 51,5% of respondents)   Lack of a dedicated scheme to cyber -certify a specific product/service (supported by 45,4% of  respondents)   Lack of certification support for the lifecycle of the product (e.g., incremental certification for software  and hardware changes/updates) (supported by 39,3% of respondents)   Lack of transparency in the certification process (supported by 36,3% of respondents)  PROBLEMS WHEN DEALING WITH ICT SECURITY CERTIFICATION PROCEDURES  TOTAL  RESPONSES  Lack of mutual recognition of certificates across Member States 17  Cost 24  Duration of the process 19  Lack of transparency 12  Lack of a dedicated scheme to cyber-certify a specific product/service 15  Lack of certification support for the lifecycle of the product 13  Table 3 : Problems when dealing with ICT security certification procedures  Future Evolution of ICT security certification across EU  Almost all respondents, 90,9%, agreed that mutual recognition of ICT security certification schemes is  desirable at European level. There was 81,8% of the respondents who agreed also that certification and  labelling can be effective tools to increase transparency about the level of security assurances of ICT  products/services, and enhance trust across the Digital Single Market. However, it was noted that a  ranking of assurance levels with clear information is required as oversimplifying could introduce additional  risks. In addition, certification and labelling should denote only baseline security requirements and should  not deferment innovation or increase complexity.  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  09  NEED FOR A MUTUAL ICT SECURITY RECOGNITION MECHANISM OF CERTIFICATES  ACROSS ALL MS  RESPONSES  The current situation is satisfactory 1  Mutual recognition is desirable at European level 30  The current situation is satisfactory; mutual recognition is desirable at European level 2  Don't know 0  Table 4 : Need for a mutual ICT recognition mechanism of certificates across all Member Statess  CERTIFICATION AND LABELLING CAN BE EFFECTIVE TOOLS TO INCREASE  TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THE LEVEL OF SECURITY ASSURANCES OF ICT  PRODUCTS/SERVICES, AND ENHANCE TRUST ACROSS THE DIGITAL SINGLE MARKET.  RESPONSES  Agree 27  Disagree 6  Don’t know 0  Table 5 : Certification and labeling ars effective tools to increase transparency  The need for greater efforts to promote ICT security certification was highlighted by 66,6% of the  respondents who made specific reference to industry sectors while 21,2% stated that ICT security  certification is a pure market issue and there is no need for additional support.  RECOURSES TO CERTIFICATION AND LABELLING IN THE ICT SECTOR ARE  SUFFICIENTLY WIDESPREAD OR GREATER EFFORT IS NEEDED TO PROMOTE ICT  SECURITY CERTIFICATION IN SPECIFIC SECTORS  RESPONSES  This is a pure market issue and there is no need for additional support 7  No, greater efforts are required in specific sector 22  Don’t know 4  Table 6: Promotion of ICT security certification in specific sectors  Sectors and Technologies  The majority of the respondents (75,7%) identified the need for ICT security and labelling in the Internet of  Things-domain, due to the imminent ubiquity of IoT, issues of vulnerabilities and the required  interoperability across different platforms.  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  10  NEED FOR ICT SECURITY CERTIFICATION AND LABELLING IN THE INTERNET OF  THINGS DOMAIN  RESPONSES  Yes 25  No 6  Don’t know 2  Table 7: Need for ICT security and labelling in the Internet of Things domain  Similarly, 66,6% of the respondents, identified the need for ICT security certification in the Industrial  Control System (ICS)-domain, due to the criticality of processes they support and the level of cyber threats  they are exposed to.  NEED FOR ICT SECURITY CERTIFICATION IN THE INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEM (ICS)- DOMAIN  RESPONSES  Yes 22  No 7  Don’t know 4  Table 8: Need for ICT security and labelling in the Industrial Control System (ICS) domain  Policy Options and Envisioned Features  To reach the objective of reducing internal market fragmentation and improving trust in the security of ICT  products and services in the EU, 33,3% of the respondents opted for creating a European certification  general framework, laying down the essential rules for mutual recognition of certificates issued in  accordance with the framework. The “Soft law approach\", encouraging, supporting and to the extent  possible coordinating the adoption and use of certification initiatives at European level was supported only  by 18,1% while 12,1% of the respondents were in favour of extending the SOG-IS MRA to all Member  States and make it mandatory. Lastly, 12,1% opted for regulating the security of I CT products and services  and specify essential security requirements for such products to be placed on the market. The remaining  respondents indicated that a mixed approach, from all the aforementioned options, should be the  preferred path of action instead.  They argued that mutual recognition of existing certification schemes  and labelling programs can promote a robust Digital Single Market and support EU digital economy while  an entirely new certification framework would not scale with the dynamicsecurity landscape.  ACTIONS FOR REDUCING INTERNAL MARKET FRAGMENTATION AND IMPROVING  TRUST IN THE SECURITY OF ICT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN THE EU  RESPONSES  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  11  \"Soft law approach\", encouraging, supporting and to the extent possible coordinating  the adoption and use of certification initiatives at European level  6  Extending the SOG-IS MRA to all Member States: legislative proposal making MS  participation to the SOGIS agreement mandatory  4  Creating a European certification general framework, laying down the essential rules  for mutual recognition of certificates issued in accordance with the framework  11  Regulating the security of ICT products and services, specifying essential security  requirements for such products to be placed on the market  4  None of the above  8  Table 9: Possible options for reducing internal market fragmentation and improving trust  In all, 45,4% of the respondents were in favour of exploiting the current SOG-IS MRA as the basis to build  an EU-wide certification framework, while 21,2% stated otherwise and 33,3% did not answer either  positive or negative on the role of SOG-IS MRA.  SOG-IS MRA COULD BE A BASIS TO BUILD AN EU-WIDE CERTIFICATION FRAMEWORK RESPONSES  Yes 15  No 7  Don’t know 11  Table 10: SOG-IS MRA role within an EU-wide certification framework  On self-certification schemes, 66,6% of the respondents agreed that these schemes could present a viable  option to boost the level of cyber-security for selected product’ domains, especially for low assurance level  products and should be considered as an integral part of the future EU certification framework, drawing  also experience from existing market driven  initiatives. Nevertheless, 24,2% of the respondents disagree  that self-certification should be considered, as it does not provide for any assurance, there is no control  and it is not sufficient unless there is a third party validating conformance.  SELF-CERTIFICATION SCHEMES COULD BE CONSIDERED A VIABLE OPTION TO BOOST  THE LEVEL OF CYBER-SECURITY FOR SELECTED PRODUCT’ DOMAINS  RESPONSES  Yes 22  No 8  Don’t know 3  Table 11: Self-certification schemes  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  12  The overwhelming majority of the respondents, i.e. 90,9%, indicated that the processes and tools used for  security certification should be improved to ensure the required flexibility by allowing different level of  assurance.  PROCESSES AND TOOLS USED FOR SECURITY CERTIFICATION SHOULD BE IMPROVED  TO ENSURE THE REQUIRED FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT TO DIFFERENT MARKET  SITUATIONS, PARTICULARLY BY ALLOWING DIFFERENT LEVEL OF ASSURANCES  ACCORDING TO MARKET NEEDS  RESPONSES  Yes 30  No 1  Don’t know 2  Table 12: Flexibility to allow different assurance levels  Introducing a common label across the EU was accepted by 66,6% of the respondents.  Such a label would  indicate that the products have been certified within a certification scheme in accordance with EU rules  and provide visual notice that product’s features comply with specific requirements. Nevertheless, the  respondents who were not in favour of a common label, proposed a specific sectoral labelling (e.g. SOGIS)  or consider that it could be difficult for complex systems and/or it could also result in a false sense of  security.  INTRODUCTION OF A COMMON LABEL SIGNALLING CERTIFIED PRODUCTS  RESPONSES  Yes 22  No 8  Don’t know 3  Table 13: Introduction of a common label signalling certified products  Roles and Competencies of Policy Stakeholders  The majority of the respondents, 78,7%, envisage a role for existing European  Commission bodies and  agencies (e.g. JRC, ENISA, ACER) in a possible future EU certification and labelling security framework.  Among the respondents who did not see a role for existing EU Commission's bodies and agencies,  supporting actions such as determining a minimum level of security per category of technology, issuing  voluntary guidelines for both industry and consumers, were envisioned, without identifying key EU bodies  or agencies.  ACTIVE ROLES FOR EXISTING EU COMMISSION'S BODIES AND AGENCIES (E.G. JRC,  ENISA, ACER) IN A POSSIBLE FUTURE CERTIFICATION AND LABELLING FRAMEWORK.  RESPONSES  Yes 26  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  13  No 4  Don’t know 3  Table 14: Roles and Competencies for existing EU Commission's bodies and agencies  Respondents envisaging a role for existing EU Commission's bodies and agencies indicated that:   A central organization at EU level is needed to warrant that a robust system is in place with defined  rules, references and tools. Such a referencecentral organization could also induce recognition by  Member States.   CEN/CENELEC should be involved in a future scheme with the contribution of ENISA to support  technical, organisational and stakeholders’ management tasks.   EU agencies, with respective competences such as ACER and ENISA, could participate in the  development of guidelines, criteria, etc., to be applied in a certification and labelling system, and  promote its adoption across various stakeholders.   JRC and ENISA could serve as a monitoring body to guarantee compliance with the proposed way  forward. ENISA could mandate expert groups with the definition of flexible certification approaches in  respective sectors.   EU bodies could provide administrative support while supporting definition of the scheme, interacting  with EU standardization bodies.  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  14  3. Conclusions  ICT security certification plays an important role in increasing trust and security in products and services  and all survey participants reflected on the necessity to design and deploy ICT security certification at a  European Level. This broad consensus was also prevalent in the consultation workshops organized by  ENISA and the Europen Commission during 2016 as ICT security certification has been regarded as one of  the means to enhance trust across the digital single market. This survey confirms that doing nothing is no  policy option for the EU; pro-activity at the policy level is favoured by respondents who see the European  Commisison as a driver for change and a greater role of the EU in the area of certification of products  meets stakeholder’s expectations.  Currently, the ICT security certification landscape comprises of SOG-IS MRA, national and sectorial  schemes along to internal standards, which incommodes a wide-ranging recognition of certificates across  Member States.  Respondents also highlighted the aspects of costs, duration, transparency and support  during the lifecycle as existing barriers to current setting while highlighting that depending on the criticality  or the impact of each sector, such as Internet of Things and Industrial Control Systems, more attentive  efforts are needed.  To meet the expectation of reducing internal market fragmentation and improving trust in the security of  ICT products and services in the EU, the respondents were mostly in favour of creating a European  certification general framework. Notably a number of respondents were also in favour of extending the  SOG-IS MRA to all Member States or encouraging, and supporting the adoption and use of certification  initiatives at European level.  The respondents agreed that the processes and tools used for security certification should be improved to  ensure the required flexibility to adapt to different market situations, particularly by allowing different  level of assurances according to market needs. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to certification and a  scheme based on labelling, and flexibility is likely to be more permitting of greater transparency in this  area. Any certification scheme needs to appropriately mitigate risk and be commercially oriented to allow  for market forces shape benefit from forthcoming technologies i.e. the security for a handset used for  emergency services should be at a higher standard than consumer devices, and therefore at a higher cost.  For high assurance sectors SOG-IS MRA was perceived as a suitable framework to build upon and set up a  framework to consult further among participants while for lower assurance sectors, self-certification could  complement the overall framework.  Lastly, respondents underlined the importance to allocate adequate resources in order to ensure due  maintenance of such a framework while coordination and support roles were suggested or existing EU  Institutions and Bodies, including the European Commission and an agency like ENISA.

This online EU-wide survey on the topic of ICT Security Certification has been singled out as a suitable  instrument to consult with stakeholders and seek structured feedback against the currently envisaged  policy options. On the background, in April 2017 the Commission presented a set of tentative policy  approaches as follows:   Option 0 - Do nothing: No EU policy initiative or action – baseline scenario   Option 1 - Soft law approach: Commission to encourage and support national or industry initiatives   Option 2 - Extension of SOGIS agreement: Legislative proposal making MS participation to the  SOG-IS agreement mandatory   Option 3 - European certification framework: EU-wide framework with its own scope, functioning  and governance rules  This survey has been broadly publicised, albeit within the confined boundaries of the certification  stakeholders’ community, along with a number of prospective respondents from competent Member State  agencies, vendors, manufacturers and consumer associations that were all invited to participate. The  survey was structured across five main thematic pillars, namely i) current situation and open issues, ii)  future evolution, iii) sectors and technologies, iv) policy options and envisioned features and v) roles and  competencies for the policy stakeholders.  Survey respondents reflected and responded on the need to design and deploy ICT security certification at  the EU level as the current ICT security certification landscape incommodes mutual recognition across  Member States.  The aspects of costs, duration, transparency and support during the lifecycle of a  product’s certification were also highlighted as present barriers featured in the current landscape, along  with  different security baselines and levels of assurance concerning the criticality or the impact of each  sector, such as Internet of Things and Industrial Control Systems. To meet the expectation of reducing  internal market fragmentation and improving trust in the security of ICT products and services in the EU,  the respondents were mostly in favour of a general European certification general framework.  Following the analysis of the responses it has become clear that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to  certification and labelling. The respondents agreed that the processes and tools used for security  certification should be improved to ensure the required flexibility to adapt to different market situations,  particularly by allowing different level of assurances according to market needs.  For high assurance  sectors SOG-IS MRA was perceived as a suitable paradigm to build upon and create a platform to consult  further among participants while for lower assurance sectors, self-certification could complement the  overall framework.  Overall, any procedures implemented need to mitigate risk and allow for forthcoming technologies to take  root in the EU ; the prevailing approach should be supported  by an adequate amount of resources, in  order to ensure appropriate coordination and support, at the level of EU Institutions and Bodies, notably at  the level of the EUROPEAN Commission with support from an EU Agency such as ENISA.  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  05  1. Background  Trustworthiness and security of information technology products can be enhanced by putting in place a  certification framework. In the EU, a common scheme would support the recognition of security  certification across Member States, an essential pillar towards achieving trust and security required to  promote the Digital Single Market. The European Commission, has emphasized on the need to develop a  proposal for a European ICT security certification framework as stated in Commissions’ COM(2016) 4101.  ENISA, within the scope of its Programming Document 2017-20192, has continued supporting the  European Commission and the Member States in their efforts to identify a way forward on ICT security  products  certification, which on one hand seeks to boost competition and on the other to promote mutual  recognition or harmonisation of certification practices up to a certain level. The Agency, has engaged in a  number of activities in pursuit of this goal. This online EU-wide survey on the topic of ICT Security  Certification has been deemed being a suitable instrument to consult with stakeholders and seek  structured feedback against set policy options. On the background, in April 20173 the Commission  presented a set of tentative policy approaches as follows:   Option 0 - Do nothing: No EU policy initiative or action – baseline scenario   Option 1 - Soft law approach: Commission to encourage and support national or industry initiatives   Option 2 - Extension of SOGIS agreement: Legislative proposal making MS participation to the  SOG-IS agreement mandatory   Option 3 - European certification framework: EU-wide framework with its own scope, functioning  and governance rules  These four options have been reflected in the survey.  With this survey ENISA and the European Commission have aimed to actively consult with industry  representatives and experts from Member States on the subject-matter area, complementing the  outcomes and findings of studies and consultation workshops organized. This survey serves the purpose of  consulting with stakeholders to come up with an approach that serves the interests of the bulk of  stakeholders across the EU.  While quantitative research aims to quantifying attitudes, opinions or other defined variables in order to  generalize input from a sample population, while qualitative research is focused on explaining the reasons,  the opinions, and the options ofa sample population ’s behavior. This report relies on a combination of  both research strategies was followed and a self-completion questionnaire was used to support the survey  outcomes.  The survey comprises 14 closed questions, the majority of which are based on multiple choice questions;  the participants were also asked to provide comments and feedback in relation to ICT security certification  on open-ended subquestions. This survey was carried outin Q2 2017.  1 https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-410-EN-F1-1.PDF  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-programming-document-2017-2019  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/ict-security-certification-april-2017/workshop-on-a-european-ict-security- certification-framework  https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-410-EN-F1-1.PDF https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-programming-document-2017-2019 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/ict-security-certification-april-2017/workshop-on-a-european-ict-security-certification-framework https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/ict-security-certification-april-2017/workshop-on-a-european-ict-security-certification-framework  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  06  2. Analysis of results  This survey has been broadly publicised, albeit within the boundaries of the certification stakeholders’  community, and a number of prospective respondents was invited to join and respond; specifically  invitations to respond were sent to 28 agencies from Member States, 24 vendors and manufacturers from  the private sector, and 4 consumer associations.  The questions presented to the respondents are available under Annex A. To facilitate the presentation of  the results the survey questions have been grouped across five thematic areas, namely:   Current Situation and open issues are covered by questions 2, 3 and 4   Future evolution are covered by questions 5 and 6   Sectors and technologies are covered by questions 7 and 8   Policy Options and envisioned features are covered by questions 9 through to 13   Roles and competencies for the policy stakeholders are covered by question 14  The full set of questions can be found in Annex A and the question with the responses given in Annex B. In  total 33 participants provided full responses; the following tables  display the survey results that derived  from the number of responses collected for each answer option per question. A concise overview of the  respondents’ composition is presented hereinafter:  Figure 1: Respondents’ composition  43%  27%  9%  0% 3%  18% National authority / Agency  Manufacturer / provider of ICT of ICT products and services  User / Customer / Consumer of ICT products and services  Manufacturer of testing equipment  Security certification laboratory  Other (Please specify)  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  07  TYPE OF ORGANISATION RESPONSES  National authority / Agency 14  Manufacturer / provider of ICT of ICT products (both hardware and software) and services 9  User / Customer / Consumer of ICT products (both hardware and software) and services 3  Manufacturer of testing equipment 0  Security certification laboratory 1  Other (Please specify) 6  Table 1: Type of organisation  Current Situation in ICT Security Certification  All survey participants agreed on the need to design and deploy ICT security certification, although some  suggested that it should be limited to the Member States’ or to the industry sectorial level concerned. All  respondents agreed on the need to leverage on certification to mitigate cybersecurity risks. The majority of  the participants (57,5%) is aware of multiple existing ICT security certification schemes across EU Member  States for the same product or service and they provided examples thereto.  AWARENESS OF THE EXISTENCE OF MULTIPLE ICT SECURITY CERTIFICATION  SCHEMES ACROSS EU MEMBER STATES FOR THE SAME PRODUCT/SERVICE  RESPONSES  Yes 19  No 12  Don’t know  2  Table 2: Multiple ICT security certification schemes across EU Member States for the same product/service  Some of the examples provided by the respondents include the following:   National ICT Security Certification Schemes,   SOG-IS MRA   Certification against International Standards   Sector specific certification schemes   Market driven certification schemes  A smaller percentage (36,3%) of the respondents suggest that they were not aware of multiple ICT security  schemes across EU, but they expressed their preparedness to accept one; at least, the survey reveals,  these respondents have acknowledged the need to have ICT security certification schemes at large.  Examples provided by the respondents include:   Privacy and Personal Data protection  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  08   IoT   Industrial Control Systems   Telecom,   Health   Aerospace   Cloud security   ICT products and services  When dealing with ICT security certification procedures, the respondents indicated that the main problems  they encounter are the following:   Costs (mentioned by 72,7% of respondents)   Duration of the process (supported by 57,5% of respondents)   Lack of mutual recognition of certificates across Member States (supported by 51,5% of respondents)   Lack of a dedicated scheme to cyber -certify a specific product/service (supported by 45,4% of  respondents)   Lack of certification support for the lifecycle of the product (e.g., incremental certification for software  and hardware changes/updates) (supported by 39,3% of respondents)   Lack of transparency in the certification process (supported by 36,3% of respondents)  PROBLEMS WHEN DEALING WITH ICT SECURITY CERTIFICATION PROCEDURES  TOTAL  RESPONSES  Lack of mutual recognition of certificates across Member States 17  Cost 24  Duration of the process 19  Lack of transparency 12  Lack of a dedicated scheme to cyber-certify a specific product/service 15  Lack of certification support for the lifecycle of the product 13  Table 3 : Problems when dealing with ICT security certification procedures  Future Evolution of ICT security certification across EU  Almost all respondents, 90,9%, agreed that mutual recognition of ICT security certification schemes is  desirable at European level. There was 81,8% of the respondents who agreed also that certification and  labelling can be effective tools to increase transparency about the level of security assurances of ICT  products/services, and enhance trust across the Digital Single Market. However, it was noted that a  ranking of assurance levels with clear information is required as oversimplifying could introduce additional  risks. In addition, certification and labelling should denote only baseline security requirements and should  not deferment innovation or increase complexity.  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  09  NEED FOR A MUTUAL ICT SECURITY RECOGNITION MECHANISM OF CERTIFICATES  ACROSS ALL MS  RESPONSES  The current situation is satisfactory 1  Mutual recognition is desirable at European level 30  The current situation is satisfactory; mutual recognition is desirable at European level 2  Don't know 0  Table 4 : Need for a mutual ICT recognition mechanism of certificates across all Member Statess  CERTIFICATION AND LABELLING CAN BE EFFECTIVE TOOLS TO INCREASE  TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THE LEVEL OF SECURITY ASSURANCES OF ICT  PRODUCTS/SERVICES, AND ENHANCE TRUST ACROSS THE DIGITAL SINGLE MARKET.  RESPONSES  Agree 27  Disagree 6  Don’t know 0  Table 5 : Certification and labeling ars effective tools to increase transparency  The need for greater efforts to promote ICT security certification was highlighted by 66,6% of the  respondents who made specific reference to industry sectors while 21,2% stated that ICT security  certification is a pure market issue and there is no need for additional support.  RECOURSES TO CERTIFICATION AND LABELLING IN THE ICT SECTOR ARE  SUFFICIENTLY WIDESPREAD OR GREATER EFFORT IS NEEDED TO PROMOTE ICT  SECURITY CERTIFICATION IN SPECIFIC SECTORS  RESPONSES  This is a pure market issue and there is no need for additional support 7  No, greater efforts are required in specific sector 22  Don’t know 4  Table 6: Promotion of ICT security certification in specific sectors  Sectors and Technologies  The majority of the respondents (75,7%) identified the need for ICT security and labelling in the Internet of  Things-domain, due to the imminent ubiquity of IoT, issues of vulnerabilities and the required  interoperability across different platforms.  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  10  NEED FOR ICT SECURITY CERTIFICATION AND LABELLING IN THE INTERNET OF  THINGS DOMAIN  RESPONSES  Yes 25  No 6  Don’t know 2  Table 7: Need for ICT security and labelling in the Internet of Things domain  Similarly, 66,6% of the respondents, identified the need for ICT security certification in the Industrial  Control System (ICS)-domain, due to the criticality of processes they support and the level of cyber threats  they are exposed to.  NEED FOR ICT SECURITY CERTIFICATION IN THE INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEM (ICS)- DOMAIN  RESPONSES  Yes 22  No 7  Don’t know 4  Table 8: Need for ICT security and labelling in the Industrial Control System (ICS) domain  Policy Options and Envisioned Features  To reach the objective of reducing internal market fragmentation and improving trust in the security of ICT  products and services in the EU, 33,3% of the respondents opted for creating a European certification  general framework, laying down the essential rules for mutual recognition of certificates issued in  accordance with the framework. The “Soft law approach\", encouraging, supporting and to the extent  possible coordinating the adoption and use of certification initiatives at European level was supported only  by 18,1% while 12,1% of the respondents were in favour of extending the SOG-IS MRA to all Member  States and make it mandatory. Lastly, 12,1% opted for regulating the security of I CT products and services  and specify essential security requirements for such products to be placed on the market. The remaining  respondents indicated that a mixed approach, from all the aforementioned options, should be the  preferred path of action instead.  They argued that mutual recognition of existing certification schemes  and labelling programs can promote a robust Digital Single Market and support EU digital economy while  an entirely new certification framework would not scale with the dynamicsecurity landscape.  ACTIONS FOR REDUCING INTERNAL MARKET FRAGMENTATION AND IMPROVING  TRUST IN THE SECURITY OF ICT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN THE EU  RESPONSES  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  11  \"Soft law approach\", encouraging, supporting and to the extent possible coordinating  the adoption and use of certification initiatives at European level  6  Extending the SOG-IS MRA to all Member States: legislative proposal making MS  participation to the SOGIS agreement mandatory  4  Creating a European certification general framework, laying down the essential rules  for mutual recognition of certificates issued in accordance with the framework  11  Regulating the security of ICT products and services, specifying essential security  requirements for such products to be placed on the market  4  None of the above  8  Table 9: Possible options for reducing internal market fragmentation and improving trust  In all, 45,4% of the respondents were in favour of exploiting the current SOG-IS MRA as the basis to build  an EU-wide certification framework, while 21,2% stated otherwise and 33,3% did not answer either  positive or negative on the role of SOG-IS MRA.  SOG-IS MRA COULD BE A BASIS TO BUILD AN EU-WIDE CERTIFICATION FRAMEWORK RESPONSES  Yes 15  No 7  Don’t know 11  Table 10: SOG-IS MRA role within an EU-wide certification framework  On self-certification schemes, 66,6% of the respondents agreed that these schemes could present a viable  option to boost the level of cyber-security for selected product’ domains, especially for low assurance level  products and should be considered as an integral part of the future EU certification framework, drawing  also experience from existing market driven  initiatives. Nevertheless, 24,2% of the respondents disagree  that self-certification should be considered, as it does not provide for any assurance, there is no control  and it is not sufficient unless there is a third party validating conformance.  SELF-CERTIFICATION SCHEMES COULD BE CONSIDERED A VIABLE OPTION TO BOOST  THE LEVEL OF CYBER-SECURITY FOR SELECTED PRODUCT’ DOMAINS  RESPONSES  Yes 22  No 8  Don’t know 3  Table 11: Self-certification schemes  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  12  The overwhelming majority of the respondents, i.e. 90,9%, indicated that the processes and tools used for  security certification should be improved to ensure the required flexibility by allowing different level of  assurance.  PROCESSES AND TOOLS USED FOR SECURITY CERTIFICATION SHOULD BE IMPROVED  TO ENSURE THE REQUIRED FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT TO DIFFERENT MARKET  SITUATIONS, PARTICULARLY BY ALLOWING DIFFERENT LEVEL OF ASSURANCES  ACCORDING TO MARKET NEEDS  RESPONSES  Yes 30  No 1  Don’t know 2  Table 12: Flexibility to allow different assurance levels  Introducing a common label across the EU was accepted by 66,6% of the respondents.  Such a label would  indicate that the products have been certified within a certification scheme in accordance with EU rules  and provide visual notice that product’s features comply with specific requirements. Nevertheless, the  respondents who were not in favour of a common label, proposed a specific sectoral labelling (e.g. SOGIS)  or consider that it could be difficult for complex systems and/or it could also result in a false sense of  security.  INTRODUCTION OF A COMMON LABEL SIGNALLING CERTIFIED PRODUCTS  RESPONSES  Yes 22  No 8  Don’t know 3  Table 13: Introduction of a common label signalling certified products  Roles and Competencies of Policy Stakeholders  The majority of the respondents, 78,7%, envisage a role for existing European  Commission bodies and  agencies (e.g. JRC, ENISA, ACER) in a possible future EU certification and labelling security framework.  Among the respondents who did not see a role for existing EU Commission's bodies and agencies,  supporting actions such as determining a minimum level of security per category of technology, issuing  voluntary guidelines for both industry and consumers, were envisioned, without identifying key EU bodies  or agencies.  ACTIVE ROLES FOR EXISTING EU COMMISSION'S BODIES AND AGENCIES (E.G. JRC,  ENISA, ACER) IN A POSSIBLE FUTURE CERTIFICATION AND LABELLING FRAMEWORK.  RESPONSES  Yes 26  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  13  No 4  Don’t know 3  Table 14: Roles and Competencies for existing EU Commission's bodies and agencies  Respondents envisaging a role for existing EU Commission's bodies and agencies indicated that:   A central organization at EU level is needed to warrant that a robust system is in place with defined  rules, references and tools. Such a referencecentral organization could also induce recognition by  Member States.   CEN/CENELEC should be involved in a future scheme with the contribution of ENISA to support  technical, organisational and stakeholders’ management tasks.   EU agencies, with respective competences such as ACER and ENISA, could participate in the  development of guidelines, criteria, etc., to be applied in a certification and labelling system, and  promote its adoption across various stakeholders.   JRC and ENISA could serve as a monitoring body to guarantee compliance with the proposed way  forward. ENISA could mandate expert groups with the definition of flexible certification approaches in  respective sectors.   EU bodies could provide administrative support while supporting definition of the scheme, interacting  with EU standardization bodies.  Considerations on ICT security certification in EU  Final  |  August 2017  14  3. Conclusions  ICT security certification plays an important role in increasing trust and security in products and services  and all survey participants reflected on the necessity to design and deploy ICT security certification at a  European Level. This broad consensus was also prevalent in the consultation workshops organized by  ENISA and the Europen Commission during 2016 as ICT security certification has been regarded as one of  the means to enhance trust across the digital single market. This survey confirms that doing nothing is no  policy option for the EU; pro-activity at the policy level is favoured by respondents who see the European  Commisison as a driver for change and a greater role of the EU in the area of certification of products  meets stakeholder’s expectations.  Currently, the ICT security certification landscape comprises of SOG-IS MRA, national and sectorial  schemes along to internal standards, which incommodes a wide-ranging recognition of certificates across  Member States.  Respondents also highlighted the aspects of costs, duration, transparency and support  during the lifecycle as existing barriers to current setting while highlighting that depending on the criticality  or the impact of each sector, such as Internet of Things and Industrial Control Systems, more attentive  efforts are needed.  To meet the expectation of reducing internal market fragmentation and improving trust in the security of  ICT products and services in the EU, the respondents were mostly in favour of creating a European  certification general framework. Notably a number of respondents were also in favour of extending the  SOG-IS MRA to all Member States or encouraging, and supporting the adoption and use of certification  initiatives at European level.  The respondents agreed that the processes and tools used for security certification should be improved to  ensure the required flexibility to adapt to different market situations, particularly by allowing different  level of assurances according to market needs. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to certification and a  scheme based on labelling, and flexibility is likely to be more permitting of greater transparency in this  area. Any certification scheme needs to appropriately mitigate risk and be commercially oriented to allow  for market forces shape benefit from forthcoming technologies i.e. the security for a handset used for  emergency services should be at a higher standard than consumer devices, and therefore at a higher cost.  For high assurance sectors SOG-IS MRA was perceived as a suitable framework to build upon and set up a  framework to consult further among participants while for lower assurance sectors, self-certification could  complement the overall framework.  Lastly, respondents underlined the importance to allocate adequate resources in order to ensure due  maintenance of such a framework while coordination and support roles were suggested or existing EU  Institutions and Bodies, including the European Commission and an agency like ENISA.

    "abstract": "Over the last years, ENISA has engaged in a number of activities in pursuit of supporting the Commission and the Member States in identifying a way forward on the certification of ICT security products and services, which on the one hand seeks to boost competition and on the other to promote mutual recognition or harmonisation of certification practices up to a certain level. This online EU-wide survey on the topic of ICT Security Certification has been singled out as a suitable instrument to consult with stakeholders and seek structured feedback against the currently envisaged policy options."

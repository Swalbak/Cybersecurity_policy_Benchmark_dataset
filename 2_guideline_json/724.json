The most effective of these mitigation strategies are the Essential Eight.  This publication details a process for undertaking assessments of the Essential Eight. In doing so, it includes guidance on  assessment methods that can be used for assessing both the implementation and effectiveness of controls that  underpin the Essential Eight – as articulated within the Essential Eight Maturity Model (November 2022 release).  This publication should be read and used in conjunction with other ACSC guidance and tools. This includes the:   Essential Eight Maturity Model   Essential Eight Maturity Model FAQ   Essential Eight Assessment Report Template   Essential Eight assessment toolkit.  Note, all vendor products mentioned within this publication are for illustrative purposes only and should not be  interpreted as an explicit endorsement by the ACSC.  Overview  Assessments against the Essential Eight are conducted using the Essential Eight Maturity Model. This maturity model  describes three target maturity levels (Maturity Level One through to Maturity Level Three) which are based on  mitigating increasing levels of adversary targeting and tradecraft. The maturity model also includes Maturity Level Zero  which exists for capturing instances in which the requirements of Maturity Level One are not met.  Although the approach to conducting an assessment depends on the size and complexity of a system, there are  foundational principles that are common to each assessment. As such, the guidance in this publication should be  incorporated by assessors, noting that assessors should still use their own judgement and expertise.  While the Essential Eight may be applied to a non-Microsoft Windows system, specific mitigation strategies, or parts  thereof, may not be applicable or even the most effective mitigation strategies available. In these instances, such as for  Linux workstations and servers, cloud computing or enterprise mobility, organisations should consider alternative  guidance provided by the ACSC.  Finally, in determining compensating control effectiveness, assessors should ensure that any compensating controls  that have been implemented provide an equivalent level of protection to those recommended under the Essential  Essential Eight  Assessment Process Guide  First published: November 2022  Last updated: January 2023  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight-maturity-model-faq https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight-assessment-process-guide https://partners.cyber.gov.au/ https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-hardening/hardening-linux-workstations-and-servers https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/outsourcing-and-procurement/cloud-security-guidance https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility  2  Eight. This will assist in ensuring that an equivalent level of overall protection against a specific level of adversary  targeting and tradecraft can be achieved and maintained.  Evidence quality  In conducting an assessment, assessors need to gather and review credible evidence to support conclusions they draw  on the effectiveness of controls. In general terms, the evidence used to determine the effectiveness of controls will vary  in quality depending on the approach taken. As such, when conducting an assessment, assessors should seek to gather  and use the highest quality evidence where reasonably practicable. This guide defines four levels of evidence quality:   Excellent evidence: Testing a control with a simulated activity designed to confirm it is in place and effective (e.g.  attempting to run an application to check application control rulesets).   Good evidence: Reviewing the configuration of a system through the system’s interface to determine whether it  should enforce an expected policy.   Fair evidence: Reviewing a copy of a system’s configuration (e.g. using reports or screenshots) to determine  whether it should enforce an expected policy.   Poor evidence: A policy or verbal statement of intent (e.g. sighting mention of controls within documentation).  Determining effective implementation of  mitigation strategies  Upon concluding assessment activities, assessors will need to determine whether mitigation strategies were  implemented effectively or not. This determination requires a combination of judgement and consideration of the  following factors:   adoption of a risk-based approach to the implementation of mitigation strategies   ability to test the mitigation strategies across an accurate representative sample of workstations (including  laptops), servers and network devices   level of assurance gained from assessment activities and any evidence provided (noting the quality of evidence)   any exceptions, including associated compensating controls, and whether they have been accepted by an  appropriate authority as part of a formal exception process.  Assessors should use the ACSC’s standardised assessment outcomes which are:   Effective: The organisation is effectively meeting the control’s objective.   Ineffective: The organisation is not adequately meeting the control’s objective.   Alternate control: The organisation is effectively meeting the control’s objective through an alternate control.   Not assessed: The control has not yet been assessed.   Not applicable: The control does not apply to the system or environment.   No visibility: The assessor was unable to obtain adequate visibility of a control’s implementation.  It is important that assessors do not allow organisational risk acceptance without sufficient compensating controls as a  justification for not implementing a mitigation strategy (e.g. a system owner has risk accepted not implementing  application control or multi-factor authentication). In these scenarios, without adequate compensating controls, the  mitigation strategy is considered to be not implemented.  3  For a system owner to claim they have implemented a mitigation strategy, all controls specified within the mitigation  strategy must be assessed as ‘effective’ or ‘alternate control’. If one of the controls specified for a mitigation strategy is  assessed as ‘ineffective’, the system owner cannot claim to have met the requirements for that maturity level. In turn,  this applies to the determination of whether a system owner has met the target maturity level for their system (i.e. if  one or more mitigation strategies are deemed to be not implemented then the target maturity level for the system  cannot be claimed to have been met).  Where exceptions to a mitigation strategy’s controls have been identified, the assessor should review and evaluate any  compensating controls that are in place to determine whether they address the intent of the original controls and are  implemented effectively. Two examples have been provided below.  Example: During an internal review, an organisation identified a low-risk Windows server that could not be patched.  As a result, the organisation implemented a plan to decommission the server within two months.  In this situation, it was still important for the organisation to apply compensating controls that reduced the risk to an  acceptable level, and to align with the requirements of the Essential Eight’s exception process. As a result, a risk  owner was assigned, and strong compensating controls were put in place.  In this instance, as the exception was being effectively managed and strong compensating controls were in place, an  assessor determined that the exception should not preclude the organisation from reaching their target maturity  level. Conversely, if the organisation had not applied strong compensating controls, it would not have aligned with  the requirements of the Essential Eight’s exception process and should have precluded the organisation from  reaching their target maturity level.  Example: During an internal review, an organisation identified cloud services that did not have available multi-factor  authentication functionality enabled. In assessing the situation, the organisation decided it was not worth the time  and effort to enable such functionality, not to mention the complaints they expected they would receive from users.  In this situation, the organisation had chosen to simply accept the risk of not implementing a control rather than  implementing strong compensating controls.  In this instance, as the exception was not being effectively managed nor were strong compensating controls in place,  an assessor determined that the organisation should be precluded from reaching their target maturity level.  It is important that the use of exceptions for a system are documented and approved by an appropriate authority  through a formal process. Documentation for exceptions should include the following:   detail, scope and justification for exceptions   detail of compensating controls associated with exceptions, including:   detail, scope and justification for compensating controls   expected implementation lifetime of compensating controls   when compensating controls will next be reviewed   system risk rating before and after the implementation of compensating controls   any caveats placed on the use of the system as a result of exceptions   acceptance by an appropriate authority of the residual risk for the system   when the necessity of exceptions will next be considered by an appropriate authority (noting exceptions should  not be approved beyond one year).  4  The appropriate use of a formal exception process, along with compensating controls, should not preclude an  organisation from being assessed as meeting the requirements for their target maturity level.  Stages of an assessment  At a high-level, assessments are comprised of four stages:   Stage 1: The assessor plans and prepares for the assessment.   Stage 2: The assessor determines the scope and approach for the assessment.   Stage 3: The assessor assesses the controls associated with each of the mitigation strategies.   Stage 4: The assessor develops the security assessment report.  The activities and considerations for each stage of an assessment are discussed in further detail below.  Stage 1: Assessment planning and preparation  Assessment planning  Prior to commencing an assessment, the assessor should conduct assessment planning activities. These activities  require the assessor to discuss with the system owner:   system classification and assessment scope (see further detail below)   access to low and high-privileged user accounts, devices, documentation, personnel, and facilities   intended assessment approach and any approvals required to run scripts and tools (see further detail below)   evidence collection and protection, including any requirements following the conclusion of the assessment   where the security assessment report will be developed (e.g. on an assessor’s device or on an alternative device)   approach to stakeholder engagement and consultation (including key points of contact)   whether any managed service providers or other outsourced providers manage any aspects of the system  (including appropriate points of contact)   access to any relevant prior security assessment reports for the system   appropriate use, retention and marketing of the security assessment report by both parties.  Assessors may also develop an assessment test plan and share it with the system owner. Example assessment test plans  are included as Annex A through Annex C.  Note, test cases listed within the example assessment test plans included as Annex A through Annex C should not be  treated as mandatory assessment requirements. Rather, assessors should apply their own judgement and experience in  the development of their own assessment test plans.  5  Stage 2: Determination of assessment scope and  approach  Determine assessment scope  In determining the assessment scope, assessors should first clarify the target maturity level with the system owner,  noting that the Essential Eight is required to be implemented and assessed as a package. For example, if a system  owner has not previously had an assessment demonstrating that they have implemented Maturity Level One, they  should not begin an assessment against Maturity Level Two until they have done so, and likewise for Maturity Level  Two before being assessed against Maturity Level Three.  Having identified a suitable target maturity level, the assessor should familiarise themselves with the requirements for  that maturity level as it will impact the components or aspects of the system within scope of the assessment. At this  time it may also be useful to request an approximate percentage breakdown of the operating systems used on  workstations and servers for the system.  Once the scope of the assessment has been identified, and agreed upon with the system owner, a more accurate  determination of the assessment’s duration and any milestones will likely be possible.  The scope of the assessment should be documented within the security assessment report. Any components or aspects  of a system deemed out-of-scope should also be documented and accompanied by a justification for their exclusion.  Determine assessment approach  In determining a suitable assessment approach, both qualitative and quantitative testing techniques should be  considered. For example, qualitative testing techniques include documentation reviews and interviews with personnel  administering or managing system security, while quantitative testing techniques include system configuration reviews  and the use of scripts and tools. Sample sizes for testing should also be determined in consultation with the system  owner, with the aim to assess an accurate representative sample population of workstations (including laptops), servers  and network devices.  Conducting assessments using interviews, reports and screenshots will always be inferior to conducting assessments  using scripts and tools. Particularly as scripts and tools often assess many workstations and servers on a network, rather  than a single sample workstation or server, and often identify issues that may be missed in interviews or overlooked by  human analysis of reports and configuration settings. If adequate assessment scripts and tools are not already present  on a system, assessors may wish to use their own scripts and tools following approval by the system owner.  Any assessment limitations including sample sizes and constraints on technical testing should be documented within  the security assessment report.  Stage 3: Assessment of controls  The assessment of each mitigation strategy is performed by reviewing and testing the effectiveness of controls. This  section provides guidance on the approach to assessing each mitigation strategy at a given target maturity level, along  with relevant assessment considerations. Guidance on determining the effectiveness of the controls within each  mitigation strategy is also provided within this section.  Assessment guidance for maturity levels in this section is cumulative. For example, the guidance provided in the  Maturity Level Two section is focused on unique requirements above those of Maturity Level One. Likewise, the  6  guidance provided in the Maturity Level Three section is focused on unique requirements above those of Maturity Level  Two. This aligns with the manner in which assessments should be conducted against target maturity levels.  Maturity Level One  The focus of this maturity level is adversaries who are content to simply leverage commodity tradecraft that is widely  available to gain access to, and control of, a system. For example, adversaries opportunistically using a publicly- available exploit for a security vulnerability in an unpatched internet-facing service, or authenticating to an internet- facing service using credentials that were stolen, reused, brute forced or guessed.  Generally, adversaries are looking for any victim rather than a specific victim and will opportunistically seek common  weaknesses in many targets rather than investing heavily in gaining access to a specific target. Adversaries will employ  common social engineering techniques to trick users into weakening the security of a system and executing malicious  code, for example, via a Microsoft Office macro.  Adversaries will also often seek to compromise user accounts. If successful, they may seek to exploit privileges  associated with these accounts or escalate privileges to higher levels. Depending on their intent, adversaries may also  seek to steal or destroy data (including backups) or make data otherwise unavailable through various denial-of-service  techniques.  Application control  Context  Application control assessments can be done without tools but efforts will be severely limited in their effectiveness and  are likely to miss edge cases that adversaries would look to exploit. For example, adversaries may use custom tools to  scan for weak or vulnerable paths on a system. This could be achieved with a Microsoft Office macro.  It is important to note that the last major update to the maturity model introduced compiled Hypertext Markup  Language (HTML) (.chm files), HTML applications (.hta files) and control panel applets (.cpl files) to the list of file types  that need to be controlled. Depending on the application control solution selected, it may not support these file types.  When conducting assessments, paths for standard user profiles and temporary folders used by operating systems, web  browsers, and email clients can include those from the list below. Note, depending on the system configuration, there  may be overlap (e.g. %temp% and %tmp% generally reside within %userprofile%\\*).   %userprofile%\\*   %temp%\\*   %tmp%\\*   %windir%\\Temp\\*.  To check if application control is implemented within the user profile directory, attempt to run a benign executable file  inside the directory. The executables tested should cover .exe, .com, .dll, .ocx, .ps1, .bat, .vbs, .js, .msi, .mst, .msp, .chm,  .hta, and .cpl. If any of the executables run within the user profile directory or operating system temporary folders,  application control is ineffective.  Note, while a dedicated application control solution is not required at Maturity Level One (i.e. file system permissions  can be used instead), organisations may still choose to implement a dedicated application control solution if they  intend to eventually implement requirements for Maturity Level Two.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  7  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  The execution of  executables, software  libraries, scripts,  installers, compiled  HTML, HTML  applications and control  panel applets is  prevented on  workstations from  within standard user  profiles and temporary  folders used by the  operating system, web  browsers and email  clients.  Due to the complexity of advanced file system permissions, and various user groups that  a user account may belong to, the only truly effective way to check application control  implementations is to attempt to write to and execute from all locations accessible to a  user on the file system. There are several free tools available to support the assessment  of this control, including the ACSC’s Essential Eight Maturity Verification Tool (E8MVT)  and Application Control Verification Tool (ACVT), AirLock Digital’s Application Whitelist  Auditor, and CyberArk’s Evasor. There are also several paid tools available. In choosing a  tool to use, make sure that it has been thoroughly tested beforehand to ensure it is fit- for-purpose.  If the system owner is willing to allow the use of trusted Microsoft tools, but not other  third-party tools, the SysInternals AccessChk application can be used to generate the  output of folder permissions, noting this is only relevant to a path-based approach. For  example, by running ‘accesschk -dsuvw [path] > report.txt’, it is possible to generate a  list of all writable paths and their access permissions for all users. Note, the ‘whoami  /groups’ command would also need to be run to determine which user groups a typical  standard user belonged to in order to determine the effective permissions for each path.  Alternatively, PowerShell cmdlets can be used to test and review AppLocker policy  where applicable.  For a system on which tools cannot be run, assuming a path-based approach is used,  screenshots of the ‘effective access’ permissions for specified folders can be requested.  This, however, has limitations, because unless screenshots of access permissions are  requested for every folder and sub-folder (for which there may be many), it will not be  possible to comprehensively assess whether read, write and execute permissions exist  for a given user. At a minimum, screenshots for key paths (such as temporary folders  used by the operating system, web browsers and email clients) should be requested and  examined to determine whether inheritance is set, noting that at any point in a path,  application control inheritance previously set by an operating system may be disabled by  an application installer.  Patch applications  Context  Most vendors of internet-facing services regularly release updated versions of their applications to fix security  vulnerabilities. Applications that exist on a system can be compared to the latest versions available from the vendor to  determine whether existing versions are the latest, and if not, how long-ago updates were made available by the  vendor, based on release dates and patch notes. Services such as the SANS Internet Storm Centre, Microsoft Security  Response Centre or the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog can  be used to determine whether public exploits exist for a given internet-facing service.  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/applocker/test-applockerpolicy?view=windowsserver2022-ps https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/applocker/get-applockerpolicy?view=windowsserver2022-ps https://isc.sans.edu/ https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog  8  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  An automated method  of asset discovery is  used at least fortnightly  to support the detection  of assets for subsequent  vulnerability scanning  activities.  Ask for a demonstration of a method of asset discovery being used in an automated manner  to identify assets associated with the system, such as workstations, servers and network  devices. This may be a dedicated asset discovery tool or it may be equivalent functionality  built into a vulnerability scanner. In addition, request evidence of previous automated asset  discovery scans and pay attention to the date/time stamp and their scope.  Note, while an automated method of asset discovery should be used at least fortnightly,  system owners may elect to align the frequency of asset discovery scans to more frequent  timeframes used for vulnerability scans (such as daily or weekly) in order to perform both  activities at the same time for optimal effect.  Finally, in addition to identifying assets for follow-on vulnerability scanning activities,  automated asset discovery can also be used to identify any unauthorised assets that may  have been connected to a system between scheduled scans. If unknown assets are  identified as part of asset discovery scans, they should be immediately investigated and  treated as suspicious until confirmed otherwise.  A vulnerability scanner  with an up-to-date  vulnerability database is  used for vulnerability  scanning activities.  Ask for a demonstration of a vulnerability scan. In addition, request evidence of the  date/time stamp of when the vulnerability database used for the scan was last updated.  Ideally, this should be within 24 hours of the vulnerability scan taking place.  A vulnerability scanner  is used at least daily to  identify missing patches  or updates for security  vulnerabilities in  internet-facing services.  Ask for a demonstration of a vulnerability scan. In addition, request evidence of previous  vulnerability scans and pay attention to the date/time stamp and scope of event logs. Check  whether the list of scanned internet-facing services matches the internet-facing services.  Request evidence of previous vulnerability scans and pay attention to the date/time stamp  and scope of event logs.  A vulnerability scanner  is used at least  fortnightly to identify  missing patches or  updates for security  vulnerabilities in office  productivity suites, web  browsers and their  extensions, email  clients, PDF software,  and security products.  Ask for a demonstration of a vulnerability scan. In addition, request evidence of previous  vulnerability scans and pay attention to the date/time stamp and scope of event logs.  Request evidence of previous vulnerability scans and pay attention to the date/time stamp  and scope of event logs.  9  Patches, updates or  vendor mitigations for  security vulnerabilities  in internet-facing  services are applied  within two weeks of  release, or within 48  hours if an exploit exists.  A network-based vulnerability scanner can be used to identify internet-facing services, their  versions and install dates. This can then be reviewed alongside the date of release for each  to determine whether patch timeframes have been met. The use of these tools can quickly  determine service versions and whether they are the latest versions available from vendors.  There are several free tools available to support the assessment of this control, including the  ACSC’s E8MVT, Nessus Essentials, Nexpose Community Edition, OpenVAS and Qualys  Community Edition. There are also several paid tools available. In choosing a tool to use,  make sure that it has been thoroughly tested beforehand to ensure it is fit-for-purpose.  Note, a scanner may not identify missing vendor mitigations such as specific configuration  changes.  If a network-based vulnerability scanner cannot be used, screenshots of versions of internet- facing services can be requested. This allows for manual checking against the latest versions  available from vendors. Alternatively, a list of services may be requested (noting that  adversaries often exploit security vulnerabilities in internet-facing services that the system  owner may have forgotten about or that have been installed by users without the system  owner’s knowledge).  Patches, updates or  vendor mitigations for  security vulnerabilities  in office productivity  suites, web browsers  and their extensions,  email clients, PDF  software, and security  products are applied  within one month of  release.  A vulnerability scanner can be used to assess applications, their versions and install dates.  The above output must be reviewed alongside the date of release for each application to  determine whether the timeframe has been met.  10  Alternatively, PowerShell can be used to identify applications with registered uninstall  functionality. However, this method alone will not always cover all applications that are  installed on a system. As a result, it should be combined with the list of installed applications  within ‘Programs and Features’.  While this approach can be used for assessments, the limitations in coverage should be  noted. For key applications though, it will likely be sufficient. If any key applications appear  to be missing in reports provided, this should be raised for clarification.  Below is a PowerShell script to output a list of installed applications with registered uninstall  functionality. This list should be reviewed in conjunction with the list of installed  applications within ‘Control Panel – Programs – Programs and Features’ to ensure no  applications are missed.  function Analyze( $p, $f) {  Get-ItemProperty $p |foreach {  if (($_.DisplayName) -or ($_.version)) {  [PSCustomObject]@{  From = $f;  Name = $_.DisplayName;  Version = $_.DisplayVersion;  Install = $_.InstallDate  }  }  }  }  $s = @()  $s += Analyze ‘HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\*’ 64  $s += Analyze ‘HKLM:\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\*’ 32  $s | Sort-Object -Property Name  The combined list of installed applications must be reviewed alongside the date of release  for each application patch to determine whether the timeframe has been met.  If tools cannot be used, request a demonstration that shows the versions of installed  applications and their install date. This allows for manual checking against the latest  versions available from vendors.  Internet-facing services,  office productivity  suites, web browsers  and their extensions,  email clients, PDF  software, Adobe Flash  Player, and security  products that are no  longer supported by  vendors are removed.  A vulnerability scanner can be used to assess applications and whether they are end of life.  Request a demonstration that shows the versions of the referenced applications and  services. This allows for manual checking against the list of supported versions. In addition,  check if hotfix KB4577586 has been applied to demonstrate that Adobe Flash Player is no  longer supported. Note, this hotfix will only remove Adobe Flash Player if it was installed by  Windows. If Adobe Flash Player was installed manually from another source, it will not be  removed by this hotfix.  11  Configure Microsoft Office macro settings  Context  All users should be denied the ability to execute Microsoft Office macros by default unless they have a specific business  requirement. If certain users are required to run Microsoft Office macros, they should be restricted to only the specific  applications required (rather than all Microsoft Office applications). In addition, a record of their business requirement  and associated approvals should be kept. This record should align with the list of users within the Active Directory  group that have permission to run Microsoft Office macros. Note, once a business requirement can no longer be  demonstrated by a user, permission to run Microsoft Office macros should be revoked.  Microsoft Defender is commonly used to perform Microsoft Office macro antivirus scanning. This product uses the  Antimalware Scan Interface to integrate applications and services with any antimalware installed on a machine. Other  antivirus solutions may use this interface or other processes to scan Microsoft Office macros.  Microsoft Office applications that can execute Microsoft Office macros include Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel,  Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Publisher, Microsoft Visio and Microsoft Word.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Microsoft Office macros  are disabled for users  that do not have a  demonstrated business  requirement.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can be used to assist with assessing this control. Refer to supporting  E8MVT documentation.  The ‘gpresult’ command can be run on workstations to generate an RSoP report to  identify Microsoft Office macro settings applied via group policy settings. Within the  report, look for the ‘VBA Macro Notification Settings’ setting at ‘User  Configuration\\Policies\\Administration Templates\\<Microsoft Office  Application>\\Application Settings\\Security\\Trust Center\\’.  The ‘VBA Macro Notification Settings’ setting should be enabled and configured to  ‘Disable all macros without notification’ for most users. If this setting is not configured,  all Microsoft Office macros will be disabled but users will receive a prompt via the Trust  Bar asking whether they would like to enable them.  For users with a demonstrated business requirement for Microsoft Office macro use,  this group policy setting may either not be configured, disabled or enabled and set to  any other setting – as long as antivirus scanning is enabled and Microsoft Office macros  in files originating from the internet are being blocked.  12  Within each Microsoft Office application, check or request demonstration showing  Trust Center macro settings (File – Options – Trust Center – Trust Center Settings –  Macro Settings) for users that are not allowed to run Microsoft Office macros and for  users with a business requirement to do so. For users that are allowed to run Microsoft  Office macros, request documentation that outlines the business need. Consider  requesting the percentage of the organisation’s userbase that have been granted  approval to run Microsoft Office macros.  For the assessment of Microsoft Office macro security, identify what setting is selected  for ‘macro settings’. For most users, the desired setting should be ‘Disable all macros  without notification’. However, for users with a demonstrated business requirement  for Microsoft Office macro use, any other setting is acceptable at this maturity level. In  these instances, identify any compensating controls such as antivirus scanning and if  Microsoft Office macros in files originating from the internet are being blocked.  Microsoft Office macros  in files originating from  the internet are  blocked.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can be used to assist with assessing this control. Refer to supporting  E8MVT documentation.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Block macros from running in Office files from the  Internet’ setting at ‘User Configuration\\Policies\\Administration Templates\\<Microsoft  Office Application>\\Application Settings\\Security\\Trust Center\\’. It should be enabled.  If this setting is not configured, all Microsoft Office macros from the internet will be  able to run. In addition, if users have the ability to access a file’s properties, they can  remove the Mark of the Web. To prevent this, the ‘Hide mechanisms to remove zone  information’ setting at ‘User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative  Templates\\Windows Components\\Attachment Manager\\’ should also be enabled.  Users can also remove the Mark of the Web by copying files from NTFS formatted  storage media to external FAT/FAT32/exFAT formatted storage media and back. Unless  external storage media (which is typically FAT32/exFAT formatted) is disabled for a  system, it will be difficult to prevent users bypassing this control if they know how to –  or adversaries tell them how to (which is more likely at higher maturity levels).  Microsoft Office macro  antivirus scanning is  enabled.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can be used to assist with assessing this control. Refer to supporting  E8MVT documentation.  Check if the following group policy setting is enabled for each Microsoft Office  application. Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Macro Runtime Scan Scope’ setting at  ‘User Configuration/Policies/Administrative Templates/Microsoft Office <Version>/  Security Settings/Macro Runtime Scan Scope’. It should be enabled with a value of  either:  0 - No macro scanning  1 - Macros in files with the MoTW (Default)  2 - Macros in all files (Ideal).  Alternatively, a pseudo-malicious Microsoft Office macro that contains an EICAR  antivirus test string can be used for testing purposes. The ACSC’s E8MVT has a benign  sample file that can be used for testing without running the tool.  13  If an Antimalware Scan Interface compatible antivirus product is not being used, ask for  a screenshot of any Microsoft Office macro scanning configuration settings that might  be present.  Microsoft Office macro  security settings cannot  be changed by users.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can be used to assist with assessing this control. Refer to supporting  E8MVT documentation.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘VBA Macro Notification Settings’ setting at ‘User  Configuration\\Policies\\Administration Templates\\<Microsoft Office Application>\\  Application Settings\\Security\\Trust Center\\’. If it is either enabled or disabled, then  users will not be able to change their Microsoft Office macro security settings.  Using a user account, open each Microsoft Office application and attempt to change  Microsoft Office macro security settings in the Trust Centre. If Microsoft Office macro  security settings have been configured via group policy settings, they should appear  greyed out.  User application hardening  Context  Adversaries are known to indiscriminately use ‘malvertising’ in their attempts to compromise systems. Blocking web  advertisements using web browser add-ins or extensions, or via web content filtering, can prevent the compromise of a  system.  Internet Explorer 11 lacks many of the security features of modern web browsers and ceased to be supported by  Microsoft on 15 June 2022. As such, it is more regularly targeted by adversaries. Ideally, Internet Explorer 11 should be  removed from systems and Microsoft Edge (running in ‘IE mode’ for legacy sites), or other modern web browsers,  should be used instead.  Web browser security settings should be configured via group policy settings. In addition, default web browser security  settings should not be relied upon as users may tinker with these settings to enable content or change settings when  guided to do so by adversaries. Web browser security settings that are configured via group policy settings typically  appear greyed out to users, have a hover over message explaining the setting is configured by their organisation or  have an icon such as a padlock.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  14  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Web browsers do not  process Java from the  internet.  A list of the web browsers installed on a system can be derived from the list of all  installed applications. For each web browser installed on the system, visit a  specific web page that contains Java, such as the Is Java installed? website.  Additionally, review any plug-ins or extensions that are installed for each web  browser present on the system. This can be used to check whether any web  browsers have Java plug-ins or extensions installed, and if so, whether they are  disabled.  If the system owner requires Java content to be accessed on their intranet, other  controls should be assessed to determine whether internet-based Java content is  blocked via a web content filter.  Web browsers do not  process web  advertisements from  the internet.  Check whether web browsers have either an ad blocker add-in or extension  installed. Alternatively, check whether a web content filter or proxy is blocking  web advertisements. A simple check is to request a user to browse to a website  that is known to display ads (to observe if any ads are displayed) or to browse to  AdBlock Tester website (for comprehensive testing) and provide a screenshot of  the results.  Note, built-in settings within web browsers to block pop-ups do not meet the  intent of this control.  Internet Explorer 11  does not process  content from the  internet.  For Microsoft Windows 11: This requirement is not applicable.  For Microsoft Windows 10: Determine whether Internet Explorer 11 is installed  on the system. If it is, attempt to access any website on the internet, such as  https://www.google.com.au.  Check that Internet Explorer 11 is not the default web browser (Settings – Apps –  Default apps – Web browser) and check for any file associations (Settings – Apps –  Default apps – Choose default applications by file type) tied to Internet Explorer  11.  Web browser security  settings cannot be  changed by users.  Check the security settings of each web browser present on the system. Identify if  settings are greyed out (Internet Explorer 11 and Mozilla Firefox), have an icon  with a hover over message that says ‘This setting is managed by your  organisation’ (Microsoft Edge) or ‘This setting is managed by your administrator’  (Google Chrome). This indicates that settings have been configured via group  policy settings and cannot be changed by users. In addition, identify whether Java  Control Panel settings can be changed by the user.  https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/is-java-installed https://adblock-tester.com/ https://www.google.com.au/  15  Restrict administrative privileges  Context  Policies, processes and procedures for managing privileged access to systems should be documented and enforced  within organisational workflows. In doing so, privileged access to systems and applications should be requested via a  form, service desk ticket or email from users, and require approval from a supervisor or application owner, to maintain  a record of all such requests. System owners should also maintain a list of all applications on their system that require  privileged access.  Privileged accounts are often targeted by adversaries for their greater control and access to organisational resources.  For this reason, privileged accounts should not have access to the internet, email and web services.  Note, while no constraints are placed on how privileged and unprivileged operating environments are separated for  privileged users at Maturity Level One, organisations may choose to implement an approach that avoids virtualising a  privileged operating environment within an unprivileged operating environment if they intend to eventually implement  requirements for Maturity Level Two.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Requests for privileged  access to systems and  applications are validated  when first requested.  Request copies of forms, support tickets or emails provided by users requesting access –  along with the support of their supervisor or applicable application owner. This can then  be compared to screenshots of accounts with privileged access to determine if there are  any discrepancies.  Privileged accounts  (excluding privileged  service accounts) are  prevented from accessing  the internet, email and  web services.  Attempt to browse the internet as a privileged user, review the internet proxy on the  network to determine whether it is configured to block traffic from privileged accounts  and run the below PowerShell command to check if privileged accounts have access to  mailboxes and email addresses:  Get-ADUser -Filter {(admincount -eq 1) -and (emailaddress -like “*”) -and (enabled -eq  $true)} -Properties EmailAddress | Select samaccountname, emailaddress  Tools such as BloodHound can assist in identifying privileged users that may be missed  when utilising PowerShell alone.  Privileged users use  separate privileged and  unprivileged operating  environments.  Discuss how privileged operating environments have been implemented for the  management of the system. Note, at this maturity level there are no constraints on how  this can be implemented beyond that separate privileged and unprivileged operating  environments have been implemented.  Unprivileged accounts  cannot logon to privileged  operating environments.  Attempt to logon to a privileged workstation using a standard user account.  Bloodhound can be used to assess whether any unprivileged accounts have connected to  privileged environments by looking for cached credentials.  https://www.sans.org/blog/bloodhound-sniffing-out-path-through-windows-domains/ https://www.sans.org/blog/bloodhound-sniffing-out-path-through-windows-domains/  16  Privileged accounts  (excluding local  administrator accounts)  cannot logon to  unprivileged operating  environments.  Request a demonstration of a privileged account attempting to logon to a standard user  workstation. Note, the moment a privileged account’s username and password are  entered into a standard user workstation, the account should be considered  compromised (noting this is the reason behind having separate operating environments).  This test should be done using a privileged account set up specifically for this purpose.  The privileged account should then be removed immediately after testing is complete.  Bloodhound can be used to assess whether any privileged accounts have connected to  unprivileged environments by looking for cached credentials.  Patch operating systems  Context  Operating system vendors regularly publish updates to address security vulnerabilities. In addition, unsupported and  out-of-date operating systems of internet-facing workstations and servers are a common target for adversaries.  While operating systems of workstations, servers and network devices that are not internet-facing are at a lower risk of  exploitation, as adversaries need to compromise another system to then obtain network-based access to the  unpatched operating system, it is still important that such operating systems are patched in a reasonable timeframe  given the level of targeting and tradecraft the system owner is attempting to protect their system against.  Services such as the SANS Internet Storm Centre, Microsoft Security Response Centre or the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog can be used to determine whether public  exploits exist for operating systems of workstations, servers and network devices.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  An automated method  of asset discovery is  used at least fortnightly  to support the detection  of assets for subsequent  vulnerability scanning  activities.  Ask for a demonstration of a method of asset discovery being used in an automated  manner to identify assets associated with the system, such as workstations, servers and  network devices. This may be a dedicated asset discovery tool or it may be equivalent  functionality built into a vulnerability scanner. In addition, request evidence of previous  automated asset discovery scans and pay attention to the date/time stamp and their  scope.  Note, while an automated method of asset discovery should be used at least fortnightly,  system owners may elect to align the frequency of asset discovery scans to more  frequent timeframes used for vulnerability scans (such as daily or weekly) in order to  perform both activities at the same time for optimal effect.  Finally, in addition to identifying assets for follow-on vulnerability scanning activities,  automated asset discovery can also be used to identify any unauthorised assets that may  have been connected to a system between scheduled scans. If unknown assets are  identified as part of asset discovery scans, they should be immediately investigated and  treated as suspicious until confirmed otherwise.  https://www.sans.org/blog/bloodhound-sniffing-out-path-through-windows-domains/ https://isc.sans.edu/ https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog  17  A vulnerability scanner  with an up-to-date  vulnerability database is  used for vulnerability  scanning activities.  Ask for a demonstration of a vulnerability scan. In addition, request evidence of the  date/time stamp of when the vulnerability database used for the scan was last updated.  Ideally, this should be within 24 hours of the vulnerability scan taking place.  A vulnerability scanner  is used at least daily to  identify missing patches  or updates for security  vulnerabilities in  operating systems of  internet-facing services.  Ask for a demonstration of a vulnerability scan. In addition, request evidence of previous  vulnerability scans and pay attention to the date/time stamp and scope of event logs.  Request evidence of previous vulnerability scans and pay attention to the date/time  stamp and scope of event logs.  A vulnerability scanner  is used at least  fortnightly to identify  missing patches or  updates for security  vulnerabilities in  operating systems of  workstations, servers  and network devices.  Ask for a demonstration of a vulnerability scan. In addition, request evidence of previous  vulnerability scans and pay attention to the date/time stamp and scope of event logs.  Request evidence of previous vulnerability scans and pay attention to the date/time  stamp and scope of event logs.  Patches, updates or  vendor mitigations for  security vulnerabilities  in operating systems of  internet-facing services  are applied within two  weeks of release, or  within 48 hours if an  exploit exists.  Network-based vulnerability scanners can be used to identify operating systems, their  versions and install dates. This can then be reviewed alongside the release date of  patches to determine whether the timeframe has been met. The use of these tools can  quickly determine patches that have been applied, which can then be compared to patch  release dates. There are several free tools available to support the assessment of this  control, including the ACSC’s E8MVT, Nessus Essentials, Nexpose Community Edition,  OpenVAS and Qualys Community Edition. There are also several paid tools available. In  choosing a tool to use, make sure that it has been thoroughly tested beforehand to  ensure it is fit-for-purpose.  If using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) for the assessment of this control, it is  important to consider that WSUS does not necessarily report accurate patch levels.  Specifically, WSUS has been known to report patches or updates that have been  deployed but not whether they were successfully applied, stuck and if the machine was  rebooted (if required).  Request WMIC or PowerShell be used to generate a list of hotfixes and the date that  they were applied to an operating system. This can then be compared to available  patches, especially those that are currently being exploited, to determine whether they  have been applied or not.  18  Patches, updates or  vendor mitigations for  security vulnerabilities  in operating systems of  workstations, servers  and network devices are  applied within one  month of release.

This can then be compared to available  patches, especially those that are currently being exploited, to determine whether they  have been applied or not.  Operating systems that  are no longer supported  by vendors are replaced.  Network-based vulnerability scanners can be used to identify operating systems and  their versions. The use of these tools can quickly determine operating system versions  which can then be checked against the list of supported operating systems from vendors.  For Microsoft Windows workstations and servers, the ‘winver’ command can be run to  determine the version of the operating system. Request a screenshot of the output of  running the ‘winver’ command for servers and workstations (assuming a Standard  Operating Environment is used for workstations). This version can then be checked  against Microsoft release information to determine whether it is a supported version or  not.  Multi-factor authentication  Context  Multi-factor authentication is one of the most effective controls an organisation can implement to prevent adversaries  from gaining access to a system, service or application. When implemented correctly, multi-factor authentication can  also make it significantly more difficult for adversaries to steal legitimate credentials to facilitate further malicious  activities.  Multi-factor authentication should be implemented for remote access solutions, users performing privileged actions  and users accessing important (sensitive or high-availability) data repositories. Using multi-factor authentication  provides a secure authentication mechanism that is not as susceptible to brute force attacks, such as traditional single- factor authentication methods based on memorised secrets (e.g. personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords and  passphrases).  At this maturity level, any two or more authentication methods can be used as long as they are not of the same class  (e.g. something users know, something users have or something users are). There is no requirement that one factor  19  must be a memorised secret. Biometrics and Trusted Signals are also acceptable as an authentication method at this  maturity level.  Note, while any two or more authentication methods can be used at Maturity Level One, organisations may still choose  to implement multi-factor authentication solutions, such as those that include something the user has or are phishing- resistant, if they intend to eventually implement requirements for Maturity Level Two or Maturity Level Three.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Multi-factor authentication is  used by an organisation’s  users if they authenticate to  their organisation’s internet- facing services.  Attempt to logon to internet-facing services that staff access. Typically, the logon  screen will show a request for two or more authentication factors, such as a password  and a one-time PIN. Note, in some cases a service may request the second  authentication factor after the first authentication factor has been validated.  Organisations might only share their primary login portal and may not disclose any  other portals that may not have MFA in place. Assessors should undertake activities to  determine if any additional authentication portals are exposed to the internet.  Multi-factor authentication is  used by an organisation’s  users if they authenticate to  third-party internet-facing  services that process, store  or communicate their  organisation’s sensitive data.  Attempt to logon to third-party internet-facing services that staff access. In cases  where multi-factor authentication is not used, confirm that the vendor or service  provider does not offer that functionality.  Multi-factor authentication  (where available) is used by  an organisation’s users if they  authenticate to third-party  internet-facing services that  process, store or  communicate their  organisation’s non-sensitive  data.  Attempt to logon to third-party internet-facing services that staff access. In cases  where multi-factor authentication is not used, confirm that the vendor or service  provider does not offer that functionality.  Multi-factor authentication is  enabled by default for non- organisational users (but  users can choose to opt out)  if they authenticate to an  organisation’s internet-facing  services.  Attempt to logon to internet-facing services that customers/citizens access. Discuss  whether multi-factor authentication is setup as part of account creation (opt-out) or  whether customers/citizens need to set it up themselves after initial account creation  (opt-in).  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/feature-multifactor-unlock  20  Regular backups  Context  Backup and retention frequencies should be defined by the system owner in accordance with their organisation’s  business continuity and disaster recovery requirements. In doing so, it is important that restoration of systems and data  from backups be tested as part of regular (at least annual) disaster recovery exercises and not left to after the first  major security incident is experienced.  At this maturity level, it is important that unprivileged users cannot access the backups of any other users – although it  is not necessarily a problem if they are able to access their own backups. It is worth noting, at this maturity level, that  privileged accounts may still be able to access the backups of any user.  While unprivileged accounts can access (i.e. read) their own backups, it is important that they do not have the ability to  modify or delete those backups. This requirement exists as any ransomware running with the privileges of an  unprivileged user should be blocked from overwriting or deleting backups. Note, adversaries escalating privileges to  privileged accounts, or backup administrator accounts, to overwrite backups are addressed at higher maturity levels.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Backups of important  data, software and  configuration settings  are performed and  retained with a  frequency and retention  timeframe in  accordance with  business continuity  requirements.  Discuss backup and retention frequencies specified for the system. Request a copy of the  business continuity plan and disaster recovery plan to check that the frequency and  retention periods have been documented.  Backups of important  data, software and  configuration settings  are synchronised to  enable restoration to a  common point in time.  It is important that any backup activities are synchronised to enable restoration to a  common point in time. For example, if important data stores are being backed up out of  sync to software and configuration settings then it will hamper restoration efforts and data  will be lost.  Backups of important  data, software and  configuration settings  are retained in a secure  and resilient manner.  Check what efforts have been made to ensure that backup processes and procedures are  secure and resilient. For example, are backups encrypted and how quickly can they be used  to recover from ICT equipment failure?  21  Restoration of  important data,  software and  configuration settings  from backups to a  common point in time is  tested as part of disaster  recovery exercises.  Discuss if any disaster recovery exercises have been conducted for the system, how often  these are conducted, when the last exercise was conducted and if partial or full restoration  of the system (including important data, software and configuration settings) was exercised.  Ideally, some form of after-action review or post-exercise report should be available to  demonstrate what disaster recovery processes and procedures where exercised and any  lessons that were learnt, such as the coordination of restoration activities across different  business areas (if applicable).  Note that business-as-usual recovery of user files is not sufficient. The intent of this control  is the restoration of a significant component of a system as part of a scheduled exercise.  Unprivileged accounts  cannot access backups  belonging to other  accounts.  Review the backup solution and Active Directory security groups to determine who has  access to backups.  Check whether unprivileged accounts have the ability to access all backups or just their own  backups. If backups are stored on network shares, request a demonstration of effective  access permissions to show that an unprivileged user account is incapable of accessing  backups beyond their own.  Unprivileged accounts  are prevented from  modifying and deleting  backups.  Check whether unprivileged accounts have the ability to modify or delete their own  backups. If backups are stored on network shares, request a demonstration of effective  access permissions to show that an unprivileged user account is incapable of modifying or  deleting their backups – or taking ownership of content to change permissions.  Maturity Level Two  The focus of this maturity level is adversaries operating with a modest step-up in capability from the previous maturity  level. These adversaries are willing to invest more time in a target and, perhaps more importantly, in the effectiveness  of their tools. For example, these adversaries will likely employ well-known tradecraft to better attempt to bypass  controls implemented by a target and evade detection. This includes actively targeting credentials using phishing and  employing technical and social engineering techniques to circumvent weaker methods of multi-factor authentication.  Generally, adversaries are likely to be more selective in their targeting but still somewhat conservative in the time,  money and effort they may invest in a target. Adversaries will likely invest time to ensure their phishing is effective and  employ common social engineering techniques to trick users into weakening the security of a system and executing  malicious code, for example, via a Microsoft Office macro.  Adversaries will also often seek to compromise user accounts. If successful, they may seek to exploit privileges  associated with these accounts or escalate privileges to higher levels. Depending on their intent, adversaries may also  seek to steal or destroy data (including backups) or make data otherwise unavailable through various denial-of-service  techniques.  The guidance below outlines the requirements to be assessed in addition to the requirements of the previous maturity  level. In doing so, assessments against Maturity Level Two should focus on the delta between Maturity Level One and  Maturity Level Two.  22  Application control  Context  For Maturity Level Two, application control requires the use of a dedicated application control solution. This may be  one of the in-built solutions from Microsoft (e.g. AppLocker or Windows Defender Application Control) or it may be a  third-party solution (e.g. AirLock Digital’s AirLock, Ivanti’s Device and Application Control, Trend Micro Endpoint  Application Control or VMWare Carbon Black App Control).  The majority of application control solutions will have a form of logging or auditing mode. As such, event logs for  application control solutions should be collected and stored in case there is a cyber security incident and they are  required for forensic or incident response purposes. Often, the lack of sufficient logging can impact the ability to  determine the extent of a cyber security incident, how it occurred and what security vulnerabilities need to be  mitigated.  Assessment Guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Application control is  implemented on  workstations and internet- facing servers.  Check whether a dedicated application control solution has been implemented on all  workstations and internet-facing servers.  Application control restricts  the execution of executables,  software libraries, scripts,  installers, compiled HTML,  HTML applications and  control panel applets to an  organisation-approved set.  Due to the complexity of application control rulesets, the best way to assess application  control implementations is to attempt to write to and execute from all locations  accessible to a user on the file system. There are several free tools available to support  the assessment of this control, including the ACSC’s ACVT, AirLock Digital’s Application  Whitelist Auditor and CyberArk’s Evasor. There are also several paid tools available. In  choosing a tool to use, make sure that it has been thoroughly tested beforehand to  ensure it is fit-for-purpose.  If publisher-based rules are used for the system, check that wildcards are not used for  publisher or product names. In addition, if path-based rules are used for the system,  check that users don’t have write access to any paths specified in application control  rulesets.  Finally, if a version of an application has been trojanised, and would otherwise be  allowed to execute due to an existing publisher or hash rule, a hash-based deny rule  should be implemented for that version. Tools used for assessments are unlikely to  detect this scenario, therefore, it will need to be identified on a case-by-case basis.  Allowed and blocked  execution events on  workstations and internet- facing servers are logged.  Ask whether logging is available for the application control solution used and request  screenshots of any logging output that shows records of executable content that was  allowed to execute as well as executable content that was blocked from executing.  23  Patch applications  Context  At this maturity level, the timeframe for patching security vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems is decreased from  one month to two weeks. In addition, this maturity level introduces patching timeframes for additional applications,  and an increase in associated vulnerability scanning frequencies and scope.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  A vulnerability scanner is  used at least weekly to  identify missing patches or  updates for security  vulnerabilities in office  productivity suites, web  browsers and their  extensions, email clients, PDF  software, and security  products.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity  Level Two timeframes.  A vulnerability scanner is  used at least fortnightly to  identify missing patches or  updates for security  vulnerabilities in other  applications.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide but apply it to other  applications using the identified timeframes.  Patches, updates or vendor  mitigations for security  vulnerabilities in office  productivity suites, web  browsers and their  extensions, email clients, PDF  software, and security  products are applied within  two weeks of release.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity  Level Two timeframes.  Patches, updates or vendor  mitigations for security  vulnerabilities in other  applications are applied  within one month of release.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide but apply it to other  applications using the identified timeframes.  24  Configure Microsoft Office macro settings  Context  At this maturity level, an additional requirement is introduced relating to the use of the Attack Surface Reduction (ASR)  rule ‘Block Win32 API calls from Office macros’. This ASR rule prevents Microsoft Office macros from calling Win32 APIs,  which adversaries can exploit to run malicious code that is more powerful than the actions they can perform using the  Microsoft Office VBA macro language itself.  Event logs for Microsoft Office macro execution events should be collected and stored in case there is a cyber security  incident and they are required for forensic or incident response purposes. Often, the lack of sufficient logging can  impact the ability to determine the extent of a cyber security incident, how it occurred and what security vulnerabilities  need to be mitigated.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Microsoft Office macros are  blocked from making Win32  API calls.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can assist in determining the implementation of this control as it  includes a test file that contains a Microsoft Office macro designed to test this ASR rule.  Note, this test will need to be conducted with an account that is allowed to execute  Microsoft Office macros.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Configure Attack Surface Reduction rules’ setting  at ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\  Microsoft Defender Antivirus\\Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard\\Attack Surface  Reduction\\’. It should be enabled and include an entry of ‘92E97FA1-2EDF-4476-BDD6- 9DD0B4DDDC7B’ with a value of 1 (i.e. enabled).  If a third-party solution is being used, discuss if the third-party solution has similar  functionality to the ASR rule. If so, request evidence as required.  Allowed and blocked  Microsoft Office macro  execution events are logged.  Within Trust Center, check whether ‘Enable Trust Center Logging’ has been enabled  within the ‘Message Bar’ section.  Request screenshots of any logging output that shows records of Microsoft Office  macros that were allowed to execute and Microsoft Office macros that were blocked  from executing.  User application hardening  Context  This maturity level requires the implementation of several ASR rules to prevent adversaries from using Microsoft Office  applications to create child processes that can be used to download and run malicious code, write malicious code to  disk or inject malicious code into other processes. In addition, the ASR rule ‘Block Adobe Reader from creating child  25  processes’ should be implemented to prevent adversaries from using Adobe Reader to create child processes which can  be used to download and run malicious code.  Adversaries often attempt to exploit security vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office through its support for Object Linking  and Embedding (OLE) packages. This maturity level requires Microsoft Office to be configured to prevent activation of  these OLE packages.  The implementation of ACSC or vendor hardening guidance can assist in reducing the attack surface of applications.  This is particularly important for key applications that are commonly targeted by adversaries such as web browsers,  Microsoft Office and Portable Document Format (PDF) software (e.g. Adobe Reader). In cases where ACSC hardening  guidance conflicts with vendor hardening guidance, consideration should be given to what the hardening guidance is  attempting to achieve.  Event logs for blocked attempts to execute PowerShell scripts should be collected and stored in case there is a cyber  security incident and they are required for forensic or incident response purposes. This should not be confused with  ‘module logging’, ‘script block logging’ and ‘transcription’ functionality of PowerShell, which while recommended for  good cyber hygiene, are not within scope of Essential Eight assessments. Often, the lack of sufficient logging can impact  the ability to determine the extent of a cyber security incident, how it occurred and what security vulnerabilities need  to be mitigated.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Microsoft Office is blocked  from creating child  processes.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can assist in determining the implementation of this control as it  includes test files that contain Microsoft Office macros designed to test each ASR rule.  Note, this test will need to be conducted with an account that is allowed to execute  Microsoft Office macros.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Configure Attack Surface Reduction rules’ setting  at ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows  Components\\Microsoft Defender Antivirus\\Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard\\Attack  Surface Reduction\\’. It should be enabled and include the entries of ‘D4F940AB-401B- 4EFC-AADC-AD5F3C50688A’ and ‘26190899-1602-49E8-8B27-EB1D0A1CE869’ with a  value of 1 (i.e. enabled).  Microsoft Office is blocked  from creating executable  content.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can assist in determining the implementation of this control as it  includes test files that contain Microsoft Office macros designed to test each ASR rule.

Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Configure Attack Surface Reduction rules’ setting  at ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows  Components\\Microsoft Defender Antivirus\\Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard\\Attack  Surface Reduction\\’. It should be enabled and include the entry of ‘75668C1F-73B5- 4CF0-BB93-3ECF5CB7CC84’ with a value of 1 (i.e. enabled).  Microsoft Office is  configured to prevent  activation of OLE packages.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can assist in determining the implementation of this control.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘PackagerPrompt’ registry setting at  ‘HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\<version>\\<Microsoft Office  Application>\\Security\\’. It should exist and be set to ‘REG_DWORD 0x00000002 (2)’.  Microsoft Office security  settings cannot be changed  by users.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can assist in determining the implementation of this control.  Within the RSoP report, look for security-related group policy settings that have been  defined for Microsoft Office. Alternatively, request a screenshot of the security settings  of each Microsoft Office application present on the system. Identify if settings are  greyed out, thereby indicating they cannot be changed by users.  PDF software is blocked  from creating child  processes.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can assist in determining the implementation of this control.  This attack surface reduction rule applies only to Adobe PDF software. As such, open  any Adobe PDF software that exists on the system, such as Adobe Acrobat, and use  File-Open to browse to a location with an exe, such as the Windows directory, change  the view to show all files, right click on an executable such as calc.exe and select Open.  The ASR rule if implemented will block this action.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Configure Attack Surface Reduction rules’ setting  at ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows  Components\\Microsoft Defender Antivirus\\Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard\\Attack  Surface Reduction\\’. It should be enabled and include the entry of ‘7674BA52-37EB- 4A4F-A9A1-F0F9A1619A2C’ with a value of 1 (i.e. enabled).  PDF software security  settings cannot be changed  by users.  Within the RSoP report, look for security-related group policy settings that have been  defined for PDF software. Alternatively, request a screenshot of the security settings of  any PDF software present on the system. Identify if settings are greyed out, thereby  indicating they cannot be changed by users.  27  ACSC or vendor hardening  guidance for web browsers,  Microsoft Office and PDF  software is implemented.  Generally, hardening guidance can be configured via group policy setting templates  that are made available by vendors. This will be included as part of any RSoP reports  that are provided.  ACSC hardening guidance for Microsoft Office is available within the Hardening  Microsoft 365, Office 2021, Office 2019 and Office 2016 publication.  Microsoft hardening guidance is available from their Microsoft Security Baselines Blog.  Blocked PowerShell script  execution events are logged.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can assist in determining the implementation of this control.  If an application control solution has been suitably configured, it should already  capture any blocked attempts to execute PowerShell scripts. If not, discuss what other  logging mechanisms are in place to capture any blocked attempts to execute  PowerShell scripts on the system and seek supporting evidence.  Restrict administrative privileges  Context  To avoid users collecting privileges and access as they change roles throughout an organisation, and to enforce the  principle of least-privileged role-based access control, privileged users should be required to regularly revalidate their  requirement for privileged access. As such, privileged accounts that have not been used within 45 days strongly indicate  that they are no longer required. Rather than accounts remaining active, and a possible target for adversaries to  exploit, inactive accounts should be disabled on a regular basis.  For Maturity Level Two, privileged operating environments must not be virtualised within unprivileged operating  environments. This constraint allows for three implementation scenarios:   physically separate operating environments   an unprivileged operating environment virtualised within a privileged operating environment   both a privileged and unprivileged operating environment virtualised within a physical host’s hardened operating  environment.  Jump servers play an important role as a centralised logging and tool enforcement point for administrative activities,  even when privileged operating environments are used.  The use of a common local administrator password for every workstation and server is a common approach in poorly- secured networks due to its ease of use. A marginally more secure approach is using passwords that are a combination  of a fixed component and a dynamic component (e.g. including a unique asset identifier). While the latter may appear  to be secure, if adversaries are able to compromise one or more local administrator passwords they may be able to  discern a pattern. Ideally, an approach that ensures local administrator and service accounts are unique, unpredictable  and managed should be used. For example, Microsoft’s Local Administrator Password Solution.  Event logs relating to the use of, and changes to, privileged accounts should be collected and stored in case there is a  cyber security incident and they are required for forensic or incident response purposes. Often, the lack of sufficient  logging can impact the ability to determine the extent of a cyber security incident, how it occurred and what security  vulnerabilities need to be mitigated.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-hardening/hardening-microsoft-365-office-2021-office-2019-and-office-2016 https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-hardening/hardening-microsoft-365-office-2021-office-2019-and-office-2016 https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-baselines/bg-p/Microsoft-Security-Baselines https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=46899  28  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Privileged access to systems  and applications is  automatically disabled after  12 months unless  revalidated.  Check whether an account expiry date is set in Active Directory under account profiles  and whether a mechanism exists to automatically disable accounts after 12 months  unless revalidated beforehand. Ask for a screenshot of the output of the following  PowerShell commands that check for accounts with either no expiration date or have  an expiration date that exceeds 12 months:  Get-ADUser -Filter {(admincount -eq 1) -and (enabled -eq $true)} -Properties  AccountExpirationDate | Where-Object {$_.AccountExpirationDate -like “” | Select  @{n=‘Username’; e={$_.SamAccountName}}, @{n=‘Account Expiration Date’;  e={$_.AccountExpirationDate}}, @{n=‘Enabled’; e={$_.Enabled}}  Get-ADUser -Filter {(admincount -eq 1) -and (enabled -eq $true)} -Properties  AccountExpirationDate | Where-Object {$_.AccountExpirationDate -gt (Get- Date).AddMonths(12)} | Select @{n=‘Username’; e={$_.SamAccountName}},  @{n=‘Account Expiration Date’; e={$_.AccountExpirationDate}}, @{n=‘Enabled’;  e={$_.Enabled}}  Privileged access to systems  and applications is  automatically disabled after  45 days of inactivity.  Microsoft provides guidance on the use of PowerShell to identify inactive accounts  based on when they were last used to logon to a system. Ask for a screenshot of the  output of the following PowerShell command that checks for inactive accounts to  demonstrate that this activity takes place on a daily basis:  Get-ADUser -Filter {(admincount -eq 1) -and (enabled -eq $true)} -Properties  LastLogonDate | Where-Object {$_.LastLogonDate -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-45) - and$_.LastLogonDate -ne $null} | Select @{n=‘Username’; e={$_.samaccountname}},  @{n=‘Last Logon Date’; e={$_.LastLogonDate}}, @{n=‘Enabled’; e={$_.enabled}}  Privileged operating  environments are not  virtualised within  unprivileged operating  environments.  Discuss how privileged operating environments have been implemented for the  management of the system. It should align to one of the implementation scenarios  within the context section of this mitigation strategy and be covered within the security  documentation for the system.  Administrative activities are  conducted through jump  servers.  Tools such as BloodHound can be used to determine the path administrators are using  to log in and which servers are jump servers.  Request a system administrator demonstrate creating and removing a test user  account to confirm the use of jump servers.  Discuss the network structure for the system to determine if jump servers have been  implemented for administrative activities. This should be visible in network diagrams  for the system.  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/services-hub/health/remediation-steps-ad/regularly-check-for-and-remove-inactive-user-accounts-in-active-directory https://www.sans.org/blog/bloodhound-sniffing-out-path-through-windows-domains/  29  Credentials for local  administrator accounts and  service accounts are long,  unique, unpredictable and  managed.  Discuss how local administrator and service accounts are managed. Confirm if  Microsoft’s Local Administrator Password Solution, or another suitable approach that  results in long, unique and unpredictable passwords for each workstation and server, is  used.  To check if all computers have LAPS configured, run the following PowerShell  commands and compare the output:  Get-ADComputer -Filter {ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime -like “*”} -Properties ms-Mcs- AdmPwdExpirationTime | measure  Get-ADComputer -Filter {Enabled -eq $true} | measure  Discuss how group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs) are managed. gMSAs are  domain accounts that use 240-byte randomly generated complex passwords. gMSAs  shift password management to the Windows operating system, which changes the  password every 30 days.  Privileged access events are  logged.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Audit Sensitive Privilege Use’ setting at ‘Computer  Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Advanced Audit Policy  Configuration\\Audit Policies\\Privilege Use\\’. It should be enabled with a value of  ‘Success and Failure’.  In addition, look for the ‘Audit Logon’, ‘Audit Other Logon/Logoff Events’ and ‘Audit  Special Logon’ settings at ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security  Settings\\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration\\Audit Policies\\Logon/Logoff’. They  should be enabled with a value of ‘Success and Failure’.  Finally, look for the ‘Audit Logoff’ setting at ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\  Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration\\Audit  Policies\\Logon/Logoff’. It should be enabled with a value of ‘Success’.  Privileged account and group  management events are  logged.  Using the specific event IDs (available from Microsoft Docs), check whether changes to  privileged accounts and groups are logged in event viewer or a SIEM tool.  More information on security operations for privileged accounts in Active Directory,  including specific event IDs for this control, can be found at Microsoft Docs.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Audit Computer Account Management’ and ‘Audit  User Account Management’ settings at ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows  Settings\\Security Settings\\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration\\Audit Policies\\Account  Management\\’. They should be enabled with a value of ‘Success and Failure’.  In addition, look for the ‘Audit Security Group Management’ setting at ‘Computer  Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Advanced Audit Policy  Configuration\\Audit Policies\\Account Management\\’. It should be enabled with a value  of ‘Success and Failure’.  https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=46899 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/service-accounts-group-managed https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/security-operations-privileged-accounts  30  Patch operating systems  Context  At this maturity level, the timeframe for patching security vulnerabilities in operating systems is decreased from one  month to two weeks. In addition, this maturity level requires weekly vulnerability scanning.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  A vulnerability scanner is  used at least weekly to  identify missing patches or  updates for security  vulnerabilities in operating  systems of workstations,  servers and network devices.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity  Level Two timeframes.  Patches, updates or vendor  mitigations for security  vulnerabilities in operating  systems of workstations,  servers and network devices  are applied within two weeks  of release.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity  Level Two timeframes.  Multi-factor authentication  Context  At this maturity level, an additional requirement for all privileged users logging onto systems, both locally and remotely,  to use multi-factor authentication is introduced. In addition, the authentication methods that can be used, and in what  combination, are restricted to avoid weaker implementations. Specifically, acceptable multi-factor authentication  implementations include:   something users have (i.e. look-up secret, out-of-band device, single-factor one-time PIN (OTP) devices, single- factor cryptographic software or single factor cryptographic device) in addition to something users know (i.e. a  memorised secret)   something users have that is unlocked by something users know or are (i.e. multi-factor OTP device, multi-factor  cryptographic software or multi-factor cryptographic device).  Biometrics are not acceptable at this maturity level. This is due to biometric characteristics not being secrets, biometric  matching being probabilistic rather than deterministic and there being a reliance on the security of biometric capture  software installed on devices. However, biometrics can be used to unlock another authentication factor (e.g. a  certificate stored in a Trusted Platform Module or an OTP generator app on a smartphone). Trusted Signals are also not  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/feature-multifactor-unlock  31  acceptable at this maturity level. This is due to issues associated with placing trust in the signal itself, which can be  targeted and spoofed by adversaries.  While not yet excluded at this maturity level, organisations may want to avoiding authentication methods increasingly  being subject to MFA fatigue or social engineering attempts by adversaries, such as push notifications and SMS codes.  Event logs for multi-factor authentication events should be collected and stored in case they are required to support  forensic or incident response activities following a cyber security incident. The lack of sufficient logging can impact the  ability to determine the extent of a cyber security incident, how it occurred and what security vulnerabilities need to be  mitigated.  Note, at this maturity level organisations may choose to implement multi-factor authentication solutions that are  phishing-resistant, such as security keys or smartcards, if they intend to eventually implement requirements for  Maturity Level Three.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Multi-factor authentication  is used to authenticate  privileged users of systems.  Observe an administrator authenticate to a system to check whether they are required  to use MFA. Alternatively, request evidence of the logon screen for a privileged user.  The logon screen should show multiple authentication methods being requested.  Multi-factor authentication  uses either: something users  have and something users  know, or something users  have that is unlocked by  something users know or  are.  Discuss the implementation of multi-factor authentication for users. Note, multiple  different forms of multi-factor authentication may exist depending on the number of  different systems and internet-facing services that users authenticate to. For example,  multi-factor authentication for administration of cloud services might involve a  different implementation to multi-factor authentication for administration of on- premises services. Furthermore, not all third-party internet-facing services may offer  the same multi-factor authentication implementation.  Discussions should also include distinguishing between multi-step authentication and  multi-factor authentication, as well as different levels of security provided by different  multi-factor authentication implementations. For example, a security key or smartcard  is more secure than a hardware OTP device which is more secure than an OTP mobile  app which is more secure than a push notification or SMS code sent to a smartphone.  Successful and unsuccessful  multi-factor authentication  events are logged.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Audit Logon’ and ‘Audit Special Logon’ settings at  ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Advanced Audit  Policy Configuration\\Audit Policies\\Logon/Logoff\\’. They should be enabled with a  value of ‘Success and Failure’.  For certain MFA implementations the above guidance may not be applicable. In these  instances discuss whether logging is available for all systems that users authenticate to  and seek evidence that such logging is in place.  If an administrator logon was observed (per the first control in this table), request  recent event logs to check that there is a corresponding event log entry.  32  Regular backups  Context  At this maturity level, privileged accounts (with the exception of backup administrator accounts) are limited to only  accessing their own backups, and should not be able to modify and delete backups.  It is important that backup administrator accounts (as well as user accounts in general) are provisioned following the  principles of least privilege and separation of duties. As such, backup administrator accounts should only be given to a  small group of trusted administrators and a separate group should be setup for the purpose of restoring backups.  Excessive permissions for accounts increases the chance that they will be compromised. Should this occur for these  accounts, adversaries performing ransomware attacks can easily encrypt or delete all backups.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Privileged accounts  (excluding backup  administrator accounts)  cannot access backups  belonging to other accounts.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity  Level Two access control requirements. Specifically, privileged accounts should only be  able to access their own backups (except for backup administrator accounts).  Active Directory queries and tools such as BloodHound can help to identify privileged  accounts including backup administrator accounts.  Privileged accounts  (excluding backup  administrator accounts) are  prevented from modifying  and deleting backups.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity  Level Two access control requirements. Specifically, privileged accounts should no  longer be able to modify and delete backups. Such activities should be restricted to  backup administrator accounts.  Active Directory queries and tools such as BloodHound can help to identify privileged  accounts including backup administrator accounts.  Maturity Level Three  The focus of this maturity level is adversaries who are more adaptive and much less reliant on public tools and  techniques. These adversaries are able to exploit the opportunities provided by weaknesses in their target’s cyber  security posture, such as the existence of older operating systems or inadequate logging and monitoring. Adversaries  do this to not only extend their access once initial access has been gained to a target, but to evade detection and  solidify their presence. Adversaries make swift use of exploits when they become publicly available as well as other  tradecraft that can improve their chance of success.  Generally, at this level, adversaries are more focused on particular targets and, more importantly, are willing and able  to invest effort into circumventing particular policy and technical controls implemented by their targets. For example,  this includes socially engineering a user to execute a malicious Microsoft Office macro or circumventing multi-factor  authentication implementations by stealing authentication token values to impersonate a user. Once a foothold is  gained on a system, adversaries seek to gain privileged credentials or password hashes, pivot to other parts of a  network, and cover their tracks. Depending on their intent, adversaries may also destroy all data (including backups).  https://www.sans.org/blog/bloodhound-sniffing-out-path-through-windows-domains/ https://www.sans.org/blog/bloodhound-sniffing-out-path-through-windows-domains/  33  The guidance below outlines the requirements to be assessed in addition to the requirements of the previous maturity  level. In doing so, assessments against Maturity Level Three should focus on the delta between Maturity Level Two and  Maturity Level Three.  Application control  Context  At this maturity level, the scope of application control is expanded to include drivers and all servers (not just internet- facing servers). Note, while Microsoft AppLocker does not currently support the control of drivers, Windows Defender  Application Control (WDAC) does. This maturity level also includes the requirement for centralised logging of allowed  and blocked execution events on workstations and servers.  Microsoft maintains a list of application control bypasses and malicious drivers that have been discovered by security  researchers and adversaries. Implementing Microsoft’s recommended block rules and recommended driver block rules  can help to provide protection from adversaries that would have looked at using these against an otherwise robust  application control implementation to gain access to a system.  When implementing an application control solution, an organisation may develop application control rulesets but fail to  ensure they remains fit-for-purpose by reviewing them on a regular basis. This can lead to the potential failure to  identify several scenarios, such as operating system vendors changing permissions on paths as part of updates or  upgrades, exploitable applications or drivers remaining approved for a system, vendor code-signing certificates being  compromised, or system administrators introducing exceptions to ‘get things working’ or troubleshoot but failing to  remove the workarounds afterwards. Each of these scenarios are real, having been observed during assessments, and  introduce additional security vulnerabilities into a system that may be exploited by adversaries.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Application control is  implemented on  workstations and servers.  It is important to note that at this maturity level the scope has been expanded to  include all servers. As such, use the guidance provided in Maturity Level Two of this  guide and apply it to all servers rather than just internet-facing servers.  Application control restricts  the execution of executables,  software libraries, scripts,  installers, compiled HTML,  HTML applications, control  panel applets and drivers to  an organisation-approved  set.  Depending on the application control solution, controlling the execution of drivers may  or may not be supported. Request a copy of application control rulesets to check for  the inclusion of drivers.  Microsoft’s ‘recommended  block rules’ are  implemented.  Request a copy of application control rulesets. Check whether Microsoft’s  recommended block rules have been specified.  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/microsoft-recommended-block-rules https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/microsoft-recommended-driver-block-rules https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/microsoft-recommended-block-rules  34  Microsoft’s ‘recommended  driver block rules’ are  implemented.  Depending on the application control solution, controlling the execution of drivers may  or may not be supported. Request a copy of application control rulesets to check for  the inclusion of drivers. If drivers are included, check whether Microsoft’s  recommended driver block rules have been specified.  Application control rulesets  are validated on an annual  or more frequent basis.  Discuss how application control rulesets are validated and with what frequency. In  addition, discuss the governance processes and procedures around making changings  to application control rulesets and any testing or reviews that are conducted following  operating system upgrades and the addition or removal of applications.  Allowed and blocked  execution events on  workstations and servers are  centrally logged.  Request the event logs associated with the testing performed using application control  testing tools. Discuss whether event logs are stored locally or centrally.  Note, organisations that are comfortable that certain events have a high probability of  being legitimate may choose to filter them out as part of their centralised collection in  order to simplify event log analysis and reduce storage requirements.  Event logs are protected  from unauthorised  modification and deletion.  Discuss whether a security information and event management (SIEM) solution is  appropriately configured for the protection of event logs.  Event logs are monitored for  signs of compromise and  actioned when any signs of  compromise are detected.  Discuss whether a SIEM solution supported by security operations centre (SOC)  analysts is used to monitor event logs for signs of compromise and respond when any  signs of compromise are detected.  Patch applications  Context  At this maturity level, patches, updates or vendor mitigations must be applied within 48 hours rather than two weeks if  an exploit exists. In addition, all applications that are no longer supported by vendors should be removed.  This requirement can be assessed in a similar way to Maturity Level Two, except that if an exploit exists, patches,  updates and vendor mitigations must be applied within 48 hours rather than two weeks.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting an assessment method, the  quality of the evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/microsoft-recommended-driver-block-rules  35  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Patches, updates or vendor  mitigations for security  vulnerabilities in office  productivity suites, web  browsers and their  extensions, email clients, PDF  software, and security  products are applied within  two weeks of release, or  within 48 hours if an exploit  exists.  Use the relevant guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the  Maturity Level Three timeframes when exploits exist for security vulnerabilities.  Applications that are no  longer supported by vendors  are removed.  Use the relevant guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and extend it to  all applications.  Configure Microsoft Office macro settings  Context  Disabling the use of Microsoft Office macros represents an optimal security outcome, however, some users will have a  business requirement for their use. In such situations, additional controls should be implemented to make the use of  Microsoft Office macros as secure as possible. This may include either running Microsoft Office macros from within a  sandboxed environment, from an appropriately controlled Trusted Location or ensuring they are digitally signed by a  trusted publisher.  As Microsoft Office allows any files that are opened from a Trusted Location to bypass security checks, it is critical that  only trusted users can write to or modify content in these locations. Under no circumstances should Trusted Locations  be specified within a user’s profile, such as their desktop or documents folders.  If the ‘Disable all macros except digitally signed macros’ setting is used, this will allow any Microsoft Office macro  signed by a trusted publisher to execute without prompting the user for permission. However, any Microsoft Office  macro that is digitally signed by an untrusted publisher will ask users to decide as to whether they would like to allow  the Microsoft Office macro to execute via the Message Bar or Backstage View. While this prompt can be disabled using  a group policy setting, the removal of the option to enable Microsoft Office macros via the Backstage View requires the  implementation of an undocumented graphical user interface setting.  When implementing a digitally signed Microsoft Office macro approach, an organisation may identify a list of trusted  publishers but fail to review them on a regular basis for their ongoing suitability. This can create issues when a vendor’s  code-signing certificate is compromised. Ideally, an organisation should acquire their own code-signing certificate and  re-sign any Microsoft Office macros they trust, even if already signed by a third party. While introducing additional  overhead, this mitigates the risk of trusting compromised third-party code-signing certificates.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  36  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Only Microsoft Office  macros running from within  a sandboxed environment, a  Trusted Location or that are  digitally signed by a trusted  publisher are allowed to  execute.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘VBA Macro Notification Settings’ setting at ‘User  Configuration\\Policies\\Administration Templates\\<Microsoft Office  Application>\\Application Settings\\Security\\Trust Center\\’. It should be enabled and  configured to ‘Disable all macros without notification’ (if Trusted Locations are used) or  ‘Disable all macros except digitally signed macros’ (if digitally signed Microsoft Office  macros are used).  Note, an organisation may choose to use a combination of Trusted Locations and  digitally signed Microsoft Office macros. However, if only digitally signed Microsoft  Office macros are used then Trusted Locations should be disabled.  Within each Microsoft Office application, request a screenshot showing Trust Center  macro settings (File – Options – Trust Center – Trust Center Settings – Macro Settings).  In addition, request a screenshot showing Trust Center trusted publisher settings (File –  Options – Trust Center – Trust Center Settings – Trusted Publishers).  For the assessment of Microsoft Office macro security, identify what setting is selected  for ‘macro settings’. The setting should either be set to ‘Disable all macros without  notification’ (if Trusted Locations are used) or ‘Disable all macros except digitally signed  macros’ (if digitally signed Microsoft Office macros are used). For the assessment of  Trusted Locations, check whether the ‘Disable all trusted locations’ option has been  checked or not. If it has not, then Trusted Locations are enabled and should be  individually assessed for their suitability.  Only privileged users  responsible for validating  that Microsoft Office macros  are free of malicious code  can write to and modify  content within Trusted  Locations.  For each Trusted Location that is specified, review the effective file system permissions  for that location (i.e. similar to the assessment for application control at Maturity Level  One). If able to, the assessor should seek to review file system permissions themselves  rather than requesting a screenshot.  Check the total number of users who are in the groups that have the relevant file  system permissions.  Microsoft Office macros  digitally signed by an  untrusted publisher cannot  be enabled via the Message  Bar or Backstage View.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Disable all Trust Bar notifications for security  issues’ setting at ‘User Configuration\\Policies\\Administration Templates\\Microsoft  Office <version>\\Security Settings\\’. It should be enabled.  In addition, look for the ‘Disable commands’ setting at ‘User  Configuration\\Policies\\Administration Templates\\<Microsoft Office  Application>\\Disable Items in User Interface\\Custom\\’. It should be enabled with a  value of ‘Enter a command bar ID to disable: 19092’.  Microsoft Office’s list of  trusted publishers is  validated on an annual or  more frequent basis.  For the assessment of trusted publishers, check which publishers are listed. Ideally, this  should only be a code-signing certificate belonging to the organisation. Alternatively, if  external vendors’ code-signing certificates are listed, discuss how often these are  reviewed and what mechanisms are used to identify when/if these need to be removed  due to compromise by adversaries as part of supply chain attacks.  37  Allowed and blocked  Microsoft Office macro  execution events are  centrally logged.  Request the event logs associated with the testing performed using tools that attempt  to run Microsoft Office macros. Discuss whether event logs are stored locally or  centrally.  Note, organisations that are comfortable that certain events have a high probability of  being legitimate may choose to filter them out as part of their centralised collection in  order to simplify event log analysis and reduce storage requirements.  Event logs are protected  from unauthorised  modification and deletion.  Discuss whether a SIEM solution is appropriately configured for the protection of event  logs.  Event logs are monitored for  signs of compromise and  actioned when any signs of  compromise are detected.  Discuss whether a SIEM solution supported by SOC analysts is used to monitor event  logs for signs of compromise and respond when any signs of compromise are detected.  User application hardening  Context  At this maturity level, Internet Explorer 11 must be removed from operating systems rather than just blocked from  accessing the internet or opening files from the internet. Note, Internet Explorer 11 is not available in Microsoft  Windows 11. For Microsoft Windows 10 however, Internet Explorer 11 will progressively be phased out and eventually  removed from the operating system via a future update (depending on the version of Microsoft Windows 10 being  used).  .NET Framework 3.5 (including .NET 2.0 and 3.0) is often targeted by adversaries due to its lack of security functionality  when compared to newer versions of the .NET Framework, as well as due to its linkages to PowerShell 2.0. Within  Microsoft Windows 11 and Microsoft Windows 10, there are two separate features relating to the .NET Framework,  ‘.NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and .NET 3.0)’ and ‘.NET Framework 4.8 Advanced Services’.  Microsoft ended support for Windows PowerShell 2.0 in late 2017. At that time, Microsoft noted that Windows  PowerShell 2.0 lacked the security functionality of Windows PowerShell 5.0 and higher.  Constrained Language Mode for PowerShell is designed to prevent PowerShell users (which may include adversaries)  from running tools that exploit PowerShell or load Component Object Model objects, libraries and classes into a  PowerShell session.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  38  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Internet Explorer 11 is  disabled or removed.  For Microsoft Windows 11: This requirement is not applicable.  For Microsoft Windows 10: Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Computer  Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Internet  Explorer/Disable Internet Explorer 11 as a standalone browser’ setting. It should be  enabled.  Alternatively, request a screenshot of the ‘Windows Features’ that are installed. This  can be accessed via (Settings – Apps & features – Programs and Features – Turn  Windows features on or off). Check whether Internet Explorer 11 is installed by  checking for a tick or black square. Note, if Internet Explorer 11 has already been  removed it may not appear in the list of Windows Features.  .NET Framework 3.5  (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0) is  disabled or removed.  Request a screenshot of the ‘Windows Features’ that are installed.  For Microsoft Windows 11, this can be accessed via (Settings – Apps – Optional  features – More Windows features).  For Microsoft Windows 10, this can be accessed via (Settings – Apps & features –  Programs and Features – Turn Windows features on or off).  Check which of the .NET Frameworks are installed by checking for a tick or black  square. Note, enabling .NET Framework 3.5 will automatically enable PowerShell 2.0.  Windows PowerShell 2.0 is  disabled or removed.  Request a screenshot of the ‘Windows Features’ that are installed.  For Microsoft Windows 11, this can be accessed via (Settings – Apps – Optional  features – More Windows features).  For Microsoft Windows 10, this can be accessed via (Settings – Apps & features –  Programs and Features – Turn Windows features on or off).  Check if legacy versions of PowerShell are installed by checking for a tick or black  square against ‘Windows PowerShell 2.0’. To check if a downgrade to PowerShell 2.0 is  available, run the following PowerShell command:  Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -online | Where-Object {$_.FeatureName -match  “PowerShellv2”}  PowerShell is configured to  use Constrained Language  Mode.  Request a screenshot of the output of running the following PowerShell command:  $ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode.  If Constrained Language Mode is enabled, the output will be ‘ConstrainedLanguage’.  Otherwise, the output will be ‘FullLanguage’.  Blocked PowerShell script  execution events are  centrally logged.  Run a PowerShell script that should be blocked and request evidence of the associated  event log entry. Discuss whether event logs are stored locally or centrally.  Note, organisations that are comfortable that certain events have a high probability of  being legitimate may choose to filter them out as part of their centralised collection in  order to simplify event log analysis and reduce storage requirements.  39  Event logs are protected  from unauthorised  modification and deletion.  Discuss whether a SIEM solution is appropriately configured for the protection of event  logs.  Event logs are monitored for  signs of compromise and  actioned when any signs of  compromise are detected.  Discuss whether a SIEM solution supported by SOC analysts is used to monitor event  logs for signs of compromise and respond when any signs of compromise are detected.  Restrict administrative privileges  Context  Staff seeking access to systems and applications, especially with privileged access, should have a genuine business  requirement to do so. Once a requirement to access a system or application is established, staff should be provided  with only the privileges they require to undertake their duties. This can be achieved using role-based access controls.  Just-in-time (JIT) privileged access management (PAM) is an extension of role-based access control in which privileged  users are only granted the access required to perform their duties immediately before that access is required and for  only as long as it is required.  Within an active user session, credentials are cached within the Local Security Authority System Service process to  allow for access to network resources without users having to repeatedly enter their credentials. Windows Defender  Credential Guard is designed to assist in protecting this process. Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard provides  a similar functionality for remote access.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Privileged access to systems  and applications is limited to  only what is required for  users and services to  undertake their duties.  Discuss the approach that the organisation has taken to restrict privileged users to only  what is required for them to undertake their duties. Often this will involve identifying  several different roles, developing policies for those roles and assigning privileged users  to one or more of those roles depending on their duties. A system administrator should  be able to demonstrate the different user groups and policies or access controls that  apply to each. This can confirmed via an RSoP report.  Privileged accounts are  prevented from accessing the  internet, email and web  services.  Use the relevant guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and extend to  include privileged service accounts.  40  Just-in-time administration  is used for administering  systems and applications.  The implementation of JIT PAM is a complex activity that forms the basis for restricting  administrative privileges at Maturity Level Three. Given the complex nature of JIT PAM,  it will become apparent from discussions as to whether a JIT PAM approach has been  adopted or not. In doing so, it may be worthwhile observing the process of a system  administrator requesting and being granted JIT access.  Windows Defender  Credential Guard and  Windows Defender Remote  Credential Guard are  enabled.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Turn On Virtualization Based Security’ setting at  ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\System\\Device Guard\\’. It  should be enabled with a value of ‘Credential Guard Configuration: Enabled with UEFI  lock’.  In addition, look for the ‘Restrict delegation of credentials to remote servers’ setting at  ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\System\\Credentials  Delegation\\’. It should be enabled with a value of ‘Use the following restricted mode:  Require Remote Credential Guard’.  Note, the use of Windows Defender Credential Guard and Windows Defender Remote  Credential Guard has several hardware and software requirements. More information  on Windows Defender Credential Guard can be found at Microsoft Docs.  Privileged access events are  centrally logged.  Request event logs that should have been generated for typical activities associated  with the use of a privileged account, such as logging onto a system. Discuss whether  event logs are stored locally or centrally.  Note, organisations that are comfortable that certain events have a high probability of  being legitimate may choose to filter them out as part of their centralised collection in  order to simplify event log analysis and reduce storage requirements.  Privileged account and group  management events are  centrally logged.  If an administrator account was created for testing purposes, request the associated  event logs that should have been generated when the account was created and added  to a privileged group. Discuss whether event logs are stored locally or centrally.  Note, organisations that are comfortable that certain events have a high probability of  being legitimate may choose to filter them out as part of their centralised collection in  order to simplify event log analysis and reduce storage requirements.  Event logs are protected  from unauthorised  modification and deletion.  Discuss whether a SIEM solution is appropriately configured for the protection of event  logs.  Event logs are monitored for  signs of compromise and  actioned when any signs of  compromise are detected.  Discuss whether a SIEM solution supported by SOC analysts is used to monitor event  logs for signs of compromise and respond when any signs of compromise are detected.  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-requirements https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-manage  41  Patch operating systems  Context  At this maturity level, patches, updates or vendor mitigations for security vulnerabilities in operating systems of  workstations, servers and network devices are required to be applied within two weeks of release, or within 48 hours if  an exploit exists.  Modern operating systems for workstations, servers and network devices often contain security functionality that is not  available in earlier releases, even if those earlier releases remain supported by vendors. It is important that an  organisation takes advantage of new security functionality in later releases to further mitigate adversary activities.  The latest release of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Server will depend on the servicing branch being used. Further  release information is available from Microsoft. Similar information is often available from vendors of network devices.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Patches, updates or vendor  mitigations for security  vulnerabilities in operating  systems of workstations,  servers and network devices  are applied within two weeks  of release, or within 48 hours  if an exploit exists.  Use the relevant guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the  Maturity Level Three timeframes when exploits exist for security vulnerabilities.  The latest release, or the  previous release, of  operating systems are used.  Network-based vulnerability scanners can be used to identify operating systems and  their versions. The output of these tools can then be used to check against the latest  operating system versions available from vendors.  For Microsoft Windows workstations and servers, the ‘winver’ command can be run to  determine the version of the operating system. Request a screenshot of the output of  running the ‘winver’ command for servers and workstations (assuming a Standard  Operating Environment is used for workstations).  Multi-factor authentication  Context  At this maturity level, all users accessing important data repositories should be using multi-factor authentication.  Furthermore, the types and combinations of multi-factor authentication are further restricted to avoid weaker forms of  multi-factor authentication, especially those susceptible to phishing attacks. This can be achieved by ensuring that  clients cryptographically verify the authenticity of the server that they are authenticating to. For example, using  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/release-health/release-information  42  phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication would result in fake Microsoft 365 login pages being identified as such,  rather than fooling users and capturing their credentials (including additional authentication factors).  The acceptable forms of multi-factor authentication at this maturity level are generally limited to including either a  security key, smartcard or Trusted Platform Module.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Multi-factor authentication  is used to authenticate users  accessing important data  repositories.  Request a list of important data repositories for the system and associated screenshots  of users attempting to access each of these data repositories. The screenshots should  show multiple forms of authentication being requested.  Multi-factor authentication is  phishing-resistant and uses  either: something users have  and something users know,  or something users have that  is unlocked by something  users know or are.  Discuss the form of multi-factor authentication that has been implemented. Note,  different forms of multi-factor authentication may exist depending on the range of  systems, services and data repositories that users authenticate to.  Successful and unsuccessful  multi-factor authentication  events are centrally logged.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level Two of this guide and extend it to include  event logs for multi-factor authentication performed when accessing important data  repositories. Discuss whether event logs are stored locally or centrally.  Note, organisations that are comfortable that certain events have a high probability of  being legitimate may choose to filter them out as part of their centralised collection in  order to simplify event log analysis and reduce storage requirements.  Event logs are protected  from unauthorised  modification and deletion.  Discuss whether a SIEM solution is appropriately configured for the protection of event  logs.  Event logs are monitored for  signs of compromise and  actioned when any signs of  compromise are detected.  Discuss whether a SIEM solution supported by SOC analysts is used to monitor event  logs for signs of compromise and respond when any signs of compromise are detected.  43  Regular backups  Context  At this maturity level, only a subset of privileged accounts (i.e. backup administrator accounts) should be able to access  backups. The increasing level of controls around which accounts can access backups, and to what extent, progressively  limits the damage that may be caused by a ransomware incident.  In addition, at this maturity level, all accounts (except for break glass accounts) should not be able to modify and delete  backups.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Unprivileged accounts cannot  access backups belonging to  other accounts, nor their  own accounts.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity  Level Three access control requirements. Specifically, unprivileged accounts should no  longer be able to access their own backups.  Privileged accounts  (excluding backup  administrator accounts)  cannot access backups  belonging to other accounts,  nor their own accounts.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity  Level Three access control requirements. Specifically, privileged accounts (excluding  backup administrator accounts) should no longer be able to access their own backups.  Active Directory queries and tools such as BloodHound can help to identify privileged  accounts including backup administrator accounts.  Privileged accounts  (including backup  administrator accounts) are  prevented from modifying  and deleting backups during  their retention period.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity  Level Three access control requirements. Specifically, backup administrator accounts  should no longer be able to modify and delete backups during their retention period,  but may do so after the retention period has been exceeded.  The modification and deletion of backups during their retention period, should such  activities be required, need to be restricted to break glass accounts.  Active Directory queries and tools such as BloodHound can help to identify privileged  accounts (including backup administrator accounts) and break glass accounts.  Stage 4: Development of the security assessment  report  In developing the security assessment report, assessors should use the ACSC’s Essential Eight Assessment Report  Template. However, assessors can use their own report templates for branding purposes if all sections from the ACSC’s  template are included.  https://www.sans.org/blog/bloodhound-sniffing-out-path-through-windows-domains/ https://www.sans.org/blog/bloodhound-sniffing-out-path-through-windows-domains/ https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight-assessment-process-guide https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight-assessment-process-guide  44  Further information  The Information Security Manual is a cyber security framework that organisations can apply to protect their systems  and data from cyber threats. The advice in the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents, along with its Essential  Eight, complements this framework.  A mapping between the requirements of the Essential Eight Maturity Model and the Information Security Manual can  be found in the Essential Eight Maturity Model to ISM Mapping publication.

E8MVT will perform limited (single folder) testing for file execution in user profiles and temporary directories.  Patch applications An automated method  of asset discovery is  used at least  fortnightly to support  the detection of assets  for subsequent  vulnerability scanning  activities.  ML1-PA-01 An automated method of asset discovery is run and reviewed at least  fortnightly.  Confirm that a method of asset discovery is in place (such as an asset discovery tool or a vulnerability scanner with equivalent  functionality) and that it is configured to be run in an automated manner at least every fortnight. Confirm that any anomalies  that are identified are reviewed and actioned.  A vulnerability scanner  with an up-to-date  vulnerability database  ML1-PA-02 A vulnerability scanner with an up-to-date vulnerability database is being used  for vulnerability scanning activities.  Confirm that a vulnerability scanner is in place and that the vulnerability database it uses is being updated within 24 hours prior  to its use.  46  is used for vulnerability  scanning activities.  A vulnerability scanner  is used at least daily to  identify missing  patches or updates for  security vulnerabilities  in internet-facing  services.  ML1-PA-03 (Internet-Facing Services) A vulnerability scanner for internet-facing services is  run and reviewed daily.  Confirm that a vulnerability scanner is in place, and it is configured to scan the organisation’s internet-facing services. Confirm  that reports from the vulnerability scanner are reviewed by the responsible staff daily, and that identified issues have been  observed and actioned.  A vulnerability scanner  is used at least  fortnightly to identify  missing patches or  updates for security  vulnerabilities in office  productivity suites,  web browsers and  their extensions, email  clients, PDF software,  and security products.  ML1-PA-04 A vulnerability scanner is run and reviewed at least fortnightly to scan the  organisation’s office productivity suites, web browsers, email clients, PDF  software and security products.  Confirm that a vulnerability scanner is in place, and it is configured to scan the organisation’s applications listed, typically  requiring a credentialed scan. Confirm that reports from the vulnerability scanner are reviewed by the responsible staff  fortnightly, and that identified issues have been observed and actioned.  Patches, updates or  vendor mitigations for  security vulnerabilities  in internet-facing  services are applied  within two weeks of  release, or within 48  hours if an exploit  exists.  ML1-PA-05 (Internet-Facing Services) The organisation has a process for identifying  vulnerabilities in internet-facing services within 48 hours and has an example  of where an available exploit has been identified and patched within 48 hours.  Review the process in place for identifying vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems. Request evidence of the identification and  patching of a system that contained an exploitable vulnerability within the environment.  ML1-PA-06 (Internet-Facing Services) Applications with an exploit that has been available  for greater than 48 hours are patched or mitigated.  Use a vulnerability scanner to identify applications within the environment and check that they have been patched against a  known exploit. Determine the date the patch was installed and compare to when the patch was made available.  ML1-PA-07 (Internet-Facing Services) Applications are patched or mitigated within two  weeks.  Use a vulnerability scanner to identify applications within the environment and check that they have been patched against a  known exploit. Determine the date the patch was installed and compare to when the patch was made available.  Patches, updates or  vendor mitigations for  security vulnerabilities  in office productivity  suites, web browsers  and their extensions,  email clients, PDF  software, and security  products are applied  within one month of  release.  ML1-PA-08 The organisation has an effective process for patching office productivity  suites, web browsers, email clients, PDF software and security products within  one month.  Confirm the existence of a list of applications, and where the applications are installed. Ensure a process for identifying  vulnerabilities for software in the list is consistently followed. Request evidence of the patching of these applications within one  month.  ML1-PA-09 Office productivity suites, web browsers, email clients, PDF software and  security products do not have security vulnerabilities older than one month.  Use a vulnerability scanner to identify the listed applications within the organisation’s environment, and check that they have  been patched against a known exploit. Check the date the application was updated and compare to the date the patch was  released. Ensure that the gap between is not greater than one month.  E8MVT will perform basic checks of some Microsoft Office applications based on version numbers and file modification dates to  determine if the software has been updated recently.  Internet-facing  services, office  productivity suites,  web browsers and  their extensions, email  clients, PDF software,  Adobe Flash Player,  ML1-PA-10 The organisation has removed unsupported internet-facing services from the  environment.  Confirm that the environment does not contain software on internet-facing systems that is no longer supported by the vendor.

Configure  Microsoft Office  macro settings  Microsoft Office  macros are disabled  for users that do not  have a demonstrated  business requirement.  ML1-OM-01 A technical solution exists that blocks Microsoft Office macros for users who  are not approved under the Microsoft Office macro policy.  Run RSOP on workstations to identify the Microsoft Office macro security settings applied by group policy settings. This should  typically be set to ‘Disable without notification’. Note ‘Disable with notification’ allows users to bypass this control and does not  meet the intent. Check for Active Directory security groups that enforce Microsoft Office macro blocking.  Test running Microsoft Office macros on a user in the disallowed group. E8MVT will attempt to execute a Microsoft Office macro  within a document.  ML1-OM-02 A record is kept of users that have been approved to allow Microsoft Office  macro execution, and this list matches the list of users within the technical  solution.  Confirm a repository of approved requests for users to execute Microsoft Office macros is maintained and up to date and  matches the technical implementation. Typically, this means the Active Directory Security Group that permits Microsoft Office  macro use should match the list of users who have been approved to run Microsoft Office macros.  Microsoft Office  macros in files  originating from the  internet are blocked.  ML1-OM-03 Microsoft Office files from the internet are unable to execute Microsoft Office  macros.  Attempt to run Microsoft Office macros in Microsoft Office files from the internet. Confirm these files are blocked when received  by download and email. Do this for all installed Microsoft Office applications.  E8MVT will open a test file that contains a zone identifier to indicate it is from the internet.

ML1-AH-07 Internet Explorer 11 is unable to connect to internet sites. Internet Explorer 11  may be allowed to access internal web applications only.  If Internet Explorer 11 is installed, access an external website using the web browser and ensure it is blocked. If it is not installed,  use a manual request method (script, curl, proxy) with modified request headers to imitate IE (e.g. User-Agent) and check if the  request is blocked. Review proxy or firewall configuration for the existence of rules to prevent IE specific browsing from reaching  the internet.  Web browser security  settings cannot be  changed by users.  ML1-AH-08 Microsoft Edge settings cannot be changed by a standard user. Check that group policy settings are configured for Microsoft Edge. Open the web browser configuration panel and look for  existence of a ‘Managed by organisation’ message or similar.

Attempt to change a setting related to networking or security, such  as blocking of ads, proxy settings or security level.  Restrict  administrative  privileges  Requests for privileged  access to systems and  applications are  validated when first  requested.  ML1-RA-01 A process exists and is enforced for granting privileged access to systems. Confirm the organisation has a documented, approved and enforced privileged access process that outlines the requirements for  provisioning a privileged account to a system or application. Confirm the organisation has a list of systems and applications that  require privileged access.  Review documented privileged access process and systems. Request evidence of process being followed (e.g. support tickets).  Privileged accounts  (excluding privileged  service accounts) are  prevented from  accessing the internet,  email and web  services.  ML1-RA-02 Privileged accounts (excluding privileged service accounts) cannot access the  internet or web services via a web browser or other mechanism.  While logged in as a privileged user, attempt to browse to an internet website. Review the configuration preventing internet  access and attempt to change this as a privileged user not responsible for administering that system. Privileged accounts not  responsible for administering these systems should not be able to change settings to access the internet.  While privileged account policies should be reviewed, they do not satisfy this control without additional technical mechanisms.  ML1-RA-03 Privileged accounts are not configured with mailboxes and email addresses. Attempt to open Microsoft Outlook on a system using the privileged account.  Run the following PowerShell command Get-ADUser -Filter {(admincount -eq 1) -and (emailaddress -like “*”) -and (enabled -eq  $true)} -Properties EmailAddress | Select samaccountname, emailaddress  49  Privileged users use  separate privileged  and unprivileged  operating  environments.  ML1-RA-04 All administrative activities are performed in an administrative environment  that is segmented from the standard user network environment. A separate  environment is provisioned for the use of privileged access and is not used for  any other purpose.  Attempt to access the administrative network environment using a standard account. Attempt to access the standard  environment using a privileged account. Look for evidence of administrative access to unprivileged environments, using tools  such as Bloodhound. Check for the existence of workstations that exist solely for privileged access purposes.  The privileged operating environment must not be virtualised within the unprivileged operating environment for Maturity Level  Two or Maturity Level Three. However, it can be for Maturity Level One.  Unprivileged accounts  cannot logon to  privileged operating  environments.  ML1-RA-05 Unprivileged accounts are not able to logon to systems in the privileged  environment.  Use Bloodhound to analyse Active Directory data and look for which users and groups have RDP access to servers. Review group  policy settings for RDP permissions.  ML1-RA-06 Unprivileged user prevented from using the PowerShell remote PSRemote  windows feature.  Run the following PowerShell command (Get-PSSessionConfiguration -Name Microsoft.PowerShell).Permission  Check the members of the built-in Active Directory Security Group Remote Management Users.  Privileged accounts  (excluding local  administrator  accounts) cannot logon  to unprivileged  operating  environments.  ML1-RA-07 A privileged account cannot be used to authenticate and interactively login to  standard user workstations, or other unprivileged environments.

This will not consider any rules that are determined to be  necessary for business purposes and are risk managed.  Application control  rulesets are validated  on an annual or more  frequent basis.  ML3-AC-12 The organisational list of allowed applications rules are reviewed for accuracy  with current business requirements and threat profiles.  Check that the Application Control owner has a process for reviewing the list of allowed applications on an annual or more  frequent basis. Mature organisations will outline the process of assessing threats in applications and what supporting business  case details are required from the requesting group.  Check that there is evidence that the organisation has enacted the annual application list review within the last 12 months. This  evidence will typically exist as support tickets, email correspondence, or threat and risk assessments.  Allowed and blocked  execution events on  workstations and  servers are centrally  logged.  ML3-AC-13 (Workstations & Servers) Application control event logs are sent to a  centralised location.  Verify event logs for each required event are collected at a centralised location.  Verify the number of systems logging to this location align with total expected systems (i.e. all systems are logging here).  Event logs are  protected from  unauthorised  modification and  deletion.  ML3-AC-14 Application control event logs are protected from unauthorised modification  and deletion.  Verify standard and unauthorised users are unable to modify or delete event logs.  Event logs are  monitored for signs of  compromise and  actioned when any  signs of compromise  are detected.  ML3-AC-15 Application control event logs are monitored for signs of compromise. Verify a process is in place to monitor application control event logs for signs of compromise. Verify the information gathered is  sufficient to effectively identify compromise.  Look for evidence that this process is being followed. This evidence will typically exist as support tickets, email correspondence,  or threat and risk assessments.  ML3-AC-16 The organisation has an example where they investigated or responded to  signs of compromise triggered by application control monitoring.

    "original document": "1  Introduction  The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) has developed prioritised mitigation strategies, in the form of the  Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents , to help organisations protect themselves against various cyber  threats. The most effective of these mitigation strategies are the Essential Eight.  This publication details a process for undertaking assessments of the Essential Eight. In doing so, it includes guidance on  assessment methods that can be used for assessing both the implementation and effectiveness of controls that  underpin the Essential Eight – as articulated within the Essential Eight Maturity Model (November 2022 release).  This publication should be read and used in conjunction with other ACSC guidance and tools. This includes the:   Essential Eight Maturity Model   Essential Eight Maturity Model FAQ   Essential Eight Assessment Report Template   Essential Eight assessment toolkit.  Note, all vendor products mentioned within this publication are for illustrative purposes only and should not be  interpreted as an explicit endorsement by the ACSC.  Overview  Assessments against the Essential Eight are conducted using the Essential Eight Maturity Model. This maturity model  describes three target maturity levels (Maturity Level One through to Maturity Level Three) which are based on  mitigating increasing levels of adversary targeting and tradecraft. The maturity model also includes Maturity Level Zero  which exists for capturing instances in which the requirements of Maturity Level One are not met.  Although the approach to conducting an assessment depends on the size and complexity of a system, there are  foundational principles that are common to each assessment. As such, the guidance in this publication should be  incorporated by assessors, noting that assessors should still use their own judgement and expertise.  While the Essential Eight may be applied to a non-Microsoft Windows system, specific mitigation strategies, or parts  thereof, may not be applicable or even the most effective mitigation strategies available. In these instances, such as for  Linux workstations and servers, cloud computing or enterprise mobility, organisations should consider alternative  guidance provided by the ACSC.  Finally, in determining compensating control effectiveness, assessors should ensure that any compensating controls  that have been implemented provide an equivalent level of protection to those recommended under the Essential  Essential Eight  Assessment Process Guide  First published: November 2022  Last updated: January 2023  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight-maturity-model-faq https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight-assessment-process-guide https://partners.cyber.gov.au/ https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-hardening/hardening-linux-workstations-and-servers https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/outsourcing-and-procurement/cloud-security-guidance https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility  2  Eight. This will assist in ensuring that an equivalent level of overall protection against a specific level of adversary  targeting and tradecraft can be achieved and maintained.  Evidence quality  In conducting an assessment, assessors need to gather and review credible evidence to support conclusions they draw  on the effectiveness of controls. In general terms, the evidence used to determine the effectiveness of controls will vary  in quality depending on the approach taken. As such, when conducting an assessment, assessors should seek to gather  and use the highest quality evidence where reasonably practicable. This guide defines four levels of evidence quality:   Excellent evidence: Testing a control with a simulated activity designed to confirm it is in place and effective (e.g.  attempting to run an application to check application control rulesets).   Good evidence: Reviewing the configuration of a system through the system’s interface to determine whether it  should enforce an expected policy.   Fair evidence: Reviewing a copy of a system’s configuration (e.g. using reports or screenshots) to determine  whether it should enforce an expected policy.   Poor evidence: A policy or verbal statement of intent (e.g. sighting mention of controls within documentation).  Determining effective implementation of  mitigation strategies  Upon concluding assessment activities, assessors will need to determine whether mitigation strategies were  implemented effectively or not. This determination requires a combination of judgement and consideration of the  following factors:   adoption of a risk-based approach to the implementation of mitigation strategies   ability to test the mitigation strategies across an accurate representative sample of workstations (including  laptops), servers and network devices   level of assurance gained from assessment activities and any evidence provided (noting the quality of evidence)   any exceptions, including associated compensating controls, and whether they have been accepted by an  appropriate authority as part of a formal exception process.  Assessors should use the ACSC’s standardised assessment outcomes which are:   Effective: The organisation is effectively meeting the control’s objective.   Ineffective: The organisation is not adequately meeting the control’s objective.   Alternate control: The organisation is effectively meeting the control’s objective through an alternate control.   Not assessed: The control has not yet been assessed.   Not applicable: The control does not apply to the system or environment.   No visibility: The assessor was unable to obtain adequate visibility of a control’s implementation.  It is important that assessors do not allow organisational risk acceptance without sufficient compensating controls as a  justification for not implementing a mitigation strategy (e.g. a system owner has risk accepted not implementing  application control or multi-factor authentication). In these scenarios, without adequate compensating controls, the  mitigation strategy is considered to be not implemented.  3  For a system owner to claim they have implemented a mitigation strategy, all controls specified within the mitigation  strategy must be assessed as ‘effective’ or ‘alternate control’. If one of the controls specified for a mitigation strategy is  assessed as ‘ineffective’, the system owner cannot claim to have met the requirements for that maturity level. In turn,  this applies to the determination of whether a system owner has met the target maturity level for their system (i.e. if  one or more mitigation strategies are deemed to be not implemented then the target maturity level for the system  cannot be claimed to have been met).  Where exceptions to a mitigation strategy’s controls have been identified, the assessor should review and evaluate any  compensating controls that are in place to determine whether they address the intent of the original controls and are  implemented effectively. Two examples have been provided below.  Example: During an internal review, an organisation identified a low-risk Windows server that could not be patched.  As a result, the organisation implemented a plan to decommission the server within two months.  In this situation, it was still important for the organisation to apply compensating controls that reduced the risk to an  acceptable level, and to align with the requirements of the Essential Eight’s exception process. As a result, a risk  owner was assigned, and strong compensating controls were put in place.  In this instance, as the exception was being effectively managed and strong compensating controls were in place, an  assessor determined that the exception should not preclude the organisation from reaching their target maturity  level. Conversely, if the organisation had not applied strong compensating controls, it would not have aligned with  the requirements of the Essential Eight’s exception process and should have precluded the organisation from  reaching their target maturity level.  Example: During an internal review, an organisation identified cloud services that did not have available multi-factor  authentication functionality enabled. In assessing the situation, the organisation decided it was not worth the time  and effort to enable such functionality, not to mention the complaints they expected they would receive from users.  In this situation, the organisation had chosen to simply accept the risk of not implementing a control rather than  implementing strong compensating controls.  In this instance, as the exception was not being effectively managed nor were strong compensating controls in place,  an assessor determined that the organisation should be precluded from reaching their target maturity level.  It is important that the use of exceptions for a system are documented and approved by an appropriate authority  through a formal process. Documentation for exceptions should include the following:   detail, scope and justification for exceptions   detail of compensating controls associated with exceptions, including:   detail, scope and justification for compensating controls   expected implementation lifetime of compensating controls   when compensating controls will next be reviewed   system risk rating before and after the implementation of compensating controls   any caveats placed on the use of the system as a result of exceptions   acceptance by an appropriate authority of the residual risk for the system   when the necessity of exceptions will next be considered by an appropriate authority (noting exceptions should  not be approved beyond one year).  4  The appropriate use of a formal exception process, along with compensating controls, should not preclude an  organisation from being assessed as meeting the requirements for their target maturity level.  Stages of an assessment  At a high-level, assessments are comprised of four stages:   Stage 1: The assessor plans and prepares for the assessment.   Stage 2: The assessor determines the scope and approach for the assessment.   Stage 3: The assessor assesses the controls associated with each of the mitigation strategies.   Stage 4: The assessor develops the security assessment report.  The activities and considerations for each stage of an assessment are discussed in further detail below.  Stage 1: Assessment planning and preparation  Assessment planning  Prior to commencing an assessment, the assessor should conduct assessment planning activities. These activities  require the assessor to discuss with the system owner:   system classification and assessment scope (see further detail below)   access to low and high-privileged user accounts, devices, documentation, personnel, and facilities   intended assessment approach and any approvals required to run scripts and tools (see further detail below)   evidence collection and protection, including any requirements following the conclusion of the assessment   where the security assessment report will be developed (e.g. on an assessor’s device or on an alternative device)   approach to stakeholder engagement and consultation (including key points of contact)   whether any managed service providers or other outsourced providers manage any aspects of the system  (including appropriate points of contact)   access to any relevant prior security assessment reports for the system   appropriate use, retention and marketing of the security assessment report by both parties.  Assessors may also develop an assessment test plan and share it with the system owner. Example assessment test plans  are included as Annex A through Annex C.  Note, test cases listed within the example assessment test plans included as Annex A through Annex C should not be  treated as mandatory assessment requirements. Rather, assessors should apply their own judgement and experience in  the development of their own assessment test plans.  5  Stage 2: Determination of assessment scope and  approach  Determine assessment scope  In determining the assessment scope, assessors should first clarify the target maturity level with the system owner,  noting that the Essential Eight is required to be implemented and assessed as a package. For example, if a system  owner has not previously had an assessment demonstrating that they have implemented Maturity Level One, they  should not begin an assessment against Maturity Level Two until they have done so, and likewise for Maturity Level  Two before being assessed against Maturity Level Three.  Having identified a suitable target maturity level, the assessor should familiarise themselves with the requirements for  that maturity level as it will impact the components or aspects of the system within scope of the assessment. At this  time it may also be useful to request an approximate percentage breakdown of the operating systems used on  workstations and servers for the system.  Once the scope of the assessment has been identified, and agreed upon with the system owner, a more accurate  determination of the assessment’s duration and any milestones will likely be possible.  The scope of the assessment should be documented within the security assessment report. Any components or aspects  of a system deemed out-of-scope should also be documented and accompanied by a justification for their exclusion.  Determine assessment approach  In determining a suitable assessment approach, both qualitative and quantitative testing techniques should be  considered. For example, qualitative testing techniques include documentation reviews and interviews with personnel  administering or managing system security, while quantitative testing techniques include system configuration reviews  and the use of scripts and tools. Sample sizes for testing should also be determined in consultation with the system  owner, with the aim to assess an accurate representative sample population of workstations (including laptops), servers  and network devices.  Conducting assessments using interviews, reports and screenshots will always be inferior to conducting assessments  using scripts and tools. Particularly as scripts and tools often assess many workstations and servers on a network, rather  than a single sample workstation or server, and often identify issues that may be missed in interviews or overlooked by  human analysis of reports and configuration settings. If adequate assessment scripts and tools are not already present  on a system, assessors may wish to use their own scripts and tools following approval by the system owner.  Any assessment limitations including sample sizes and constraints on technical testing should be documented within  the security assessment report.  Stage 3: Assessment of controls  The assessment of each mitigation strategy is performed by reviewing and testing the effectiveness of controls. This  section provides guidance on the approach to assessing each mitigation strategy at a given target maturity level, along  with relevant assessment considerations. Guidance on determining the effectiveness of the controls within each  mitigation strategy is also provided within this section.  Assessment guidance for maturity levels in this section is cumulative. For example, the guidance provided in the  Maturity Level Two section is focused on unique requirements above those of Maturity Level One. Likewise, the  6  guidance provided in the Maturity Level Three section is focused on unique requirements above those of Maturity Level  Two. This aligns with the manner in which assessments should be conducted against target maturity levels.  Maturity Level One  The focus of this maturity level is adversaries who are content to simply leverage commodity tradecraft that is widely  available to gain access to, and control of, a system. For example, adversaries opportunistically using a publicly- available exploit for a security vulnerability in an unpatched internet-facing service, or authenticating to an internet- facing service using credentials that were stolen, reused, brute forced or guessed.  Generally, adversaries are looking for any victim rather than a specific victim and will opportunistically seek common  weaknesses in many targets rather than investing heavily in gaining access to a specific target. Adversaries will employ  common social engineering techniques to trick users into weakening the security of a system and executing malicious  code, for example, via a Microsoft Office macro.  Adversaries will also often seek to compromise user accounts. If successful, they may seek to exploit privileges  associated with these accounts or escalate privileges to higher levels. Depending on their intent, adversaries may also  seek to steal or destroy data (including backups) or make data otherwise unavailable through various denial-of-service  techniques.  Application control  Context  Application control assessments can be done without tools but efforts will be severely limited in their effectiveness and  are likely to miss edge cases that adversaries would look to exploit. For example, adversaries may use custom tools to  scan for weak or vulnerable paths on a system. This could be achieved with a Microsoft Office macro.  It is important to note that the last major update to the maturity model introduced compiled Hypertext Markup  Language (HTML) (.chm files), HTML applications (.hta files) and control panel applets (.cpl files) to the list of file types  that need to be controlled. Depending on the application control solution selected, it may not support these file types.  When conducting assessments, paths for standard user profiles and temporary folders used by operating systems, web  browsers, and email clients can include those from the list below. Note, depending on the system configuration, there  may be overlap (e.g. %temp% and %tmp% generally reside within %userprofile%\\*).   %userprofile%\\*   %temp%\\*   %tmp%\\*   %windir%\\Temp\\*.  To check if application control is implemented within the user profile directory, attempt to run a benign executable file  inside the directory. The executables tested should cover .exe, .com, .dll, .ocx, .ps1, .bat, .vbs, .js, .msi, .mst, .msp, .chm,  .hta, and .cpl. If any of the executables run within the user profile directory or operating system temporary folders,  application control is ineffective.  Note, while a dedicated application control solution is not required at Maturity Level One (i.e. file system permissions  can be used instead), organisations may still choose to implement a dedicated application control solution if they  intend to eventually implement requirements for Maturity Level Two.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  7  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  The execution of  executables, software  libraries, scripts,  installers, compiled  HTML, HTML  applications and control  panel applets is  prevented on  workstations from  within standard user  profiles and temporary  folders used by the  operating system, web  browsers and email  clients.  Due to the complexity of advanced file system permissions, and various user groups that  a user account may belong to, the only truly effective way to check application control  implementations is to attempt to write to and execute from all locations accessible to a  user on the file system. There are several free tools available to support the assessment  of this control, including the ACSC’s Essential Eight Maturity Verification Tool (E8MVT)  and Application Control Verification Tool (ACVT), AirLock Digital’s Application Whitelist  Auditor, and CyberArk’s Evasor. There are also several paid tools available. In choosing a  tool to use, make sure that it has been thoroughly tested beforehand to ensure it is fit- for-purpose.  If the system owner is willing to allow the use of trusted Microsoft tools, but not other  third-party tools, the SysInternals AccessChk application can be used to generate the  output of folder permissions, noting this is only relevant to a path-based approach. For  example, by running ‘accesschk -dsuvw [path] > report.txt’, it is possible to generate a  list of all writable paths and their access permissions for all users. Note, the ‘whoami  /groups’ command would also need to be run to determine which user groups a typical  standard user belonged to in order to determine the effective permissions for each path.  Alternatively, PowerShell cmdlets can be used to test and review AppLocker policy  where applicable.  For a system on which tools cannot be run, assuming a path-based approach is used,  screenshots of the ‘effective access’ permissions for specified folders can be requested.  This, however, has limitations, because unless screenshots of access permissions are  requested for every folder and sub-folder (for which there may be many), it will not be  possible to comprehensively assess whether read, write and execute permissions exist  for a given user. At a minimum, screenshots for key paths (such as temporary folders  used by the operating system, web browsers and email clients) should be requested and  examined to determine whether inheritance is set, noting that at any point in a path,  application control inheritance previously set by an operating system may be disabled by  an application installer.  Patch applications  Context  Most vendors of internet-facing services regularly release updated versions of their applications to fix security  vulnerabilities. Applications that exist on a system can be compared to the latest versions available from the vendor to  determine whether existing versions are the latest, and if not, how long-ago updates were made available by the  vendor, based on release dates and patch notes. Services such as the SANS Internet Storm Centre, Microsoft Security  Response Centre or the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog can  be used to determine whether public exploits exist for a given internet-facing service.  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/applocker/test-applockerpolicy?view=windowsserver2022-ps https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/applocker/get-applockerpolicy?view=windowsserver2022-ps https://isc.sans.edu/ https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog  8  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  An automated method  of asset discovery is  used at least fortnightly  to support the detection  of assets for subsequent  vulnerability scanning  activities.  Ask for a demonstration of a method of asset discovery being used in an automated manner  to identify assets associated with the system, such as workstations, servers and network  devices. This may be a dedicated asset discovery tool or it may be equivalent functionality  built into a vulnerability scanner. In addition, request evidence of previous automated asset  discovery scans and pay attention to the date/time stamp and their scope.  Note, while an automated method of asset discovery should be used at least fortnightly,  system owners may elect to align the frequency of asset discovery scans to more frequent  timeframes used for vulnerability scans (such as daily or weekly) in order to perform both  activities at the same time for optimal effect.  Finally, in addition to identifying assets for follow-on vulnerability scanning activities,  automated asset discovery can also be used to identify any unauthorised assets that may  have been connected to a system between scheduled scans. If unknown assets are  identified as part of asset discovery scans, they should be immediately investigated and  treated as suspicious until confirmed otherwise.  A vulnerability scanner  with an up-to-date  vulnerability database is  used for vulnerability  scanning activities.  Ask for a demonstration of a vulnerability scan. In addition, request evidence of the  date/time stamp of when the vulnerability database used for the scan was last updated.  Ideally, this should be within 24 hours of the vulnerability scan taking place.  A vulnerability scanner  is used at least daily to  identify missing patches  or updates for security  vulnerabilities in  internet-facing services.  Ask for a demonstration of a vulnerability scan. In addition, request evidence of previous  vulnerability scans and pay attention to the date/time stamp and scope of event logs. Check  whether the list of scanned internet-facing services matches the internet-facing services.  Request evidence of previous vulnerability scans and pay attention to the date/time stamp  and scope of event logs.  A vulnerability scanner  is used at least  fortnightly to identify  missing patches or  updates for security  vulnerabilities in office  productivity suites, web  browsers and their  extensions, email  clients, PDF software,  and security products.  Ask for a demonstration of a vulnerability scan. In addition, request evidence of previous  vulnerability scans and pay attention to the date/time stamp and scope of event logs.  Request evidence of previous vulnerability scans and pay attention to the date/time stamp  and scope of event logs.  9  Patches, updates or  vendor mitigations for  security vulnerabilities  in internet-facing  services are applied  within two weeks of  release, or within 48  hours if an exploit exists.  A network-based vulnerability scanner can be used to identify internet-facing services, their  versions and install dates. This can then be reviewed alongside the date of release for each  to determine whether patch timeframes have been met. The use of these tools can quickly  determine service versions and whether they are the latest versions available from vendors.  There are several free tools available to support the assessment of this control, including the  ACSC’s E8MVT, Nessus Essentials, Nexpose Community Edition, OpenVAS and Qualys  Community Edition. There are also several paid tools available. In choosing a tool to use,  make sure that it has been thoroughly tested beforehand to ensure it is fit-for-purpose.  Note, a scanner may not identify missing vendor mitigations such as specific configuration  changes.  If a network-based vulnerability scanner cannot be used, screenshots of versions of internet- facing services can be requested. This allows for manual checking against the latest versions  available from vendors. Alternatively, a list of services may be requested (noting that  adversaries often exploit security vulnerabilities in internet-facing services that the system  owner may have forgotten about or that have been installed by users without the system  owner’s knowledge).  Patches, updates or  vendor mitigations for  security vulnerabilities  in office productivity  suites, web browsers  and their extensions,  email clients, PDF  software, and security  products are applied  within one month of  release.  A vulnerability scanner can be used to assess applications, their versions and install dates.  The above output must be reviewed alongside the date of release for each application to  determine whether the timeframe has been met.  10  Alternatively, PowerShell can be used to identify applications with registered uninstall  functionality. However, this method alone will not always cover all applications that are  installed on a system. As a result, it should be combined with the list of installed applications  within ‘Programs and Features’.  While this approach can be used for assessments, the limitations in coverage should be  noted. For key applications though, it will likely be sufficient. If any key applications appear  to be missing in reports provided, this should be raised for clarification.  Below is a PowerShell script to output a list of installed applications with registered uninstall  functionality. This list should be reviewed in conjunction with the list of installed  applications within ‘Control Panel – Programs – Programs and Features’ to ensure no  applications are missed.  function Analyze( $p, $f) {  Get-ItemProperty $p |foreach {  if (($_.DisplayName) -or ($_.version)) {  [PSCustomObject]@{  From = $f;  Name = $_.DisplayName;  Version = $_.DisplayVersion;  Install = $_.InstallDate  }  }  }  }  $s = @()  $s += Analyze ‘HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\*’ 64  $s += Analyze ‘HKLM:\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\*’ 32  $s | Sort-Object -Property Name  The combined list of installed applications must be reviewed alongside the date of release  for each application patch to determine whether the timeframe has been met.  If tools cannot be used, request a demonstration that shows the versions of installed  applications and their install date. This allows for manual checking against the latest  versions available from vendors.  Internet-facing services,  office productivity  suites, web browsers  and their extensions,  email clients, PDF  software, Adobe Flash  Player, and security  products that are no  longer supported by  vendors are removed.  A vulnerability scanner can be used to assess applications and whether they are end of life.  Request a demonstration that shows the versions of the referenced applications and  services. This allows for manual checking against the list of supported versions. In addition,  check if hotfix KB4577586 has been applied to demonstrate that Adobe Flash Player is no  longer supported. Note, this hotfix will only remove Adobe Flash Player if it was installed by  Windows. If Adobe Flash Player was installed manually from another source, it will not be  removed by this hotfix.  11  Configure Microsoft Office macro settings  Context  All users should be denied the ability to execute Microsoft Office macros by default unless they have a specific business  requirement. If certain users are required to run Microsoft Office macros, they should be restricted to only the specific  applications required (rather than all Microsoft Office applications). In addition, a record of their business requirement  and associated approvals should be kept. This record should align with the list of users within the Active Directory  group that have permission to run Microsoft Office macros. Note, once a business requirement can no longer be  demonstrated by a user, permission to run Microsoft Office macros should be revoked.  Microsoft Defender is commonly used to perform Microsoft Office macro antivirus scanning. This product uses the  Antimalware Scan Interface to integrate applications and services with any antimalware installed on a machine. Other  antivirus solutions may use this interface or other processes to scan Microsoft Office macros.  Microsoft Office applications that can execute Microsoft Office macros include Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel,  Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Publisher, Microsoft Visio and Microsoft Word.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Microsoft Office macros  are disabled for users  that do not have a  demonstrated business  requirement.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can be used to assist with assessing this control. Refer to supporting  E8MVT documentation.  The ‘gpresult’ command can be run on workstations to generate an RSoP report to  identify Microsoft Office macro settings applied via group policy settings. Within the  report, look for the ‘VBA Macro Notification Settings’ setting at ‘User  Configuration\\Policies\\Administration Templates\\<Microsoft Office  Application>\\Application Settings\\Security\\Trust Center\\’.  The ‘VBA Macro Notification Settings’ setting should be enabled and configured to  ‘Disable all macros without notification’ for most users. If this setting is not configured,  all Microsoft Office macros will be disabled but users will receive a prompt via the Trust  Bar asking whether they would like to enable them.  For users with a demonstrated business requirement for Microsoft Office macro use,  this group policy setting may either not be configured, disabled or enabled and set to  any other setting – as long as antivirus scanning is enabled and Microsoft Office macros  in files originating from the internet are being blocked.  12  Within each Microsoft Office application, check or request demonstration showing  Trust Center macro settings (File – Options – Trust Center – Trust Center Settings –  Macro Settings) for users that are not allowed to run Microsoft Office macros and for  users with a business requirement to do so. For users that are allowed to run Microsoft  Office macros, request documentation that outlines the business need. Consider  requesting the percentage of the organisation’s userbase that have been granted  approval to run Microsoft Office macros.  For the assessment of Microsoft Office macro security, identify what setting is selected  for ‘macro settings’. For most users, the desired setting should be ‘Disable all macros  without notification’. However, for users with a demonstrated business requirement  for Microsoft Office macro use, any other setting is acceptable at this maturity level. In  these instances, identify any compensating controls such as antivirus scanning and if  Microsoft Office macros in files originating from the internet are being blocked.  Microsoft Office macros  in files originating from  the internet are  blocked.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can be used to assist with assessing this control. Refer to supporting  E8MVT documentation.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Block macros from running in Office files from the  Internet’ setting at ‘User Configuration\\Policies\\Administration Templates\\<Microsoft  Office Application>\\Application Settings\\Security\\Trust Center\\’. It should be enabled.  If this setting is not configured, all Microsoft Office macros from the internet will be  able to run. In addition, if users have the ability to access a file’s properties, they can  remove the Mark of the Web. To prevent this, the ‘Hide mechanisms to remove zone  information’ setting at ‘User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative  Templates\\Windows Components\\Attachment Manager\\’ should also be enabled.  Users can also remove the Mark of the Web by copying files from NTFS formatted  storage media to external FAT/FAT32/exFAT formatted storage media and back. Unless  external storage media (which is typically FAT32/exFAT formatted) is disabled for a  system, it will be difficult to prevent users bypassing this control if they know how to –  or adversaries tell them how to (which is more likely at higher maturity levels).  Microsoft Office macro  antivirus scanning is  enabled.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can be used to assist with assessing this control. Refer to supporting  E8MVT documentation.  Check if the following group policy setting is enabled for each Microsoft Office  application. Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Macro Runtime Scan Scope’ setting at  ‘User Configuration/Policies/Administrative Templates/Microsoft Office <Version>/  Security Settings/Macro Runtime Scan Scope’. It should be enabled with a value of  either:  0 - No macro scanning  1 - Macros in files with the MoTW (Default)  2 - Macros in all files (Ideal).  Alternatively, a pseudo-malicious Microsoft Office macro that contains an EICAR  antivirus test string can be used for testing purposes. The ACSC’s E8MVT has a benign  sample file that can be used for testing without running the tool.  13  If an Antimalware Scan Interface compatible antivirus product is not being used, ask for  a screenshot of any Microsoft Office macro scanning configuration settings that might  be present.  Microsoft Office macro  security settings cannot  be changed by users.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can be used to assist with assessing this control. Refer to supporting  E8MVT documentation.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘VBA Macro Notification Settings’ setting at ‘User  Configuration\\Policies\\Administration Templates\\<Microsoft Office Application>\\  Application Settings\\Security\\Trust Center\\’. If it is either enabled or disabled, then  users will not be able to change their Microsoft Office macro security settings.  Using a user account, open each Microsoft Office application and attempt to change  Microsoft Office macro security settings in the Trust Centre. If Microsoft Office macro  security settings have been configured via group policy settings, they should appear  greyed out.  User application hardening  Context  Adversaries are known to indiscriminately use ‘malvertising’ in their attempts to compromise systems. Blocking web  advertisements using web browser add-ins or extensions, or via web content filtering, can prevent the compromise of a  system.  Internet Explorer 11 lacks many of the security features of modern web browsers and ceased to be supported by  Microsoft on 15 June 2022. As such, it is more regularly targeted by adversaries. Ideally, Internet Explorer 11 should be  removed from systems and Microsoft Edge (running in ‘IE mode’ for legacy sites), or other modern web browsers,  should be used instead.  Web browser security settings should be configured via group policy settings. In addition, default web browser security  settings should not be relied upon as users may tinker with these settings to enable content or change settings when  guided to do so by adversaries. Web browser security settings that are configured via group policy settings typically  appear greyed out to users, have a hover over message explaining the setting is configured by their organisation or  have an icon such as a padlock.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  14  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Web browsers do not  process Java from the  internet.  A list of the web browsers installed on a system can be derived from the list of all  installed applications. For each web browser installed on the system, visit a  specific web page that contains Java, such as the Is Java installed? website.  Additionally, review any plug-ins or extensions that are installed for each web  browser present on the system. This can be used to check whether any web  browsers have Java plug-ins or extensions installed, and if so, whether they are  disabled.  If the system owner requires Java content to be accessed on their intranet, other  controls should be assessed to determine whether internet-based Java content is  blocked via a web content filter.  Web browsers do not  process web  advertisements from  the internet.  Check whether web browsers have either an ad blocker add-in or extension  installed. Alternatively, check whether a web content filter or proxy is blocking  web advertisements. A simple check is to request a user to browse to a website  that is known to display ads (to observe if any ads are displayed) or to browse to  AdBlock Tester website (for comprehensive testing) and provide a screenshot of  the results.  Note, built-in settings within web browsers to block pop-ups do not meet the  intent of this control.  Internet Explorer 11  does not process  content from the  internet.  For Microsoft Windows 11: This requirement is not applicable.  For Microsoft Windows 10: Determine whether Internet Explorer 11 is installed  on the system. If it is, attempt to access any website on the internet, such as  https://www.google.com.au.  Check that Internet Explorer 11 is not the default web browser (Settings – Apps –  Default apps – Web browser) and check for any file associations (Settings – Apps –  Default apps – Choose default applications by file type) tied to Internet Explorer  11.  Web browser security  settings cannot be  changed by users.  Check the security settings of each web browser present on the system. Identify if  settings are greyed out (Internet Explorer 11 and Mozilla Firefox), have an icon  with a hover over message that says ‘This setting is managed by your  organisation’ (Microsoft Edge) or ‘This setting is managed by your administrator’  (Google Chrome). This indicates that settings have been configured via group  policy settings and cannot be changed by users. In addition, identify whether Java  Control Panel settings can be changed by the user.  https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/is-java-installed https://adblock-tester.com/ https://www.google.com.au/  15  Restrict administrative privileges  Context  Policies, processes and procedures for managing privileged access to systems should be documented and enforced  within organisational workflows. In doing so, privileged access to systems and applications should be requested via a  form, service desk ticket or email from users, and require approval from a supervisor or application owner, to maintain  a record of all such requests. System owners should also maintain a list of all applications on their system that require  privileged access.  Privileged accounts are often targeted by adversaries for their greater control and access to organisational resources.  For this reason, privileged accounts should not have access to the internet, email and web services.  Note, while no constraints are placed on how privileged and unprivileged operating environments are separated for  privileged users at Maturity Level One, organisations may choose to implement an approach that avoids virtualising a  privileged operating environment within an unprivileged operating environment if they intend to eventually implement  requirements for Maturity Level Two.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Requests for privileged  access to systems and  applications are validated  when first requested.  Request copies of forms, support tickets or emails provided by users requesting access –  along with the support of their supervisor or applicable application owner. This can then  be compared to screenshots of accounts with privileged access to determine if there are  any discrepancies.  Privileged accounts  (excluding privileged  service accounts) are  prevented from accessing  the internet, email and  web services.  Attempt to browse the internet as a privileged user, review the internet proxy on the  network to determine whether it is configured to block traffic from privileged accounts  and run the below PowerShell command to check if privileged accounts have access to  mailboxes and email addresses:  Get-ADUser -Filter {(admincount -eq 1) -and (emailaddress -like “*”) -and (enabled -eq  $true)} -Properties EmailAddress | Select samaccountname, emailaddress  Tools such as BloodHound can assist in identifying privileged users that may be missed  when utilising PowerShell alone.  Privileged users use  separate privileged and  unprivileged operating  environments.  Discuss how privileged operating environments have been implemented for the  management of the system. Note, at this maturity level there are no constraints on how  this can be implemented beyond that separate privileged and unprivileged operating  environments have been implemented.  Unprivileged accounts  cannot logon to privileged  operating environments.  Attempt to logon to a privileged workstation using a standard user account.  Bloodhound can be used to assess whether any unprivileged accounts have connected to  privileged environments by looking for cached credentials.  https://www.sans.org/blog/bloodhound-sniffing-out-path-through-windows-domains/ https://www.sans.org/blog/bloodhound-sniffing-out-path-through-windows-domains/  16  Privileged accounts  (excluding local  administrator accounts)  cannot logon to  unprivileged operating  environments.  Request a demonstration of a privileged account attempting to logon to a standard user  workstation. Note, the moment a privileged account’s username and password are  entered into a standard user workstation, the account should be considered  compromised (noting this is the reason behind having separate operating environments).  This test should be done using a privileged account set up specifically for this purpose.  The privileged account should then be removed immediately after testing is complete.  Bloodhound can be used to assess whether any privileged accounts have connected to  unprivileged environments by looking for cached credentials.  Patch operating systems  Context  Operating system vendors regularly publish updates to address security vulnerabilities. In addition, unsupported and  out-of-date operating systems of internet-facing workstations and servers are a common target for adversaries.  While operating systems of workstations, servers and network devices that are not internet-facing are at a lower risk of  exploitation, as adversaries need to compromise another system to then obtain network-based access to the  unpatched operating system, it is still important that such operating systems are patched in a reasonable timeframe  given the level of targeting and tradecraft the system owner is attempting to protect their system against.  Services such as the SANS Internet Storm Centre, Microsoft Security Response Centre or the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog can be used to determine whether public  exploits exist for operating systems of workstations, servers and network devices.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  An automated method  of asset discovery is  used at least fortnightly  to support the detection  of assets for subsequent  vulnerability scanning  activities.  Ask for a demonstration of a method of asset discovery being used in an automated  manner to identify assets associated with the system, such as workstations, servers and  network devices. This may be a dedicated asset discovery tool or it may be equivalent  functionality built into a vulnerability scanner. In addition, request evidence of previous  automated asset discovery scans and pay attention to the date/time stamp and their  scope.  Note, while an automated method of asset discovery should be used at least fortnightly,  system owners may elect to align the frequency of asset discovery scans to more  frequent timeframes used for vulnerability scans (such as daily or weekly) in order to  perform both activities at the same time for optimal effect.  Finally, in addition to identifying assets for follow-on vulnerability scanning activities,  automated asset discovery can also be used to identify any unauthorised assets that may  have been connected to a system between scheduled scans. If unknown assets are  identified as part of asset discovery scans, they should be immediately investigated and  treated as suspicious until confirmed otherwise.  https://www.sans.org/blog/bloodhound-sniffing-out-path-through-windows-domains/ https://isc.sans.edu/ https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog  17  A vulnerability scanner  with an up-to-date  vulnerability database is  used for vulnerability  scanning activities.  Ask for a demonstration of a vulnerability scan. In addition, request evidence of the  date/time stamp of when the vulnerability database used for the scan was last updated.  Ideally, this should be within 24 hours of the vulnerability scan taking place.  A vulnerability scanner  is used at least daily to  identify missing patches  or updates for security  vulnerabilities in  operating systems of  internet-facing services.  Ask for a demonstration of a vulnerability scan. In addition, request evidence of previous  vulnerability scans and pay attention to the date/time stamp and scope of event logs.  Request evidence of previous vulnerability scans and pay attention to the date/time  stamp and scope of event logs.  A vulnerability scanner  is used at least  fortnightly to identify  missing patches or  updates for security  vulnerabilities in  operating systems of  workstations, servers  and network devices.  Ask for a demonstration of a vulnerability scan. In addition, request evidence of previous  vulnerability scans and pay attention to the date/time stamp and scope of event logs.  Request evidence of previous vulnerability scans and pay attention to the date/time  stamp and scope of event logs.  Patches, updates or  vendor mitigations for  security vulnerabilities  in operating systems of  internet-facing services  are applied within two  weeks of release, or  within 48 hours if an  exploit exists.  Network-based vulnerability scanners can be used to identify operating systems, their  versions and install dates. This can then be reviewed alongside the release date of  patches to determine whether the timeframe has been met. The use of these tools can  quickly determine patches that have been applied, which can then be compared to patch  release dates. There are several free tools available to support the assessment of this  control, including the ACSC’s E8MVT, Nessus Essentials, Nexpose Community Edition,  OpenVAS and Qualys Community Edition. There are also several paid tools available. In  choosing a tool to use, make sure that it has been thoroughly tested beforehand to  ensure it is fit-for-purpose.  If using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) for the assessment of this control, it is  important to consider that WSUS does not necessarily report accurate patch levels.  Specifically, WSUS has been known to report patches or updates that have been  deployed but not whether they were successfully applied, stuck and if the machine was  rebooted (if required).  Request WMIC or PowerShell be used to generate a list of hotfixes and the date that  they were applied to an operating system. This can then be compared to available  patches, especially those that are currently being exploited, to determine whether they  have been applied or not.  18  Patches, updates or  vendor mitigations for  security vulnerabilities  in operating systems of  workstations, servers  and network devices are  applied within one  month of release.  Network-based vulnerability scanners can be used to identify operating systems, their  versions and install date.

This can then be compared to available  patches, especially those that are currently being exploited, to determine whether they  have been applied or not.  Operating systems that  are no longer supported  by vendors are replaced.  Network-based vulnerability scanners can be used to identify operating systems and  their versions. The use of these tools can quickly determine operating system versions  which can then be checked against the list of supported operating systems from vendors.  For Microsoft Windows workstations and servers, the ‘winver’ command can be run to  determine the version of the operating system. Request a screenshot of the output of  running the ‘winver’ command for servers and workstations (assuming a Standard  Operating Environment is used for workstations). This version can then be checked  against Microsoft release information to determine whether it is a supported version or  not.  Multi-factor authentication  Context  Multi-factor authentication is one of the most effective controls an organisation can implement to prevent adversaries  from gaining access to a system, service or application. When implemented correctly, multi-factor authentication can  also make it significantly more difficult for adversaries to steal legitimate credentials to facilitate further malicious  activities.  Multi-factor authentication should be implemented for remote access solutions, users performing privileged actions  and users accessing important (sensitive or high-availability) data repositories. Using multi-factor authentication  provides a secure authentication mechanism that is not as susceptible to brute force attacks, such as traditional single- factor authentication methods based on memorised secrets (e.g. personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords and  passphrases).  At this maturity level, any two or more authentication methods can be used as long as they are not of the same class  (e.g. something users know, something users have or something users are). There is no requirement that one factor  19  must be a memorised secret. Biometrics and Trusted Signals are also acceptable as an authentication method at this  maturity level.  Note, while any two or more authentication methods can be used at Maturity Level One, organisations may still choose  to implement multi-factor authentication solutions, such as those that include something the user has or are phishing- resistant, if they intend to eventually implement requirements for Maturity Level Two or Maturity Level Three.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Multi-factor authentication is  used by an organisation’s  users if they authenticate to  their organisation’s internet- facing services.  Attempt to logon to internet-facing services that staff access. Typically, the logon  screen will show a request for two or more authentication factors, such as a password  and a one-time PIN. Note, in some cases a service may request the second  authentication factor after the first authentication factor has been validated.  Organisations might only share their primary login portal and may not disclose any  other portals that may not have MFA in place. Assessors should undertake activities to  determine if any additional authentication portals are exposed to the internet.  Multi-factor authentication is  used by an organisation’s  users if they authenticate to  third-party internet-facing  services that process, store  or communicate their  organisation’s sensitive data.  Attempt to logon to third-party internet-facing services that staff access. In cases  where multi-factor authentication is not used, confirm that the vendor or service  provider does not offer that functionality.  Multi-factor authentication  (where available) is used by  an organisation’s users if they  authenticate to third-party  internet-facing services that  process, store or  communicate their  organisation’s non-sensitive  data.  Attempt to logon to third-party internet-facing services that staff access. In cases  where multi-factor authentication is not used, confirm that the vendor or service  provider does not offer that functionality.  Multi-factor authentication is  enabled by default for non- organisational users (but  users can choose to opt out)  if they authenticate to an  organisation’s internet-facing  services.  Attempt to logon to internet-facing services that customers/citizens access. Discuss  whether multi-factor authentication is setup as part of account creation (opt-out) or  whether customers/citizens need to set it up themselves after initial account creation  (opt-in).  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/feature-multifactor-unlock  20  Regular backups  Context  Backup and retention frequencies should be defined by the system owner in accordance with their organisation’s  business continuity and disaster recovery requirements. In doing so, it is important that restoration of systems and data  from backups be tested as part of regular (at least annual) disaster recovery exercises and not left to after the first  major security incident is experienced.  At this maturity level, it is important that unprivileged users cannot access the backups of any other users – although it  is not necessarily a problem if they are able to access their own backups. It is worth noting, at this maturity level, that  privileged accounts may still be able to access the backups of any user.  While unprivileged accounts can access (i.e. read) their own backups, it is important that they do not have the ability to  modify or delete those backups. This requirement exists as any ransomware running with the privileges of an  unprivileged user should be blocked from overwriting or deleting backups. Note, adversaries escalating privileges to  privileged accounts, or backup administrator accounts, to overwrite backups are addressed at higher maturity levels.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Backups of important  data, software and  configuration settings  are performed and  retained with a  frequency and retention  timeframe in  accordance with  business continuity  requirements.  Discuss backup and retention frequencies specified for the system. Request a copy of the  business continuity plan and disaster recovery plan to check that the frequency and  retention periods have been documented.  Backups of important  data, software and  configuration settings  are synchronised to  enable restoration to a  common point in time.  It is important that any backup activities are synchronised to enable restoration to a  common point in time. For example, if important data stores are being backed up out of  sync to software and configuration settings then it will hamper restoration efforts and data  will be lost.  Backups of important  data, software and  configuration settings  are retained in a secure  and resilient manner.  Check what efforts have been made to ensure that backup processes and procedures are  secure and resilient. For example, are backups encrypted and how quickly can they be used  to recover from ICT equipment failure?  21  Restoration of  important data,  software and  configuration settings  from backups to a  common point in time is  tested as part of disaster  recovery exercises.  Discuss if any disaster recovery exercises have been conducted for the system, how often  these are conducted, when the last exercise was conducted and if partial or full restoration  of the system (including important data, software and configuration settings) was exercised.  Ideally, some form of after-action review or post-exercise report should be available to  demonstrate what disaster recovery processes and procedures where exercised and any  lessons that were learnt, such as the coordination of restoration activities across different  business areas (if applicable).  Note that business-as-usual recovery of user files is not sufficient. The intent of this control  is the restoration of a significant component of a system as part of a scheduled exercise.  Unprivileged accounts  cannot access backups  belonging to other  accounts.  Review the backup solution and Active Directory security groups to determine who has  access to backups.  Check whether unprivileged accounts have the ability to access all backups or just their own  backups. If backups are stored on network shares, request a demonstration of effective  access permissions to show that an unprivileged user account is incapable of accessing  backups beyond their own.  Unprivileged accounts  are prevented from  modifying and deleting  backups.  Check whether unprivileged accounts have the ability to modify or delete their own  backups. If backups are stored on network shares, request a demonstration of effective  access permissions to show that an unprivileged user account is incapable of modifying or  deleting their backups – or taking ownership of content to change permissions.  Maturity Level Two  The focus of this maturity level is adversaries operating with a modest step-up in capability from the previous maturity  level. These adversaries are willing to invest more time in a target and, perhaps more importantly, in the effectiveness  of their tools. For example, these adversaries will likely employ well-known tradecraft to better attempt to bypass  controls implemented by a target and evade detection. This includes actively targeting credentials using phishing and  employing technical and social engineering techniques to circumvent weaker methods of multi-factor authentication.  Generally, adversaries are likely to be more selective in their targeting but still somewhat conservative in the time,  money and effort they may invest in a target. Adversaries will likely invest time to ensure their phishing is effective and  employ common social engineering techniques to trick users into weakening the security of a system and executing  malicious code, for example, via a Microsoft Office macro.  Adversaries will also often seek to compromise user accounts. If successful, they may seek to exploit privileges  associated with these accounts or escalate privileges to higher levels. Depending on their intent, adversaries may also  seek to steal or destroy data (including backups) or make data otherwise unavailable through various denial-of-service  techniques.  The guidance below outlines the requirements to be assessed in addition to the requirements of the previous maturity  level. In doing so, assessments against Maturity Level Two should focus on the delta between Maturity Level One and  Maturity Level Two.  22  Application control  Context  For Maturity Level Two, application control requires the use of a dedicated application control solution. This may be  one of the in-built solutions from Microsoft (e.g. AppLocker or Windows Defender Application Control) or it may be a  third-party solution (e.g. AirLock Digital’s AirLock, Ivanti’s Device and Application Control, Trend Micro Endpoint  Application Control or VMWare Carbon Black App Control).  The majority of application control solutions will have a form of logging or auditing mode. As such, event logs for  application control solutions should be collected and stored in case there is a cyber security incident and they are  required for forensic or incident response purposes. Often, the lack of sufficient logging can impact the ability to  determine the extent of a cyber security incident, how it occurred and what security vulnerabilities need to be  mitigated.  Assessment Guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Application control is  implemented on  workstations and internet- facing servers.  Check whether a dedicated application control solution has been implemented on all  workstations and internet-facing servers.  Application control restricts  the execution of executables,  software libraries, scripts,  installers, compiled HTML,  HTML applications and  control panel applets to an  organisation-approved set.  Due to the complexity of application control rulesets, the best way to assess application  control implementations is to attempt to write to and execute from all locations  accessible to a user on the file system. There are several free tools available to support  the assessment of this control, including the ACSC’s ACVT, AirLock Digital’s Application  Whitelist Auditor and CyberArk’s Evasor. There are also several paid tools available. In  choosing a tool to use, make sure that it has been thoroughly tested beforehand to  ensure it is fit-for-purpose.  If publisher-based rules are used for the system, check that wildcards are not used for  publisher or product names. In addition, if path-based rules are used for the system,  check that users don’t have write access to any paths specified in application control  rulesets.  Finally, if a version of an application has been trojanised, and would otherwise be  allowed to execute due to an existing publisher or hash rule, a hash-based deny rule  should be implemented for that version. Tools used for assessments are unlikely to  detect this scenario, therefore, it will need to be identified on a case-by-case basis.  Allowed and blocked  execution events on  workstations and internet- facing servers are logged.  Ask whether logging is available for the application control solution used and request  screenshots of any logging output that shows records of executable content that was  allowed to execute as well as executable content that was blocked from executing.  23  Patch applications  Context  At this maturity level, the timeframe for patching security vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems is decreased from  one month to two weeks. In addition, this maturity level introduces patching timeframes for additional applications,  and an increase in associated vulnerability scanning frequencies and scope.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  A vulnerability scanner is  used at least weekly to  identify missing patches or  updates for security  vulnerabilities in office  productivity suites, web  browsers and their  extensions, email clients, PDF  software, and security  products.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity  Level Two timeframes.  A vulnerability scanner is  used at least fortnightly to  identify missing patches or  updates for security  vulnerabilities in other  applications.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide but apply it to other  applications using the identified timeframes.  Patches, updates or vendor  mitigations for security  vulnerabilities in office  productivity suites, web  browsers and their  extensions, email clients, PDF  software, and security  products are applied within  two weeks of release.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity  Level Two timeframes.  Patches, updates or vendor  mitigations for security  vulnerabilities in other  applications are applied  within one month of release.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide but apply it to other  applications using the identified timeframes.  24  Configure Microsoft Office macro settings  Context  At this maturity level, an additional requirement is introduced relating to the use of the Attack Surface Reduction (ASR)  rule ‘Block Win32 API calls from Office macros’. This ASR rule prevents Microsoft Office macros from calling Win32 APIs,  which adversaries can exploit to run malicious code that is more powerful than the actions they can perform using the  Microsoft Office VBA macro language itself.  Event logs for Microsoft Office macro execution events should be collected and stored in case there is a cyber security  incident and they are required for forensic or incident response purposes. Often, the lack of sufficient logging can  impact the ability to determine the extent of a cyber security incident, how it occurred and what security vulnerabilities  need to be mitigated.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Microsoft Office macros are  blocked from making Win32  API calls.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can assist in determining the implementation of this control as it  includes a test file that contains a Microsoft Office macro designed to test this ASR rule.  Note, this test will need to be conducted with an account that is allowed to execute  Microsoft Office macros.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Configure Attack Surface Reduction rules’ setting  at ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\  Microsoft Defender Antivirus\\Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard\\Attack Surface  Reduction\\’. It should be enabled and include an entry of ‘92E97FA1-2EDF-4476-BDD6- 9DD0B4DDDC7B’ with a value of 1 (i.e. enabled).  If a third-party solution is being used, discuss if the third-party solution has similar  functionality to the ASR rule. If so, request evidence as required.  Allowed and blocked  Microsoft Office macro  execution events are logged.  Within Trust Center, check whether ‘Enable Trust Center Logging’ has been enabled  within the ‘Message Bar’ section.  Request screenshots of any logging output that shows records of Microsoft Office  macros that were allowed to execute and Microsoft Office macros that were blocked  from executing.  User application hardening  Context  This maturity level requires the implementation of several ASR rules to prevent adversaries from using Microsoft Office  applications to create child processes that can be used to download and run malicious code, write malicious code to  disk or inject malicious code into other processes. In addition, the ASR rule ‘Block Adobe Reader from creating child  25  processes’ should be implemented to prevent adversaries from using Adobe Reader to create child processes which can  be used to download and run malicious code.  Adversaries often attempt to exploit security vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office through its support for Object Linking  and Embedding (OLE) packages. This maturity level requires Microsoft Office to be configured to prevent activation of  these OLE packages.  The implementation of ACSC or vendor hardening guidance can assist in reducing the attack surface of applications.  This is particularly important for key applications that are commonly targeted by adversaries such as web browsers,  Microsoft Office and Portable Document Format (PDF) software (e.g. Adobe Reader). In cases where ACSC hardening  guidance conflicts with vendor hardening guidance, consideration should be given to what the hardening guidance is  attempting to achieve.  Event logs for blocked attempts to execute PowerShell scripts should be collected and stored in case there is a cyber  security incident and they are required for forensic or incident response purposes. This should not be confused with  ‘module logging’, ‘script block logging’ and ‘transcription’ functionality of PowerShell, which while recommended for  good cyber hygiene, are not within scope of Essential Eight assessments. Often, the lack of sufficient logging can impact  the ability to determine the extent of a cyber security incident, how it occurred and what security vulnerabilities need  to be mitigated.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Microsoft Office is blocked  from creating child  processes.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can assist in determining the implementation of this control as it  includes test files that contain Microsoft Office macros designed to test each ASR rule.  Note, this test will need to be conducted with an account that is allowed to execute  Microsoft Office macros.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Configure Attack Surface Reduction rules’ setting  at ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows  Components\\Microsoft Defender Antivirus\\Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard\\Attack  Surface Reduction\\’. It should be enabled and include the entries of ‘D4F940AB-401B- 4EFC-AADC-AD5F3C50688A’ and ‘26190899-1602-49E8-8B27-EB1D0A1CE869’ with a  value of 1 (i.e. enabled).

It should be enabled and include the entries of ‘3B576869-A4EC- 4529-8536-B80A7769E899’ and ‘BE9BA2D9-53EA-4CDC-84E5-9B1EEEE46550’ with a  value of 1 (i.e. enabled).  26  Microsoft Office is blocked  from injecting code into  other processes.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can assist in determining the implementation of this control as it  includes a test file that contains a Microsoft Office macro designed to test this ASR rule.  Note, this test will need to be conducted with an account that is allowed to execute  Microsoft Office macros.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Configure Attack Surface Reduction rules’ setting  at ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows  Components\\Microsoft Defender Antivirus\\Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard\\Attack  Surface Reduction\\’. It should be enabled and include the entry of ‘75668C1F-73B5- 4CF0-BB93-3ECF5CB7CC84’ with a value of 1 (i.e. enabled).  Microsoft Office is  configured to prevent  activation of OLE packages.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can assist in determining the implementation of this control.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘PackagerPrompt’ registry setting at  ‘HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\<version>\\<Microsoft Office  Application>\\Security\\’. It should exist and be set to ‘REG_DWORD 0x00000002 (2)’.  Microsoft Office security  settings cannot be changed  by users.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can assist in determining the implementation of this control.  Within the RSoP report, look for security-related group policy settings that have been  defined for Microsoft Office. Alternatively, request a screenshot of the security settings  of each Microsoft Office application present on the system. Identify if settings are  greyed out, thereby indicating they cannot be changed by users.  PDF software is blocked  from creating child  processes.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can assist in determining the implementation of this control.  This attack surface reduction rule applies only to Adobe PDF software. As such, open  any Adobe PDF software that exists on the system, such as Adobe Acrobat, and use  File-Open to browse to a location with an exe, such as the Windows directory, change  the view to show all files, right click on an executable such as calc.exe and select Open.  The ASR rule if implemented will block this action.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Configure Attack Surface Reduction rules’ setting  at ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows  Components\\Microsoft Defender Antivirus\\Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard\\Attack  Surface Reduction\\’. It should be enabled and include the entry of ‘7674BA52-37EB- 4A4F-A9A1-F0F9A1619A2C’ with a value of 1 (i.e. enabled).  PDF software security  settings cannot be changed  by users.  Within the RSoP report, look for security-related group policy settings that have been  defined for PDF software. Alternatively, request a screenshot of the security settings of  any PDF software present on the system. Identify if settings are greyed out, thereby  indicating they cannot be changed by users.  27  ACSC or vendor hardening  guidance for web browsers,  Microsoft Office and PDF  software is implemented.  Generally, hardening guidance can be configured via group policy setting templates  that are made available by vendors. This will be included as part of any RSoP reports  that are provided.  ACSC hardening guidance for Microsoft Office is available within the Hardening  Microsoft 365, Office 2021, Office 2019 and Office 2016 publication.  Microsoft hardening guidance is available from their Microsoft Security Baselines Blog.  Blocked PowerShell script  execution events are logged.  The ACSC’s E8MVT can assist in determining the implementation of this control.  If an application control solution has been suitably configured, it should already  capture any blocked attempts to execute PowerShell scripts. If not, discuss what other  logging mechanisms are in place to capture any blocked attempts to execute  PowerShell scripts on the system and seek supporting evidence.  Restrict administrative privileges  Context  To avoid users collecting privileges and access as they change roles throughout an organisation, and to enforce the  principle of least-privileged role-based access control, privileged users should be required to regularly revalidate their  requirement for privileged access. As such, privileged accounts that have not been used within 45 days strongly indicate  that they are no longer required. Rather than accounts remaining active, and a possible target for adversaries to  exploit, inactive accounts should be disabled on a regular basis.  For Maturity Level Two, privileged operating environments must not be virtualised within unprivileged operating  environments. This constraint allows for three implementation scenarios:   physically separate operating environments   an unprivileged operating environment virtualised within a privileged operating environment   both a privileged and unprivileged operating environment virtualised within a physical host’s hardened operating  environment.  Jump servers play an important role as a centralised logging and tool enforcement point for administrative activities,  even when privileged operating environments are used.  The use of a common local administrator password for every workstation and server is a common approach in poorly- secured networks due to its ease of use. A marginally more secure approach is using passwords that are a combination  of a fixed component and a dynamic component (e.g. including a unique asset identifier). While the latter may appear  to be secure, if adversaries are able to compromise one or more local administrator passwords they may be able to  discern a pattern. Ideally, an approach that ensures local administrator and service accounts are unique, unpredictable  and managed should be used. For example, Microsoft’s Local Administrator Password Solution.  Event logs relating to the use of, and changes to, privileged accounts should be collected and stored in case there is a  cyber security incident and they are required for forensic or incident response purposes. Often, the lack of sufficient  logging can impact the ability to determine the extent of a cyber security incident, how it occurred and what security  vulnerabilities need to be mitigated.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-hardening/hardening-microsoft-365-office-2021-office-2019-and-office-2016 https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-hardening/hardening-microsoft-365-office-2021-office-2019-and-office-2016 https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-baselines/bg-p/Microsoft-Security-Baselines https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=46899  28  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Privileged access to systems  and applications is  automatically disabled after  12 months unless  revalidated.  Check whether an account expiry date is set in Active Directory under account profiles  and whether a mechanism exists to automatically disable accounts after 12 months  unless revalidated beforehand. Ask for a screenshot of the output of the following  PowerShell commands that check for accounts with either no expiration date or have  an expiration date that exceeds 12 months:  Get-ADUser -Filter {(admincount -eq 1) -and (enabled -eq $true)} -Properties  AccountExpirationDate | Where-Object {$_.AccountExpirationDate -like “” | Select  @{n=‘Username’; e={$_.SamAccountName}}, @{n=‘Account Expiration Date’;  e={$_.AccountExpirationDate}}, @{n=‘Enabled’; e={$_.Enabled}}  Get-ADUser -Filter {(admincount -eq 1) -and (enabled -eq $true)} -Properties  AccountExpirationDate | Where-Object {$_.AccountExpirationDate -gt (Get- Date).AddMonths(12)} | Select @{n=‘Username’; e={$_.SamAccountName}},  @{n=‘Account Expiration Date’; e={$_.AccountExpirationDate}}, @{n=‘Enabled’;  e={$_.Enabled}}  Privileged access to systems  and applications is  automatically disabled after  45 days of inactivity.  Microsoft provides guidance on the use of PowerShell to identify inactive accounts  based on when they were last used to logon to a system. Ask for a screenshot of the  output of the following PowerShell command that checks for inactive accounts to  demonstrate that this activity takes place on a daily basis:  Get-ADUser -Filter {(admincount -eq 1) -and (enabled -eq $true)} -Properties  LastLogonDate | Where-Object {$_.LastLogonDate -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-45) - and$_.LastLogonDate -ne $null} | Select @{n=‘Username’; e={$_.samaccountname}},  @{n=‘Last Logon Date’; e={$_.LastLogonDate}}, @{n=‘Enabled’; e={$_.enabled}}  Privileged operating  environments are not  virtualised within  unprivileged operating  environments.  Discuss how privileged operating environments have been implemented for the  management of the system. It should align to one of the implementation scenarios  within the context section of this mitigation strategy and be covered within the security  documentation for the system.  Administrative activities are  conducted through jump  servers.  Tools such as BloodHound can be used to determine the path administrators are using  to log in and which servers are jump servers.  Request a system administrator demonstrate creating and removing a test user  account to confirm the use of jump servers.  Discuss the network structure for the system to determine if jump servers have been  implemented for administrative activities. This should be visible in network diagrams  for the system.  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/services-hub/health/remediation-steps-ad/regularly-check-for-and-remove-inactive-user-accounts-in-active-directory https://www.sans.org/blog/bloodhound-sniffing-out-path-through-windows-domains/  29  Credentials for local  administrator accounts and  service accounts are long,  unique, unpredictable and  managed.  Discuss how local administrator and service accounts are managed. Confirm if  Microsoft’s Local Administrator Password Solution, or another suitable approach that  results in long, unique and unpredictable passwords for each workstation and server, is  used.  To check if all computers have LAPS configured, run the following PowerShell  commands and compare the output:  Get-ADComputer -Filter {ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime -like “*”} -Properties ms-Mcs- AdmPwdExpirationTime | measure  Get-ADComputer -Filter {Enabled -eq $true} | measure  Discuss how group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs) are managed. gMSAs are  domain accounts that use 240-byte randomly generated complex passwords. gMSAs  shift password management to the Windows operating system, which changes the  password every 30 days.  Privileged access events are  logged.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Audit Sensitive Privilege Use’ setting at ‘Computer  Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Advanced Audit Policy  Configuration\\Audit Policies\\Privilege Use\\’. It should be enabled with a value of  ‘Success and Failure’.  In addition, look for the ‘Audit Logon’, ‘Audit Other Logon/Logoff Events’ and ‘Audit  Special Logon’ settings at ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security  Settings\\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration\\Audit Policies\\Logon/Logoff’. They  should be enabled with a value of ‘Success and Failure’.  Finally, look for the ‘Audit Logoff’ setting at ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\  Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration\\Audit  Policies\\Logon/Logoff’. It should be enabled with a value of ‘Success’.  Privileged account and group  management events are  logged.  Using the specific event IDs (available from Microsoft Docs), check whether changes to  privileged accounts and groups are logged in event viewer or a SIEM tool.  More information on security operations for privileged accounts in Active Directory,  including specific event IDs for this control, can be found at Microsoft Docs.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Audit Computer Account Management’ and ‘Audit  User Account Management’ settings at ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows  Settings\\Security Settings\\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration\\Audit Policies\\Account  Management\\’. They should be enabled with a value of ‘Success and Failure’.  In addition, look for the ‘Audit Security Group Management’ setting at ‘Computer  Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Advanced Audit Policy  Configuration\\Audit Policies\\Account Management\\’. It should be enabled with a value  of ‘Success and Failure’.  https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=46899 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/service-accounts-group-managed https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/security-operations-privileged-accounts  30  Patch operating systems  Context  At this maturity level, the timeframe for patching security vulnerabilities in operating systems is decreased from one  month to two weeks. In addition, this maturity level requires weekly vulnerability scanning.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  A vulnerability scanner is  used at least weekly to  identify missing patches or  updates for security  vulnerabilities in operating  systems of workstations,  servers and network devices.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity  Level Two timeframes.  Patches, updates or vendor  mitigations for security  vulnerabilities in operating  systems of workstations,  servers and network devices  are applied within two weeks  of release.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity  Level Two timeframes.  Multi-factor authentication  Context  At this maturity level, an additional requirement for all privileged users logging onto systems, both locally and remotely,  to use multi-factor authentication is introduced. In addition, the authentication methods that can be used, and in what  combination, are restricted to avoid weaker implementations. Specifically, acceptable multi-factor authentication  implementations include:   something users have (i.e. look-up secret, out-of-band device, single-factor one-time PIN (OTP) devices, single- factor cryptographic software or single factor cryptographic device) in addition to something users know (i.e. a  memorised secret)   something users have that is unlocked by something users know or are (i.e. multi-factor OTP device, multi-factor  cryptographic software or multi-factor cryptographic device).  Biometrics are not acceptable at this maturity level. This is due to biometric characteristics not being secrets, biometric  matching being probabilistic rather than deterministic and there being a reliance on the security of biometric capture  software installed on devices. However, biometrics can be used to unlock another authentication factor (e.g. a  certificate stored in a Trusted Platform Module or an OTP generator app on a smartphone). Trusted Signals are also not  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/feature-multifactor-unlock  31  acceptable at this maturity level. This is due to issues associated with placing trust in the signal itself, which can be  targeted and spoofed by adversaries.  While not yet excluded at this maturity level, organisations may want to avoiding authentication methods increasingly  being subject to MFA fatigue or social engineering attempts by adversaries, such as push notifications and SMS codes.  Event logs for multi-factor authentication events should be collected and stored in case they are required to support  forensic or incident response activities following a cyber security incident. The lack of sufficient logging can impact the  ability to determine the extent of a cyber security incident, how it occurred and what security vulnerabilities need to be  mitigated.  Note, at this maturity level organisations may choose to implement multi-factor authentication solutions that are  phishing-resistant, such as security keys or smartcards, if they intend to eventually implement requirements for  Maturity Level Three.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Multi-factor authentication  is used to authenticate  privileged users of systems.  Observe an administrator authenticate to a system to check whether they are required  to use MFA. Alternatively, request evidence of the logon screen for a privileged user.  The logon screen should show multiple authentication methods being requested.  Multi-factor authentication  uses either: something users  have and something users  know, or something users  have that is unlocked by  something users know or  are.  Discuss the implementation of multi-factor authentication for users. Note, multiple  different forms of multi-factor authentication may exist depending on the number of  different systems and internet-facing services that users authenticate to. For example,  multi-factor authentication for administration of cloud services might involve a  different implementation to multi-factor authentication for administration of on- premises services. Furthermore, not all third-party internet-facing services may offer  the same multi-factor authentication implementation.  Discussions should also include distinguishing between multi-step authentication and  multi-factor authentication, as well as different levels of security provided by different  multi-factor authentication implementations. For example, a security key or smartcard  is more secure than a hardware OTP device which is more secure than an OTP mobile  app which is more secure than a push notification or SMS code sent to a smartphone.  Successful and unsuccessful  multi-factor authentication  events are logged.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Audit Logon’ and ‘Audit Special Logon’ settings at  ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Advanced Audit  Policy Configuration\\Audit Policies\\Logon/Logoff\\’. They should be enabled with a  value of ‘Success and Failure’.  For certain MFA implementations the above guidance may not be applicable. In these  instances discuss whether logging is available for all systems that users authenticate to  and seek evidence that such logging is in place.  If an administrator logon was observed (per the first control in this table), request  recent event logs to check that there is a corresponding event log entry.  32  Regular backups  Context  At this maturity level, privileged accounts (with the exception of backup administrator accounts) are limited to only  accessing their own backups, and should not be able to modify and delete backups.  It is important that backup administrator accounts (as well as user accounts in general) are provisioned following the  principles of least privilege and separation of duties. As such, backup administrator accounts should only be given to a  small group of trusted administrators and a separate group should be setup for the purpose of restoring backups.  Excessive permissions for accounts increases the chance that they will be compromised. Should this occur for these  accounts, adversaries performing ransomware attacks can easily encrypt or delete all backups.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Privileged accounts  (excluding backup  administrator accounts)  cannot access backups  belonging to other accounts.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity  Level Two access control requirements. Specifically, privileged accounts should only be  able to access their own backups (except for backup administrator accounts).  Active Directory queries and tools such as BloodHound can help to identify privileged  accounts including backup administrator accounts.  Privileged accounts  (excluding backup  administrator accounts) are  prevented from modifying  and deleting backups.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity  Level Two access control requirements. Specifically, privileged accounts should no  longer be able to modify and delete backups. Such activities should be restricted to  backup administrator accounts.  Active Directory queries and tools such as BloodHound can help to identify privileged  accounts including backup administrator accounts.  Maturity Level Three  The focus of this maturity level is adversaries who are more adaptive and much less reliant on public tools and  techniques. These adversaries are able to exploit the opportunities provided by weaknesses in their target’s cyber  security posture, such as the existence of older operating systems or inadequate logging and monitoring. Adversaries  do this to not only extend their access once initial access has been gained to a target, but to evade detection and  solidify their presence. Adversaries make swift use of exploits when they become publicly available as well as other  tradecraft that can improve their chance of success.  Generally, at this level, adversaries are more focused on particular targets and, more importantly, are willing and able  to invest effort into circumventing particular policy and technical controls implemented by their targets. For example,  this includes socially engineering a user to execute a malicious Microsoft Office macro or circumventing multi-factor  authentication implementations by stealing authentication token values to impersonate a user. Once a foothold is  gained on a system, adversaries seek to gain privileged credentials or password hashes, pivot to other parts of a  network, and cover their tracks. Depending on their intent, adversaries may also destroy all data (including backups).  https://www.sans.org/blog/bloodhound-sniffing-out-path-through-windows-domains/ https://www.sans.org/blog/bloodhound-sniffing-out-path-through-windows-domains/  33  The guidance below outlines the requirements to be assessed in addition to the requirements of the previous maturity  level. In doing so, assessments against Maturity Level Three should focus on the delta between Maturity Level Two and  Maturity Level Three.  Application control  Context  At this maturity level, the scope of application control is expanded to include drivers and all servers (not just internet- facing servers). Note, while Microsoft AppLocker does not currently support the control of drivers, Windows Defender  Application Control (WDAC) does. This maturity level also includes the requirement for centralised logging of allowed  and blocked execution events on workstations and servers.  Microsoft maintains a list of application control bypasses and malicious drivers that have been discovered by security  researchers and adversaries. Implementing Microsoft’s recommended block rules and recommended driver block rules  can help to provide protection from adversaries that would have looked at using these against an otherwise robust  application control implementation to gain access to a system.  When implementing an application control solution, an organisation may develop application control rulesets but fail to  ensure they remains fit-for-purpose by reviewing them on a regular basis. This can lead to the potential failure to  identify several scenarios, such as operating system vendors changing permissions on paths as part of updates or  upgrades, exploitable applications or drivers remaining approved for a system, vendor code-signing certificates being  compromised, or system administrators introducing exceptions to ‘get things working’ or troubleshoot but failing to  remove the workarounds afterwards. Each of these scenarios are real, having been observed during assessments, and  introduce additional security vulnerabilities into a system that may be exploited by adversaries.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Application control is  implemented on  workstations and servers.  It is important to note that at this maturity level the scope has been expanded to  include all servers. As such, use the guidance provided in Maturity Level Two of this  guide and apply it to all servers rather than just internet-facing servers.  Application control restricts  the execution of executables,  software libraries, scripts,  installers, compiled HTML,  HTML applications, control  panel applets and drivers to  an organisation-approved  set.  Depending on the application control solution, controlling the execution of drivers may  or may not be supported. Request a copy of application control rulesets to check for  the inclusion of drivers.  Microsoft’s ‘recommended  block rules’ are  implemented.  Request a copy of application control rulesets. Check whether Microsoft’s  recommended block rules have been specified.  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/microsoft-recommended-block-rules https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/microsoft-recommended-driver-block-rules https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/microsoft-recommended-block-rules  34  Microsoft’s ‘recommended  driver block rules’ are  implemented.  Depending on the application control solution, controlling the execution of drivers may  or may not be supported. Request a copy of application control rulesets to check for  the inclusion of drivers. If drivers are included, check whether Microsoft’s  recommended driver block rules have been specified.  Application control rulesets  are validated on an annual  or more frequent basis.  Discuss how application control rulesets are validated and with what frequency. In  addition, discuss the governance processes and procedures around making changings  to application control rulesets and any testing or reviews that are conducted following  operating system upgrades and the addition or removal of applications.  Allowed and blocked  execution events on  workstations and servers are  centrally logged.  Request the event logs associated with the testing performed using application control  testing tools. Discuss whether event logs are stored locally or centrally.  Note, organisations that are comfortable that certain events have a high probability of  being legitimate may choose to filter them out as part of their centralised collection in  order to simplify event log analysis and reduce storage requirements.  Event logs are protected  from unauthorised  modification and deletion.  Discuss whether a security information and event management (SIEM) solution is  appropriately configured for the protection of event logs.  Event logs are monitored for  signs of compromise and  actioned when any signs of  compromise are detected.  Discuss whether a SIEM solution supported by security operations centre (SOC)  analysts is used to monitor event logs for signs of compromise and respond when any  signs of compromise are detected.  Patch applications  Context  At this maturity level, patches, updates or vendor mitigations must be applied within 48 hours rather than two weeks if  an exploit exists. In addition, all applications that are no longer supported by vendors should be removed.  This requirement can be assessed in a similar way to Maturity Level Two, except that if an exploit exists, patches,  updates and vendor mitigations must be applied within 48 hours rather than two weeks.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting an assessment method, the  quality of the evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/microsoft-recommended-driver-block-rules  35  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Patches, updates or vendor  mitigations for security  vulnerabilities in office  productivity suites, web  browsers and their  extensions, email clients, PDF  software, and security  products are applied within  two weeks of release, or  within 48 hours if an exploit  exists.  Use the relevant guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the  Maturity Level Three timeframes when exploits exist for security vulnerabilities.  Applications that are no  longer supported by vendors  are removed.  Use the relevant guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and extend it to  all applications.  Configure Microsoft Office macro settings  Context  Disabling the use of Microsoft Office macros represents an optimal security outcome, however, some users will have a  business requirement for their use. In such situations, additional controls should be implemented to make the use of  Microsoft Office macros as secure as possible. This may include either running Microsoft Office macros from within a  sandboxed environment, from an appropriately controlled Trusted Location or ensuring they are digitally signed by a  trusted publisher.  As Microsoft Office allows any files that are opened from a Trusted Location to bypass security checks, it is critical that  only trusted users can write to or modify content in these locations. Under no circumstances should Trusted Locations  be specified within a user’s profile, such as their desktop or documents folders.  If the ‘Disable all macros except digitally signed macros’ setting is used, this will allow any Microsoft Office macro  signed by a trusted publisher to execute without prompting the user for permission. However, any Microsoft Office  macro that is digitally signed by an untrusted publisher will ask users to decide as to whether they would like to allow  the Microsoft Office macro to execute via the Message Bar or Backstage View. While this prompt can be disabled using  a group policy setting, the removal of the option to enable Microsoft Office macros via the Backstage View requires the  implementation of an undocumented graphical user interface setting.  When implementing a digitally signed Microsoft Office macro approach, an organisation may identify a list of trusted  publishers but fail to review them on a regular basis for their ongoing suitability. This can create issues when a vendor’s  code-signing certificate is compromised. Ideally, an organisation should acquire their own code-signing certificate and  re-sign any Microsoft Office macros they trust, even if already signed by a third party. While introducing additional  overhead, this mitigates the risk of trusting compromised third-party code-signing certificates.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  36  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Only Microsoft Office  macros running from within  a sandboxed environment, a  Trusted Location or that are  digitally signed by a trusted  publisher are allowed to  execute.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘VBA Macro Notification Settings’ setting at ‘User  Configuration\\Policies\\Administration Templates\\<Microsoft Office  Application>\\Application Settings\\Security\\Trust Center\\’. It should be enabled and  configured to ‘Disable all macros without notification’ (if Trusted Locations are used) or  ‘Disable all macros except digitally signed macros’ (if digitally signed Microsoft Office  macros are used).  Note, an organisation may choose to use a combination of Trusted Locations and  digitally signed Microsoft Office macros. However, if only digitally signed Microsoft  Office macros are used then Trusted Locations should be disabled.  Within each Microsoft Office application, request a screenshot showing Trust Center  macro settings (File – Options – Trust Center – Trust Center Settings – Macro Settings).  In addition, request a screenshot showing Trust Center trusted publisher settings (File –  Options – Trust Center – Trust Center Settings – Trusted Publishers).  For the assessment of Microsoft Office macro security, identify what setting is selected  for ‘macro settings’. The setting should either be set to ‘Disable all macros without  notification’ (if Trusted Locations are used) or ‘Disable all macros except digitally signed  macros’ (if digitally signed Microsoft Office macros are used). For the assessment of  Trusted Locations, check whether the ‘Disable all trusted locations’ option has been  checked or not. If it has not, then Trusted Locations are enabled and should be  individually assessed for their suitability.  Only privileged users  responsible for validating  that Microsoft Office macros  are free of malicious code  can write to and modify  content within Trusted  Locations.  For each Trusted Location that is specified, review the effective file system permissions  for that location (i.e. similar to the assessment for application control at Maturity Level  One). If able to, the assessor should seek to review file system permissions themselves  rather than requesting a screenshot.  Check the total number of users who are in the groups that have the relevant file  system permissions.  Microsoft Office macros  digitally signed by an  untrusted publisher cannot  be enabled via the Message  Bar or Backstage View.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Disable all Trust Bar notifications for security  issues’ setting at ‘User Configuration\\Policies\\Administration Templates\\Microsoft  Office <version>\\Security Settings\\’. It should be enabled.  In addition, look for the ‘Disable commands’ setting at ‘User  Configuration\\Policies\\Administration Templates\\<Microsoft Office  Application>\\Disable Items in User Interface\\Custom\\’. It should be enabled with a  value of ‘Enter a command bar ID to disable: 19092’.  Microsoft Office’s list of  trusted publishers is  validated on an annual or  more frequent basis.  For the assessment of trusted publishers, check which publishers are listed. Ideally, this  should only be a code-signing certificate belonging to the organisation. Alternatively, if  external vendors’ code-signing certificates are listed, discuss how often these are  reviewed and what mechanisms are used to identify when/if these need to be removed  due to compromise by adversaries as part of supply chain attacks.  37  Allowed and blocked  Microsoft Office macro  execution events are  centrally logged.  Request the event logs associated with the testing performed using tools that attempt  to run Microsoft Office macros. Discuss whether event logs are stored locally or  centrally.  Note, organisations that are comfortable that certain events have a high probability of  being legitimate may choose to filter them out as part of their centralised collection in  order to simplify event log analysis and reduce storage requirements.  Event logs are protected  from unauthorised  modification and deletion.  Discuss whether a SIEM solution is appropriately configured for the protection of event  logs.  Event logs are monitored for  signs of compromise and  actioned when any signs of  compromise are detected.  Discuss whether a SIEM solution supported by SOC analysts is used to monitor event  logs for signs of compromise and respond when any signs of compromise are detected.  User application hardening  Context  At this maturity level, Internet Explorer 11 must be removed from operating systems rather than just blocked from  accessing the internet or opening files from the internet. Note, Internet Explorer 11 is not available in Microsoft  Windows 11. For Microsoft Windows 10 however, Internet Explorer 11 will progressively be phased out and eventually  removed from the operating system via a future update (depending on the version of Microsoft Windows 10 being  used).  .NET Framework 3.5 (including .NET 2.0 and 3.0) is often targeted by adversaries due to its lack of security functionality  when compared to newer versions of the .NET Framework, as well as due to its linkages to PowerShell 2.0. Within  Microsoft Windows 11 and Microsoft Windows 10, there are two separate features relating to the .NET Framework,  ‘.NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and .NET 3.0)’ and ‘.NET Framework 4.8 Advanced Services’.  Microsoft ended support for Windows PowerShell 2.0 in late 2017. At that time, Microsoft noted that Windows  PowerShell 2.0 lacked the security functionality of Windows PowerShell 5.0 and higher.  Constrained Language Mode for PowerShell is designed to prevent PowerShell users (which may include adversaries)  from running tools that exploit PowerShell or load Component Object Model objects, libraries and classes into a  PowerShell session.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  38  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Internet Explorer 11 is  disabled or removed.  For Microsoft Windows 11: This requirement is not applicable.  For Microsoft Windows 10: Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Computer  Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Internet  Explorer/Disable Internet Explorer 11 as a standalone browser’ setting. It should be  enabled.  Alternatively, request a screenshot of the ‘Windows Features’ that are installed. This  can be accessed via (Settings – Apps & features – Programs and Features – Turn  Windows features on or off). Check whether Internet Explorer 11 is installed by  checking for a tick or black square. Note, if Internet Explorer 11 has already been  removed it may not appear in the list of Windows Features.  .NET Framework 3.5  (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0) is  disabled or removed.  Request a screenshot of the ‘Windows Features’ that are installed.  For Microsoft Windows 11, this can be accessed via (Settings – Apps – Optional  features – More Windows features).  For Microsoft Windows 10, this can be accessed via (Settings – Apps & features –  Programs and Features – Turn Windows features on or off).  Check which of the .NET Frameworks are installed by checking for a tick or black  square. Note, enabling .NET Framework 3.5 will automatically enable PowerShell 2.0.  Windows PowerShell 2.0 is  disabled or removed.  Request a screenshot of the ‘Windows Features’ that are installed.  For Microsoft Windows 11, this can be accessed via (Settings – Apps – Optional  features – More Windows features).  For Microsoft Windows 10, this can be accessed via (Settings – Apps & features –  Programs and Features – Turn Windows features on or off).  Check if legacy versions of PowerShell are installed by checking for a tick or black  square against ‘Windows PowerShell 2.0’. To check if a downgrade to PowerShell 2.0 is  available, run the following PowerShell command:  Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -online | Where-Object {$_.FeatureName -match  “PowerShellv2”}  PowerShell is configured to  use Constrained Language  Mode.  Request a screenshot of the output of running the following PowerShell command:  $ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode.  If Constrained Language Mode is enabled, the output will be ‘ConstrainedLanguage’.  Otherwise, the output will be ‘FullLanguage’.  Blocked PowerShell script  execution events are  centrally logged.  Run a PowerShell script that should be blocked and request evidence of the associated  event log entry. Discuss whether event logs are stored locally or centrally.  Note, organisations that are comfortable that certain events have a high probability of  being legitimate may choose to filter them out as part of their centralised collection in  order to simplify event log analysis and reduce storage requirements.  39  Event logs are protected  from unauthorised  modification and deletion.  Discuss whether a SIEM solution is appropriately configured for the protection of event  logs.  Event logs are monitored for  signs of compromise and  actioned when any signs of  compromise are detected.  Discuss whether a SIEM solution supported by SOC analysts is used to monitor event  logs for signs of compromise and respond when any signs of compromise are detected.  Restrict administrative privileges  Context  Staff seeking access to systems and applications, especially with privileged access, should have a genuine business  requirement to do so. Once a requirement to access a system or application is established, staff should be provided  with only the privileges they require to undertake their duties. This can be achieved using role-based access controls.  Just-in-time (JIT) privileged access management (PAM) is an extension of role-based access control in which privileged  users are only granted the access required to perform their duties immediately before that access is required and for  only as long as it is required.  Within an active user session, credentials are cached within the Local Security Authority System Service process to  allow for access to network resources without users having to repeatedly enter their credentials. Windows Defender  Credential Guard is designed to assist in protecting this process. Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard provides  a similar functionality for remote access.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Privileged access to systems  and applications is limited to  only what is required for  users and services to  undertake their duties.  Discuss the approach that the organisation has taken to restrict privileged users to only  what is required for them to undertake their duties. Often this will involve identifying  several different roles, developing policies for those roles and assigning privileged users  to one or more of those roles depending on their duties. A system administrator should  be able to demonstrate the different user groups and policies or access controls that  apply to each. This can confirmed via an RSoP report.  Privileged accounts are  prevented from accessing the  internet, email and web  services.  Use the relevant guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and extend to  include privileged service accounts.  40  Just-in-time administration  is used for administering  systems and applications.  The implementation of JIT PAM is a complex activity that forms the basis for restricting  administrative privileges at Maturity Level Three. Given the complex nature of JIT PAM,  it will become apparent from discussions as to whether a JIT PAM approach has been  adopted or not. In doing so, it may be worthwhile observing the process of a system  administrator requesting and being granted JIT access.  Windows Defender  Credential Guard and  Windows Defender Remote  Credential Guard are  enabled.  Within the RSoP report, look for the ‘Turn On Virtualization Based Security’ setting at  ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\System\\Device Guard\\’. It  should be enabled with a value of ‘Credential Guard Configuration: Enabled with UEFI  lock’.  In addition, look for the ‘Restrict delegation of credentials to remote servers’ setting at  ‘Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\System\\Credentials  Delegation\\’. It should be enabled with a value of ‘Use the following restricted mode:  Require Remote Credential Guard’.  Note, the use of Windows Defender Credential Guard and Windows Defender Remote  Credential Guard has several hardware and software requirements. More information  on Windows Defender Credential Guard can be found at Microsoft Docs.  Privileged access events are  centrally logged.  Request event logs that should have been generated for typical activities associated  with the use of a privileged account, such as logging onto a system. Discuss whether  event logs are stored locally or centrally.  Note, organisations that are comfortable that certain events have a high probability of  being legitimate may choose to filter them out as part of their centralised collection in  order to simplify event log analysis and reduce storage requirements.  Privileged account and group  management events are  centrally logged.  If an administrator account was created for testing purposes, request the associated  event logs that should have been generated when the account was created and added  to a privileged group. Discuss whether event logs are stored locally or centrally.  Note, organisations that are comfortable that certain events have a high probability of  being legitimate may choose to filter them out as part of their centralised collection in  order to simplify event log analysis and reduce storage requirements.  Event logs are protected  from unauthorised  modification and deletion.  Discuss whether a SIEM solution is appropriately configured for the protection of event  logs.  Event logs are monitored for  signs of compromise and  actioned when any signs of  compromise are detected.  Discuss whether a SIEM solution supported by SOC analysts is used to monitor event  logs for signs of compromise and respond when any signs of compromise are detected.  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-requirements https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-manage  41  Patch operating systems  Context  At this maturity level, patches, updates or vendor mitigations for security vulnerabilities in operating systems of  workstations, servers and network devices are required to be applied within two weeks of release, or within 48 hours if  an exploit exists.  Modern operating systems for workstations, servers and network devices often contain security functionality that is not  available in earlier releases, even if those earlier releases remain supported by vendors. It is important that an  organisation takes advantage of new security functionality in later releases to further mitigate adversary activities.  The latest release of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Server will depend on the servicing branch being used. Further  release information is available from Microsoft. Similar information is often available from vendors of network devices.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Patches, updates or vendor  mitigations for security  vulnerabilities in operating  systems of workstations,  servers and network devices  are applied within two weeks  of release, or within 48 hours  if an exploit exists.  Use the relevant guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the  Maturity Level Three timeframes when exploits exist for security vulnerabilities.  The latest release, or the  previous release, of  operating systems are used.  Network-based vulnerability scanners can be used to identify operating systems and  their versions. The output of these tools can then be used to check against the latest  operating system versions available from vendors.  For Microsoft Windows workstations and servers, the ‘winver’ command can be run to  determine the version of the operating system. Request a screenshot of the output of  running the ‘winver’ command for servers and workstations (assuming a Standard  Operating Environment is used for workstations).  Multi-factor authentication  Context  At this maturity level, all users accessing important data repositories should be using multi-factor authentication.  Furthermore, the types and combinations of multi-factor authentication are further restricted to avoid weaker forms of  multi-factor authentication, especially those susceptible to phishing attacks. This can be achieved by ensuring that  clients cryptographically verify the authenticity of the server that they are authenticating to. For example, using  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/release-health/release-information  42  phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication would result in fake Microsoft 365 login pages being identified as such,  rather than fooling users and capturing their credentials (including additional authentication factors).  The acceptable forms of multi-factor authentication at this maturity level are generally limited to including either a  security key, smartcard or Trusted Platform Module.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Multi-factor authentication  is used to authenticate users  accessing important data  repositories.  Request a list of important data repositories for the system and associated screenshots  of users attempting to access each of these data repositories. The screenshots should  show multiple forms of authentication being requested.  Multi-factor authentication is  phishing-resistant and uses  either: something users have  and something users know,  or something users have that  is unlocked by something  users know or are.  Discuss the form of multi-factor authentication that has been implemented. Note,  different forms of multi-factor authentication may exist depending on the range of  systems, services and data repositories that users authenticate to.  Successful and unsuccessful  multi-factor authentication  events are centrally logged.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level Two of this guide and extend it to include  event logs for multi-factor authentication performed when accessing important data  repositories. Discuss whether event logs are stored locally or centrally.  Note, organisations that are comfortable that certain events have a high probability of  being legitimate may choose to filter them out as part of their centralised collection in  order to simplify event log analysis and reduce storage requirements.  Event logs are protected  from unauthorised  modification and deletion.  Discuss whether a SIEM solution is appropriately configured for the protection of event  logs.  Event logs are monitored for  signs of compromise and  actioned when any signs of  compromise are detected.  Discuss whether a SIEM solution supported by SOC analysts is used to monitor event  logs for signs of compromise and respond when any signs of compromise are detected.  43  Regular backups  Context  At this maturity level, only a subset of privileged accounts (i.e. backup administrator accounts) should be able to access  backups. The increasing level of controls around which accounts can access backups, and to what extent, progressively  limits the damage that may be caused by a ransomware incident.  In addition, at this maturity level, all accounts (except for break glass accounts) should not be able to modify and delete  backups.  Assessment guidance  The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the  evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.  Control Assessment Guidance (ordered by effectiveness)  Unprivileged accounts cannot  access backups belonging to  other accounts, nor their  own accounts.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity  Level Three access control requirements. Specifically, unprivileged accounts should no  longer be able to access their own backups.  Privileged accounts  (excluding backup  administrator accounts)  cannot access backups  belonging to other accounts,  nor their own accounts.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity  Level Three access control requirements. Specifically, privileged accounts (excluding  backup administrator accounts) should no longer be able to access their own backups.  Active Directory queries and tools such as BloodHound can help to identify privileged  accounts including backup administrator accounts.  Privileged accounts  (including backup  administrator accounts) are  prevented from modifying  and deleting backups during  their retention period.  Use the guidance provided in Maturity Level One of this guide and apply the Maturity  Level Three access control requirements. Specifically, backup administrator accounts  should no longer be able to modify and delete backups during their retention period,  but may do so after the retention period has been exceeded.  The modification and deletion of backups during their retention period, should such  activities be required, need to be restricted to break glass accounts.  Active Directory queries and tools such as BloodHound can help to identify privileged  accounts (including backup administrator accounts) and break glass accounts.  Stage 4: Development of the security assessment  report  In developing the security assessment report, assessors should use the ACSC’s Essential Eight Assessment Report  Template. However, assessors can use their own report templates for branding purposes if all sections from the ACSC’s  template are included.  https://www.sans.org/blog/bloodhound-sniffing-out-path-through-windows-domains/ https://www.sans.org/blog/bloodhound-sniffing-out-path-through-windows-domains/ https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight-assessment-process-guide https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight-assessment-process-guide  44  Further information  The Information Security Manual is a cyber security framework that organisations can apply to protect their systems  and data from cyber threats. The advice in the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents, along with its Essential  Eight, complements this framework.  A mapping between the requirements of the Essential Eight Maturity Model and the Information Security Manual can  be found in the Essential Eight Maturity Model to ISM Mapping publication.

E8MVT will perform limited (single folder) testing for file execution in user profiles and temporary directories.  Patch applications An automated method  of asset discovery is  used at least  fortnightly to support  the detection of assets  for subsequent  vulnerability scanning  activities.  ML1-PA-01 An automated method of asset discovery is run and reviewed at least  fortnightly.  Confirm that a method of asset discovery is in place (such as an asset discovery tool or a vulnerability scanner with equivalent  functionality) and that it is configured to be run in an automated manner at least every fortnight. Confirm that any anomalies  that are identified are reviewed and actioned.  A vulnerability scanner  with an up-to-date  vulnerability database  ML1-PA-02 A vulnerability scanner with an up-to-date vulnerability database is being used  for vulnerability scanning activities.  Confirm that a vulnerability scanner is in place and that the vulnerability database it uses is being updated within 24 hours prior  to its use.  46  is used for vulnerability  scanning activities.  A vulnerability scanner  is used at least daily to  identify missing  patches or updates for  security vulnerabilities  in internet-facing  services.  ML1-PA-03 (Internet-Facing Services) A vulnerability scanner for internet-facing services is  run and reviewed daily.  Confirm that a vulnerability scanner is in place, and it is configured to scan the organisation’s internet-facing services. Confirm  that reports from the vulnerability scanner are reviewed by the responsible staff daily, and that identified issues have been  observed and actioned.  A vulnerability scanner  is used at least  fortnightly to identify  missing patches or  updates for security  vulnerabilities in office  productivity suites,  web browsers and  their extensions, email  clients, PDF software,  and security products.  ML1-PA-04 A vulnerability scanner is run and reviewed at least fortnightly to scan the  organisation’s office productivity suites, web browsers, email clients, PDF  software and security products.  Confirm that a vulnerability scanner is in place, and it is configured to scan the organisation’s applications listed, typically  requiring a credentialed scan. Confirm that reports from the vulnerability scanner are reviewed by the responsible staff  fortnightly, and that identified issues have been observed and actioned.  Patches, updates or  vendor mitigations for  security vulnerabilities  in internet-facing  services are applied  within two weeks of  release, or within 48  hours if an exploit  exists.  ML1-PA-05 (Internet-Facing Services) The organisation has a process for identifying  vulnerabilities in internet-facing services within 48 hours and has an example  of where an available exploit has been identified and patched within 48 hours.  Review the process in place for identifying vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems. Request evidence of the identification and  patching of a system that contained an exploitable vulnerability within the environment.  ML1-PA-06 (Internet-Facing Services) Applications with an exploit that has been available  for greater than 48 hours are patched or mitigated.  Use a vulnerability scanner to identify applications within the environment and check that they have been patched against a  known exploit. Determine the date the patch was installed and compare to when the patch was made available.  ML1-PA-07 (Internet-Facing Services) Applications are patched or mitigated within two  weeks.  Use a vulnerability scanner to identify applications within the environment and check that they have been patched against a  known exploit. Determine the date the patch was installed and compare to when the patch was made available.  Patches, updates or  vendor mitigations for  security vulnerabilities  in office productivity  suites, web browsers  and their extensions,  email clients, PDF  software, and security  products are applied  within one month of  release.  ML1-PA-08 The organisation has an effective process for patching office productivity  suites, web browsers, email clients, PDF software and security products within  one month.  Confirm the existence of a list of applications, and where the applications are installed. Ensure a process for identifying  vulnerabilities for software in the list is consistently followed. Request evidence of the patching of these applications within one  month.  ML1-PA-09 Office productivity suites, web browsers, email clients, PDF software and  security products do not have security vulnerabilities older than one month.  Use a vulnerability scanner to identify the listed applications within the organisation’s environment, and check that they have  been patched against a known exploit. Check the date the application was updated and compare to the date the patch was  released. Ensure that the gap between is not greater than one month.  E8MVT will perform basic checks of some Microsoft Office applications based on version numbers and file modification dates to  determine if the software has been updated recently.  Internet-facing  services, office  productivity suites,  web browsers and  their extensions, email  clients, PDF software,  Adobe Flash Player,  ML1-PA-10 The organisation has removed unsupported internet-facing services from the  environment.

Configure  Microsoft Office  macro settings  Microsoft Office  macros are disabled  for users that do not  have a demonstrated  business requirement.  ML1-OM-01 A technical solution exists that blocks Microsoft Office macros for users who  are not approved under the Microsoft Office macro policy.  Run RSOP on workstations to identify the Microsoft Office macro security settings applied by group policy settings. This should  typically be set to ‘Disable without notification’. Note ‘Disable with notification’ allows users to bypass this control and does not  meet the intent. Check for Active Directory security groups that enforce Microsoft Office macro blocking.  Test running Microsoft Office macros on a user in the disallowed group. E8MVT will attempt to execute a Microsoft Office macro  within a document.  ML1-OM-02 A record is kept of users that have been approved to allow Microsoft Office  macro execution, and this list matches the list of users within the technical  solution.  Confirm a repository of approved requests for users to execute Microsoft Office macros is maintained and up to date and  matches the technical implementation. Typically, this means the Active Directory Security Group that permits Microsoft Office  macro use should match the list of users who have been approved to run Microsoft Office macros.  Microsoft Office  macros in files  originating from the  internet are blocked.  ML1-OM-03 Microsoft Office files from the internet are unable to execute Microsoft Office  macros.  Attempt to run Microsoft Office macros in Microsoft Office files from the internet. Confirm these files are blocked when received  by download and email. Do this for all installed Microsoft Office applications.  E8MVT will open a test file that contains a zone identifier to indicate it is from the internet.  ML1-OM-04 Microsoft Office has been configured to block Microsoft Office macros from  running in Microsoft Office files from the internet.  Check if the following group policy setting is enabled. Do this for all installed Microsoft Office applications User  Configuration/Policies/Administrative Templates/Microsoft <Application><Version>/Application Settings/Security/Trust  Center/Block macros from running in Office files from the internet.

Restrict  administrative  privileges  Requests for privileged  access to systems and  applications are  validated when first  requested.  ML1-RA-01 A process exists and is enforced for granting privileged access to systems. Confirm the organisation has a documented, approved and enforced privileged access process that outlines the requirements for  provisioning a privileged account to a system or application. Confirm the organisation has a list of systems and applications that  require privileged access.  Review documented privileged access process and systems. Request evidence of process being followed (e.g. support tickets).  Privileged accounts  (excluding privileged  service accounts) are  prevented from  accessing the internet,  email and web  services.  ML1-RA-02 Privileged accounts (excluding privileged service accounts) cannot access the  internet or web services via a web browser or other mechanism.  While logged in as a privileged user, attempt to browse to an internet website. Review the configuration preventing internet  access and attempt to change this as a privileged user not responsible for administering that system. Privileged accounts not  responsible for administering these systems should not be able to change settings to access the internet.  While privileged account policies should be reviewed, they do not satisfy this control without additional technical mechanisms.  ML1-RA-03 Privileged accounts are not configured with mailboxes and email addresses. Attempt to open Microsoft Outlook on a system using the privileged account.  Run the following PowerShell command Get-ADUser -Filter {(admincount -eq 1) -and (emailaddress -like “*”) -and (enabled -eq  $true)} -Properties EmailAddress | Select samaccountname, emailaddress  49  Privileged users use  separate privileged  and unprivileged  operating  environments.  ML1-RA-04 All administrative activities are performed in an administrative environment  that is segmented from the standard user network environment. A separate  environment is provisioned for the use of privileged access and is not used for  any other purpose.  Attempt to access the administrative network environment using a standard account. Attempt to access the standard  environment using a privileged account. Look for evidence of administrative access to unprivileged environments, using tools  such as Bloodhound. Check for the existence of workstations that exist solely for privileged access purposes.  The privileged operating environment must not be virtualised within the unprivileged operating environment for Maturity Level  Two or Maturity Level Three. However, it can be for Maturity Level One.  Unprivileged accounts  cannot logon to  privileged operating  environments.  ML1-RA-05 Unprivileged accounts are not able to logon to systems in the privileged  environment.

Privileged accounts  (excluding local  administrator  accounts) cannot logon  to unprivileged  operating  environments.  ML1-RA-07 A privileged account cannot be used to authenticate and interactively login to  standard user workstations, or other unprivileged environments. Limited- permission administrative accounts can be used to meet business  requirements in unprivileged environments, such as for help desk personnel.  Attempt to login with a privileged account to a standard user workstation. Check group policy settings for ‘Deny logon locally’ and  ‘Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services user rights’ to workstations for privileged accounts.  Limited-permission administrative accounts can be used to meet business requirements in unprivileged environments, such as for  help desk personnel. These accounts should not be highly privileged.  Review list of administrative users who can login to unprivileged environments. None of the users should be highly privileged, for  example Domain Administrators. These users should not be able to access the privileged environment.  ML1-RA-08 An unprivileged account logged into a standard user workstation cannot raise  privileges to a privileged user.  While logged in as a standard user, attempt to use ‘runas’ to open an application as an administrator. Attempt other ways (e.g.  WinRM, Computer Management or RDP) to escalate privileges to an administrator.

ML3-AC-12 The organisational list of allowed applications rules are reviewed for accuracy  with current business requirements and threat profiles.  Check that the Application Control owner has a process for reviewing the list of allowed applications on an annual or more  frequent basis. Mature organisations will outline the process of assessing threats in applications and what supporting business  case details are required from the requesting group.  Check that there is evidence that the organisation has enacted the annual application list review within the last 12 months. This  evidence will typically exist as support tickets, email correspondence, or threat and risk assessments.  Allowed and blocked  execution events on  workstations and  servers are centrally  logged.  ML3-AC-13 (Workstations & Servers) Application control event logs are sent to a  centralised location.  Verify event logs for each required event are collected at a centralised location.  Verify the number of systems logging to this location align with total expected systems (i.e. all systems are logging here).  Event logs are  protected from  unauthorised  modification and  deletion.  ML3-AC-14 Application control event logs are protected from unauthorised modification  and deletion.  Verify standard and unauthorised users are unable to modify or delete event logs.  Event logs are  monitored for signs of  compromise and  actioned when any  signs of compromise  are detected.  ML3-AC-15 Application control event logs are monitored for signs of compromise. Verify a process is in place to monitor application control event logs for signs of compromise. Verify the information gathered is  sufficient to effectively identify compromise.  Look for evidence that this process is being followed. This evidence will typically exist as support tickets, email correspondence,  or threat and risk assessments.  ML3-AC-16 The organisation has an example where they investigated or responded to  signs of compromise triggered by application control monitoring.

Verify the organisation has responded to a sign of compromise trigged by privileged access monitoring. This evidence will  typically exist as support tickets, email correspondence or threat and risk assessments.  ML3-RA-14 Privileged account and group management event logs are monitored for signs  of compromise.  Verify a solution or process is in place to monitor the privileged account and group management event logs for signs of  compromise. Check that the environment owner has a process for detecting and handling any signs of compromise relating to  privileged account and group management.  ML3-RA-15 The organisation has an example where they investigated or responded to  signs of compromise event triggered by privileged account and group  management monitoring.  Verify the organisation has responded to a sign of compromise trigged by privileged account and group management monitoring.  This evidence will typically exist as support tickets, email correspondence or threat and risk assessments.  Patch operating  systems  Patches, updates or  vendor mitigations for  security vulnerabilities  in operating systems of  workstations, servers  and network devices  are applied within two  weeks of release, or  within 48 hours if an  exploit exists.  ML3-PO-01 Operating systems vulnerable to an exploit that has been available for greater  than 48 hours are patched or mitigated.  View vulnerability management solution, logon to server to verify patch applied successfully or review mitigation strategy.  The latest release, or  the previous release,  of operating systems  are used for.  ML3-PO-02 The minimum version of the operating system is the current, or previous  release (N-1 version).  Query Active Directory using PowerShell commands or tools such as ADRecon or Bloodhound to identify operating system  versions within the environment. Use a vulnerability management solution to scan all systems to record their operating system  version.  Multi-factor  authentication  Multi-factor  authentication is used  to authenticate users  accessing important  data repositories.  ML3-MF-01 The organisation has a list of important data repositories. Confirm the organisation has a list of important data repositories and this list is regularly checked.  ML3-MF-02 Data repositories that have been listed as important require MFA to access. Verify important data repositories are configured to present a MFA challenge.  The organisation will determine important / sensitive data repositories.  67  Multi-factor  authentication is  phishing-resistant and  uses either: something  users have and  something users know,  or something users  have that is unlocked  by something users  know or are.  ML3-MF-03 The MFA implementation requires the use of a phishing-resistant solution. Verify that MFA requires a smart card, security key, Windows Hello for Business or any other solution this is resistant to phishing  attacks.  Successful and  unsuccessful multi- factor authentication  events are centrally  logged.  ML3-MF-04 MFA event logs are sent to a centralised location. Verify event logs for each required event are collected at a centralised location.  Verify the number of systems logging to this location align with total expected systems (i.e. all systems are logging here).  Event logs are  protected from  unauthorised  modification and  deletion.  ML3-MF-05 MFA event logs are protected from unauthorised modification and deletion. Verify standard and unauthorised users are unable to modify or delete event logs.  Event logs are  monitored for signs of  compromise and  actioned when any  signs of compromise  are detected.  ML3-MF-06 MFA event logs are monitored for signs of compromise. Verify a solution or process is in place to monitor the integrity and validity of MFA event logs.  ML3-MF-07 The organisation has an example where they investigated or responded to  signs of compromise triggered by MFA monitoring.  Verify the organisation has responded to a sign of compromise trigged by MFA monitoring. This evidence will typically exist as  support tickets, email correspondence or threat and risk assessments.  Regular backups Unprivileged accounts  cannot access backups  belonging to other  accounts, nor their  own accounts.  ML3-RB-01 Unprivileged users are unable to access backups, including their own. Verify access controls restrict unprivileged users from accessing backup repositories.  Privileged accounts  (excluding backup  administrator  accounts) cannot  access backups  belonging to other  accounts, nor their  own accounts.  ML3-RB-02 Privileged users (excluding backup administrator accounts) are unable to  access backups, including their own.  Verify access controls restrict privileged users (excluding backup administrator accounts) from accessing backup repositories.  Privileged accounts  (including backup  administrator  accounts) are  prevented from  modifying and deleting  ML3-RB-03 Privileged users (including backup administrator accounts) are unable to  modify and delete backups during their retention period.  Verify access controls restrict the modification and deletion of backups during their retention period to break glass accounts.  68  backups during their  retention period.

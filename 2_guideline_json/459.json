The development of a Digital Single Market is also the main objective of the Digital Agenda (currently  Digital Single Market strategy2), one pillar being strengthening online trust and security, on which the  growth of the European economy and the development of a strong digital business sector depend. The  Digital Agenda sees internet trust and security as vital to a vibrant digital society and considers a high level  of network and information security across the EU essential to ensure consumer confidence and to keep  the online economy running. Although there is state-of-the-art research in Europe in the field of NIS, and  this area is extensively supported by European funded programs, research is usually not focused on the  aspects where NIS policies need available technologies to move forward on their implementation.  The scope of this report is to review existing analysis reports on EU funded Trust and Security Projects,  summarize achievements that have significantly promoted specific pillars of NIS, identify and summarize  specific outcomes that can promote and support emerging policy and legislative initiatives, namely eIDAS,  GDPR, support industry policy in cybersecurity, and provide recommendations on the formulation of  forthcoming work programmes.  For the analysis of the selected projects, through their reports, six  assessment pillars were identified, based on the ICT & Trust and Security interrelated thematic areas and  emerging policy and legislative initiatives aspects. For each project, achievements that can significantly  promote/favour specific pillars of NIS, are identified along with specific outcomes that can favour and  support emerging policy and legislative initiatives - notably: eIDAS, GDPR, NIS and industry policy in  cybersecurity, including the cybersecurity cPPP.  Even given the limited subset of projects reviewed within the scope of this report, notable achievements  and innovative approaches are identified. Particular note should also be taken of the promotion of  horizontal aspects such as usability, standardization, societal acceptance, economic viability and legal  compliance of the research results. Furthermore, several projects have been particularly successful in  shortening the gap from research to innovation and thus promoting the establishment of a vibrant market  in secure and trustworthy ICT in Europe. The analysis however indicated that there is still a large number  of unresolved cybersecurity, privacy and trust issues (areas of the main legislative initiatives that are not  covered) which necessitate further research across all ICT technology, components, applications and  services.  The recommendations for the forthcoming research and innovation work programmes of H2020 and  cybersecurity cPPP can be summarized as follows:   Sustain close collaboration with all relevant stakeholders on research and innovation topics while  supporting key EU policy initiatives;   Promote market-oriented innovation and direct transferability of outcomes to products or  services;   Introduce horizontal requirements for new information and transparency models and endorse the  adoption of by design and by default paradigms.  1 http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  2 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/europe-2020-strategy  http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/europe-2020-strategy  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  06  1. Introduction  The Europe 2020 strategy3 for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth identifies research as a driver for  innovation, economic growth and sustainability. Through different framework programmes, EU funded  research projects promote and support state‑of‑the‑art research in Europe. The specialized field of  Network and Information Security (NIS) is extensively supported by European‑funded programmes, but is  not always focused on the aspects where emerging policy and legislative initiatives need available  technologies to move forward on their implementation. Within the scope of this report, the following  policy and legislative initiatives have been considered and are briefly presented below.  The EU Cybersecurity Strategy4 includes a number of measures aimed to promote a Single Market for  cybersecurity products together with fostering research and development investments and innovation.  The development of a Digital Single Market is also the main objective of the Commission's Digital Agenda,  one pillar being strengthening online trust and security, on which the growth of the European economy  and the development of a strong digital business sector depend. The Digital Agenda and the Digital Single  Market Strategy5, perceive trust and security in digital services vital for a vibrant digital society and  consider a high level of network and information security across the EU essential to ensure consumer  confidence and to keep the online economy running.  The Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive, adopted by the EU Council  on 17 May 20166, aims  to put in place the necessary mechanisms at national and EU level to improve security levels and respond  to cyber threats. The aim is to have a secure and trustworthy digital environment throughout the EU. This  should include improving Member States' national cybersecurity capabilities, improving Member States  cooperation and improving cooperation between public and private sectors.  The Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market (eIDAS Regulation)7 adopted on 23 July 2014 is a milestone to provide a stable regulatory  environment to enable secure and seamless electronic interactions between businesses, citizens and  public authorities. It lays down the foundations for people, companies (in particular SMEs) and public  administrations to access safely cross border electronic services and seamlesly perform electronic  transactions.  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which entered into force on 24 May 2016 and shall apply  from 25 May 2018.8, aims to achieve a comprehensive reform of data protection rules in the EU. The  objective of this new set of rules is to give citizens back control over of their personal data, and to simplify  the regulatory environment for business. The data protection reform is a key enabler of the Digital Single  Market.  3 http://ec.europa.eu/eu2020/pdf/COMPLET%20EN%20BARROSO%20%20%20007%20-%20Europe%202020%20- %20EN%20version.pdf  4 http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  5 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52015DC0192  6 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/commission-proposal-directive-concerning-measures-ensure-high- common-level-network-and  7 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN  8 http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  http://ec.europa.eu/eu2020/pdf/COMPLET%20EN%20BARROSO%20%20%20007%20-%20Europe%202020%20-%20EN%20version.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/eu2020/pdf/COMPLET%20EN%20BARROSO%20%20%20007%20-%20Europe%202020%20-%20EN%20version.pdf http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52015DC0192 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/commission-proposal-directive-concerning-measures-ensure-high-common-level-network-and http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/commission-proposal-directive-concerning-measures-ensure-high-common-level-network-and http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  07  Scope and Objectives  This work is undertaken under ENISA Work Programme 2016, as part of Work Package 1.3. -  Research &  Development, Innovation under the Strategic Objective 1 - To develop and maintain a high level of  expertise of EU actors taking into account evolutions in Network and Information Security (NIS). The  overall scope is to improve coordination and facilitate support in policy areas that rely on a technological  base. The objectives of this report are to:   Review findings from existing reports on the achievements of a subset of the ICT Trust & Security  research projects, funded under the 7th Framework Programme, that have exceeded expectations and  have been characterized as success stories;   Summarize achievements from the aforementioned projects that have significantly promoted specific  pillars of Network and Information Security (NIS);   Identify and summarize specific outcomes that can promote emerging policy and legislative initiatives,  such as the eIDAS Regulation and the General Data Protection Regulation, stimulate trust across  different stakeholders and support industry policy in cybersecurity, including the cybersecurity  contractual Public Private Partnership;   Provide recommendations on promoting research approaches that can move forward Network and  Information Security (NIS) at EU level;  It should be noted however that the overall aim of this report is not to supplement the role of reviewers of  the projects, nor the relevant review meetings and procedures. ENISA did not analyse the deliverables of  the projects but only information from publicly available reports.  Overview of Research, Innovation and Policy Support Programmes  The 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7) was the EU's main  instrument for funding research in Europe from 2007 to 2013. The total budget for this seven years period  was € 50.5 billion which marked the priority of Europe in research, innovation and technological  development. It consisted of 4 main blocks of activities forming 4 specific programmes, namely co- operation, ideas, people and capacities, plus a fifth specific programme on nuclear research. Information  and Communication Technologies (ICTs) research activities were part of the co-operation programme and  the total budget was € 9.1 billion.  As mentioned in the 2014 Digital Agenda Scoreboard9, ICT was the  largest research area in the FP7 Cooperation programme. The FP7 ICT worked on the approach of  implementing strategic roadmaps, but also kept an open part for emerging ideas. Under both approaches,  the EU has co-funded over the period 2007-2013 2,261 projects for a total Union funding of about €7.6  billion. In parallel the CIP ICT Policy Support Programme has allocated € 593.2 million of EU funding over  the period 2008 – 2013, distributed to 233 different projects. The ICT PSP (Policy Support Programme) was  one of specific programmes within the CIP (Competitiveness and Innovation framework Programme).  Projects that acted within this programme are funded to support the realization of the Digital agenda for  Europe. More specifically, the programme addressed issues and challenges related to effective exploitation  of innovative, IT products and services.  9 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/scoreboard-2014-overview-participation-fp7-and-cip- programmes-ict-domain  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/scoreboard-2014-overview-participation-fp7-and-cip-programmes-ict-domain https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/scoreboard-2014-overview-participation-fp7-and-cip-programmes-ict-domain  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  08  In absolute terms Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, France and Spain accounted for 60% of total EU  funding and 57% of participations. Cyprus, Greece, Slovenia, Austria and Belgium are the 5 Member States  with the highest amounts of funding compared to the size of their ICT sector. According to the latest  analysis of publications and patents of ICT research in FP710, funded projects were  particularly  effective  in  strengthening  scientific  excellence as well; they have generated  over  170,000  publications, have  led  to  more  than 1,700  patents  and  7,400  commercial  exploitations of products or services.  In the specific ICT research area of Trust and Security the overall focus was towards “developing  knowledge and technologies for building an open, secure and trustworthy information society in Europe,  where citizens and organisations can fully reap the benefits from the new technologies”.  Towards this  direction, a number of interrelated thematic areas11 were promoted and are briefly depicted below.  Figure 1: Main thematic areas of FP7 ICT Trust & Security8  A very high percentage of the EC funding in FP7 was received by organizations that have already  participated in FP6. This holds especially true for universities and research organizations, where a  comparably small number of organizations managed to build up the qualifications and capacities for  10 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=14504  11 http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/security/projects_en.html  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=14504 http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/security/projects_en.html  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  09  continuing to be key players in European‐funded research. FP7 can therefore be considered as having  balanced the need for openness and concentration central to global competition.  Evaluation Criteria  The evaluation criteria used to review findings and summarize achievements of EU Funded research  projects were inspired by the Better Regulation “Toolbox”12, and in particular Tool # 42: Identifying the  evaluation criteria and Questions. According to the Toolbox \"All evaluations must assess the evaluation  criteria of effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, relevance and EU added value” and “Evaluations ... should  also always assess the economic, social and environmental impacts ...\". Based on these indications, five (5)  evaluation criteria were defined and are briefly described in the following subsections.  Effectiveness  Effectiveness analysis considers how successful the project has been in achieving or progressing towards  its objectives. The evaluation aims at forming an opinion on the progress made. The analysis also tries to  identify if any unexpected or unintended effects have occurred.  Coherence  The evaluation of coherence involves looking at a how well or not different actions work together.  Checking \"internal\" coherence means looking at how the various internal components of the project  operate together to achieve its objectives. Similar checks can be conducted in relation to other (\"external\")  interventions at different levels, for example with respect to projects in related areas and EU interventions  within the same policy field or in areas which may have to work together.  Relevance  Relevance looks at the relationship between the needs and problems in society and the objectives of the  project. For example, incorrect assumptions may have been made about the cause and effect relationships  or circumstances may have changed and the current needs/problems may not be the same as the ones  looked at when the project was proposed.  EU added value  EU-added value looks for changes which it can reasonably be argued are due to EU scope, rather than any  other factors. Under the principle of subsidiarity (Article 5 Treaty on European Union), the EU should only  act when the objectives can be better achieved by Union action rather than by potentially varying action  by Member States.  Impacts  Evaluations should also always assess the economic, social and environmental impacts of EU-funded  projects, with – in this specific context - particular emphasis on those impacts that are relevant for the  creation of a Digital Single Market13.  12 http://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/guidelines/toc_tool_en.htm  13 http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market_en  http://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/guidelines/toc_tool_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market_en  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  10  2. Impact Assessment Pillars  Impact Assessment is also part of the Better Regulation “Toolbox” and provides support to the political  decision-making process. It pertains gathering and analysing evidence to support policy making, verifying,  identifying and assessing whether EU action is needed and analysing the advantages and disadvantages of  available solutions. Within the scope of this report six assessment pillars were identified, based on the ICT  & Trust and Security interrelated thematic areas and emerging policy and legislative initiatives aspects.  Namely these pillars are i) Cryptography, ii) Identity Management, iii) Privacy Enhancing Technologies, iv)  Threat Detection And Mitigation, v)Critical Infrastructure Protection and vi) Trustworthy Digital Services.  For each project, achievements that can significantly promote/favour specific pillars of NIS, are identified  along to specific outcomes that can favour and support emerging policy and legislative initiatives - notably:  eIDAS, GDPR, NIS and industry policy in cybersecurity, including the cybersecurity cPPP. The assessment of  each project is a result of an analysis from existing (and publicly available) reports. It is worth emphasizing  that the project list is by no means exhaustive, i.e. many other projects funded within the context of the  same calls, that have also exceeded expectations and could thus be characterized as success stories, have  not been included in this deliverable, due to lack of room and of time (as well as of – possibly – public  information).  Cryptography  European Network of Excellence in Cryptology (Phase II) – Ecrypt II  ECRYPT’s objective was to promote the collaboration of European researchers in information security, and  especially in cryptology and digital watermarking. ECRYPT listed five core research areas, termed \"virtual  laboratories\": symmetric key algorithms (STVL), public key algorithms (AZTEC), protocol (PROVILAB),  secure and efficient implementations (VAMPIRE) and watermarking (WAVILA). Its continuation, ECRYPT II,  was a Network of Excellence in the area of cryptology aiming towards durable integration of European  research in both academia and industry.  ECRYPT II  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2013  Effectiveness  The objectives of the project have been achieved through a wide range of dissemination,  communication and awareness activities including a training program, a substantial  contribution towards standardization bodies, and an active publication policy.  Coherence  The ECRYPT II research roadmap was motivated by the changing environment and threat  models in which cryptology is deployed, the gradual erosion of the computational difficulty  of the mathematical problems on which cryptology is based, and the requirements of new  applications and cryptographic implementations. The project was coherent with a number  of other interventions which had similar objectives.  Relevance  Research in Cryptology and digital watermarking is relevant, since these are fundamental  enablers for secure, dependable, and trusted ICT infrastructures.  EU added value  Ecrypt II engaged leading EU players to integrate their research capabilities within three  virtual labs focusing on i) symmetric key algorithms, ii) public key algorithms and protocols,  and iii) hardware and software implementation. Additionally, it had a critical mass and  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  11  ECRYPT II  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2013  breadth to address the key questions in these areas that could only be achieved at the  European level.  Impacts  Cryptology and digital watermarking are research areas with a high strategic impact for  European industry and for the society as a whole. The intense networking activity done in  Ecrypt II not only brought together industrial and public recourses but also helped stimulate  cybersecurity industry by aligning the demand for advanced cryptology.  Computer Aided Cryptography Engineering – CACE  CACE objective was to design, develop and deploy a toolbox that would support the specific domain of  cryptographic software engineering. The main motivation was that development of hardware devices and  software products is facilitated by a design flow, and a set of tools (e.g., compilers and debuggers), which  automate tasks normally performed by experienced, highly skilled developers. However, in both hardware  and software examples the tools are generic since they seldom provide specific support for a particular  domain.  CACE  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2010  Effectiveness  Project objectives were achieved as final validated solutions enable (relatively) non-expert  personnel to develop high-level cryptographic applications and business models by means  of cryptography-aware high-level programming languages and compilers.  Coherence  Cryptographic software is one of the key enabling technologies of a secure and trustworthy  ICT infrastructure in Europe. Cryptographic software engineering can be a viable solution  for the European software industry to cope with the ever increasing volume of requests for  high-quality cryptographic software. Internally, project objectives were coherent, in that  they were pursued via the development of an integrated set of tools. Externally, the  overarching objective of improving the productivity of the cryptographic software industry  in Europe was – and will be even more so in the years to come – entirely coherent with  other actions aiming at gearing up the European ICT industry for the future challenges  related to secure operation of ICT infrastructures.  Relevance  The final solutions allow automatic analysis and transformation of cryptographic software  to detect security critical implementation failures, e.g., software and hardware based side- channel attacks, when realizing low level cryptographic primitives and protocols. These  objectives are still relevant, since mission critical and modern applications processing  sensitive data are in need of sophisticated cryptographic techniques and cryptographic  software.  EU added value  The challenges that the project addressed affect the industry supplying cryptographic  applications in all European Member States in the same manner. The tackled research  challenges are not limited to regional or national boundaries. Thus, research in this area  would be inefficient at a national level: limiting the scope to the academic or industrial  research in a particular country would lead to a solution that is not sufficient to make the  results usable and efficient for the European-wide use.  Impacts  Development of better-quality and robust software at a much lower cost can provide a  clear economic advantage to the European industry in the short term and positions it better  in dealing with future roadblocks to ICT development in the longer term.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  12  Secure, Embedded Platform with advanced Process Isolation & Anonymity Capabilities – SEPIA  SEPIA focused on three topics: security enhancements of mobile platforms, cryptography and privacy  protecting technologies, delta-evaluation and certification methodologies. The project researched privacy  protecting mechanisms based on strong cryptography and time- and cost-efficient certification processes  reducing the time from design to market. Within the scope of the project, establishing trustworthiness was  seen as an asset that is to be considered right from the design phase rather than being addressed as an  add-on feature.  SEPIA ICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2013  Effectiveness  SEPIA through theoretical and practical research, as well as the development of proof-of- concept prototypes, managed to meet its objectives.  The final SEPIA reference platform was  disseminated via demonstrators and as an open platform for further research and product  development.  Coherence  Establishing trust is a multi-faceted problem, which requires assessments from independent  organisations. Internally, the project was coherent, since significant progress was made with  respect to objectives characterized by a common overarching goal. Externally, the SEPIA  endeavour is perfectly aligned to other interventions, aiming at establishing a trustworthy  ICT infrastructure in Europe.  Relevance  The SEPIA project addressed challenges that are – and will be even more so in the future –  central for the development of prominent digital markets, such as mobile devices and  applications and the Internet of Things. The project tackled issues of trustworthiness, security  and protection of mobile devices as key enablers for new businesses opportunities and the  integration of mobile platforms.  EU added value  The solutions that have been constructed during the project are an example where the SEPIA  concerted efforts of Europe's leading researchers can be used to validate the project's  results. By operating at the European level, the consortium has been able to participate in  clusters of projects aiming at related or complementary goals, in order to disseminate,  discuss and compare the results. The consortium was a mix of industrial and academic  partners that brought together expertise and excellence from various disciplines.  Impacts  SEPIA focused on topics that have a tremendous impact on the development of borderless  and secure Digital Single Market in Europe. Mobile and embedded devices are rapidly  evolving into powerful, ubiquitous personal assistants. As such, they will be involved in  security-critical operations like authentication, payment, e-Banking and e-Government  applications and transactions as regarded in the eIDAS regulation.  Trusted Revocable Biometric Identities – TURBINE  TURBINE proposed a multi-disciplinary privacy enhancing authentication technology combining innovative  developments in cryptography and fingerprint biometrics. Specific objectives of the project were to ensure  that the crypto-protection deployed on the biometric data was non-invertible and had the lowest possible  impact on biometric verification performance. Project results were assessed using very large fingerprint  data bases held by two project partners to compare performance with and without crypto-protection.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  13  TURBINE  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2011  Effectiveness  TURBINE provided reliable biometric 1:1 verifications, multi-vendor interoperability, and  system security, while addressing major issues related to privacy concerns associated to the  use of biometrics for ID management. Its primary objective of rendering this innovation  commercially viable was also achieved, by demonstrating that the technology is sufficiently  mature for deployment as a solution to large scale eID requirements.  Coherence  TURBINE addressed topics that were – and still are – coherent with other actions which have  similar objectives. In particular, it explored: i) data protection and privacy issues and ii)  requirements of key application sectors for eID management solutions. Expert groups were  included in the project to advise the consortium.  Relevance  TURBINE addressed privacy concerns regarding the use of fingerprint biometrics for ID  management. Through a comprehensive verification test and demonstration environment, it  evaluated how single fingerprint data of an individual may be used to generate several secure  identities with different levels of trust without weakening the overall security.  EU added value  The challenges that the project addressed affect the industry supplying cryptographic  applications in all European Member States. The breadth of technical expertise necessary to  undertake this project could not be assembled at the national level.  Impacts  TURBINE addressed research issues that have a tremendous potential in terms of market  opportunities as they can offer all the benefits of biometric security while mitigating or  eliminating the associated risks. Additionally, the European Data Protection Supervisor  (EDPS) issued a positive opinion14 on TURBINE's approach which provides evidence that data  protection concerns, as imposed by GDPR, related to the use of biometrics can be resolved.  Identity Management  Secure Identity Across Borders Linked – STORK  The aim of the STORK project was to establish a European eID Interoperability Platform to enable citizens  to establish new e-relations across borders, just by presenting their national eID.  STORK 2.0 followed up  on STORK and validated the STORK platform in additional pilots, promoting interoperability of different  approaches at national and EU level.  STORK  CIP-ICT-PSP-2007.1.2 - TOWARDS PAN-EUROPEAN  RECOGNITION OF ELECTRONIC IDS (EIDS)  2008 - 2011  Effectiveness  The STORK interoperable solution for electronic identity (eID) was based on a distributed  architecture that paved the way towards full integration of EU e-services while taking into  account specifications and infrastructures currently existing in EU Member States. The main  technology outcome of STORK was the creation of a pan-European federation of electronic  identities along to common rules and specifications to assist mutual recognition of eIDs.  Coherence The STORK project aimed to establish a European eID Interoperability Platform that allows  citizens to authenticate themselves using their own national credentials in order to access  14 https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/webdav/shared/Documents/Consultation/Opinions/2011/11-02- 01_FP7_EN.pdf  https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/webdav/shared/Documents/Consultation/Opinions/2011/11-02-01_FP7_EN.pdf https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/webdav/shared/Documents/Consultation/Opinions/2011/11-02-01_FP7_EN.pdf  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  14  STORK  CIP-ICT-PSP-2007.1.2 - TOWARDS PAN-EUROPEAN  RECOGNITION OF ELECTRONIC IDS (EIDS)  2008 - 2011  cross-border services provided by national service provider. The project’s main contributions  and achievements are coherent with other EU interventions and objectives.  Relevance  Interoperability across different countries has been, and is still a challenge as far as identity  is concerned, because of the many issues involved (security, privacy, compliance). STORK’s  user centric and cross-border approaches, and its results, are valuable for the development  of future projects.  EU added value  STORK’s goal was to ensure eID interoperability at European level including common  specifications, a common code for an architecture and a framework for sustainable  deployment across EU. STORK and STORK 2 paved the way towards the provision of a pan- European ID, since they has addressed main issues like enabling mutual recognition of eID  and trust services among Member States and tangible evidence on the applicability of the  eIDAS regulation.  Impacts  STORK and STORK 2.0 had a direct impact on the adoption of the eID services across Europe  through a federated and trustworthy framework for cross-border eID services and build the  basis for a future widespread use of eID solutions across borders.  Authentication and Authorisation for Entrusted Unions – AU2EU  AU2EU brought advanced privacy-enhancing attribute-based credentials towards the cloud to simplify  deployments, e.g., by reducing or avoiding the requirement to install user-side software. The aim of the  project was to implement and demonstrate in a real-life environment an integrated eAuthentication and  eAuthorisation framework to enable trusted collaborations and delivery of services across different  organisational/governmental jurisdictions.  AU2EU ICT-2013.1.5 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2013 - 2015  Effectiveness  AU2EU built on existing schemes and research results, mainly ABC4Trust, and efficiently  executed aligned activities defined in the Trust in Digital Life (TDL) strategic research agenda.

Relevance  The projects advanced the technology in the fields of eAuthentication and eAuthorization  providing a privacy-friendly authentication architecture and platform across organisational  borders. It has developed tools allowing unifying authorisation policies, attributes and claims  of different security domains, and providing the advanced authorisation platform working  across organisational borders.  EU added value  The project has successfully advanced four different domains: assurance of claims, trust  indicators, policy enforcement mechanisms and processing under encryption techniques to  address specific security and confidentiality requirements of large distributed  infrastructures.  Impacts Achievements of AU2EU will have a direct impact on the promotion and deployment of the  trust services as defined within the eIDAS regulation. Moreover, the eAuthentication and  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  15  AU2EU ICT-2013.1.5 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2013 - 2015  eAuthorization framework support concepts as (un)Traceability, (un)Linkability from relying  party to claims provider, (un)Linkability between relying parties and (non)Disclosure, which  are directly related to GDPR specifically in the areas of privacy by design, privacy enhancing  technologies and data subject rights.  Shaping the Future of Electronic Identity – FutureID  FutureID integrated existing eID technologies and trust infrastructures, emerging federated identity  management services and modern credential technologies to provide a user-centric system for the  trustworthy and accountable management of identity claims towards a privacy-aware and ubiquitous  identity management infrastructure for Europe.  FUTUREID ICT-2011.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2012 - 2015  Effectiveness  FutureID developed building blocks that can be used to provide interoperability between  different identity management standards and organize an open marketplace for identity  management where many service providers and identity providers can operate. End users  can benefit from ubiquitously usable open source eID client, while application and service  providers will be enabled to use trustworthy authentication services.  Coherence  FutureID bridged the gap between the various existing electronic identities and promoted  efforts towards the implementation of a trust infrastructure for authentication support and  promoted reliable, accountable and coherent with EU initiatives deployment of electronic  identity technologies.  Relevance  FutureID can by exploited by different providers and operators, supporting the flexible  development of new and possibly diverging business cases while the infrastructure is  expected to provide benefits to all stakeholders involved in the eID value chain.  EU added value  FutureID can support all stakeholders involved in the eID value chain. Users will benefit  from the availability of ubiquitously usable open source eID client application and service  providers will use trustworthy authentication services without the need of making large up- front investments in eID technologies or to meet legal obligations.  Impacts  FutureID offers the technical components that together form the infrastructure necessary for  online authentication and electronic signatures while considering the electronic  identification and trust services requirements in the vision of providing of the infrastructure  of eSignature services. Moreover, the architecture puts high emphasis on privacy protection  and integrates state of the art privacy-enhancing attribute-based credentials addressing also  GDPR requirements.  Trusted Architecture for Securely Shared Services - TAS3  TAS3 aimed at developing and implementing an architecture with trusted services to manage and process  distributed personal information. It contributed to the design of an architecture able to meet the  requirements of complex and highly versatile business processes and to enabling the dynamic user-centric  management of policies.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  16  TAS3  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES 2008 - 2011  Effectiveness  TAS3 focused on the development of a Trust Policy Management architecture, where issues  like trust and privacy, identity management, authentication and authorisation as well as legal  and privacy issues were efficiently handled. It efficiently validated and demonstrated the  applicability of the open, secure and trusted architecture that was developed for the  exchange of personal information in the domains of e-Employability and e-Health.  Coherence  TAS3 developed architecture supports dynamic user-centric management of policies, ensures  end-to-end secure transmission of personal information and user-controlled attributes  between heterogeneous, context dependent and continuously changing systems.  Relevance  Empowering individuals to be in control of their personal data and supporting their lifelong  re-use of personal data while preserving personal privacy and confidentiality in dynamic  environments are fundamental issues for the provision of electronic services.  EU added value  TAS3 promotes trust and confidence in electronic transactions, and indirectly addresses the  requirements of the electronic identification and trust services as described in the eIDAS  regulation. Moreover, the proposed notification mechanism can also be used by service  providers and organizations to easily implement requirements imposed by GDPR concerning  mainly on mechanisms for notification of citizens when breaches do occur. Moreover, the  techniques proposed in TAS3 are directly relevant for EU cyber preparedness.  Impacts  TAS3 participated in the development of European Trust Observatory (ETO), which aimed  towards the development of trust compliance policies and procedures for Service Providers.  Such “policy and procedure specifications\" need to be observable and auditable and these  will deliver the information to certify and build trustworthiness into the systems, services and  their providers, paving the way towards GDPR implementation.  Secure Widespread Identities for Federated Telecommunications - SWIFT  The SWIFT project leveraged identity technology as a key to integrate service and transport infrastructures  for the benefit of users and the providers. It focused on extending identity functions and federation to the  network while addressing usability and privacy concerns.  SWIFT  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2010  Effectiveness  SWIFT developed an identity framework that transforms identity as a key enabling  technology for convergence between networks, services, applications and content on the  technical side and between operators, service providers, micro-operators and even users as  providers on the business side. It has efficiently achieved its objectives to solve identity  fragmentation, by extending IdM systems for multiple services at different network layers  using the same ID and bridging platforms and layers.  Coherence  The SWIFT framework advanced traditional IdM solutions and provided an environment for  an advanced management of end users identities through identity aggregation from different  individual identities, anonymous services access and cross-layer authentication and  authorization.  Relevance  The SWIFT framework extended and progressed identity management solutions like identity  aggregation, anonymity, cross-layer SSO, advanced access control and mobility at network  level, and between devices. Regarding privacy, it supported prevention of unauthorized  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  17  SWIFT  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2010  parties linking different steps or actions due to identical identifiers, enforcement of privacy  rules at different providers, and assurance of the user's autonomy in disclosing attributes.  EU added value  The SWIFT project leveraged identity as a convergence layer between different players in  the communication and services space, and aimed to make identity a communication end  point through which service and network providers can discover the users and deliver their  services. It covered a number of privacy issues and user concerns and tackled the relative  regulatory issues of GDPR. Moreover, the SWIFT identity framework aimed to overcome the  Identity fragmentation in EU, provide cross-layer IdM taking into account both application  and network layers, support for multiple devices and provide independency from online  components. These aspects consist requirements of the electronic identification and trust  services architecture.  Impacts  SWIFT leveraged digital Identities to solve mainly identity fragmentation and extended IdM  systems for multiple services at different network layers. An effective IdM can have a  significant impact on networks and network services providing new service delivery options  and guaranteeing end users about the authenticity of the service provider.  Privacy Enhancing Technologies  Attribute-Based Credentials for Trust – ABC4Trust  ABC4Trust’s focus was to improve internet privacy by developing capabilities to introduce attribute-based  credentials into identity management systems, allowing users to only reveal the minimum information  required by the application, without giving away full identity information.  ABC4TRUST ICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2015  Effectiveness  ABC4Trust successfully addressed the federation and interchangeability of technologies that  support trustworthy yet privacy-preserving Attribute-based Credentials (ABCs). The  proposed architecture is able to decompose future (reference) implementations of Privacy- ABC technologies into sets of modules and specify the abstract functionality of these  components in such a way that they are independent from algorithms or cryptographic  components used underneath.  Coherence  ABC4Trust is applicable to the architectures of existing widely deployed identity protocols  and frameworks such as WS-*, SAML, OpenID, OAuth and X.509 and also alleviates some of  their security, privacy, and scalability issues.  Relevance  The project outcomes provide benefits in the concept of “partial identities” and the legal  principle of data minimisation as included in GDPR, allowing people to control release of their  data.  EU added value  ABC4Trust facilitates the implementation of a trustworthy and at the same time privacy- protecting digital society which provides an added value in GDPR implementation.  Privacy ABCs alone and together with other mature Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs)  have a high potential to influence the ongoing development in the domain of data protection  and privacy. This will influence the understanding and definition of what appropriate  technical and organisational measures are adequate to ensure data protection.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  18  ABC4TRUST ICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2015  Impacts  ABC4Trust promotes European privacy values in infrastructures and will empower individuals  and communities by increasing accountability, trustworthiness of information, allowing more  elaborate access control and user-centred Identity Management (IdM).  Privacy and identity management for community services - PICOS  The objective of PICOS was to develop and build a state-of-the-art platform for providing the trust, privacy,  and identity management aspects of social community services and applications on the Internet and in  mobile communication networks.  PICOS  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2011  Effectiveness  PICOS met its objective through the implementation of Sub-communities and Partial  Identities concepts that allows users to reveal only selected personal information as an  attribute and the Privacy Advisor tool to guide the users in aspects of their privacy and  identity management. The notion of Private Rooms was also introduced enabling users to  establish a personal area for managing their private information and content, enhancing  their privacy by enabling them to store and selectively publish their private information to a  certain set of other users.  Coherence  The resulting platform provided a state-of-the-art community, supporting identity  management system that can be used by the industrial members of PICOS creating benefits  and insights in the European IT and telecommunications industry beyond the scope of the  project. By involving all stakeholders on the community value chain, PICOS will strengthen  integrated European privacy and trust products and Europe’s competitive advantage for trust  in on-line applications and services.  Relevance  PICOS concepts and developments provide the basis for the enhancement of products and  services with regards to privacy and data protection, confirming also their key role during the  participation and engagement in online communities.  EU added value  PICOS through insights on citizens’ perception and understanding of  privacy, achieved  implementation of privacy-enhancing technologies for trustworthy, privacy-friendly  community transactions addressing several areas of the GDPR.  Impacts  The results of PICOS have an impact at different levels of community related services, by  integrating privacy enhancing concepts as part of a holistic approach to improve privacy and  trust in social communities.  Privacy and Identity Management in Europe for Life – PrimeLife  PrimeLife’s vision was to provide privacy, trust and ID management through tools such as browser plug-ins,  social networks and encryption. It was built upon and extended the FP6 Project PRIME, which dealt with  enabling citizens to exercise their legal rights to control personal information in online transactions.  PrimeLife aimed to resolve core privacy and trust issues involving protection of privacy for web-based  applications, making existing privacy enhancing technologies useable and foster the adoption of privacy  enhancing technologies by providing open source components and educational materials.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  19  PRIMELIFE  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2011  Effectiveness  PrimeLife developed a number of mechanisms and open source tools for privacy and identity  management that can be used as building blocks of future privacy-enabled technologies.  Project results further advanced state-of-the-art in the sphere of interface usability,  configurable policy languages, federation of web services, privacy-enhanced identity  management enablers, and privacy-enhancing cryptography.  PrimeLife has extended identity management towards transparency with a set of open  source tools such as the W3C Privacy Dashboard for tracking data collection while protecting  usage of personal data through encryption.  Coherence  PrimeLife contributed to the development of a new generation of web-based applications  and services, removing trust and security barriers and enabling end users to control personal  information in on-line transactions.  Relevance  The privacy-enhancing technique developed during the projects lifetime still corresponds to  the needs and problems within the EU and can be used for virtual communities (social  networks) and collaborative applications on the Internet.  EU added value  In the fields of transparency in general data processing and information exchange, project  tools can be re-used and extended, as the Privacy Dashboard, with the focus on emerging ICT  systems and life-log of personal data within social communities.  Impacts  By promoting aspects like user reputation, certification and granting users the ability to  control their privacy, Primelife contributed to addressing EU societal challenges and  obligations as imposed by GDPR.  Context-aware data-centric information sharing – CONSEQUENCE  Consequence focused on the engineering of an interoperable architecture for data sharing, facilitating  dynamic policy management enforcement and end-to-end data protection across multiple organizations  and techniques for organisation of neutral data sharing agreements.  CONSEQUENCE  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2011  Effectiveness  Consequence combined known technologies extending and combining them to achieve the  required goal and delivered new research results (e.g. DSA and EPL languages). The use of  the controlled natural language (CNL4DSA), the insertion of a help-on-line facility partly  mitigating usability issues and a world-wide patent depict project’s achieved objectives.  Coherence  Consequence defined a generic, scalable, context-aware, secure and resilient architecture  within a framework that enable dynamic management policies based on agreements that  ensure end-to-end secure protection of data-centric information, addressing the increasing  need for quick, dynamic and secure information sharing.  Relevance  The proposed framework took into account not only technological, but also economic and  social aspects of data exchange while promoting Data Sharing Agreements (DSA) for  managing shared data among multiple participants in several specific domains and contexts  and EPL languages.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  20  CONSEQUENCE  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2011  EU added value  Consequence advanced available technologies for quick, dynamic and secure information  sharing in multi-organisational environments with independent IT Infrastructures addressing  the emerging need for information sharing as expressed in all major EU policy interventions.  Impacts  The integrated capability of the developed solution for converting a high level specification  of security requirements into low-level enforceable policies can be exploited in several  different domains, through respective customization and integration.  Privacy-aware Secure Monitoring - PRISM  PRISM’s aim was to devise a privacy-preserving network monitoring system with enforcement of the  applicable data protection legal framework. It investigated the possibility to preserve the customers’  privacy, by avoiding disclosure of raw captured data even inside the controller domain itself, while  preserving the possibility of executing monitoring applications, including the possibility to detect and react  to attacks and trace back abuses and having as result to improve public security.  PRISM  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2010  Effectiveness  PRISM developed a privacy-preserving network monitoring system where carefully designed  data protection mechanisms can coexist with suitably adapted monitoring applications.  Moreover, it addressed the challenge of out-sourcing monitoring applications without  privacy concerns. A regulatory assessment was also performed based on the  EuroPriSeCriteria15 .  Coherence  PRISM is coherent with EU interventions in the area of privacy. The interest in monitoring  systems resides in their results and even if they do not introduce directly any privacy concern,  their need to access a data trace does. The middleware policies ensure that the processing  of data gathered through monitoring will be carried out in line with the set of rules and  limitations provided by respective data protection obligation and requirements.  Relevance  PRISM moved traffic analysis and data reduction to the edge of the measurement system  where possible, and replaced general techniques with specific analysis targeted toward  specific tasks. This approach allows aggressive data reduction and protection for scalability  as well as privacy protection.  EU added value  The approach undertaken managed to adapt to the regulatory requirements of functional  separation between the entities accessing the gathered data and the entities controlling and  managing access permissions while reducing the data that telecom operators needs to  process and store.  Impacts  PRISM can impact the way citizens perceive their network activities about being monitored  and increase their trust in communication infrastructures since network monitoring  applications are able to operate in a privacy-preserving manner and in accordance to the  underlying legal obligations and restrictions.  15 https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/Criteria  https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/Criteria  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  21  Threat Detection and Mitigation  Worldwide Observatory of Malicious Behaviors and Attack Threats – WOMBAT  WOMBAT aimed at the development of new means to address the current and future threats related to the  Internet and IT services. It focused on real-time gathering of security-related raw data, with particular  attention put on leveraging existing tools and exploring the development of tools dedicated to wireless  (WiFi, RFID, Bluetooth) networks, threat analysis and techniques to enrich the raw secure-related data.  WOMBAT  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2011  Effectiveness  The project reached its objectives, in particular as reported in the WOMBAT experimental  reports. Root Cause Analysis framework and prototype of early warning system developed  during the project have been successfully tested and applied to various WOMBAT datasets  to perform intelligence analyses. Moreover, the WOMBAT Consortium provided end-users  with the open-access to WOMBAT API (WAPI) - a set of API developed by the project partners  to allow integrated access to different attack datasets.  Coherence  Current EU and national initiatives prove that combating cybercrime is one of the major  priorities in the security field in general. In addition, problem of the usability and accessibility  of security-related information is still challenging. Therefore the goals, approach and outputs  of the WOMBAT project are still coherent with the scope of the current cyber security efforts.  WOMBAT scope and focus were also coherent with NIS Working Group 2 WG2 focused on  information exchange and incident coordination.  Relevance  The WOMBAT objectives were in line with expectations of potential end-users (i.e.: ISPs,  CERTS, antivirus companies, security researchers, security-conscious organizations and home  users) related to threat analysis. Objectives of the project were relevant to the end-user  needs, and current obstacles related to sharing the security data, trade-off between safety  and flexibility of access to the data, and also independency of the analyses of security threats.  Moreover, the project addressed also issues related to the insufficient level of confidence of  the European citizens related the cyber security and addressed the needs for raising security  awareness in Europe.  EU added value  Results of WOMBAT were a step towards obtaining more global and comprehensive view of  the security-related data, thus they can contribute to supporting cyber-security experts in  their decision making process for countermeasures selection. Also, the project results can  foster cyber security investments in EU organisations.  Impacts  The potential impact of WOMBAT activities can strengthen users (society, government,  business) trust in the use of networks, software and e-services. Moreover, the outputs of the  project have a potential to provide IT users with means to protect their digital identity and  personal data, which is consistent with the current European efforts leading to adoption of  the new GDPR regulation.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  22  Nippon-European Cyberdefense-Oriented Multilayer threat Analysis – NECOMA  NECOMA addressed aspects of data collection, aiming at expanding currently used data gathering  mechanisms and adapting them to threat data analysis purposes. Moreover, the project aimed to analyse  threat-related data including both the target and victim perspective, instead focusing only on attack  mechanisms and system vulnerabilities. NECOMA aimed also at developing cyber security metrics to assess  attack impact and novel cyber defence mechanisms that could be used with these metrics.  NECOMA  ICT-2013.10.1 - EU-JAPAN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  COOPERATION  2013 - 2016  Effectiveness  One of the main outputs of the project was the implementation of the threat analysis  platform with a set of unified interfaces for accessing heterogeneous security related  information that can be used both for real as well as for non-real time analyses. The  prototype of the platform allowed to monitor and analyse a number of security incidents and  attack patterns across different layers (end-point layer and infrastructure layer).  Coherence  Current EU and national initiatives prove that combating cybercrime is one of the major  priorities in the security field in general. In addition, problem of the usability and accessibility  of security-related information is still challenging, therefore the goals, approach and outputs  of the WOMBAT project are still coherent with the scope of the current cyber security efforts.  Moreover, NECOMA objectives and scope are coherent with other, previous EU initiatives  funded under FP7 ICT schemes, e.g. with the WOMBAT project.  Relevance  NECOMA contributed to the development of new approaches and instruments addressing  the fight against cyber-attacks. The proposed scenarios are in line with the currently  emerging threats, in particular combating botnets and malware, as well as cyber security of  mobile/micro devices are the topics addressed in European and US roadmaps related to  cyber security, e.g. “A Roadmap for cybersecurity research” and “The Red Book: A Roadmap  for Systems Security Research”.  Those threats and scope are also in line with recently  published cyber threats landscape by ENISA. Moreover, the comprehensiveness of the  proposed approach (including both victim and attacked infrastructure perspective analysis)  is relevant to the current needs and trends.  EU added value  As the project is funded within the EU-Japan collaboration scheme, NECOMA included project  partners both from EU and Japan fostering international cooperation in the field of cyber  security and promoting EU cybersecurity preparedness.  Impacts  The NECOMA consortium intensively collaborated with the industry aiming at adoption of  the project results and in order to augment the exploitation potential for consortium  members. Moreover, NECOMA industrial partners are actively involved in development and  providing DDoS mitigation solutions and are major European players in the area of cyber  security.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  23  Securing Websites through Malware Detection and Attack Prevention Technologies – SWEPT  The SWEPT project focus was put on protection of websites against cyber-attacks, malware and on  mitigation of web vulnerabilities. The main goal of the consortium was to develop a solution that will be  able to minimize impact of malicious attacks on websites, maximizing their security posture with the  assumption that website owners or administrators intervention is not necessary (or limited intervention is  needed) to secure the website.  SWEPT ICT CIP-PSP 2007-2013 2014 – 2017  Effectiveness  The proposed SWEPT security solution mixes two approaches, namely proactive security  (website attacks prevention) and reactive security (including detection and mitigation). At  the current stage of the project the consortium effectively progresses towards the defined  objectives. Two business-oriented pilots are planned for year 2016: Pilot for ISP, website  administrators and owners, and Pilot 2 for web designers and developers.  Coherence  The SWEPT initiative is coherent with other initiatives in this research area. SWEPT  consortium formally interacts with ACDC project (FP7) in order to maximize benefits coming  from future implementation of both projects’ outputs. Complementarities between SWEPT  and ACDC projects have been reported in an official deliverable and enable future integration  of projects results, namely SWEPT can use threat and vulnerability data from the ACDC  Central Clearing House (CCH) and analogically threats and vulnerabilities detected using the  SWEPT platform can feed the CCH.  Relevance  The project approach reflects the needs for securing websites and targets the majority of  actors from the Internet ecosystem, in particular website owner and administrators, web  hosting providers and ISPs. Nowadays, one of the main challenging issues is the lack of  resources in the majority of organisations to invest on websites security (both in terms of  funding and time/human resources). In this sense, SWEPT introduces an approach that will  be cost-effective, automated and easy to implement addressing this main challenge. Finally,  the SWEPT outputs can be integrated and can complement 3rd party security products of  web security companies.  EU added value  The successful implementation of the SWEPT platform will bring benefits to individual  website owners and administrators, and small/SME organizations with limited resources that  must balance between security of their websites and cost of security investments. This could  be achieved by the SWEPT approach promoting not only secure design of the websites  (Security-by-Design) but also by fostering the automation of response (automated detection  and threat mitigation) in case of malicious attack. The project outputs will contribute to  increasing the European consumers trust in websites and web applications, including  emerging markets of e-services.  Impacts  The expected impact reaches a variety of stakeholders from the whole Internet value chain,  impacting also common Internet users that can be ultimately affected by the malicious  website infection. Additionally, the SWEPT project has the ambition to define and develop  “de facto” standards and good practices in the context of websites protection and a model  of certification that will assess the security of given website in accordance to the SWEPT  security measures. Therefore, the project outputs will have potential to impact also  certification/auditing standards and standardisation bodies.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  24  Critical Infrastructure Protection  A European Network of Excellence in Managing Threats and Vulnerabilities in the Future  Internet: Europe for the World – SysSec  SysSec was a Network of Excellence project extending the FORWARD project and aimed at building strong  synergies with industry and policy makers by advancing the field of Systems Security. Three areas were  identified as the most important and crucial in securing ICT systems: malware, targeted attacks and social  engineering/phishing. The project also identified the major technologies which require more investment in  their security: social networks, on-line games, e-commerce, e-banking, sensors/drones, embedded systems,  smart environments, legacy systems, Critical Infrastructures, mobile/wireless networks, implantable devices  and cloud computing.  SYSSEC ICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2014  Effectiveness  The main output of the project was the Roadmap for Systems Security Research. Moreover,  SysSec consortium created and maintained a virtual centre of excellence with the goal to  consolidate system security researchers across EU.  Coherence  The project was coherent with the vision of Horizon H2020 programme, taking into account  industrial and societal perspective of cyber security challenges. The SysSec threat  identification and recommendations were also consistent with ENISA Threat Landscape  reports published during the SysSec project. SysSec efforts was highly coherent with the  activities of NIS PPP Working Groups dealing with risk management (WG1) by SysSec  educational activities, with security information exchange (WG2) by identification of Future  Internet vulnerabilities, and with secure ICT research and innovation through the SysSec  Roadmap contribution.  Relevance  The identified research outputs are relevant to the actual cyber security trends and the  Future Internet challenges, addressing such topics as privacy preservation, big data  challenges, security of smart cities and smart infrastructures (e.g. smart grids).  EU added value  SysSec established a strong community of experts in the field of systems security with an  ambition to play a noticeable role in the changing cyber security environment. Creation of a  synergy between research/academia and policy makers - both through the Red Book content  as well as by the SysSec community involvement –also adds value for the EU cyber security  and CIP initiatives. It should be noted that Red Book includes clearly articulated research  gaps, the main challenges and recommendations for future R&D actions that can be reflected  in the EU interventions.  Impacts  The main impact of the project can be expected on policy makers and research communities.  In particular identification of the Grand Challenge Research Problems in the area of Systems  Security is strong advice to the collaboration between RTO organisations and funding  agencies in order to improve cyber security of ICT.  Tool for systemic risk analysis and secure mediation of data exchanged across linked CI  information infrastructures – MICIE  The MICIE project was focused on the Critical Infrastructure (CI) protection domain and resilience of CI  against malicious activities and failures caused by natural phenomena. It developed and validated an alerting  system, able to identify threats related to given CI component in real time and to identify dependencies of  threaten CI with other critical facilities.  http://cordis.europa.eu/programme/rcn/14134_en.html http://cordis.europa.eu/programme/rcn/14134_en.html  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  25  MICIE  ICT-SEC-2007.1.7 - INFORMATION AND  COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES: CRITICAL  INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION  2008 - 2011  Effectiveness  The core of the alerting system prototype was the Prediction Tool – the central module of  the early warning system. Other expected results were also achieved, namely the off-line  design of CI models and the mediation gateways to collect CI-related security events with  ability to describe them using common meta-data model.  Coherence  Critical Infrastructures have to ensure the highest security levels to be able to fulfil their duty  in any circumstances. Modelling and analysing them and their interdependencies are  essential to discovering hidden vulnerabilities and threats.  Relevance  The MICIE project was consistent with end-user needs related to daily operation of Critical  Infrastructures and reflected in the Work Programme, namely better understanding and  management of complex and interdependent interactions between different CI components,  as well as systematic risk analysis and security configuration dedicated to CI. Risk analysis was  also the main focus of the NIS PPP WG1 working group.  The MICIE project objectives and results were consistent with and can contribute to the EU  proposal of Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CIWIN) that is a pillar of the  European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP).  EU added value  Based on the results of MICIE system validation, it can be concluded that MICIE solution have  a potential to increase the quality of services provided with European Critical Infrastructures.  Automated support for the operator that will be assisted in detecting failures, malicious  attempts of attacks and appropriated countermeasures can contribute to the cost-savings  and increased resilience of the EU CI networks. Contribution to the modelling of CIs and CI  dependencies can also be perceived as an added value due to still immature and inadequate  models currently in use.  Impacts  Implementation of results of the MICIE can impact CI owners and operators leveraging CI  resilience against disruptions. In result, this may have a positive impact of CI end-users  (societal impact). Moreover, contributing to CIWIN can impact CI expert communities.  Technology-supported Risk Estimation by Predictive Assessment of Socio-technical Security –  TREsPASS  The TREsPASS project’s main objectives are to develop tools supporting analysis and visualisation of  information about security risks, and to propose possible countermeasures for them. The developed tool  will identify various attack paths (their possibility and impact) and analyse which countermeasures are the  most effective. The project combines technical approach (analysis of assets and protocols vulnerabilities)  with social aspects.  TRESPASS ICT-2011.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2012 - 2016  Effectiveness  The expected outputs of the TREsPASS project will be included in the developed framework  allowing organisations to employ analytic, model-based methods in their risk management  processes. This framework will allow for the iterative development of socio-technical security  models and will also include tools for prediction of attacks and their prioritisation based on  attack properties extracted from these models. Finally, the project will deliver a preventive  tool able to calculate the effects of an attack and the most appropriate countermeasures and  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  26  TRESPASS ICT-2011.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2012 - 2016  mitigation strategies taken into account the cost-effectiveness of those countermeasures. Up  to date (close to the end of the project) it seems that objectives will be effectively achieved.  Coherence  Since the project aims at identification and protection against security threats related to  information and at improvements of existing risk management methods, it is coherent with  a number of complementary EU funded R&D projects and address Risk Management  Emerging Challenge (NIS PPP WG1).  Relevance  The project addresses three case scenarios from different domains: a cloud infrastructure, a  telecommunication infrastructure and remote payment system with a focus on security  technologies, and the business models related to given domain.  EU added value  By integrating European expertise on socio-technical security into a widely applicable and  standardised framework, TREsPASS has the ambition to decrease the number of security  incidents in Europe and support organisations and their customers to take more conscious  decisions about security investments. In result, TREsPASS can contribute to the increased  resilience of European businesses and to social and economic benefits.  Impacts  The TREsPASS consortium partners include organisations from the entire value chain, both  from the academia/RTO domain, as well as from SMEs and large institution, thus the  consortium combines social and the technical expertise and integrates theoretical research  with the cyber security practice. Therefore, TREsPASS impacts research communities and  cyber security practitioners contributing to the development of cyber security and risk  management tools development and their maturity.  Trustworthy Digital Services  Network of Excellence on Engineering Secure Future Internet Software Services and Systems –  NESSoS  NESSoS aimed at constituting and integrating a long lasting research community on engineering of secure  software-based services and systems. The main assumption was to address security concerns from the  beginning of design, thus incorporating security principles in the engineering processes.  NESSOS ICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2014  Effectiveness  The NESSoS consortium has reached its objectives by performing community building  activities and by setting up the joint virtual research lab (JVRL) for collaborative working.  NESSoS project also integrated a number of security service-oriented tools into the NESSoS  workbench called SDE (Service Development Environment). Moreover, NESSoS has  developed an educational program for master degree related to security engineering for  Future Internet services.  Coherence  The NESSoS project was coherent with the NIS objectives, in particular with secure ICT  innovation principles. Moreover, NESSoS project was consistent with other EU projects  funded under the related topics, e.g. interoperability of the SPaCIoS Tool with the NESSoS  SDE platform was achieved. NESSoS researchers also actively contributed to the Network and  Information Security Platform (NIS).  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  27  NESSOS ICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2014  Relevance  The NESSoS project and the community established and acting after the project address the  need for support to networking and coordination of research aimed at improving trustworthy  of the current ICT.  EU added value  The main expected added value of NESSoS is improvement of competitiveness of EU industry  in trustworthy ICT market. NESSoS contributes to the development of trustworthy European  infrastructures and security of networked services and improved interoperability of these  services. NESSoS provides also a support for standardisation efforts in the area of secure  services development. Moreover, NESSoS network of excellence provides a necessary  support in coordination and integration of research activities in Europe.  Impacts  NESSoS aimed at re-addressing, integration, and fostering the research activities in the  secure/trustworthy ICT area, and had a goal to increase and spread the expert knowledge  among research communities. NESSoS and its after-project community collaborate and  impact industrial stakeholders with the goal of contributing to the industrial best practices  and supporting a growth of software-based service systems. Finally, NESSoS efforts  supported the European competitiveness in the Future Internet area.  Secure Provision and Consumption in the Internet of Services – SPaCIoS  SPaCIoS aimed to develop and combine currently used technologies for penetration testing, security testing,  model validation and related automated reasoning techniques, model inference, model extraction and  automatic learning and to integrate them into the SPaCIoS tool supporting secure design and development  of Internet services.  SPACIOS ICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2014  Effectiveness  The SPaCIoS project reached its objectives and  the consortium has particularly developed:   techniques for security testing that allow security properties (e.g. confidentiality  and authentication) to be testable,   vulnerability-based testing techniques that incorporate tests or test strategies  deriving from vulnerabilities (e.g. XSS),   techniques for model inference/extraction from the behaviour or code of the  implementation, including generation of test cases and related automated  reasoning techniques, security goals and a model of the attacker.  These techniques are implemented and integrated into the SPaCIoS Tool that is publicly  available for cyber security experts and analysts.  Coherence  The consortium performed integration activities for achieving interoperability of the SPaCIoS  Tool with the NESSoS SDE platform. Therefore the project was coherent and was  complementary to the EU research initiatives launched in parallel to SPaCIoS and also after  its finalization. Moreover, the scope of the SPaCIoS is in line with the Commission efforts  towards securing the Internet of Services and with Digital Agenda for Europe. The SPaCIoS  project was a follow-up of the AVANTSSAR (funded under ICT-2007.1.4 call).  Relevance  The project was relevant to the actual trends (i.e. growing Internet of Services) and addressed  the main security testing challenges related to IoS, contributing to the assurance of security  and trustworthiness in the entire lifecycle of services.  http://cordis.europa.eu/programme/rcn/14134_en.html  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  28  SPACIOS ICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2014  EU added value  The project was an added value to the security validation technologies and processes. Results  of the project contributed to the development of innovative tools for analysis and validation  of a service not only at the design stage, but also during the service consumption.  Moreover, the SPaCIoS shared its results and experience gained during the course of the  project within industry, research organisation as well as contributed to the number of  working groups and standardization organizations.  Impacts  The results of the project have a great potential for successful transferring into industrial  practices and processes (by involvement such industrial partners as SAP or Siemens). This  may strengthen efforts towards trustworthy services available over Internet. Lessons learned  and best practices collected and published during the project may impact standardisation in  security testing area and communities acting in this area. Other stakeholders that may be  impacted with the project results are service developers and producers that will be provided  with the novel security testing capabilities, and finally e-services consumers.  Policy and Security Configuration Management – PoSecCo  The PoSecCo project addressed the challenges related to ISPs/ IT service providers and complexity of their  systems. The project had a goal to support of resolving conflicts between interdependent high-level security  requirements, low-level security configurations and corresponding security policies.  POSECCO IICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2013  Effectiveness  PoSecCo developed a set of integrated tools to manage the security and policy requirements.  The proposed framework included the central model repository (the MoVE tool), system for  identification security and policy requirements (the CoSeRMaS system), tool for specification  of policies and resolving conflicts with security requirements (the IT Policy tool), and decision  support system for security (SDSS).  Coherence  The PoSecCo was coherent with the EC research initiatives dealing with the problem of  growing complexity of IT systems and compliance between security requirements at the  different levels. Enabling traceability and mapping between requirements and security  configuration of the system was also coherent with the NIS PPP WG1 group focused on risk  management.  Relevance  High (and still growing) complexity of the systems and evolving security and configuration  requirements, as well as continuously changing policies and law regulations are undoubtedly  one of the major obstacles that service providers must face to achieve demanded security  compliance. Additional difficulties arise with the growth of “shared IT systems”, i.e. with the  growing popularity of cloud-based services or infrastructures. In this light, cost-efficient  system for managing security policies and configurations (often resulting from the 3rd party  needs) is highly relevant to the actual needs, trends and challenges.  EU added value  The economic and organizational benefits of an improved policy-making and configuration  management for security purposes was studied by the consortium. Such initiatives can  contribute to the increased effectiveness of IT security configuration processes by  incorporating self-managed features and decision support systems. Also, more appropriate  and security requirements-aware policy modelling as well as conflict detection and resolving  in European IT services can contribute to greater competitiveness of the EU digital market.  Impacts The PoSecCo approach can impact on organizations that are facing conflicts between high- level requirements and low-level software system configuration. In general, the project  http://cordis.europa.eu/programme/rcn/14134_en.html http://cordis.europa.eu/programme/rcn/14134_en.html http://cordis.europa.eu/programme/rcn/14134_en.html  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  29  POSECCO IICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2013  approach achieved a demanded compliance of developed/provided services with existing  laws and regulations without reducing their security.  Moreover, the project adopted some existing industry-standards for change management  and for auditing.  Holistic Approaches for Integrity of ICT-Systems – HINT  The HINT project was focused on trust in hardware devices, including two techniques namely Physically  Unclonable Functions (PUFs) used for chip authentication, and side channel analysis-based Hardware Trojan  (HT) detection for verification of chip integrity and counterfeit detection.  The major objective was to implement a common security framework for verification of a system integrity  based on Trusted Computing technologies and to demonstrate the potential and capabilities of the  developed solutions in real-life applications.  HINT ICT-2011.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2012 - 2015  Effectiveness  HINT proposed a novel PUF technology for chip authentication. To increase effectiveness of  Hardware Trojan (HT) detection, the project studied and assessed several measurement  (such as power, EM, timing information) and detection alternatives. Each of them has been  implemented and demonstrated.  Coherence  HINT addressed several legislative actions taken by the European Commission with the goal  of hardware integrity and trustworthiness assurance. The project was also coherent and  complementary with other the EURO-MILS project funded under the same topic and dealing  with security of embedded systems.  Relevance  Nowadays ICT systems are combination of software and hardware components for which  security must be equally assured. Such systems work in many critical applications such as  avionics, Critical Infrastructures and their control systems, embedded systems in health and  transport or smart cards (ID cards, financial sector). The security of such systems, where the  authenticity and integrity of the hardware components can be the possible attack targets, is  continuously challenged. On the other hand, currently existing approaches based on PUFs  and HT detection schemes are not ready for the market adoption and wide use in the real  conditions due to lack of stability. Taking into account the above facts, growing trends of  counterfeiting of hardware ICT components and growing threat of “Trojans” in Integrated  Circuits (IC), the project objectives, scope and results were relevant to the current needs and  challenges.  EU added value  The HINT project aimed to contribute for increased ICT trustworthiness by providing holistic,  multi-level approach towards device integrity and authenticity. Since such technologies as  e.g. smart cards or ICT in medical sector are future/emerging applications, the  trustworthiness of these systems and protection of their hardware components can  contribute to increase of the societal acceptance of such solutions and to foster their future  market adoption.  Impacts  The project results had possible impact on overall security of integrated circuits, resulting in  higher security of end-user devices. HINT had a very wide potential impact, including the  homeland security market, the embedded security market, the smart card market and the  personal identity market as was identified by the HINT consortium. Moreover, the HINT  results had impact on standardisation bodies, as the HINT created the foundations for a new  ISO standard for the PUF technology.  http://cordis.europa.eu/programme/rcn/14134_en.html http://cordis.europa.eu/programme/rcn/14134_en.html  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  30  Cloud Computing Security  TRustworthy Embedded systems for Secure Cloud Computing Applications – TRESCCA  TRESCCA aimed to define the basis of a secure and trustable cloud platform by ensuring strong logical and  physical security on the edge devices, using both hardware security and virtualization techniques. It  proposed and demonstrated hardware/software solutions allowing stakeholders to delegate the  processing of their sensitive data to a remote processing engine, thus ultimately enabling a new breed of  cloud services and applications.  TRESCCA ICT-2011.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2012 - 2015  Effectiveness  TRESCCA developed mechanisms that enable end users and cloud operators to delegate the  processing of their sensitive data to the un-trusted other. Lack of these mechanisms limits the  potential of the cloud computing market, since cloud operators and end users may not have  established mutual trust relationships.  Coherence  The objectives of the project, particularly the ones related to creating a dependable chain of  trust, have substantial synergies potential with a number of actions related to effectively  addressing security issues and supporting trust and security research.  Relevance  TRESCCA objectives are considered relevant, since cloud computing is an inevitable trend, but  lack of trust limits the potential of the cloud computing market.  Through hardware security  modules and virtualization with live migration to isolate individual processes, the basis for a  secure and trusted cloud platform is created. Safety-critical applications can run in a secure  environment on the user side and non-safety-critical ones can be outsourced to the cloud  safely.  EU added value  The collaboration, dialog at a European level and participation in clusters of projects facilitated  the validation and merging of approaches and proposals for standardization that could be quite  different if the work had been carried out at a national level. Openness was also an important  characteristic as most of the project's outcomes have been made public and released under  free software licenses.  Impacts  TRESCCA project promoted the concept of secure and trustable cloud platforms by ensuring  strong logical and physical security on the edge devices, using both hardware security and  virtualization techniques, while considering the whole cloud architecture and key metrics,  namely: cost, performance, and acceptability.  Trustworthy Clouds – Privacy and Resilience for Internet-scale Critical Infrastructure – TCLOUDS  TClouds goal was to provide a computing and network platform to enable resilient and privacy-enabled  deployment of Internet-scale critical information and communication infrastructures. Projects’ aim was to  provide this while addressing the challenges of cross-border privacy, end-user usability and acceptance,  which are essential for wide deployment of such an infrastructure.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  31  TCLOUDS ICT-2011.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2013  Effectiveness  The project has achieved important results, and in particular: 1) A Trustworthy Infrastructure  Cloud enables individual providers to offer more resilient and privacy-aware infrastructure  clouds. 2) Privacy and Resilience for Commodity Clouds enables end users to put a security  layer on top of existing commodity infrastructure clouds to enforce their security objectives.  3) Federated Cloud-of-cloud Middleware offers privacy-protection and resilience beyond any  individual cloud.  Coherence  Clouds may evolve into a single point of failure, threaten all dependent ICT, and put the  Future Internet at risk. Thus, there are many synergies between the project and other  actions.  Relevance  Protecting critical infrastructures providing communications, energy, or healthcare is still  very relevant, since it presents increasing ICT challenges as ICT itself has become vital to  them. The project specifically targeted Internet-scale ICT infrastructures (the so called  \"infrastructure clouds\"). These infrastructures promise scalable virtualised computing,  network, and storage resources over the Internet. They provide scalability and cost-efficiency  but pose significant new privacy and resilience challenges.  EU added value  Establishing trust in cloud environments requires mechanisms for assessing the operational  trust on the cloud which includes assessing the trustworthiness of self-managed services and  is considered as a vital requirement for moving critical applications out of private cloud  environments.  Impacts  The project targeted application domains with high impacts on the society at large. One was  smart power grids, connecting renewable energy sources and users. This is a premier  example of an Internet of Things. The second was home healthcare, where prophylaxis was  provided to citizens. Collaboration with complementary standardisation and FP7 projects  resulted in increased impact and fostered a European trustworthy cloud ecosystem.  Privacy-Preserving Computation in the Cloud – PRACTICE  The PRACTICE project aims to build a secure cloud framework that allows for the realization of advanced  and practical cryptographic technologies providing sophisticated security and privacy guarantees for all  parties in cloud computing scenarios.  PRACTICE ICT-2013.1.5 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2013 - 2016  Effectiveness  PRACTICE goal is to create the conditions for users to have data confidentiality and integrity  guarantees without having to trust their cloud providers. The progress so far seems to  indicate that the project will achieve its objectives.  Coherence  The traditional computing paradigm is experiencing a fundamental shift: organizations no  longer completely control their own data, but instead hand it to external untrusted parties,  cloud service providers, for processing and storage. There currently exist no satisfactory  approach to protect data during computation from cloud providers and from other users of  the cloud. Thus, project objectives are very timely and coherent with other actions aiming at  improving cloud security.  Relevance  PRACTICE is among the first projects addressing the issue of mitigating insider threats and  data leakage for computations in the cloud while maintaining economies of scale. This goes  beyond current approaches that can only protect data at rest within storage clouds once  insiders may misbehave. Moreover, it will investigate economical and legal frameworks,  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  32  PRACTICE ICT-2013.1.5 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2013 - 2016  quantify the economic aspects and return on security investment, as well as evaluate legal  aspects regarding private data processing and outsourcing.  EU added value  Secure computation and secure computation services for the cloud have a potential of being  a  disruptive  technology  that  will  change  the  economics  of  technology  development  and  deployment.  The  ability  to  provide  cryptographic  and  more  general  secure  computation  services in the cloud  can  bring  forth  new  economic  and  technological opportunities  for  Europe,  and  new  efficiencies  from  which  multiple  sectors  of  industry  in Europe will  benefit.  Impacts  PRACTICE is strongly industry-driven and will demonstrate its results on two end-user  defined use cases in statistics and collaborative supply chain management. PRACTICE is  based on real-life use cases underpinning the business interest of the partners. The project  focus is on near-term and large-scale commercial exploitation of cutting-edge technology  where project results are quickly transferred into novel products. Since computation is  done on encrypted data, even insiders can no longer disclose secrets or disrupt the service.  This opens new markets, increases their market share, and may allow conquering foreign  markets where reach has been limited due to confidentiality and privacy concerns.  PRACTICE enables European customers to save money by globally outsourcing to the  cheapest providers while still maintaining guaranteed security and legal compliance.  Confidential and Compliant Clouds – Coco Cloud  Coco Cloud aims to empower cloud users to securely and privately share their data in the cloud. This is  expected to increase the trust of users in cloud services, and thus favour widespread adoption of cloud  technology, with substantial benefits for the users and for the digital economy in general.  COCO CLOUD ICT-2013.1.5 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2013 - 2016  Effectiveness  The project has achieved its overarching goal of enabling control of the disseminated  data based on mutually agreed data sharing agreements that are uniformly and end- to-end enforced. These agreements may reflect legal, contractual or user defined  preferences, which may be conflicting and thus an appropriate balance and model  for their enforcement must be found.  Coherence  The project goal is creating an efficient and flexible framework for secure data  management from the client to the cloud, and vice-versa. The research work is  internally coherent, since it develops along three main dimensions that are  technically sound: 1) facilitation of the writing, understanding, analysis,  management, enforcement and dissolution of data sharing agreements; 2)  appropriate selection of enforcing mechanisms, depending on the underlying  infrastructure and context; 3) legal compliance in the data sharing process.  Externally, the activity is coherent with major related initiatives in the field of  protection of personal information.  Relevance  The objectives of the project are relevant, since the outsourced nature of the cloud  (and the inherent loss of control that goes along with that) means that sensitive data  must be carefully controlled to ensure it is always protected. The most appropriate  form/level of protection depends on the peculiar characteristics of the application,  as well as on the situation, context, and environment. Coco Cloud solutions enable  data protection (including personal information) by means of flexible mechanisms.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  33  COCO CLOUD ICT-2013.1.5 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2013 - 2016  This is essential to citizens, governments and organizations across all sectors,  including healthcare and banking and it will be even more so in the future.  EU added value  By taking a \"compliance by design\" approach, the project places an early emphasis  on understanding and incorporating legal and regulatory requirements into the data  sharing agreements. Coco Cloud contributes to fulfil the pervasive need for data  protection in cloud services that arises from different stakeholders, including  business organizations and citizens, and overcoming the limitations of currently  available technology offerings. These are important achievements towards the  creation of a Digital Single Market and the requirements imposed by GDPR.  Impacts  Providing assurance on data protection and data usage control is a key prerequisite  for facilitating data sharing among individuals and organisations (or among  organisations) to create new ventures and novel means of leveraging the data value.  Thus, the outputs of the project can indeed favour the creation of a cloud  ecosystem, where data is securely shared.  Secure Provisioning of Cloud Services based on SLA management – SPECS  SPECS focuses on the development and implementation of an open-source framework that will offer  security-as-a-service relying on security parameters as specified in service level agreements  (SLAs). SPECS also provides techniques to systematically manage their lifecycle.  SPECS ICT-2013.1.5 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2013 - 2016  Effectiveness  SPECS’s solution offers intuitive user centric interfaces to negotiate, enforce,  monitor and real-time remediate to possible fluctuations in the Quality of Security  (QoSec) by suggesting and/or applying proper actions/countermeasures.  Coherence  SPECS is coherent with related actions such as participation in the Data Protection,  Security and Privacy (DPSP) cluster initiative, contribution in standardization activities,  definition of a Security Metric Catalogue and collaboration with relevant projects.  Relevance  Providing comprehensible and enforceable security assurance by Cloud Service  Providers (CSP) can be considered as a vital aspect of deploying trustworthy Cloud  ecosystems. SPECS’s proposed framework puts also emphasis on  small/medium/federated CSP’s and can be also integrated \"as-a-Service\" into existing  ecosystems.  EU added value  SPECS propose solutions for Continuous Security Monitoring, which implements SLA  monitoring solutions dedicated to continuously control the security offered by CSP  and to help ensuring the granted security service level objectives through agreed SLAs  and eventually provide comprehensible and enforceable security assurance.  Impacts  Providing comprehensible and enforceable security assurance by Cloud Service  Providers (CSP) is a critical factor to deploy trustworthy Cloud ecosystems and relates  directly to EU cybersecurity strategy and NIS objectives.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  34  3. Main achievements and Recommendations for the way ahead  Main Achievements  The overall aim of ICT research in the Seventh Framework Programme was to develop knowledge and  technologies for building an open, secure and trustworthy information society in Europe. As already  supported by ex post evaluation and impact assessment reports key innovative results have been  produced as immediate results while indirect benefits have also been acknowledged regarding provision of  a knowledge base to support key EU policy initiatives and alignment of research activities between  Member States.  Even given the limited subset of projects, reviewed within the scope of this report, notable achievements  and innovative approaches can be identified in the areas of trustworthy network and service  infrastructures, user-centric identity and privacy management and technologies, trusted computing,  cryptology and advanced biometrics. Particular note should also be made to the promotion of horizontal  aspects such as usability, standardization, societal acceptance, economic viability and legal compliance of  the research results. Many projects in ICT Security and Trust have been particularly successful in  shortening the gap from research to innovation and thus promoting the establishment of a vibrant market  in secure and trustworthy ICT in Europe.  However, such impact could not have been achieved without assembling key experts concentrating efforts  of Europe's leading researchers. The backing of several European universities and companies provided a  critical thrust behind each project that a national level research program might not be able to provide.  Only with European partners from different European countries have the projects been able to deliver  results that allow the European industry supplying security solutions to fully leverage the potential of the  advancements proposed.  Apart from the technical results and their innovation potentials, several FP7 projects also managed to  support EU’s efforts to achieve policy promotion and coherence.  The ICT Trust & Security Programme has  been thought to “implement the EU Cybersecurity Strategy and to address the technological and industrial  issues that derive from the Network and Information Security (NIS) policy of DG CONNECT,  including the  implementation of research and innovation agenda related to cybersecurity, privacy and trustworthy ICT”.  In addition to NIS, promotion and support of other emerging legislative initiatives at EU level, namely  eIDAS and GDPR has been also achieved.  Similar to the reports prepared under the Security and Trust Coordination and Enhanced Collaboration  (SecCord) project16, Figure 2 below, attempts to summarize the promotion and support offered by each  project to the three main legislative initiatives that have been identified above. It is however apparent that  still a large number of unresolved cybersecurity, privacy and trust issues (areas of the main legislative  initiatives that are not covered) necessitate further research across all ICT technology, components,  applications and services.  16 http://www.seccord.eu/  http://www.seccord.eu/  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  35  Figure 2: Overview of Projects contribution per main legislative initiatives  The way ahead  ICT is the backbone every modern society, thus the EU needs to become the single market of preference  for governments and industry where trusted core NIS technologies and services for industry and citizens  are concerned. The ENISA Threat Landscape 201517 provides an analysis of the state and the dynamics of  the cyber-threat environment. Among other findings it acknowledges that cyber-threats have undergone  significant evolution and just as in 2014, cyber-threat agents have had the tranquillity and resources to  implement a series of advancements in malicious practices. An overview and comparison of cyber-threat  landscapes for 2015 and 2014 is presented in Table 1 below.  17 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat- landscape/etl2015/etl2015/at_download/fullReport  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/etl2015/etl2015/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/etl2015/etl2015/at_download/fullReport  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  36  TOP THREATS 2014  ASSESSED  TRENDS 2013  TOP THREATS 2015  ASSESSED  TRENDS 2014  CHANGE IN  RANKING  1.

A lot of work  has already been done with industrial stakeholders within the NIS Platform. WG3 identified key challenges  and desired outcomes in terms of innovation-focused, basic and applied research in the fields of cyber  security, privacy, and trust and proposed ways to promote multidisciplinary research that foster  collaboration among researchers, industry, and policy makers through the Strategic Research Agenda  (SRA)18. According to the SRA, the main the main research priorities to be further investigated in the future  are summarized in the following key objectives:   Fostering assurance   Focussing on data   Enabling secure execution   Preserving privacy   Increasing trust   Managing cyber risks   Protecting ICT infrastructures   Achieving user-centricity  EU level public-private partnerships in research and innovation were first introduced in 7th research  Framework Programme (FP7), mainly through Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs) and they were  implemented through dedicated legal entities - Joint Undertakings. Public-private partnerships is  considered a powerful tool to deliver on innovation and growth in Europe, also supported by the  respective Communication19 from 2013. The new EU research framework programme – Horizon 2020 –  may be implemented through public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the case of research and innovation  activities of strategic importance to the Union’s competitiveness and industrial leadership, or to address  specific societal challenges. On 2015, the European Commission adopted the Digital Single Market (DSM)20  Strategy, which establishes a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) on cybersecurity in the area of technologies  and solutions for online network security in the course of 2016.  The contractual PPP (cPPP) objective is to allow the EU to retain a high degree of technological capacity in  securing its digital economy and ensuring access to products and services reflecting European values such  as privacy. The cPPP will focus on Research and Innovation but also go beyond and address measures that  can help impose connection to end users, improve the reporting of validation activities with users of  research results and promote participation of relevant EU Industry. As the technology progresses, new  areas emerge and have to be explored addressed and secured. Therefore, the governance model should be  flexible enough and well represented by all relevant public and private sector stakeholders to address this  evolvement.

Table 2: SRA expected benefits/contributions per research commonality15  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  40  4. Future Work Programme Recommendations  Promote market-oriented innovation and direct transferability of outcomes to products or services.  The need to establish online trust has been identified early upon by the European Commission with a  number of policy initiatives supporting this objective such as the NIS Directive, General Data Protection  Regulation, the eIDAS Regulation and the ePrivacy Directive.  However, with the progress in the field of  information and communication technologies, and especially due to the decrease in calculation and  storage costs, new challenges to privacy and data protection, and eventually online trust, have emerged.  Forthcoming H2020 and Cyber Security contractual Public-Private Partnership (cPPP) work programmes  are already oriented towards promoting synergies between different areas of research and innovation; yet  additional effort should be made to ensure more market-oriented innovation and direct transferability of  outcomes to products or services.  Introduce horizontal requirements for new information and transparency models and endorse the  adoption of by design and by default paradigms.  At the end user’s level, this concern has given rise to an increasing appearance of online tools, often open- source and/or freeware, affirming that they can offer certain privacy-preventive functionality for the  average user, secure communication, protection against tracking, safeguarding of personal data,  anonymous browsing, etc. However, in many cases the functionality of such tools can only be compared  against the initial commitments and not the actual development and operation of the tool.  Proper information and transparency is a key issue in any data processing, so as to allow individuals to  understand how their data are being processed and to make relevant informed choices. As indicated in  ENISA 2015 report22, transparency needs to expand beyond the original point of data collection and  individuals should be adequately informed about the logic and the criteria applied in the context of  analytics and automated decision-making processes. To this end, new information and transparency  models need to be developed and could comprise a horizontal requirement in forthcoming work  programme pillars Purely textual information or existing privacy policies do not seem to cope with the  evolution of services and to comprehensively inform users on the processing of data occurring in the  complex data value chain. Along with transparency (or as part of it), providing access to users on their data  is an important privacy condition as well as an obligation of data controllers.  Sustain close collaboration with all relevant stakeholders on research and innovation topics while  supporting key EU policy initiatives  Tools and models that put the data subject in charge of managing their data and promote transparency  and user control online seems a promising and emerging research field. The forthcoming revision23 of the  ePrivacy Directive is one of the key policy initiatives aimed at reinforcing trust and security in electronic  22 Privacy by Design in Big Data: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/big-data-protection  23 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/public-consultation-evaluation-and-review-eprivacy-directive  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/big-data-protection https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/public-consultation-evaluation-and-review-eprivacy-directive  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  41  communications in the EU with a focus on ensuring a high level of protection for citizens and a level  playing field for all market players. However, in order to bridge the gap between the legal framework and  the available technological implementation approaches, research and innovation activities that will bring  together all relevant stakeholders and will provide building blocks of various degrees of maturity should  also be promoted.

The development of a Digital Single Market is also the main objective of the Digital Agenda (currently  Digital Single Market strategy2), one pillar being strengthening online trust and security, on which the  growth of the European economy and the development of a strong digital business sector depend. The  Digital Agenda sees internet trust and security as vital to a vibrant digital society and considers a high level  of network and information security across the EU essential to ensure consumer confidence and to keep  the online economy running. Although there is state-of-the-art research in Europe in the field of NIS, and  this area is extensively supported by European funded programs, research is usually not focused on the  aspects where NIS policies need available technologies to move forward on their implementation.  The scope of this report is to review existing analysis reports on EU funded Trust and Security Projects,  summarize achievements that have significantly promoted specific pillars of NIS, identify and summarize  specific outcomes that can promote and support emerging policy and legislative initiatives, namely eIDAS,  GDPR, support industry policy in cybersecurity, and provide recommendations on the formulation of  forthcoming work programmes.  For the analysis of the selected projects, through their reports, six  assessment pillars were identified, based on the ICT & Trust and Security interrelated thematic areas and  emerging policy and legislative initiatives aspects. For each project, achievements that can significantly  promote/favour specific pillars of NIS, are identified along with specific outcomes that can favour and  support emerging policy and legislative initiatives - notably: eIDAS, GDPR, NIS and industry policy in  cybersecurity, including the cybersecurity cPPP.  Even given the limited subset of projects reviewed within the scope of this report, notable achievements  and innovative approaches are identified. Particular note should also be taken of the promotion of  horizontal aspects such as usability, standardization, societal acceptance, economic viability and legal  compliance of the research results. Furthermore, several projects have been particularly successful in  shortening the gap from research to innovation and thus promoting the establishment of a vibrant market  in secure and trustworthy ICT in Europe. The analysis however indicated that there is still a large number  of unresolved cybersecurity, privacy and trust issues (areas of the main legislative initiatives that are not  covered) which necessitate further research across all ICT technology, components, applications and  services.  The recommendations for the forthcoming research and innovation work programmes of H2020 and  cybersecurity cPPP can be summarized as follows:   Sustain close collaboration with all relevant stakeholders on research and innovation topics while  supporting key EU policy initiatives;   Promote market-oriented innovation and direct transferability of outcomes to products or  services;   Introduce horizontal requirements for new information and transparency models and endorse the  adoption of by design and by default paradigms.  1 http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  2 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/europe-2020-strategy  http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/europe-2020-strategy  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  06  1. Introduction  The Europe 2020 strategy3 for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth identifies research as a driver for  innovation, economic growth and sustainability. Through different framework programmes, EU funded  research projects promote and support state‑of‑the‑art research in Europe. The specialized field of  Network and Information Security (NIS) is extensively supported by European‑funded programmes, but is  not always focused on the aspects where emerging policy and legislative initiatives need available  technologies to move forward on their implementation. Within the scope of this report, the following  policy and legislative initiatives have been considered and are briefly presented below.  The EU Cybersecurity Strategy4 includes a number of measures aimed to promote a Single Market for  cybersecurity products together with fostering research and development investments and innovation.  The development of a Digital Single Market is also the main objective of the Commission's Digital Agenda,  one pillar being strengthening online trust and security, on which the growth of the European economy  and the development of a strong digital business sector depend. The Digital Agenda and the Digital Single  Market Strategy5, perceive trust and security in digital services vital for a vibrant digital society and  consider a high level of network and information security across the EU essential to ensure consumer  confidence and to keep the online economy running.  The Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive, adopted by the EU Council  on 17 May 20166, aims  to put in place the necessary mechanisms at national and EU level to improve security levels and respond  to cyber threats. The aim is to have a secure and trustworthy digital environment throughout the EU. This  should include improving Member States' national cybersecurity capabilities, improving Member States  cooperation and improving cooperation between public and private sectors.  The Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market (eIDAS Regulation)7 adopted on 23 July 2014 is a milestone to provide a stable regulatory  environment to enable secure and seamless electronic interactions between businesses, citizens and  public authorities. It lays down the foundations for people, companies (in particular SMEs) and public  administrations to access safely cross border electronic services and seamlesly perform electronic  transactions.  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which entered into force on 24 May 2016 and shall apply  from 25 May 2018.8, aims to achieve a comprehensive reform of data protection rules in the EU. The  objective of this new set of rules is to give citizens back control over of their personal data, and to simplify  the regulatory environment for business. The data protection reform is a key enabler of the Digital Single  Market.  3 http://ec.europa.eu/eu2020/pdf/COMPLET%20EN%20BARROSO%20%20%20007%20-%20Europe%202020%20- %20EN%20version.pdf  4 http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  5 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52015DC0192  6 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/commission-proposal-directive-concerning-measures-ensure-high- common-level-network-and  7 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN  8 http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  http://ec.europa.eu/eu2020/pdf/COMPLET%20EN%20BARROSO%20%20%20007%20-%20Europe%202020%20-%20EN%20version.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/eu2020/pdf/COMPLET%20EN%20BARROSO%20%20%20007%20-%20Europe%202020%20-%20EN%20version.pdf http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52015DC0192 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/commission-proposal-directive-concerning-measures-ensure-high-common-level-network-and http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/commission-proposal-directive-concerning-measures-ensure-high-common-level-network-and http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  07  Scope and Objectives  This work is undertaken under ENISA Work Programme 2016, as part of Work Package 1.3. -  Research &  Development, Innovation under the Strategic Objective 1 - To develop and maintain a high level of  expertise of EU actors taking into account evolutions in Network and Information Security (NIS). The  overall scope is to improve coordination and facilitate support in policy areas that rely on a technological  base. The objectives of this report are to:   Review findings from existing reports on the achievements of a subset of the ICT Trust & Security  research projects, funded under the 7th Framework Programme, that have exceeded expectations and  have been characterized as success stories;   Summarize achievements from the aforementioned projects that have significantly promoted specific  pillars of Network and Information Security (NIS);   Identify and summarize specific outcomes that can promote emerging policy and legislative initiatives,  such as the eIDAS Regulation and the General Data Protection Regulation, stimulate trust across  different stakeholders and support industry policy in cybersecurity, including the cybersecurity  contractual Public Private Partnership;   Provide recommendations on promoting research approaches that can move forward Network and  Information Security (NIS) at EU level;  It should be noted however that the overall aim of this report is not to supplement the role of reviewers of  the projects, nor the relevant review meetings and procedures. ENISA did not analyse the deliverables of  the projects but only information from publicly available reports.  Overview of Research, Innovation and Policy Support Programmes  The 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7) was the EU's main  instrument for funding research in Europe from 2007 to 2013. The total budget for this seven years period  was € 50.5 billion which marked the priority of Europe in research, innovation and technological  development. It consisted of 4 main blocks of activities forming 4 specific programmes, namely co- operation, ideas, people and capacities, plus a fifth specific programme on nuclear research. Information  and Communication Technologies (ICTs) research activities were part of the co-operation programme and  the total budget was € 9.1 billion.  As mentioned in the 2014 Digital Agenda Scoreboard9, ICT was the  largest research area in the FP7 Cooperation programme. The FP7 ICT worked on the approach of  implementing strategic roadmaps, but also kept an open part for emerging ideas. Under both approaches,  the EU has co-funded over the period 2007-2013 2,261 projects for a total Union funding of about €7.6  billion. In parallel the CIP ICT Policy Support Programme has allocated € 593.2 million of EU funding over  the period 2008 – 2013, distributed to 233 different projects. The ICT PSP (Policy Support Programme) was  one of specific programmes within the CIP (Competitiveness and Innovation framework Programme).  Projects that acted within this programme are funded to support the realization of the Digital agenda for  Europe. More specifically, the programme addressed issues and challenges related to effective exploitation  of innovative, IT products and services.  9 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/scoreboard-2014-overview-participation-fp7-and-cip- programmes-ict-domain  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/scoreboard-2014-overview-participation-fp7-and-cip-programmes-ict-domain https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/scoreboard-2014-overview-participation-fp7-and-cip-programmes-ict-domain  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  08  In absolute terms Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, France and Spain accounted for 60% of total EU  funding and 57% of participations. Cyprus, Greece, Slovenia, Austria and Belgium are the 5 Member States  with the highest amounts of funding compared to the size of their ICT sector. According to the latest  analysis of publications and patents of ICT research in FP710, funded projects were  particularly  effective  in  strengthening  scientific  excellence as well; they have generated  over  170,000  publications, have  led  to  more  than 1,700  patents  and  7,400  commercial  exploitations of products or services.  In the specific ICT research area of Trust and Security the overall focus was towards “developing  knowledge and technologies for building an open, secure and trustworthy information society in Europe,  where citizens and organisations can fully reap the benefits from the new technologies”.  Towards this  direction, a number of interrelated thematic areas11 were promoted and are briefly depicted below.  Figure 1: Main thematic areas of FP7 ICT Trust & Security8  A very high percentage of the EC funding in FP7 was received by organizations that have already  participated in FP6. This holds especially true for universities and research organizations, where a  comparably small number of organizations managed to build up the qualifications and capacities for  10 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=14504  11 http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/security/projects_en.html  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=14504 http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/security/projects_en.html  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  09  continuing to be key players in European‐funded research. FP7 can therefore be considered as having  balanced the need for openness and concentration central to global competition.  Evaluation Criteria  The evaluation criteria used to review findings and summarize achievements of EU Funded research  projects were inspired by the Better Regulation “Toolbox”12, and in particular Tool # 42: Identifying the  evaluation criteria and Questions. According to the Toolbox \"All evaluations must assess the evaluation  criteria of effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, relevance and EU added value” and “Evaluations ... should  also always assess the economic, social and environmental impacts ...\". Based on these indications, five (5)  evaluation criteria were defined and are briefly described in the following subsections.  Effectiveness  Effectiveness analysis considers how successful the project has been in achieving or progressing towards  its objectives. The evaluation aims at forming an opinion on the progress made. The analysis also tries to  identify if any unexpected or unintended effects have occurred.  Coherence  The evaluation of coherence involves looking at a how well or not different actions work together.  Checking \"internal\" coherence means looking at how the various internal components of the project  operate together to achieve its objectives. Similar checks can be conducted in relation to other (\"external\")  interventions at different levels, for example with respect to projects in related areas and EU interventions  within the same policy field or in areas which may have to work together.  Relevance  Relevance looks at the relationship between the needs and problems in society and the objectives of the  project. For example, incorrect assumptions may have been made about the cause and effect relationships  or circumstances may have changed and the current needs/problems may not be the same as the ones  looked at when the project was proposed.  EU added value  EU-added value looks for changes which it can reasonably be argued are due to EU scope, rather than any  other factors. Under the principle of subsidiarity (Article 5 Treaty on European Union), the EU should only  act when the objectives can be better achieved by Union action rather than by potentially varying action  by Member States.  Impacts  Evaluations should also always assess the economic, social and environmental impacts of EU-funded  projects, with – in this specific context - particular emphasis on those impacts that are relevant for the  creation of a Digital Single Market13.  12 http://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/guidelines/toc_tool_en.htm  13 http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market_en  http://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/guidelines/toc_tool_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market_en  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  10  2. Impact Assessment Pillars  Impact Assessment is also part of the Better Regulation “Toolbox” and provides support to the political  decision-making process. It pertains gathering and analysing evidence to support policy making, verifying,  identifying and assessing whether EU action is needed and analysing the advantages and disadvantages of  available solutions. Within the scope of this report six assessment pillars were identified, based on the ICT  & Trust and Security interrelated thematic areas and emerging policy and legislative initiatives aspects.  Namely these pillars are i) Cryptography, ii) Identity Management, iii) Privacy Enhancing Technologies, iv)  Threat Detection And Mitigation, v)Critical Infrastructure Protection and vi) Trustworthy Digital Services.  For each project, achievements that can significantly promote/favour specific pillars of NIS, are identified  along to specific outcomes that can favour and support emerging policy and legislative initiatives - notably:  eIDAS, GDPR, NIS and industry policy in cybersecurity, including the cybersecurity cPPP. The assessment of  each project is a result of an analysis from existing (and publicly available) reports. It is worth emphasizing  that the project list is by no means exhaustive, i.e. many other projects funded within the context of the  same calls, that have also exceeded expectations and could thus be characterized as success stories, have  not been included in this deliverable, due to lack of room and of time (as well as of – possibly – public  information).  Cryptography  European Network of Excellence in Cryptology (Phase II) – Ecrypt II  ECRYPT’s objective was to promote the collaboration of European researchers in information security, and  especially in cryptology and digital watermarking. ECRYPT listed five core research areas, termed \"virtual  laboratories\": symmetric key algorithms (STVL), public key algorithms (AZTEC), protocol (PROVILAB),  secure and efficient implementations (VAMPIRE) and watermarking (WAVILA). Its continuation, ECRYPT II,  was a Network of Excellence in the area of cryptology aiming towards durable integration of European  research in both academia and industry.  ECRYPT II  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2013  Effectiveness  The objectives of the project have been achieved through a wide range of dissemination,  communication and awareness activities including a training program, a substantial  contribution towards standardization bodies, and an active publication policy.  Coherence  The ECRYPT II research roadmap was motivated by the changing environment and threat  models in which cryptology is deployed, the gradual erosion of the computational difficulty  of the mathematical problems on which cryptology is based, and the requirements of new  applications and cryptographic implementations. The project was coherent with a number  of other interventions which had similar objectives.  Relevance  Research in Cryptology and digital watermarking is relevant, since these are fundamental  enablers for secure, dependable, and trusted ICT infrastructures.  EU added value  Ecrypt II engaged leading EU players to integrate their research capabilities within three  virtual labs focusing on i) symmetric key algorithms, ii) public key algorithms and protocols,  and iii) hardware and software implementation. Additionally, it had a critical mass and  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  11  ECRYPT II  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2013  breadth to address the key questions in these areas that could only be achieved at the  European level.  Impacts  Cryptology and digital watermarking are research areas with a high strategic impact for  European industry and for the society as a whole. The intense networking activity done in  Ecrypt II not only brought together industrial and public recourses but also helped stimulate  cybersecurity industry by aligning the demand for advanced cryptology.  Computer Aided Cryptography Engineering – CACE  CACE objective was to design, develop and deploy a toolbox that would support the specific domain of  cryptographic software engineering. The main motivation was that development of hardware devices and  software products is facilitated by a design flow, and a set of tools (e.g., compilers and debuggers), which  automate tasks normally performed by experienced, highly skilled developers. However, in both hardware  and software examples the tools are generic since they seldom provide specific support for a particular  domain.  CACE  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2010  Effectiveness  Project objectives were achieved as final validated solutions enable (relatively) non-expert  personnel to develop high-level cryptographic applications and business models by means  of cryptography-aware high-level programming languages and compilers.  Coherence  Cryptographic software is one of the key enabling technologies of a secure and trustworthy  ICT infrastructure in Europe. Cryptographic software engineering can be a viable solution  for the European software industry to cope with the ever increasing volume of requests for  high-quality cryptographic software. Internally, project objectives were coherent, in that  they were pursued via the development of an integrated set of tools. Externally, the  overarching objective of improving the productivity of the cryptographic software industry  in Europe was – and will be even more so in the years to come – entirely coherent with  other actions aiming at gearing up the European ICT industry for the future challenges  related to secure operation of ICT infrastructures.  Relevance  The final solutions allow automatic analysis and transformation of cryptographic software  to detect security critical implementation failures, e.g., software and hardware based side- channel attacks, when realizing low level cryptographic primitives and protocols. These  objectives are still relevant, since mission critical and modern applications processing  sensitive data are in need of sophisticated cryptographic techniques and cryptographic  software.  EU added value  The challenges that the project addressed affect the industry supplying cryptographic  applications in all European Member States in the same manner. The tackled research  challenges are not limited to regional or national boundaries. Thus, research in this area  would be inefficient at a national level: limiting the scope to the academic or industrial  research in a particular country would lead to a solution that is not sufficient to make the  results usable and efficient for the European-wide use.  Impacts  Development of better-quality and robust software at a much lower cost can provide a  clear economic advantage to the European industry in the short term and positions it better  in dealing with future roadblocks to ICT development in the longer term.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  12  Secure, Embedded Platform with advanced Process Isolation & Anonymity Capabilities – SEPIA  SEPIA focused on three topics: security enhancements of mobile platforms, cryptography and privacy  protecting technologies, delta-evaluation and certification methodologies. The project researched privacy  protecting mechanisms based on strong cryptography and time- and cost-efficient certification processes  reducing the time from design to market. Within the scope of the project, establishing trustworthiness was  seen as an asset that is to be considered right from the design phase rather than being addressed as an  add-on feature.  SEPIA ICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2013  Effectiveness  SEPIA through theoretical and practical research, as well as the development of proof-of- concept prototypes, managed to meet its objectives.  The final SEPIA reference platform was  disseminated via demonstrators and as an open platform for further research and product  development.  Coherence  Establishing trust is a multi-faceted problem, which requires assessments from independent  organisations. Internally, the project was coherent, since significant progress was made with  respect to objectives characterized by a common overarching goal. Externally, the SEPIA  endeavour is perfectly aligned to other interventions, aiming at establishing a trustworthy  ICT infrastructure in Europe.  Relevance  The SEPIA project addressed challenges that are – and will be even more so in the future –  central for the development of prominent digital markets, such as mobile devices and  applications and the Internet of Things. The project tackled issues of trustworthiness, security  and protection of mobile devices as key enablers for new businesses opportunities and the  integration of mobile platforms.  EU added value  The solutions that have been constructed during the project are an example where the SEPIA  concerted efforts of Europe's leading researchers can be used to validate the project's  results. By operating at the European level, the consortium has been able to participate in  clusters of projects aiming at related or complementary goals, in order to disseminate,  discuss and compare the results. The consortium was a mix of industrial and academic  partners that brought together expertise and excellence from various disciplines.  Impacts  SEPIA focused on topics that have a tremendous impact on the development of borderless  and secure Digital Single Market in Europe. Mobile and embedded devices are rapidly  evolving into powerful, ubiquitous personal assistants. As such, they will be involved in  security-critical operations like authentication, payment, e-Banking and e-Government  applications and transactions as regarded in the eIDAS regulation.  Trusted Revocable Biometric Identities – TURBINE  TURBINE proposed a multi-disciplinary privacy enhancing authentication technology combining innovative  developments in cryptography and fingerprint biometrics. Specific objectives of the project were to ensure  that the crypto-protection deployed on the biometric data was non-invertible and had the lowest possible  impact on biometric verification performance. Project results were assessed using very large fingerprint  data bases held by two project partners to compare performance with and without crypto-protection.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  13  TURBINE  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2011  Effectiveness  TURBINE provided reliable biometric 1:1 verifications, multi-vendor interoperability, and  system security, while addressing major issues related to privacy concerns associated to the  use of biometrics for ID management. Its primary objective of rendering this innovation  commercially viable was also achieved, by demonstrating that the technology is sufficiently  mature for deployment as a solution to large scale eID requirements.  Coherence  TURBINE addressed topics that were – and still are – coherent with other actions which have  similar objectives. In particular, it explored: i) data protection and privacy issues and ii)  requirements of key application sectors for eID management solutions. Expert groups were  included in the project to advise the consortium.  Relevance  TURBINE addressed privacy concerns regarding the use of fingerprint biometrics for ID  management. Through a comprehensive verification test and demonstration environment, it  evaluated how single fingerprint data of an individual may be used to generate several secure  identities with different levels of trust without weakening the overall security.  EU added value  The challenges that the project addressed affect the industry supplying cryptographic  applications in all European Member States. The breadth of technical expertise necessary to  undertake this project could not be assembled at the national level.  Impacts  TURBINE addressed research issues that have a tremendous potential in terms of market  opportunities as they can offer all the benefits of biometric security while mitigating or  eliminating the associated risks. Additionally, the European Data Protection Supervisor  (EDPS) issued a positive opinion14 on TURBINE's approach which provides evidence that data  protection concerns, as imposed by GDPR, related to the use of biometrics can be resolved.  Identity Management  Secure Identity Across Borders Linked – STORK  The aim of the STORK project was to establish a European eID Interoperability Platform to enable citizens  to establish new e-relations across borders, just by presenting their national eID.  STORK 2.0 followed up  on STORK and validated the STORK platform in additional pilots, promoting interoperability of different  approaches at national and EU level.  STORK  CIP-ICT-PSP-2007.1.2 - TOWARDS PAN-EUROPEAN  RECOGNITION OF ELECTRONIC IDS (EIDS)  2008 - 2011  Effectiveness  The STORK interoperable solution for electronic identity (eID) was based on a distributed  architecture that paved the way towards full integration of EU e-services while taking into  account specifications and infrastructures currently existing in EU Member States. The main  technology outcome of STORK was the creation of a pan-European federation of electronic  identities along to common rules and specifications to assist mutual recognition of eIDs.  Coherence The STORK project aimed to establish a European eID Interoperability Platform that allows  citizens to authenticate themselves using their own national credentials in order to access  14 https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/webdav/shared/Documents/Consultation/Opinions/2011/11-02- 01_FP7_EN.pdf  https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/webdav/shared/Documents/Consultation/Opinions/2011/11-02-01_FP7_EN.pdf https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/webdav/shared/Documents/Consultation/Opinions/2011/11-02-01_FP7_EN.pdf  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  14  STORK  CIP-ICT-PSP-2007.1.2 - TOWARDS PAN-EUROPEAN  RECOGNITION OF ELECTRONIC IDS (EIDS)  2008 - 2011  cross-border services provided by national service provider. The project’s main contributions  and achievements are coherent with other EU interventions and objectives.  Relevance  Interoperability across different countries has been, and is still a challenge as far as identity  is concerned, because of the many issues involved (security, privacy, compliance). STORK’s  user centric and cross-border approaches, and its results, are valuable for the development  of future projects.  EU added value  STORK’s goal was to ensure eID interoperability at European level including common  specifications, a common code for an architecture and a framework for sustainable  deployment across EU. STORK and STORK 2 paved the way towards the provision of a pan- European ID, since they has addressed main issues like enabling mutual recognition of eID  and trust services among Member States and tangible evidence on the applicability of the  eIDAS regulation.  Impacts  STORK and STORK 2.0 had a direct impact on the adoption of the eID services across Europe  through a federated and trustworthy framework for cross-border eID services and build the  basis for a future widespread use of eID solutions across borders.  Authentication and Authorisation for Entrusted Unions – AU2EU  AU2EU brought advanced privacy-enhancing attribute-based credentials towards the cloud to simplify  deployments, e.g., by reducing or avoiding the requirement to install user-side software. The aim of the  project was to implement and demonstrate in a real-life environment an integrated eAuthentication and  eAuthorisation framework to enable trusted collaborations and delivery of services across different  organisational/governmental jurisdictions.  AU2EU ICT-2013.1.5 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2013 - 2015  Effectiveness  AU2EU built on existing schemes and research results, mainly ABC4Trust, and efficiently  executed aligned activities defined in the Trust in Digital Life (TDL) strategic research agenda.  It developed tools allowing unifying authorisation policies, attributes and claims of different  security domains, and providing the advanced authorisation and platform working across  organisational borders.  Coherence  The project is coherent with basic EU interventions in the area of identity management,  increasing trust, security and privacy and aims at fostering the adoption of security  technologies at European level.  Relevance  The projects advanced the technology in the fields of eAuthentication and eAuthorization  providing a privacy-friendly authentication architecture and platform across organisational  borders. It has developed tools allowing unifying authorisation policies, attributes and claims  of different security domains, and providing the advanced authorisation platform working  across organisational borders.  EU added value  The project has successfully advanced four different domains: assurance of claims, trust  indicators, policy enforcement mechanisms and processing under encryption techniques to  address specific security and confidentiality requirements of large distributed  infrastructures.  Impacts Achievements of AU2EU will have a direct impact on the promotion and deployment of the  trust services as defined within the eIDAS regulation. Moreover, the eAuthentication and  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  15  AU2EU ICT-2013.1.5 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2013 - 2015  eAuthorization framework support concepts as (un)Traceability, (un)Linkability from relying  party to claims provider, (un)Linkability between relying parties and (non)Disclosure, which  are directly related to GDPR specifically in the areas of privacy by design, privacy enhancing  technologies and data subject rights.  Shaping the Future of Electronic Identity – FutureID  FutureID integrated existing eID technologies and trust infrastructures, emerging federated identity  management services and modern credential technologies to provide a user-centric system for the  trustworthy and accountable management of identity claims towards a privacy-aware and ubiquitous  identity management infrastructure for Europe.  FUTUREID ICT-2011.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2012 - 2015  Effectiveness  FutureID developed building blocks that can be used to provide interoperability between  different identity management standards and organize an open marketplace for identity  management where many service providers and identity providers can operate. End users  can benefit from ubiquitously usable open source eID client, while application and service  providers will be enabled to use trustworthy authentication services.  Coherence  FutureID bridged the gap between the various existing electronic identities and promoted  efforts towards the implementation of a trust infrastructure for authentication support and  promoted reliable, accountable and coherent with EU initiatives deployment of electronic  identity technologies.  Relevance  FutureID can by exploited by different providers and operators, supporting the flexible  development of new and possibly diverging business cases while the infrastructure is  expected to provide benefits to all stakeholders involved in the eID value chain.  EU added value  FutureID can support all stakeholders involved in the eID value chain. Users will benefit  from the availability of ubiquitously usable open source eID client application and service  providers will use trustworthy authentication services without the need of making large up- front investments in eID technologies or to meet legal obligations.  Impacts  FutureID offers the technical components that together form the infrastructure necessary for  online authentication and electronic signatures while considering the electronic  identification and trust services requirements in the vision of providing of the infrastructure  of eSignature services. Moreover, the architecture puts high emphasis on privacy protection  and integrates state of the art privacy-enhancing attribute-based credentials addressing also  GDPR requirements.  Trusted Architecture for Securely Shared Services - TAS3  TAS3 aimed at developing and implementing an architecture with trusted services to manage and process  distributed personal information. It contributed to the design of an architecture able to meet the  requirements of complex and highly versatile business processes and to enabling the dynamic user-centric  management of policies.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  16  TAS3  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES 2008 - 2011  Effectiveness  TAS3 focused on the development of a Trust Policy Management architecture, where issues  like trust and privacy, identity management, authentication and authorisation as well as legal  and privacy issues were efficiently handled. It efficiently validated and demonstrated the  applicability of the open, secure and trusted architecture that was developed for the  exchange of personal information in the domains of e-Employability and e-Health.  Coherence  TAS3 developed architecture supports dynamic user-centric management of policies, ensures  end-to-end secure transmission of personal information and user-controlled attributes  between heterogeneous, context dependent and continuously changing systems.  Relevance  Empowering individuals to be in control of their personal data and supporting their lifelong  re-use of personal data while preserving personal privacy and confidentiality in dynamic  environments are fundamental issues for the provision of electronic services.  EU added value  TAS3 promotes trust and confidence in electronic transactions, and indirectly addresses the  requirements of the electronic identification and trust services as described in the eIDAS  regulation. Moreover, the proposed notification mechanism can also be used by service  providers and organizations to easily implement requirements imposed by GDPR concerning  mainly on mechanisms for notification of citizens when breaches do occur. Moreover, the  techniques proposed in TAS3 are directly relevant for EU cyber preparedness.  Impacts  TAS3 participated in the development of European Trust Observatory (ETO), which aimed  towards the development of trust compliance policies and procedures for Service Providers.  Such “policy and procedure specifications\" need to be observable and auditable and these  will deliver the information to certify and build trustworthiness into the systems, services and  their providers, paving the way towards GDPR implementation.  Secure Widespread Identities for Federated Telecommunications - SWIFT  The SWIFT project leveraged identity technology as a key to integrate service and transport infrastructures  for the benefit of users and the providers. It focused on extending identity functions and federation to the  network while addressing usability and privacy concerns.  SWIFT  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2010  Effectiveness  SWIFT developed an identity framework that transforms identity as a key enabling  technology for convergence between networks, services, applications and content on the  technical side and between operators, service providers, micro-operators and even users as  providers on the business side. It has efficiently achieved its objectives to solve identity  fragmentation, by extending IdM systems for multiple services at different network layers  using the same ID and bridging platforms and layers.  Coherence  The SWIFT framework advanced traditional IdM solutions and provided an environment for  an advanced management of end users identities through identity aggregation from different  individual identities, anonymous services access and cross-layer authentication and  authorization.  Relevance  The SWIFT framework extended and progressed identity management solutions like identity  aggregation, anonymity, cross-layer SSO, advanced access control and mobility at network  level, and between devices. Regarding privacy, it supported prevention of unauthorized  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  17  SWIFT  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2010  parties linking different steps or actions due to identical identifiers, enforcement of privacy  rules at different providers, and assurance of the user's autonomy in disclosing attributes.  EU added value  The SWIFT project leveraged identity as a convergence layer between different players in  the communication and services space, and aimed to make identity a communication end  point through which service and network providers can discover the users and deliver their  services. It covered a number of privacy issues and user concerns and tackled the relative  regulatory issues of GDPR. Moreover, the SWIFT identity framework aimed to overcome the  Identity fragmentation in EU, provide cross-layer IdM taking into account both application  and network layers, support for multiple devices and provide independency from online  components. These aspects consist requirements of the electronic identification and trust  services architecture.  Impacts  SWIFT leveraged digital Identities to solve mainly identity fragmentation and extended IdM  systems for multiple services at different network layers. An effective IdM can have a  significant impact on networks and network services providing new service delivery options  and guaranteeing end users about the authenticity of the service provider.  Privacy Enhancing Technologies  Attribute-Based Credentials for Trust – ABC4Trust  ABC4Trust’s focus was to improve internet privacy by developing capabilities to introduce attribute-based  credentials into identity management systems, allowing users to only reveal the minimum information  required by the application, without giving away full identity information.  ABC4TRUST ICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2015  Effectiveness  ABC4Trust successfully addressed the federation and interchangeability of technologies that  support trustworthy yet privacy-preserving Attribute-based Credentials (ABCs). The  proposed architecture is able to decompose future (reference) implementations of Privacy- ABC technologies into sets of modules and specify the abstract functionality of these  components in such a way that they are independent from algorithms or cryptographic  components used underneath.  Coherence  ABC4Trust is applicable to the architectures of existing widely deployed identity protocols  and frameworks such as WS-*, SAML, OpenID, OAuth and X.509 and also alleviates some of  their security, privacy, and scalability issues.  Relevance  The project outcomes provide benefits in the concept of “partial identities” and the legal  principle of data minimisation as included in GDPR, allowing people to control release of their  data.  EU added value  ABC4Trust facilitates the implementation of a trustworthy and at the same time privacy- protecting digital society which provides an added value in GDPR implementation.  Privacy ABCs alone and together with other mature Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs)  have a high potential to influence the ongoing development in the domain of data protection  and privacy. This will influence the understanding and definition of what appropriate  technical and organisational measures are adequate to ensure data protection.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  18  ABC4TRUST ICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2015  Impacts  ABC4Trust promotes European privacy values in infrastructures and will empower individuals  and communities by increasing accountability, trustworthiness of information, allowing more  elaborate access control and user-centred Identity Management (IdM).  Privacy and identity management for community services - PICOS  The objective of PICOS was to develop and build a state-of-the-art platform for providing the trust, privacy,  and identity management aspects of social community services and applications on the Internet and in  mobile communication networks.  PICOS  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2011  Effectiveness  PICOS met its objective through the implementation of Sub-communities and Partial  Identities concepts that allows users to reveal only selected personal information as an  attribute and the Privacy Advisor tool to guide the users in aspects of their privacy and  identity management. The notion of Private Rooms was also introduced enabling users to  establish a personal area for managing their private information and content, enhancing  their privacy by enabling them to store and selectively publish their private information to a  certain set of other users.  Coherence  The resulting platform provided a state-of-the-art community, supporting identity  management system that can be used by the industrial members of PICOS creating benefits  and insights in the European IT and telecommunications industry beyond the scope of the  project. By involving all stakeholders on the community value chain, PICOS will strengthen  integrated European privacy and trust products and Europe’s competitive advantage for trust  in on-line applications and services.  Relevance  PICOS concepts and developments provide the basis for the enhancement of products and  services with regards to privacy and data protection, confirming also their key role during the  participation and engagement in online communities.  EU added value  PICOS through insights on citizens’ perception and understanding of  privacy, achieved  implementation of privacy-enhancing technologies for trustworthy, privacy-friendly  community transactions addressing several areas of the GDPR.  Impacts  The results of PICOS have an impact at different levels of community related services, by  integrating privacy enhancing concepts as part of a holistic approach to improve privacy and  trust in social communities.  Privacy and Identity Management in Europe for Life – PrimeLife  PrimeLife’s vision was to provide privacy, trust and ID management through tools such as browser plug-ins,  social networks and encryption. It was built upon and extended the FP6 Project PRIME, which dealt with  enabling citizens to exercise their legal rights to control personal information in online transactions.  PrimeLife aimed to resolve core privacy and trust issues involving protection of privacy for web-based  applications, making existing privacy enhancing technologies useable and foster the adoption of privacy  enhancing technologies by providing open source components and educational materials.

Project results further advanced state-of-the-art in the sphere of interface usability,  configurable policy languages, federation of web services, privacy-enhanced identity  management enablers, and privacy-enhancing cryptography.  PrimeLife has extended identity management towards transparency with a set of open  source tools such as the W3C Privacy Dashboard for tracking data collection while protecting  usage of personal data through encryption.  Coherence  PrimeLife contributed to the development of a new generation of web-based applications  and services, removing trust and security barriers and enabling end users to control personal  information in on-line transactions.  Relevance  The privacy-enhancing technique developed during the projects lifetime still corresponds to  the needs and problems within the EU and can be used for virtual communities (social  networks) and collaborative applications on the Internet.  EU added value  In the fields of transparency in general data processing and information exchange, project  tools can be re-used and extended, as the Privacy Dashboard, with the focus on emerging ICT  systems and life-log of personal data within social communities.  Impacts  By promoting aspects like user reputation, certification and granting users the ability to  control their privacy, Primelife contributed to addressing EU societal challenges and  obligations as imposed by GDPR.  Context-aware data-centric information sharing – CONSEQUENCE  Consequence focused on the engineering of an interoperable architecture for data sharing, facilitating  dynamic policy management enforcement and end-to-end data protection across multiple organizations  and techniques for organisation of neutral data sharing agreements.  CONSEQUENCE  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2011  Effectiveness  Consequence combined known technologies extending and combining them to achieve the  required goal and delivered new research results (e.g. DSA and EPL languages). The use of  the controlled natural language (CNL4DSA), the insertion of a help-on-line facility partly  mitigating usability issues and a world-wide patent depict project’s achieved objectives.  Coherence  Consequence defined a generic, scalable, context-aware, secure and resilient architecture  within a framework that enable dynamic management policies based on agreements that  ensure end-to-end secure protection of data-centric information, addressing the increasing  need for quick, dynamic and secure information sharing.  Relevance  The proposed framework took into account not only technological, but also economic and  social aspects of data exchange while promoting Data Sharing Agreements (DSA) for  managing shared data among multiple participants in several specific domains and contexts  and EPL languages.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  20  CONSEQUENCE  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2011  EU added value  Consequence advanced available technologies for quick, dynamic and secure information  sharing in multi-organisational environments with independent IT Infrastructures addressing  the emerging need for information sharing as expressed in all major EU policy interventions.  Impacts  The integrated capability of the developed solution for converting a high level specification  of security requirements into low-level enforceable policies can be exploited in several  different domains, through respective customization and integration.  Privacy-aware Secure Monitoring - PRISM  PRISM’s aim was to devise a privacy-preserving network monitoring system with enforcement of the  applicable data protection legal framework. It investigated the possibility to preserve the customers’  privacy, by avoiding disclosure of raw captured data even inside the controller domain itself, while  preserving the possibility of executing monitoring applications, including the possibility to detect and react  to attacks and trace back abuses and having as result to improve public security.  PRISM  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2010  Effectiveness  PRISM developed a privacy-preserving network monitoring system where carefully designed  data protection mechanisms can coexist with suitably adapted monitoring applications.  Moreover, it addressed the challenge of out-sourcing monitoring applications without  privacy concerns. A regulatory assessment was also performed based on the  EuroPriSeCriteria15 .  Coherence  PRISM is coherent with EU interventions in the area of privacy. The interest in monitoring  systems resides in their results and even if they do not introduce directly any privacy concern,  their need to access a data trace does. The middleware policies ensure that the processing  of data gathered through monitoring will be carried out in line with the set of rules and  limitations provided by respective data protection obligation and requirements.  Relevance  PRISM moved traffic analysis and data reduction to the edge of the measurement system  where possible, and replaced general techniques with specific analysis targeted toward  specific tasks. This approach allows aggressive data reduction and protection for scalability  as well as privacy protection.  EU added value  The approach undertaken managed to adapt to the regulatory requirements of functional  separation between the entities accessing the gathered data and the entities controlling and  managing access permissions while reducing the data that telecom operators needs to  process and store.  Impacts  PRISM can impact the way citizens perceive their network activities about being monitored  and increase their trust in communication infrastructures since network monitoring  applications are able to operate in a privacy-preserving manner and in accordance to the  underlying legal obligations and restrictions.  15 https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/Criteria  https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/Criteria  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  21  Threat Detection and Mitigation  Worldwide Observatory of Malicious Behaviors and Attack Threats – WOMBAT  WOMBAT aimed at the development of new means to address the current and future threats related to the  Internet and IT services. It focused on real-time gathering of security-related raw data, with particular  attention put on leveraging existing tools and exploring the development of tools dedicated to wireless  (WiFi, RFID, Bluetooth) networks, threat analysis and techniques to enrich the raw secure-related data.  WOMBAT  ICT-2007.1.4 - SECURE, DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTED  INFRASTRUCTURES  2008 - 2011  Effectiveness  The project reached its objectives, in particular as reported in the WOMBAT experimental  reports. Root Cause Analysis framework and prototype of early warning system developed  during the project have been successfully tested and applied to various WOMBAT datasets  to perform intelligence analyses. Moreover, the WOMBAT Consortium provided end-users  with the open-access to WOMBAT API (WAPI) - a set of API developed by the project partners  to allow integrated access to different attack datasets.  Coherence  Current EU and national initiatives prove that combating cybercrime is one of the major  priorities in the security field in general. In addition, problem of the usability and accessibility  of security-related information is still challenging. Therefore the goals, approach and outputs  of the WOMBAT project are still coherent with the scope of the current cyber security efforts.  WOMBAT scope and focus were also coherent with NIS Working Group 2 WG2 focused on  information exchange and incident coordination.  Relevance  The WOMBAT objectives were in line with expectations of potential end-users (i.e.: ISPs,  CERTS, antivirus companies, security researchers, security-conscious organizations and home  users) related to threat analysis. Objectives of the project were relevant to the end-user  needs, and current obstacles related to sharing the security data, trade-off between safety  and flexibility of access to the data, and also independency of the analyses of security threats.  Moreover, the project addressed also issues related to the insufficient level of confidence of  the European citizens related the cyber security and addressed the needs for raising security  awareness in Europe.  EU added value  Results of WOMBAT were a step towards obtaining more global and comprehensive view of  the security-related data, thus they can contribute to supporting cyber-security experts in  their decision making process for countermeasures selection. Also, the project results can  foster cyber security investments in EU organisations.  Impacts  The potential impact of WOMBAT activities can strengthen users (society, government,  business) trust in the use of networks, software and e-services. Moreover, the outputs of the  project have a potential to provide IT users with means to protect their digital identity and  personal data, which is consistent with the current European efforts leading to adoption of  the new GDPR regulation.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  22  Nippon-European Cyberdefense-Oriented Multilayer threat Analysis – NECOMA  NECOMA addressed aspects of data collection, aiming at expanding currently used data gathering  mechanisms and adapting them to threat data analysis purposes. Moreover, the project aimed to analyse  threat-related data including both the target and victim perspective, instead focusing only on attack  mechanisms and system vulnerabilities. NECOMA aimed also at developing cyber security metrics to assess  attack impact and novel cyber defence mechanisms that could be used with these metrics.  NECOMA  ICT-2013.10.1 - EU-JAPAN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  COOPERATION  2013 - 2016  Effectiveness  One of the main outputs of the project was the implementation of the threat analysis  platform with a set of unified interfaces for accessing heterogeneous security related  information that can be used both for real as well as for non-real time analyses. The  prototype of the platform allowed to monitor and analyse a number of security incidents and  attack patterns across different layers (end-point layer and infrastructure layer).  Coherence  Current EU and national initiatives prove that combating cybercrime is one of the major  priorities in the security field in general. In addition, problem of the usability and accessibility  of security-related information is still challenging, therefore the goals, approach and outputs  of the WOMBAT project are still coherent with the scope of the current cyber security efforts.  Moreover, NECOMA objectives and scope are coherent with other, previous EU initiatives  funded under FP7 ICT schemes, e.g. with the WOMBAT project.  Relevance  NECOMA contributed to the development of new approaches and instruments addressing  the fight against cyber-attacks. The proposed scenarios are in line with the currently  emerging threats, in particular combating botnets and malware, as well as cyber security of  mobile/micro devices are the topics addressed in European and US roadmaps related to  cyber security, e.g. “A Roadmap for cybersecurity research” and “The Red Book: A Roadmap  for Systems Security Research”.  Those threats and scope are also in line with recently  published cyber threats landscape by ENISA. Moreover, the comprehensiveness of the  proposed approach (including both victim and attacked infrastructure perspective analysis)  is relevant to the current needs and trends.  EU added value  As the project is funded within the EU-Japan collaboration scheme, NECOMA included project  partners both from EU and Japan fostering international cooperation in the field of cyber  security and promoting EU cybersecurity preparedness.  Impacts  The NECOMA consortium intensively collaborated with the industry aiming at adoption of  the project results and in order to augment the exploitation potential for consortium  members. Moreover, NECOMA industrial partners are actively involved in development and  providing DDoS mitigation solutions and are major European players in the area of cyber  security.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  23  Securing Websites through Malware Detection and Attack Prevention Technologies – SWEPT  The SWEPT project focus was put on protection of websites against cyber-attacks, malware and on  mitigation of web vulnerabilities. The main goal of the consortium was to develop a solution that will be  able to minimize impact of malicious attacks on websites, maximizing their security posture with the  assumption that website owners or administrators intervention is not necessary (or limited intervention is  needed) to secure the website.  SWEPT ICT CIP-PSP 2007-2013 2014 – 2017  Effectiveness  The proposed SWEPT security solution mixes two approaches, namely proactive security  (website attacks prevention) and reactive security (including detection and mitigation). At  the current stage of the project the consortium effectively progresses towards the defined  objectives. Two business-oriented pilots are planned for year 2016: Pilot for ISP, website  administrators and owners, and Pilot 2 for web designers and developers.  Coherence  The SWEPT initiative is coherent with other initiatives in this research area. SWEPT  consortium formally interacts with ACDC project (FP7) in order to maximize benefits coming  from future implementation of both projects’ outputs. Complementarities between SWEPT  and ACDC projects have been reported in an official deliverable and enable future integration  of projects results, namely SWEPT can use threat and vulnerability data from the ACDC  Central Clearing House (CCH) and analogically threats and vulnerabilities detected using the  SWEPT platform can feed the CCH.  Relevance  The project approach reflects the needs for securing websites and targets the majority of  actors from the Internet ecosystem, in particular website owner and administrators, web  hosting providers and ISPs. Nowadays, one of the main challenging issues is the lack of  resources in the majority of organisations to invest on websites security (both in terms of  funding and time/human resources). In this sense, SWEPT introduces an approach that will  be cost-effective, automated and easy to implement addressing this main challenge. Finally,  the SWEPT outputs can be integrated and can complement 3rd party security products of  web security companies.  EU added value  The successful implementation of the SWEPT platform will bring benefits to individual  website owners and administrators, and small/SME organizations with limited resources that  must balance between security of their websites and cost of security investments. This could  be achieved by the SWEPT approach promoting not only secure design of the websites  (Security-by-Design) but also by fostering the automation of response (automated detection  and threat mitigation) in case of malicious attack. The project outputs will contribute to  increasing the European consumers trust in websites and web applications, including  emerging markets of e-services.  Impacts  The expected impact reaches a variety of stakeholders from the whole Internet value chain,  impacting also common Internet users that can be ultimately affected by the malicious  website infection. Additionally, the SWEPT project has the ambition to define and develop  “de facto” standards and good practices in the context of websites protection and a model  of certification that will assess the security of given website in accordance to the SWEPT  security measures. Therefore, the project outputs will have potential to impact also  certification/auditing standards and standardisation bodies.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  24  Critical Infrastructure Protection  A European Network of Excellence in Managing Threats and Vulnerabilities in the Future  Internet: Europe for the World – SysSec  SysSec was a Network of Excellence project extending the FORWARD project and aimed at building strong  synergies with industry and policy makers by advancing the field of Systems Security. Three areas were  identified as the most important and crucial in securing ICT systems: malware, targeted attacks and social  engineering/phishing. The project also identified the major technologies which require more investment in  their security: social networks, on-line games, e-commerce, e-banking, sensors/drones, embedded systems,  smart environments, legacy systems, Critical Infrastructures, mobile/wireless networks, implantable devices  and cloud computing.  SYSSEC ICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2014  Effectiveness  The main output of the project was the Roadmap for Systems Security Research. Moreover,  SysSec consortium created and maintained a virtual centre of excellence with the goal to  consolidate system security researchers across EU.  Coherence  The project was coherent with the vision of Horizon H2020 programme, taking into account  industrial and societal perspective of cyber security challenges. The SysSec threat  identification and recommendations were also consistent with ENISA Threat Landscape  reports published during the SysSec project. SysSec efforts was highly coherent with the  activities of NIS PPP Working Groups dealing with risk management (WG1) by SysSec  educational activities, with security information exchange (WG2) by identification of Future  Internet vulnerabilities, and with secure ICT research and innovation through the SysSec  Roadmap contribution.  Relevance  The identified research outputs are relevant to the actual cyber security trends and the  Future Internet challenges, addressing such topics as privacy preservation, big data  challenges, security of smart cities and smart infrastructures (e.g. smart grids).  EU added value  SysSec established a strong community of experts in the field of systems security with an  ambition to play a noticeable role in the changing cyber security environment. Creation of a  synergy between research/academia and policy makers - both through the Red Book content  as well as by the SysSec community involvement –also adds value for the EU cyber security  and CIP initiatives. It should be noted that Red Book includes clearly articulated research  gaps, the main challenges and recommendations for future R&D actions that can be reflected  in the EU interventions.  Impacts  The main impact of the project can be expected on policy makers and research communities.  In particular identification of the Grand Challenge Research Problems in the area of Systems  Security is strong advice to the collaboration between RTO organisations and funding  agencies in order to improve cyber security of ICT.  Tool for systemic risk analysis and secure mediation of data exchanged across linked CI  information infrastructures – MICIE  The MICIE project was focused on the Critical Infrastructure (CI) protection domain and resilience of CI  against malicious activities and failures caused by natural phenomena. It developed and validated an alerting  system, able to identify threats related to given CI component in real time and to identify dependencies of  threaten CI with other critical facilities.  http://cordis.europa.eu/programme/rcn/14134_en.html http://cordis.europa.eu/programme/rcn/14134_en.html  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  25  MICIE  ICT-SEC-2007.1.7 - INFORMATION AND  COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES: CRITICAL  INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION  2008 - 2011  Effectiveness  The core of the alerting system prototype was the Prediction Tool – the central module of  the early warning system. Other expected results were also achieved, namely the off-line  design of CI models and the mediation gateways to collect CI-related security events with  ability to describe them using common meta-data model.  Coherence  Critical Infrastructures have to ensure the highest security levels to be able to fulfil their duty  in any circumstances. Modelling and analysing them and their interdependencies are  essential to discovering hidden vulnerabilities and threats.  Relevance  The MICIE project was consistent with end-user needs related to daily operation of Critical  Infrastructures and reflected in the Work Programme, namely better understanding and  management of complex and interdependent interactions between different CI components,  as well as systematic risk analysis and security configuration dedicated to CI. Risk analysis was  also the main focus of the NIS PPP WG1 working group.  The MICIE project objectives and results were consistent with and can contribute to the EU  proposal of Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CIWIN) that is a pillar of the  European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP).  EU added value  Based on the results of MICIE system validation, it can be concluded that MICIE solution have  a potential to increase the quality of services provided with European Critical Infrastructures.  Automated support for the operator that will be assisted in detecting failures, malicious  attempts of attacks and appropriated countermeasures can contribute to the cost-savings  and increased resilience of the EU CI networks. Contribution to the modelling of CIs and CI  dependencies can also be perceived as an added value due to still immature and inadequate  models currently in use.  Impacts  Implementation of results of the MICIE can impact CI owners and operators leveraging CI  resilience against disruptions. In result, this may have a positive impact of CI end-users  (societal impact). Moreover, contributing to CIWIN can impact CI expert communities.  Technology-supported Risk Estimation by Predictive Assessment of Socio-technical Security –  TREsPASS  The TREsPASS project’s main objectives are to develop tools supporting analysis and visualisation of  information about security risks, and to propose possible countermeasures for them. The developed tool  will identify various attack paths (their possibility and impact) and analyse which countermeasures are the  most effective. The project combines technical approach (analysis of assets and protocols vulnerabilities)  with social aspects.  TRESPASS ICT-2011.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2012 - 2016  Effectiveness  The expected outputs of the TREsPASS project will be included in the developed framework  allowing organisations to employ analytic, model-based methods in their risk management  processes. This framework will allow for the iterative development of socio-technical security  models and will also include tools for prediction of attacks and their prioritisation based on  attack properties extracted from these models. Finally, the project will deliver a preventive  tool able to calculate the effects of an attack and the most appropriate countermeasures and  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  26  TRESPASS ICT-2011.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2012 - 2016  mitigation strategies taken into account the cost-effectiveness of those countermeasures. Up  to date (close to the end of the project) it seems that objectives will be effectively achieved.  Coherence  Since the project aims at identification and protection against security threats related to  information and at improvements of existing risk management methods, it is coherent with  a number of complementary EU funded R&D projects and address Risk Management  Emerging Challenge (NIS PPP WG1).  Relevance  The project addresses three case scenarios from different domains: a cloud infrastructure, a  telecommunication infrastructure and remote payment system with a focus on security  technologies, and the business models related to given domain.  EU added value  By integrating European expertise on socio-technical security into a widely applicable and  standardised framework, TREsPASS has the ambition to decrease the number of security  incidents in Europe and support organisations and their customers to take more conscious  decisions about security investments. In result, TREsPASS can contribute to the increased  resilience of European businesses and to social and economic benefits.  Impacts  The TREsPASS consortium partners include organisations from the entire value chain, both  from the academia/RTO domain, as well as from SMEs and large institution, thus the  consortium combines social and the technical expertise and integrates theoretical research  with the cyber security practice. Therefore, TREsPASS impacts research communities and  cyber security practitioners contributing to the development of cyber security and risk  management tools development and their maturity.  Trustworthy Digital Services  Network of Excellence on Engineering Secure Future Internet Software Services and Systems –  NESSoS  NESSoS aimed at constituting and integrating a long lasting research community on engineering of secure  software-based services and systems. The main assumption was to address security concerns from the  beginning of design, thus incorporating security principles in the engineering processes.  NESSOS ICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2014  Effectiveness  The NESSoS consortium has reached its objectives by performing community building  activities and by setting up the joint virtual research lab (JVRL) for collaborative working.  NESSoS project also integrated a number of security service-oriented tools into the NESSoS  workbench called SDE (Service Development Environment). Moreover, NESSoS has  developed an educational program for master degree related to security engineering for  Future Internet services.  Coherence  The NESSoS project was coherent with the NIS objectives, in particular with secure ICT  innovation principles. Moreover, NESSoS project was consistent with other EU projects  funded under the related topics, e.g. interoperability of the SPaCIoS Tool with the NESSoS  SDE platform was achieved. NESSoS researchers also actively contributed to the Network and  Information Security Platform (NIS).  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  27  NESSOS ICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2014  Relevance  The NESSoS project and the community established and acting after the project address the  need for support to networking and coordination of research aimed at improving trustworthy  of the current ICT.  EU added value  The main expected added value of NESSoS is improvement of competitiveness of EU industry  in trustworthy ICT market. NESSoS contributes to the development of trustworthy European  infrastructures and security of networked services and improved interoperability of these  services. NESSoS provides also a support for standardisation efforts in the area of secure  services development. Moreover, NESSoS network of excellence provides a necessary  support in coordination and integration of research activities in Europe.  Impacts  NESSoS aimed at re-addressing, integration, and fostering the research activities in the  secure/trustworthy ICT area, and had a goal to increase and spread the expert knowledge  among research communities. NESSoS and its after-project community collaborate and  impact industrial stakeholders with the goal of contributing to the industrial best practices  and supporting a growth of software-based service systems. Finally, NESSoS efforts  supported the European competitiveness in the Future Internet area.  Secure Provision and Consumption in the Internet of Services – SPaCIoS  SPaCIoS aimed to develop and combine currently used technologies for penetration testing, security testing,  model validation and related automated reasoning techniques, model inference, model extraction and  automatic learning and to integrate them into the SPaCIoS tool supporting secure design and development  of Internet services.  SPACIOS ICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2014  Effectiveness  The SPaCIoS project reached its objectives and  the consortium has particularly developed:   techniques for security testing that allow security properties (e.g. confidentiality  and authentication) to be testable,   vulnerability-based testing techniques that incorporate tests or test strategies  deriving from vulnerabilities (e.g. XSS),   techniques for model inference/extraction from the behaviour or code of the  implementation, including generation of test cases and related automated  reasoning techniques, security goals and a model of the attacker.  These techniques are implemented and integrated into the SPaCIoS Tool that is publicly  available for cyber security experts and analysts.  Coherence  The consortium performed integration activities for achieving interoperability of the SPaCIoS  Tool with the NESSoS SDE platform. Therefore the project was coherent and was  complementary to the EU research initiatives launched in parallel to SPaCIoS and also after  its finalization. Moreover, the scope of the SPaCIoS is in line with the Commission efforts  towards securing the Internet of Services and with Digital Agenda for Europe. The SPaCIoS  project was a follow-up of the AVANTSSAR (funded under ICT-2007.1.4 call).  Relevance  The project was relevant to the actual trends (i.e. growing Internet of Services) and addressed  the main security testing challenges related to IoS, contributing to the assurance of security  and trustworthiness in the entire lifecycle of services.  http://cordis.europa.eu/programme/rcn/14134_en.html  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  28  SPACIOS ICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2014  EU added value  The project was an added value to the security validation technologies and processes. Results  of the project contributed to the development of innovative tools for analysis and validation  of a service not only at the design stage, but also during the service consumption.  Moreover, the SPaCIoS shared its results and experience gained during the course of the  project within industry, research organisation as well as contributed to the number of  working groups and standardization organizations.  Impacts  The results of the project have a great potential for successful transferring into industrial  practices and processes (by involvement such industrial partners as SAP or Siemens). This  may strengthen efforts towards trustworthy services available over Internet. Lessons learned  and best practices collected and published during the project may impact standardisation in  security testing area and communities acting in this area. Other stakeholders that may be  impacted with the project results are service developers and producers that will be provided  with the novel security testing capabilities, and finally e-services consumers.  Policy and Security Configuration Management – PoSecCo  The PoSecCo project addressed the challenges related to ISPs/ IT service providers and complexity of their  systems. The project had a goal to support of resolving conflicts between interdependent high-level security  requirements, low-level security configurations and corresponding security policies.  POSECCO IICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2013  Effectiveness  PoSecCo developed a set of integrated tools to manage the security and policy requirements.  The proposed framework included the central model repository (the MoVE tool), system for  identification security and policy requirements (the CoSeRMaS system), tool for specification  of policies and resolving conflicts with security requirements (the IT Policy tool), and decision  support system for security (SDSS).  Coherence  The PoSecCo was coherent with the EC research initiatives dealing with the problem of  growing complexity of IT systems and compliance between security requirements at the  different levels. Enabling traceability and mapping between requirements and security  configuration of the system was also coherent with the NIS PPP WG1 group focused on risk  management.  Relevance  High (and still growing) complexity of the systems and evolving security and configuration  requirements, as well as continuously changing policies and law regulations are undoubtedly  one of the major obstacles that service providers must face to achieve demanded security  compliance. Additional difficulties arise with the growth of “shared IT systems”, i.e. with the  growing popularity of cloud-based services or infrastructures. In this light, cost-efficient  system for managing security policies and configurations (often resulting from the 3rd party  needs) is highly relevant to the actual needs, trends and challenges.  EU added value  The economic and organizational benefits of an improved policy-making and configuration  management for security purposes was studied by the consortium. Such initiatives can  contribute to the increased effectiveness of IT security configuration processes by  incorporating self-managed features and decision support systems. Also, more appropriate  and security requirements-aware policy modelling as well as conflict detection and resolving  in European IT services can contribute to greater competitiveness of the EU digital market.  Impacts The PoSecCo approach can impact on organizations that are facing conflicts between high- level requirements and low-level software system configuration. In general, the project  http://cordis.europa.eu/programme/rcn/14134_en.html http://cordis.europa.eu/programme/rcn/14134_en.html http://cordis.europa.eu/programme/rcn/14134_en.html  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  29  POSECCO IICT-2009.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2013  approach achieved a demanded compliance of developed/provided services with existing  laws and regulations without reducing their security.  Moreover, the project adopted some existing industry-standards for change management  and for auditing.  Holistic Approaches for Integrity of ICT-Systems – HINT  The HINT project was focused on trust in hardware devices, including two techniques namely Physically  Unclonable Functions (PUFs) used for chip authentication, and side channel analysis-based Hardware Trojan  (HT) detection for verification of chip integrity and counterfeit detection.  The major objective was to implement a common security framework for verification of a system integrity  based on Trusted Computing technologies and to demonstrate the potential and capabilities of the  developed solutions in real-life applications.  HINT ICT-2011.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2012 - 2015  Effectiveness  HINT proposed a novel PUF technology for chip authentication. To increase effectiveness of  Hardware Trojan (HT) detection, the project studied and assessed several measurement  (such as power, EM, timing information) and detection alternatives. Each of them has been  implemented and demonstrated.  Coherence  HINT addressed several legislative actions taken by the European Commission with the goal  of hardware integrity and trustworthiness assurance. The project was also coherent and  complementary with other the EURO-MILS project funded under the same topic and dealing  with security of embedded systems.  Relevance  Nowadays ICT systems are combination of software and hardware components for which  security must be equally assured. Such systems work in many critical applications such as  avionics, Critical Infrastructures and their control systems, embedded systems in health and  transport or smart cards (ID cards, financial sector). The security of such systems, where the  authenticity and integrity of the hardware components can be the possible attack targets, is  continuously challenged. On the other hand, currently existing approaches based on PUFs  and HT detection schemes are not ready for the market adoption and wide use in the real  conditions due to lack of stability. Taking into account the above facts, growing trends of  counterfeiting of hardware ICT components and growing threat of “Trojans” in Integrated  Circuits (IC), the project objectives, scope and results were relevant to the current needs and  challenges.  EU added value  The HINT project aimed to contribute for increased ICT trustworthiness by providing holistic,  multi-level approach towards device integrity and authenticity. Since such technologies as  e.g. smart cards or ICT in medical sector are future/emerging applications, the  trustworthiness of these systems and protection of their hardware components can  contribute to increase of the societal acceptance of such solutions and to foster their future  market adoption.  Impacts  The project results had possible impact on overall security of integrated circuits, resulting in  higher security of end-user devices. HINT had a very wide potential impact, including the  homeland security market, the embedded security market, the smart card market and the  personal identity market as was identified by the HINT consortium. Moreover, the HINT  results had impact on standardisation bodies, as the HINT created the foundations for a new  ISO standard for the PUF technology.  http://cordis.europa.eu/programme/rcn/14134_en.html http://cordis.europa.eu/programme/rcn/14134_en.html  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  30  Cloud Computing Security  TRustworthy Embedded systems for Secure Cloud Computing Applications – TRESCCA  TRESCCA aimed to define the basis of a secure and trustable cloud platform by ensuring strong logical and  physical security on the edge devices, using both hardware security and virtualization techniques. It  proposed and demonstrated hardware/software solutions allowing stakeholders to delegate the  processing of their sensitive data to a remote processing engine, thus ultimately enabling a new breed of  cloud services and applications.  TRESCCA ICT-2011.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2012 - 2015  Effectiveness  TRESCCA developed mechanisms that enable end users and cloud operators to delegate the  processing of their sensitive data to the un-trusted other. Lack of these mechanisms limits the  potential of the cloud computing market, since cloud operators and end users may not have  established mutual trust relationships.  Coherence  The objectives of the project, particularly the ones related to creating a dependable chain of  trust, have substantial synergies potential with a number of actions related to effectively  addressing security issues and supporting trust and security research.  Relevance  TRESCCA objectives are considered relevant, since cloud computing is an inevitable trend, but  lack of trust limits the potential of the cloud computing market.  Through hardware security  modules and virtualization with live migration to isolate individual processes, the basis for a  secure and trusted cloud platform is created. Safety-critical applications can run in a secure  environment on the user side and non-safety-critical ones can be outsourced to the cloud  safely.  EU added value  The collaboration, dialog at a European level and participation in clusters of projects facilitated  the validation and merging of approaches and proposals for standardization that could be quite  different if the work had been carried out at a national level. Openness was also an important  characteristic as most of the project's outcomes have been made public and released under  free software licenses.  Impacts  TRESCCA project promoted the concept of secure and trustable cloud platforms by ensuring  strong logical and physical security on the edge devices, using both hardware security and  virtualization techniques, while considering the whole cloud architecture and key metrics,  namely: cost, performance, and acceptability.  Trustworthy Clouds – Privacy and Resilience for Internet-scale Critical Infrastructure – TCLOUDS  TClouds goal was to provide a computing and network platform to enable resilient and privacy-enabled  deployment of Internet-scale critical information and communication infrastructures. Projects’ aim was to  provide this while addressing the challenges of cross-border privacy, end-user usability and acceptance,  which are essential for wide deployment of such an infrastructure.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  31  TCLOUDS ICT-2011.1.4 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2010 - 2013  Effectiveness  The project has achieved important results, and in particular: 1) A Trustworthy Infrastructure  Cloud enables individual providers to offer more resilient and privacy-aware infrastructure  clouds. 2) Privacy and Resilience for Commodity Clouds enables end users to put a security  layer on top of existing commodity infrastructure clouds to enforce their security objectives.  3) Federated Cloud-of-cloud Middleware offers privacy-protection and resilience beyond any  individual cloud.  Coherence  Clouds may evolve into a single point of failure, threaten all dependent ICT, and put the  Future Internet at risk. Thus, there are many synergies between the project and other  actions.  Relevance  Protecting critical infrastructures providing communications, energy, or healthcare is still  very relevant, since it presents increasing ICT challenges as ICT itself has become vital to  them. The project specifically targeted Internet-scale ICT infrastructures (the so called  \"infrastructure clouds\"). These infrastructures promise scalable virtualised computing,  network, and storage resources over the Internet. They provide scalability and cost-efficiency  but pose significant new privacy and resilience challenges.  EU added value  Establishing trust in cloud environments requires mechanisms for assessing the operational  trust on the cloud which includes assessing the trustworthiness of self-managed services and  is considered as a vital requirement for moving critical applications out of private cloud  environments.  Impacts  The project targeted application domains with high impacts on the society at large. One was  smart power grids, connecting renewable energy sources and users. This is a premier  example of an Internet of Things. The second was home healthcare, where prophylaxis was  provided to citizens. Collaboration with complementary standardisation and FP7 projects  resulted in increased impact and fostered a European trustworthy cloud ecosystem.  Privacy-Preserving Computation in the Cloud – PRACTICE  The PRACTICE project aims to build a secure cloud framework that allows for the realization of advanced  and practical cryptographic technologies providing sophisticated security and privacy guarantees for all  parties in cloud computing scenarios.  PRACTICE ICT-2013.1.5 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2013 - 2016  Effectiveness  PRACTICE goal is to create the conditions for users to have data confidentiality and integrity  guarantees without having to trust their cloud providers. The progress so far seems to  indicate that the project will achieve its objectives.  Coherence  The traditional computing paradigm is experiencing a fundamental shift: organizations no  longer completely control their own data, but instead hand it to external untrusted parties,  cloud service providers, for processing and storage. There currently exist no satisfactory  approach to protect data during computation from cloud providers and from other users of  the cloud. Thus, project objectives are very timely and coherent with other actions aiming at  improving cloud security.  Relevance  PRACTICE is among the first projects addressing the issue of mitigating insider threats and  data leakage for computations in the cloud while maintaining economies of scale. This goes  beyond current approaches that can only protect data at rest within storage clouds once  insiders may misbehave. Moreover, it will investigate economical and legal frameworks,  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  32  PRACTICE ICT-2013.1.5 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2013 - 2016  quantify the economic aspects and return on security investment, as well as evaluate legal  aspects regarding private data processing and outsourcing.  EU added value  Secure computation and secure computation services for the cloud have a potential of being  a  disruptive  technology  that  will  change  the  economics  of  technology  development  and  deployment.  The  ability  to  provide  cryptographic  and  more  general  secure  computation  services in the cloud  can  bring  forth  new  economic  and  technological opportunities  for  Europe,  and  new  efficiencies  from  which  multiple  sectors  of  industry  in Europe will  benefit.  Impacts  PRACTICE is strongly industry-driven and will demonstrate its results on two end-user  defined use cases in statistics and collaborative supply chain management. PRACTICE is  based on real-life use cases underpinning the business interest of the partners. The project  focus is on near-term and large-scale commercial exploitation of cutting-edge technology  where project results are quickly transferred into novel products. Since computation is  done on encrypted data, even insiders can no longer disclose secrets or disrupt the service.  This opens new markets, increases their market share, and may allow conquering foreign  markets where reach has been limited due to confidentiality and privacy concerns.  PRACTICE enables European customers to save money by globally outsourcing to the  cheapest providers while still maintaining guaranteed security and legal compliance.  Confidential and Compliant Clouds – Coco Cloud  Coco Cloud aims to empower cloud users to securely and privately share their data in the cloud. This is  expected to increase the trust of users in cloud services, and thus favour widespread adoption of cloud  technology, with substantial benefits for the users and for the digital economy in general.  COCO CLOUD ICT-2013.1.5 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2013 - 2016  Effectiveness  The project has achieved its overarching goal of enabling control of the disseminated  data based on mutually agreed data sharing agreements that are uniformly and end- to-end enforced. These agreements may reflect legal, contractual or user defined  preferences, which may be conflicting and thus an appropriate balance and model  for their enforcement must be found.  Coherence  The project goal is creating an efficient and flexible framework for secure data  management from the client to the cloud, and vice-versa. The research work is  internally coherent, since it develops along three main dimensions that are  technically sound: 1) facilitation of the writing, understanding, analysis,  management, enforcement and dissolution of data sharing agreements; 2)  appropriate selection of enforcing mechanisms, depending on the underlying  infrastructure and context; 3) legal compliance in the data sharing process.  Externally, the activity is coherent with major related initiatives in the field of  protection of personal information.  Relevance  The objectives of the project are relevant, since the outsourced nature of the cloud  (and the inherent loss of control that goes along with that) means that sensitive data  must be carefully controlled to ensure it is always protected. The most appropriate  form/level of protection depends on the peculiar characteristics of the application,  as well as on the situation, context, and environment. Coco Cloud solutions enable  data protection (including personal information) by means of flexible mechanisms.  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  33  COCO CLOUD ICT-2013.1.5 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2013 - 2016  This is essential to citizens, governments and organizations across all sectors,  including healthcare and banking and it will be even more so in the future.  EU added value  By taking a \"compliance by design\" approach, the project places an early emphasis  on understanding and incorporating legal and regulatory requirements into the data  sharing agreements. Coco Cloud contributes to fulfil the pervasive need for data  protection in cloud services that arises from different stakeholders, including  business organizations and citizens, and overcoming the limitations of currently  available technology offerings. These are important achievements towards the  creation of a Digital Single Market and the requirements imposed by GDPR.  Impacts  Providing assurance on data protection and data usage control is a key prerequisite  for facilitating data sharing among individuals and organisations (or among  organisations) to create new ventures and novel means of leveraging the data value.  Thus, the outputs of the project can indeed favour the creation of a cloud  ecosystem, where data is securely shared.  Secure Provisioning of Cloud Services based on SLA management – SPECS  SPECS focuses on the development and implementation of an open-source framework that will offer  security-as-a-service relying on security parameters as specified in service level agreements  (SLAs). SPECS also provides techniques to systematically manage their lifecycle.  SPECS ICT-2013.1.5 - TRUSTWORTHY ICT 2013 - 2016  Effectiveness  SPECS’s solution offers intuitive user centric interfaces to negotiate, enforce,  monitor and real-time remediate to possible fluctuations in the Quality of Security  (QoSec) by suggesting and/or applying proper actions/countermeasures.  Coherence  SPECS is coherent with related actions such as participation in the Data Protection,  Security and Privacy (DPSP) cluster initiative, contribution in standardization activities,  definition of a Security Metric Catalogue and collaboration with relevant projects.  Relevance  Providing comprehensible and enforceable security assurance by Cloud Service  Providers (CSP) can be considered as a vital aspect of deploying trustworthy Cloud  ecosystems. SPECS’s proposed framework puts also emphasis on  small/medium/federated CSP’s and can be also integrated \"as-a-Service\" into existing  ecosystems.  EU added value  SPECS propose solutions for Continuous Security Monitoring, which implements SLA  monitoring solutions dedicated to continuously control the security offered by CSP  and to help ensuring the granted security service level objectives through agreed SLAs  and eventually provide comprehensible and enforceable security assurance.  Impacts  Providing comprehensible and enforceable security assurance by Cloud Service  Providers (CSP) is a critical factor to deploy trustworthy Cloud ecosystems and relates  directly to EU cybersecurity strategy and NIS objectives.

Main achievements and Recommendations for the way ahead  Main Achievements  The overall aim of ICT research in the Seventh Framework Programme was to develop knowledge and  technologies for building an open, secure and trustworthy information society in Europe. As already  supported by ex post evaluation and impact assessment reports key innovative results have been  produced as immediate results while indirect benefits have also been acknowledged regarding provision of  a knowledge base to support key EU policy initiatives and alignment of research activities between  Member States.  Even given the limited subset of projects, reviewed within the scope of this report, notable achievements  and innovative approaches can be identified in the areas of trustworthy network and service  infrastructures, user-centric identity and privacy management and technologies, trusted computing,  cryptology and advanced biometrics. Particular note should also be made to the promotion of horizontal  aspects such as usability, standardization, societal acceptance, economic viability and legal compliance of  the research results. Many projects in ICT Security and Trust have been particularly successful in  shortening the gap from research to innovation and thus promoting the establishment of a vibrant market  in secure and trustworthy ICT in Europe.  However, such impact could not have been achieved without assembling key experts concentrating efforts  of Europe's leading researchers. The backing of several European universities and companies provided a  critical thrust behind each project that a national level research program might not be able to provide.  Only with European partners from different European countries have the projects been able to deliver  results that allow the European industry supplying security solutions to fully leverage the potential of the  advancements proposed.  Apart from the technical results and their innovation potentials, several FP7 projects also managed to  support EU’s efforts to achieve policy promotion and coherence.  The ICT Trust & Security Programme has  been thought to “implement the EU Cybersecurity Strategy and to address the technological and industrial  issues that derive from the Network and Information Security (NIS) policy of DG CONNECT,  including the  implementation of research and innovation agenda related to cybersecurity, privacy and trustworthy ICT”.  In addition to NIS, promotion and support of other emerging legislative initiatives at EU level, namely  eIDAS and GDPR has been also achieved.  Similar to the reports prepared under the Security and Trust Coordination and Enhanced Collaboration  (SecCord) project16, Figure 2 below, attempts to summarize the promotion and support offered by each  project to the three main legislative initiatives that have been identified above. It is however apparent that  still a large number of unresolved cybersecurity, privacy and trust issues (areas of the main legislative  initiatives that are not covered) necessitate further research across all ICT technology, components,  applications and services.  16 http://www.seccord.eu/  http://www.seccord.eu/  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  35  Figure 2: Overview of Projects contribution per main legislative initiatives  The way ahead  ICT is the backbone every modern society, thus the EU needs to become the single market of preference  for governments and industry where trusted core NIS technologies and services for industry and citizens  are concerned. The ENISA Threat Landscape 201517 provides an analysis of the state and the dynamics of  the cyber-threat environment. Among other findings it acknowledges that cyber-threats have undergone  significant evolution and just as in 2014, cyber-threat agents have had the tranquillity and resources to  implement a series of advancements in malicious practices. An overview and comparison of cyber-threat  landscapes for 2015 and 2014 is presented in Table 1 below.  17 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat- landscape/etl2015/etl2015/at_download/fullReport  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/etl2015/etl2015/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/etl2015/etl2015/at_download/fullReport  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  36  TOP THREATS 2014  ASSESSED  TRENDS 2013  TOP THREATS 2015  ASSESSED  TRENDS 2014  CHANGE IN  RANKING  1.

A lot of work  has already been done with industrial stakeholders within the NIS Platform. WG3 identified key challenges  and desired outcomes in terms of innovation-focused, basic and applied research in the fields of cyber  security, privacy, and trust and proposed ways to promote multidisciplinary research that foster  collaboration among researchers, industry, and policy makers through the Strategic Research Agenda  (SRA)18. According to the SRA, the main the main research priorities to be further investigated in the future  are summarized in the following key objectives:   Fostering assurance   Focussing on data   Enabling secure execution   Preserving privacy   Increasing trust   Managing cyber risks   Protecting ICT infrastructures   Achieving user-centricity  EU level public-private partnerships in research and innovation were first introduced in 7th research  Framework Programme (FP7), mainly through Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs) and they were  implemented through dedicated legal entities - Joint Undertakings. Public-private partnerships is  considered a powerful tool to deliver on innovation and growth in Europe, also supported by the  respective Communication19 from 2013. The new EU research framework programme – Horizon 2020 –  may be implemented through public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the case of research and innovation  activities of strategic importance to the Union’s competitiveness and industrial leadership, or to address  specific societal challenges. On 2015, the European Commission adopted the Digital Single Market (DSM)20  Strategy, which establishes a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) on cybersecurity in the area of technologies  and solutions for online network security in the course of 2016.  The contractual PPP (cPPP) objective is to allow the EU to retain a high degree of technological capacity in  securing its digital economy and ensuring access to products and services reflecting European values such  as privacy. The cPPP will focus on Research and Innovation but also go beyond and address measures that  can help impose connection to end users, improve the reporting of validation activities with users of  research results and promote participation of relevant EU Industry. As the technology progresses, new  areas emerge and have to be explored addressed and secured. Therefore, the governance model should be  flexible enough and well represented by all relevant public and private sector stakeholders to address this  evolvement.  Based on the latest finding and reports from the research projects funded under the SEC-2013.2.5-1 -  Developing a Cybercrime and cyber terrorism research agenda – Coordination and Support Action call, the  proposed future research roadmap should pertain Technical, Human, Organizational and Regulatory  18 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform/shared-documents/wg3-documents/strategic-research-agenda- final-v0.96/at_download/file  19 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52013DC0494&from=EN  20 http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform/shared-documents/wg3-documents/strategic-research-agenda-final-v0.96/at_download/file https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform/shared-documents/wg3-documents/strategic-research-agenda-final-v0.96/at_download/file http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52013DC0494&from=EN http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  38  dimensions. A provisional instantiation of this roadmap from Comprehensive Approach to cyber roadMap  coordINation and develOpment (CAMINO) project21 is presented below.  Figure 3: CAMINO project Roadmap18  The technical dimension relates to concrete technological approaches and solutions that will strengthen  emerging tools and techniques and improve security assurance and preparedness. Human dimension  relates to human factors and behavioural aspects, training tools, promotion of privacy enchanting  technologies and appropriate use and re-use of data. The organisational dimension relates to processes,  procedures and policies within organisations, adapting to the cross-border nature of the Internet and  promoting cooperation and collaboration. Finally, the regulatory relates to law provisioning on information  sharing and flow of information and standardization in the areas of electronic transactions.  SRA has taken  one step further and has also compiled a set of indicative examples of expected benefits and contributions  per each identified objective.  21 http://www.fp7-camino.eu/  http://www.fp7-camino.eu/  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  39  TOPIC / BENEFITS BUSINESS CITIZENS SOCIETY  Fostering Assurance  Business will be able to  operate across Digital Single  Market (DSM) thanks to more  uniform assurance/protection  requirements and achieved  levels.

Table 2: SRA expected benefits/contributions per research commonality15  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  40  4. Future Work Programme Recommendations  Promote market-oriented innovation and direct transferability of outcomes to products or services.  The need to establish online trust has been identified early upon by the European Commission with a  number of policy initiatives supporting this objective such as the NIS Directive, General Data Protection  Regulation, the eIDAS Regulation and the ePrivacy Directive.  However, with the progress in the field of  information and communication technologies, and especially due to the decrease in calculation and  storage costs, new challenges to privacy and data protection, and eventually online trust, have emerged.  Forthcoming H2020 and Cyber Security contractual Public-Private Partnership (cPPP) work programmes  are already oriented towards promoting synergies between different areas of research and innovation; yet  additional effort should be made to ensure more market-oriented innovation and direct transferability of  outcomes to products or services.  Introduce horizontal requirements for new information and transparency models and endorse the  adoption of by design and by default paradigms.  At the end user’s level, this concern has given rise to an increasing appearance of online tools, often open- source and/or freeware, affirming that they can offer certain privacy-preventive functionality for the  average user, secure communication, protection against tracking, safeguarding of personal data,  anonymous browsing, etc. However, in many cases the functionality of such tools can only be compared  against the initial commitments and not the actual development and operation of the tool.  Proper information and transparency is a key issue in any data processing, so as to allow individuals to  understand how their data are being processed and to make relevant informed choices. As indicated in  ENISA 2015 report22, transparency needs to expand beyond the original point of data collection and  individuals should be adequately informed about the logic and the criteria applied in the context of  analytics and automated decision-making processes. To this end, new information and transparency  models need to be developed and could comprise a horizontal requirement in forthcoming work  programme pillars Purely textual information or existing privacy policies do not seem to cope with the  evolution of services and to comprehensively inform users on the processing of data occurring in the  complex data value chain. Along with transparency (or as part of it), providing access to users on their data  is an important privacy condition as well as an obligation of data controllers.  Sustain close collaboration with all relevant stakeholders on research and innovation topics while  supporting key EU policy initiatives  Tools and models that put the data subject in charge of managing their data and promote transparency  and user control online seems a promising and emerging research field. The forthcoming revision23 of the  ePrivacy Directive is one of the key policy initiatives aimed at reinforcing trust and security in electronic  22 Privacy by Design in Big Data: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/big-data-protection  23 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/public-consultation-evaluation-and-review-eprivacy-directive  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/big-data-protection https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/public-consultation-evaluation-and-review-eprivacy-directive  Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy  November 2016  41  communications in the EU with a focus on ensuring a high level of protection for citizens and a level  playing field for all market players. However, in order to bridge the gap between the legal framework and  the available technological implementation approaches, research and innovation activities that will bring  together all relevant stakeholders and will provide building blocks of various degrees of maturity should  also be promoted.

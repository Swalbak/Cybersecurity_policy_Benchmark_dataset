Collaboration between Computer Security Incident Response Teams  (CSIRTs) and Law Enforcement (LE) is the key to find such information and fighting cybercrime.  A number of attacks that recently hit critical sectors brought about an increased level of  cooperation, partly out of necessity; Wannacry (ENISA, 2017a) and ‘NotPetya’ (an updated  version of Petya) attacks (Europol, 2017a) being the most recent examples.  As mentioned in the Council Note of 31 May 2017 Cybersecurity - Information from the  Commission (Council, EU, 2017), “Conclusions drawn from the WannaCry attack include the  need for CSIRTs, LE authorities and the private sector to work together and the need for LE  authorities to have right tools to investigate these types of crimes and to prosecute criminals”.  The technical aspects, including tools and methodologies used, are an important component of  the cooperation. This report aims to support the cooperation between CSIRTs - in particular,  national and governmental, LE and the judiciary – in particular, prosecutors and judges, in their  fight against cybercrime, by providing information on the technical aspects of the cooperation,  identifying current shortcomings, and formulating and proposing recommendations to enhance  their technical cooperation. Moreover, this report introduces some use cases to present the  interaction among the different actors and the methodology and the tools used when CSIRTs,  LE and the judiciary cooperate for responding to cybercrime.  The data for this report has been collected by means of desk research and an online survey.  The data collected identified a shared platform across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary to be an  effective solution to the technical challenges highlighted in previous ENISA reports. While  designing the cooperation platform, there are important technical aspects that need to be  considered. Interoperability, authentication of users and security of personal data are some of  them. In addition, the platform should always be available, which is ensured at the level of  technological infrastructure by various parameters such as network infrastructures that support  its operation, software, hardware and durability - tolerance to risk factors such as power outages  and natural disasters.  It is generally accepted that there is a reciprocal understanding of the needs between CSIRT  and LE communities; however, information sharing between these communities occurs on an  ad-hoc basis rather than in a systematic manner.  At this point, there are many international initiatives started, some at EU level and some outside  the EU. Cross-sharing evidence seems to be on everyone’s agenda, although we all seem to be  in very early stages.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  6  There are plenty of tools available, belonging to different categories or having different features.  Thus, a cooperation platform should be built taking into account the different functionalities and  features of current tools and developments within the field  Core recommendations of this report on the development of a shared platform to improve  cooperation between CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary include:   ENISA and possibly EUROPOL EC3 and EUROJUST: to drive efforts towards the  development of a common platform, considering all requirements and constraints  expressed by the communities.   CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary with the support of ENISA and possibly EUROPOL EC3 and  EUROJUST: to work together towards a better mutual understanding of the strengths,  needs and limitations of the three communities in relation to the sharing information.   CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary with the support of ENISA and EUROPOL EC3: to facilitate  the sharing of experience at strategic and operational cooperation.   ENISA and possibly EUROPOL EC3 and EUROJUST: to promote the use of Segregation  (or separation) of Duties (SoD) matrices to avoid overlapping duties across CSIRTs, LE  and the judiciary in relation to the sharing information.   CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary with the support of ENISA and EUROPOL EC3: to develop  EU as well as national level requirements for their communities, on what types of  information can be useful from their own perspectives, throughout the cybercrime  investigation lifecycle.   ENISA and possibly EUROPOL EC3 and EUROJUST: to consider and promote the  adoption of a common digital forensics framework and CSIRTs and LE: to discuss and  consider the adoption of it.   ENISA and possibly EUROPOL EC3 and EUROJUST: to assess the suitability of EU  cybersecurity certification framework for cybercrime investigation tools.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  7  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 PURPOSE  Collecting information on current cooperation across CSIRT, LE and the judiciary communities  is a key step to enhance it. In 2019, the ENISA Roadmap on the cooperation between CSIRTs  and LE (ENISA, 2019d) also highlighted the importance of the technical cooperation across the  three communities; the purpose of this report is to better apprehend the technical aspects of the  cooperation and challenges lying ahead.  This report analyses the tools used and tools required by various countries when cooperating in  order to better manage the cybersecurity incidents, identifies the key technical challenges that  prevent or limit effective cooperation, and looks for common tools through which cooperation  can be strengthened and further enhanced.  Importantly, ENISA aims at using this report as a guidance to plan its policy support activities in  the forthcoming period of its annual work programme planning.  1.2 BACKGROUND TO THE REPORT  The ENISA programming document 2019-2021 includes ‘Objective 4.2. CSIRT and other NIS  community building’. Under this objective, ‘Output O.4.2.2 — Support the fight against  cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and LEA’ has the goal to continue supporting the  cooperation between the CSIRT and the law-enforcement communities and the extensions that  this collaboration may have to the judiciary. (ENISA, 2018, p. 53).  This report is a continuation of previous ENISA work, and it contributes to the implementation of  the ENISA programming document 2019-2021, Output O.4.2.2, in particular to what is planned  as project activities under Scenario 2.  1.3 REPORT OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE  1.3.1 Report objectives  The main objective of this report is:   To support collaboration across CSIRTs, in particular, national and governmental, LE,  prosecutors and judges.  1.3.2 Report scope  The report focuses on cooperation between national/governmental CSIRTs, LE and the  judiciary, although most considerations made are largely applicable to CSIRTs in general (i.e.  other than national/governmental CSIRTs).  The geographical coverage is limited to the EU (European Union, 2019) and EFTA (EFTA,  n.d.)1. (See also (ENISA, 2015a). This does not mean however that all these countries are  covered in the report and that no reference to other countries outside the EU and EFTA is  made. Possible specific differences among the EU and EFTA, or between the EU and the  United States, or the EU and Asia, also fall outside the scope of this report. This report does not  seek to provide an exhaustive analysis, but rather focus on a small number of topics influencing  1 In this report ‘n.d.’ stands for ‘no date’ and it is used in the references when no date could be found for the cited source.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  8  cooperation as it might become of interest for cross border investigations; hence, the  geographic scoping is essential to remain limited to the EU only.  The report does not target a specific sector; considerations made can apply to cooperation  between CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary to fight against cybercrime in all sectors (from finance to  energy, from transport to health).  This report does not aim to present an exhaustive set of tools for cooperation across CSIRTs,  LE and the judiciary; rather it seeks to facilitate the drawing of meaningful conclusions and  recommendations for further enhancing their technical cooperation and interaction.  1.4 TARGET AUDIENCE  The intended target audience are CSIRTs (mainly national and governmental CSIRTs but not  limited to them) LE, prosecutors, judges, as well as individuals and organisations with an  interest in Cybersecurity.  For the purposes of this report, the definition of each community is listed below:   Computer security incident response team (CSIRT) or computer emergency  response team (CERT) is ‘an organisation that studies computer and network security  to provide incident response services to victims of attacks, publish alerts concerning  vulnerabilities and threats, and […] offer other information to help improve computer and  network security’. At present, ‘both terms (CERT and CSIRT) are used in a synonymous  manner, with CSIRT being the more precise term’ (ENISA, 2015a, p. 7) (ENISA, 2015b,  p. 12) (ENISA, 2016b, p. 10). Governmental CSIRTs are teams whose constituency are  the public administration networks (ENISA, 2015c);   Law enforcement (LE), police and police agencies are terms used in this report are  synonymous and used to refer to police and police agencies, also used as synonymous.  LE is “any public authority competent for the prevention, investigation, detection or  prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the  safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security” (Council E. P.,  2016c);   Judiciary refers both to prosecutors and judges (a similar approach taken in (Council,  EU, 2017). Prosecutor refers ‘a legal official who accuses someone of committing a  crime, especially in a [criminal] law court’ (Cambridge Dictionary, n.d.). Judge refers to a  person who is in charge of a court of law and who makes final decisions.  Additionally, policy and lawmakers may benefit from select aspects of analysis as well as the  recommendations of this report, as they prepare policies and legislation for enhancing the  cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction with the judiciary.  http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-12711-2017-INIT/en/pdf  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  9  2. METHODOLOGY  2.1 DESK RESEARCH  Initially, desk research was conducted based on publicly available information sources,  including ENISA publications.  Supplementary desk research was conducted to address certain specific topics that the project  team deemed appropriate to examine in more depth following the analysis of the data collected  via the online survey.  2.2 ONLINE SURVEY  An online survey was conducted to collect data to validate and further substantiate some  findings. It was composed of 25 questions (see Annex D of the Roadmap on the cooperation  between CSIRTs and LE— Questions in the online survey (ENISA, 2019d, p. 86)), most of them  with closed answers and some with the possibility to add additional comments and provide more  details related to the answers.  The survey was developed using EUSurvey2, a survey tool that is ‘supported by the European  Commission’s ISA programme, which promotes interoperability solutions for European public  administrations’ (European Commission, n.d. b).  The invitation to complete the survey was disseminated via:   A closed ENISA mailing list of European national and governmental CSIRTs.   A Europol mailing list of the European Union Cybercrime Task Force (EUCTF), which is  composed of the heads of the designated national cybercrime units throughout the EU  Member States and Europol. The EUCTF3 is an interagency group formed to allow the  heads of National Cybercrime Units of EU member states, Iceland, Norway and  Switzerland, along with representatives from  Europol, CEPOL, the European  Commission and Eurojust to discuss the strategic and operational issues related to  cybercrime investigations and prosecutions within the EU and beyond (Council, EU,  2017b, p. 13).  The survey was launched in June 2019 and was open for around 2 weeks. The data collected  via the online survey was used to validate the data collected through the desk research.  A total of 33 replies4 were received, of these, 32 were from EU Member States (European  Union, n.d.) and EFTA countries (EFTA, n.d.) and 1 from a non-EU/non-EFTA country. It must  be noted that the reply from non-EU/non-EFTA country was somewhat in line with the other  replies received and has been used to formulate general considerations.  2 https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/home/welcome  3 In execution of the JHA Council conclusions of 27-28 November 2008 and of the 26 April 2010, Europol together with the  European Commission and the EU Member States have set up the European Union cybercrime task force (EUCTF)  composed of the Heads of the designated national cybercrime units throughout the EU Member States and Europol. The  EUCTF is an interagency group formed to allow the Heads of Cybercrime Units, Europol, the European Commission and  Eurojust to discuss the strategic and operational issues related to cybercrime investigations and prosecutions within the  EU and beyond.  4 ENISA is not privy of the exact number of recipients of the Europol list. The ENISA mailing list is approximately 63.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  10  Figure 1: Overview of communities of respondents to the online survey  Of the 32 EU and EFTA respondents, 10 respondents were from the CSIRT community, 21 from  the LE community and 1 belonged to both of these communities.  2.2.1 Data used to develop the recommendations  The recommendations in Chapter 6, have been developed based on research findings and the  results of this report.  2.3 CONTRIBUTION BY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS  ENISA selected five external subject-matter experts from the list of NIS experts compiled  following the ENISA CEI5 (Ref. ENISA M-CEI-17-T01) (ENISA, n.d.).  Three of them contributed to this report by supporting the data collection and the drafting while  two were reviewers. The two CEI experts contributing as reviewers reviewed this report in  several rounds including the first draft in September 2019, an intermediate draft in early October  2019, and the final draft in late October 2019. They reviewed it in addition to ENISA reviewers  and other external reviewers.  All five experts contributed ad personam.  These experts contributed inter alia with their expertise in Network and Information Security  (NIS) aspects of cybercrime, including but not limited to CSIRT and law enforcement  cooperation, operational cooperation, information sharing to handle incidents and to fight  against cybercrime.  5 The ENISA CEI list comprises of experts in various NIS subject-matters that have been selected according to a procedure  in line with the ENISA financial regulation; these experts are called upon by ENISA from time to time to support the Agency  in carrying out its operational duties.

TOOLS USED IN THE CYBERCRIME  INVESTIGATION LIFECYCLE  This chapter aims at outlining the similarities and differences of the most common and  recognised tools used by CSIRTs and LE during the whole lifecycle of a cybercrime  investigation. As the roles of CSIRTs and LE are not the same, some tools may be used by  CSIRTs, some others from LE and some by both communities. The goal is to enumerate the  main tools or tool categories/types used by both communities, at the same time providing as  many examples as possible.  3.1 MAIN TOOLS USED IN CYBERCRIME INVESTIGATION LIFECYCLE  In general, the cycle of investigation starts when the authorities, CSIRTs, Law Enforcement  Agencies (LEAs) or judicial authorities become aware that a cybersecurity incident or a  cybercrime has taken place. This information may reach the authorities from multiple sources,  e.g. a report from a victim (individual or representative of a legal entity), monitoring of online  illegal activities by officials, information published on the media, information from CSIRTs or a  LEA of another country, etc.  Figure 2: Incident handling process flow  Source: “ENISA Good Practice Guide for Incident Management”:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practice-guide-for-incident-management  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practice-guide-for-incident-management  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  12  A first responder, that may need to visit the ‘crime scene’, should take the appropriate measures  to secure the scene, use appropriate tools and collect any available digital evidence, always  following lawful procedures, according to the country’s legislation (ENISA, 2019c).  After the first response, a thorough investigation needs to take place by an investigator, in order  to get the full extent of the criminal activity, identify the victims, the damages and any losses,  find the real identities of the perpetrators and any others involved in the crime. Tools for  analysis and investigation are used in this phase.  To fully understand the crime that has been committed, the investigators firstly must collect  information from multiple sources, e.g. interviews with the victim(s), requests to Internet Service  Providers (ISPs), etc. They will possibly need to exchange information and cooperate with  authorities from other countries, using tools for cooperation and secure communication. They  may also need to deal with information in digital form, applying digital forensics techniques and  tools in any seized equipment (e.g. collected during a search at a suspect’s house). After all this  information is collected, it must be analysed, so that the investigator identifies the perpetrator(s),  based on the evidence.  The final step of the investigation is bringing the case to justice (if the action was taken by LE)  or taking any other appropriate measures to remediate the incident (if any action was taken by  CSIRTs), using specific tools for remediation.  The following sections, although not exclusive, outline the possible phases followed in an  incident response/ cybercrime investigation (ENISA, 2010) (SANS, 2019), (CREST, 2019). In  brief, the report will present:   Tools for reporting;   Tools for evidence collection;   Tools for analysis and investigation;   Tools for remediation;   Tools for coordination and information sharing;   Tools for secure communication.  3.2 TOOLS FOR REPORTING  Reporting is the first step within the cybercrime investigation lifecycle. CSIRTs and LE become  aware, by different sources (open-source intelligence, monitoring services, reports of citizens,  reports of IT administrator of companies etc.) of cybersecurity incidents that have taken place. It  should be noted that not all cybersecurity incidents are cybercrimes (so LE do not need to be  informed) and not all cybercrimes are considered cybersecurity incidents (so CSIRTs do not  need to be informed). This means that CSIRTs and LE do not always have the same interest in  incidents or investigations, which also affects the way they further handle each case.  Nevertheless, there are cases that may interest both CSIRTs and LE, so the need still exists for  information exchange. Reporting is also important to avoid duplication of efforts and resources  by CSIRTs and LE working on the same case (evidence collection, analysis, etc.). Reporting  could be considered as part of the information sharing process.  Regarding the reporting to the judiciary, due to the role of the CSIRT community, direct  reporting from CSIRTs to the judiciary is rare (ENISA, 2019a). It is generally accepted that there  is communication, on the one side, between LE and the judiciary and, on the other side,  between CSIRTs and LE. This means that there is an indirect communication between CSIRTs  and the judiciary, via LEAs. CSIRTs typically support LE during the investigation of an alleged  cybercrime. Cybersecurity incidents can be a source of illicit activities harbouring cybercrime.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  13  The judicial authorities in several Member States direct the investigations for cybercrime.  From the answers provided by the participants in the online survey, there are no common tools  for reporting and communication between CSIRTs and LE. The most traditional way of reporting  is via email and telephone calls. Especially in urgent cases, direct contact between people is the  most efficient way of communication.  Secure communication channels are also of great  importance and for this reason, largely PGP solutions are used.  A need for using a common language with terms that can be easily understood had been  highlighted by the three communities (ENISA, 2017, p. 38); hence, a common taxonomy has  been created, namely ‘Common Taxonomy for Law Enforcement and The National Network of  CSIRTs’6, and it is used by CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary. The objective of the document  created is to “support the CSIRTs and the public prosecutors in their dealing with LE in cases of  criminal investigations, by providing a common taxonomy for the classification of incidents”.  3.3 TOOLS FOR EVIDENCE COLLECTION  Evidence is perhaps the most important aspect of an investigation. Digital evidence has its own  life cycle and digital forensics is an enormous modern scientific sector. CSIRTs, LE and the  judiciary are interested in evidence collection, each community from their own standpoint.  Evidence collection is important in order to identify, prosecute and convict criminals. LE handle  and examine digital evidence with the purpose of further presenting their findings in court. On  the contrary, CSIRTs’ purpose when handling digital evidence is to identify the source of the  cyber-attack, its effects and its consequences as fast as possible. Although evidence collection  seems to be mostly a LE specific activity, CSIRTs can also offer assistance in this area.  According to the online survey results, various digital forensic techniques are used for collecting  evidence; the most frequently used are the following:   Memory forensics;   Network forensics;   Cloud forensics;   Computer forensics;   Mobile forensics;   IoT forensics;   OSINT (Twitter analysis, web crawling etc.);   TOR browser forensics (TOR network research, TOR nodes analysis etc.);   Darknet forensics [Darknet website enumeration, Tools research (GPG tools, databases),  etc.];   Physical forensics (physical evidence).  6 https://www.europol.europa.eu/publications-documents/common-taxonomy-for-law-enforcement-and-csirts  https://www.europol.europa.eu/publications-documents/common-taxonomy-for-law-enforcement-and-csirts  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  14  Figure 3: Replies to Question 10 of the online survey  For the above-mentioned techniques, the respondents identified the use of several different  tools either commercial or free or open-source or developed in-house. The major issue with  evidence collection is the admissibility in criminal prosecutions. This means that someone can  collect evidence using many different tools, simple or more complicated, commercial or open-  source. It is important, though, especially for LE to collect evidence that will be admissible to the  judicial procedures and in front of a court. From a CSIRT perspective, what is of great  importance is the timing to collect evidence, so any tool can be used, even those developed in-  house if it supports the normal activities of a CSIRT.  Some weaknesses of such tools have been highlighted by the participants of the online survey  and are presented below:   Slow speed of tools: this is also related to the evolution of disc/memory spaces;   Rapid growth of tools: this means that tools get outdated very quickly;   High cost of commercial tools: this could be an issue for certain LEAs, and need to be  addressed by the seller;   Limited options and functionalities of some tools: in addition to that, not all the tools  support all the operating systems.  9%  13%  13%  13%  16%  22%  31%  34%  50%  50%  53%  75%  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80%  Other  IoT forensics  Darknet forensics  No answer provided  TOR browser forensics  Digital forensics and Blockchain  Physical forensics  Mobile forensics  Network forensics  Digital forensics and OSINT  Memory forensics  Computer forensics  Replies  10. How the investigations are carried out? Which is the most common used forensic  technique?  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  15  3.4 TOOLS FOR ANALYSIS AND INVESTIGATION  On the one hand, LE investigate cybercrime in order to identify the people who are involved in  criminal activities and bring them to justice. Once evidence is collected, it must be analysed to  provide useful information or intelligence for LE and prosecution authorities. On the other hand,  CSIRTs analyse the evidence for the purpose of mitigating cyber threats and protecting the  infrastructure and data of an organisation.  The analysis is performed based on the evidence collected. There are traditional analysis  techniques and tools that can be used by analysts during an investigation of any type of crime.  During the analysis phase, the analyst looks for relationships among entities, sequences of  events, movement of money, narcotics, stolen goods or other commodities, activities involved in  a criminal operation, etc.  According to the respondents, for analysis purposes, both commercial and open-source tools  can be used as well as the skills of investigators and analysts.  Investigation techniques include not only data analysis but also several other traditional LE  methods, such as interviewing of victims and suspects, undercover surveillance, access to non-  public sources of information and more.  There are certain trends that seem to affect investigation and identification that have been  identified as challenges by several organisations in the online survey:   The analysis of “big data” by the LE is not considered an easy task; it is often time-  consuming and requires specific knowledge;   The Carrier-grade NAT (CGN)7 technology also makes it difficult for LE to reveal the  identity of criminals, as several users are hidden behind the same IP address;   The Internet of Things (IoT) is an issue discussed mainly because forensic analysis of IoT  devices is not a straightforward task in most cases;   Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers an automated analysis that can be performed by LEAs, but  this approach raises legal, ethical and technological issues.   Analysis of cryptocurrencies transactions, which is fundamental for identifying the money  flow, is often related to online criminal activities. Many online services exist that offer  mixing and obfuscation services, making it difficult for LEAs to trace users behind digital  wallets.  3.5 TOOLS FOR REMEDIATION  Remediation is a highly complex activity, with the purpose of restoring the systems and services  damaged during an attack/incident.  The respondents from LEAs in the online survey did not indicate that restoration/remediation is  part of their duty. Most of them mentioned that they focus mainly on the evidence collection  phase.  CSIRT respondents indicated that systems recovery is part of their post-incident duties.  Responses did not indicate clearly defined tools or activities, but merely that some national  CSIRTs can perform such activities as coordinators or consultants.  Important aspects to be considered regarding remediation:  7 https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/are-you-sharing-same-ip-address-criminal-law-enforcement-call-for-end- of-carrier-grade-nat-cgn-to-increase-accountability-online  https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/are-you-sharing-same-ip-address-criminal-law-enforcement-call-for-end-of-carrier-grade-nat-cgn-to-increase-accountability-online https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/are-you-sharing-same-ip-address-criminal-law-enforcement-call-for-end-of-carrier-grade-nat-cgn-to-increase-accountability-online  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  16   Remediation operations are specific per each system. Only the owner of a system can  choose the appropriate tools and activities for remediation, depending on the specificities  of the environment.   Remediation is usually an activity within a bigger domain called “Business Continuity and  Disaster Recovery”. It involves many prerequisites to be in place, specific procedures,  tools and people.    Choosing the right tools to perform remediation depends on the environment that must  be restored. There are different types of data backup (e.g. cloud, on-site, Redundant  Array of Independent Disks - RAID, tapes etc.).   National CSIRTs might be involved in coordination activities as regards remediation; they  might need to be actively involved only when they manage the systems or have in-depth  experience in certain technologies.   Nobody, within the respondents, indicated specific tools to be used in the remediation  phase.  3.6 TOOLS FOR COORDINATION (AND INFORMATION SHARING)  Due to the borderless nature of cybercrime and cybersecurity incidents, the same incident may  affect several countries. In such cases, it is important for CSIRTs and LEAs of different  countries to be able to work together on the same cases, exchange information and take  coordinated actions, according to their mandates.  Within the LE community and specifically in the field of cybercrime, cooperation among LEAs of  the EU Member States and a few Third countries takes place through Europol, the European  Cybercrime Centre and in major cases through the Joint Cyber-crime Action Taskforce (J-  CAT)8.  Europol’s position at the heart of the European security governance system allows it to serve as  a:   support centre for law enforcement operations;   a hub for information on criminal activities;   centre for law enforcement expertise.  Europol also supports the law enforcement activities of the Member States through a network of  liaison officers. This network consists of liaison officers who are responsible for facilitating the  exchange of information between the Member States; each liaison officer represents his/her  Member States. In this way, messages and requests from one country to another are sent  through the liaison bureau.  The European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)9 was set up “to strengthen the law enforcement  response to cybercrime in the EU and thus to help protect European citizens, businesses and  governments from online crime”. EC3 has been involved in tens of high-profile operations. One  big innovation that took place within the EC3 is the establishment of the J-CAT. “J-CAT’s  objective is to drive intelligence-led, coordinated action against key cybercrime threats and  targets by facilitating the joint identification, prioritisation, preparation and initiation of cross-  border investigations and operations by its partners.”10  8 https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/joint-cybercrime-action-taskforce  9 https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3  10 https://www.europol.europa.eu/  https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/joint-cybercrime-action-taskforce https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3 https://www.europol.europa.eu/  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  17  Another mechanism for coordinating actions during major cyberattacks against information  systems is the “Law Enforcement – Emergency Response Protocol (LE ERP)”. The LE ERP has  been recognised by the EU Council and the Member States as one of the key mechanisms at  EU level providing an EU coordinated response to large-scale cybersecurity incidents and  crises11. LE ERP includes setting up Europol’s Virtual Command Post, a secure communication  channel to facilitate real-time critical communications and on a need-to-know basis with the  different stakeholder groups.  It should be also noted that according to the Directive on Attacks against Information Systems  2013/40/EU12 and the Council of Europe’s Convention on Cyber-crime13, networks of 24/7  contact points have been established, so that direct communication and information exchange  can take place among relevant LEAs of Member States in cases of attacks against information  systems, but also several types of cybercrime.  Coordination plays an important role in incident response. Most often cybercrime cases or  cybersecurity incidents have a cross-border dimension, meaning that there is a need for a  certain level of coordination. CSIRTs usually take the lead in collecting large amounts of data  related to malicious activities, a part of which could end up in LE related investigations that later  will lead to the identification and incrimination of culprits.  The path to incrimination is challenging, according to a study published by Third Way on their  website14; less than 1% of cybercrimes in the United States see an enforcement action taken  against the attackers. In addition, for that 1%, there is immense cooperation and coordination  effort in place.  In recent years, many successful takedown operations have taken place as a result of the  cooperation across CSIRTs, LE and private sector players15.  The online survey responses indicate a basic level of cooperation taking place between CSIRTs  and LE, but mostly with regular tools such as phone or email.  There are clear signs of cooperation within communities, but not necessarily among  communities. For example, the majority of CSIRTs across the EU are using the same tools such  as a Request Tracker for Incident Response (RTIR)16 ticketing system (Hall, 2015), Malware  Information Sharing Platform (MISP)17 or other similar malware information-sharing platforms,  messaging, email clients, etc.  The CSIRT community is also supported by EU level initiatives, such as the CSIRTs network  established by the NIS Directive (ENISA, 2016), Trusted Introducer and the specific activities  that ENISA has supported over the last years. A common technical platform for cooperation and  exchange of information is also under development (MeliCERTes18).  Survey responses suggest that the members of the CSIRT community have more skills and  resources to develop in-house applications. Several tools mentioned by the respondents are  11 Draft Council Conclusions on EU Coordinated Response to Large-Scale Cybersecurity Incidents and Crises,10085/18,  19 June 2018.  12 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32013L0040  13 https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/0900001680081561  14 https://www.thirdway.org/report/to-catch-a-hacker-toward-a-comprehensive-strategy-to-identify-pursue-and-punish- malicious-cyber-actors  15 https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/%E2%80%98avalanche%E2%80%99-network-dismantled-in- international-cyber-operation  16 https://bestpractical.com/rtir  17 https://www.misp-project.org/  18 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/call-tender-advance-melicertes-facility-used-csirts-eu-cooperate-and- exchange-information  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32013L0040 https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/0900001680081561 https://www.thirdway.org/report/to-catch-a-hacker-toward-a-comprehensive-strategy-to-identify-pursue-and-punish-malicious-cyber-actors https://www.thirdway.org/report/to-catch-a-hacker-toward-a-comprehensive-strategy-to-identify-pursue-and-punish-malicious-cyber-actors https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/%E2%80%98avalanche%E2%80%99-network-dismantled-in-international-cyber-operation https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/%E2%80%98avalanche%E2%80%99-network-dismantled-in-international-cyber-operation https://bestpractical.com/rtir https://www.misp-project.org/ https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/call-tender-advance-melicertes-facility-used-csirts-eu-cooperate-and-exchange-information https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/call-tender-advance-melicertes-facility-used-csirts-eu-cooperate-and-exchange-information  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  18  developed by members of the CSIRT community. In addition, they intensely rely on open-source  software. On the other side, LE use mainly commercial tools but they can also rely on tools  developed by the CSIRT community.  The LE community presents similar signs of inter-member cooperation. Survey responses  indicate, in general, that LEAs across the EU use mainly similar tools and do make use of the  cooperation mechanisms put in place at EU level. There is a strong level of cooperation and  coordination at EU level through EUROPOL, that hosts some EU wide available cooperation  tools (e.g. SIENA19, SIRIUS 20). EUROPOL also established EC3 to “strengthen the law  enforcement response to cyber-crime in the EU”21.  However, the online survey responses do not indicate the use of advanced coordination tools  between the two communities. Cooperation does take place, but only basic tools such as email  and telephone are used. There are though, several examples where well-established  cooperation mechanisms and tools are put in place.  One is in the UK, where the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the National Cyber Security  Centre (NCSC) are tasked with responding to different aspects of cyber-attacks22. In this  respect, NCA investigates the most serious and complex attacks affecting the UK while NCSC  protects critical services from cyber-attacks. According to the source, this model was tested  “during the WannaCry attack in which the NCA led the criminal investigation, while the NCSC  developed advice on limiting damage, protecting uninfected computers, and establishing the  scale of the incident”. The online survey replies identify NSCS using several internal  cooperation tools developed by the NCA.  Based on the interviews conducted for preparing the Roadmap on the cooperation between  CSIRTs and LE (ENISA, 2019d), the Malta Police Force - Cyber Crime Unit23, is currently  working on a project for implementing MISP and other information-sharing platforms between  CSIRT and LEAs.  The Belgium Federal Computer Crime Unit also mentioned that they are using a coordination  tool developed by their national CSIRT.  The French National Police created a CSIRT for supporting investigation. As a full member of  the French CSIRT community and TF-CSIRTs Network, it shares information directly with  CSIRTs by using a MISP.  Some coordination tools used by the CSIRT community are the following:   Incident response ticketing systems - RTIR;   Messaging platforms – Mattermost24, Threema25;   Software to structure information – Taranis26;   Collecting and processing security feeds (such as log files) – IntelMQ27.  19 https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/information-exchange/secure-information-exchange- network-application-siena  20 https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/europol-launches-sirius-platform-to-facilitate-online-investigations  21 https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3  22 https://www.computerweekly.com/news/450430399/UK-cyber-defenders-set-to-build-on-existing-capability  23 https://pulizija.gov.mt/en/police-force/police-sections/Pages/Cyber-Crime-Unit.aspx  24 https://mattermost.com  25 https://threema.ch/en  26 https://github.com/NCSC-NL/taranis3/wiki  27 https://github.com/certtools/intelmq  https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/information-exchange/secure-information-exchange-network-application-siena https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/information-exchange/secure-information-exchange-network-application-siena https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/europol-launches-sirius-platform-to-facilitate-online-investigations https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3 https://www.computerweekly.com/news/450430399/UK-cyber-defenders-set-to-build-on-existing-capability https://pulizija.gov.mt/en/police-force/police-sections/Pages/Cyber-Crime-Unit.aspx https://mattermost.com/ https://threema.ch/en https://github.com/NCSC-NL/taranis3/wiki https://github.com/certtools/intelmq  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  19  Among others, two coordination tools used by the LE community are the following:   Secure information exchange network application – SIENA;   A platform for facilitating online investigations – SIRIUS.  3.7 TOOLS FOR SECURE COMMUNICATION  When dealing with cybercrime, secure communication is of the highest importance. The  processing and sharing of sensitive data require appropriate protection.  Section 4.2.1 of the ENISA report Tools and Methodologies to Support Cooperation between  CSIRTs and Law Enforcement (ENISA, 2017, p. 28) provides more insights into the types of  tools used by each community.  The most significant tool that is used for information exchange among LEAs in different  countries is Europol’s SIENA. SIENA ensures the secure exchange of sensitive and restricted  information among LE of Member States.  Other than the above, the organisations make use of encrypted emails to communicate  between themselves.  The online survey did not reveal any serious progress in this area as the CSIRT community  continues to use OpenPGP28 besides other protocols that provide end-to-end encryption over  the network, such as Transport Secure Layer (TLS). Tools enumerated in the previous  subchapter also provide certain levels of security.  It is worthwhile to mention the MeliCERTes platform, serving as a network for establishing  confidence and trust among the national CSIRTs of the Member States and for promoting swift  and effective operational cooperation. A modular platform that interlaces various services that  not only offers a complete security incident management solution but also allows CSIRTs to  share information and collaborate with each other within verified trust circles. Each module  specialises in a task essential to security incident management29.  In some cases, LE rely on secure email services, while in the few cases where using CSIRT  powered tools, they rely on the security provided by the developers. EU level cooperation  platforms, hosted by Europol, offer adequate levels of protection, but can only be used for “LE  to LE” type of cooperation.  28 https://www.openpgp.org/about/  29 https://github.com/melicertes/csp  https://www.openpgp.org/about/ https://github.com/melicertes/csp  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  20  4. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  4.1 REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR USING TOOLS DURING  INVESTIGATIONS  This subchapter examines different types of restrictions/constraints that CSIRTs and LEAs  might have when using specific tools. Currently criminal investigations may also have a digital  dimension. The many ways information technology impacts our lives have also influenced the  way criminal investigations are conducted.  Over the last decade, the use of digital evidence in  the LE and justice sector has encountered an exponential increase in Europe. Digital evidence  has become important not only for cybercrime but for all sorts of crimes.  The authors of Handling and Exchanging Electronic Evidence Across Europe, (Biasiotti M. J.,  2018) provide useful insights on how digital evidence is currently handled in the EU. They  mention that although Member States might have in place-varied legislation that regulates the  collection and handling of digital evidence, there are two elements that must be guaranteed in  any case, that is relevance and authenticity. Nevertheless, these requirements are difficult to be  met due to some peculiar characteristics of digital evidence, namely fragility and immateriality  (difficult to associate with physical objects). That is why the “chain of custody” becomes very  important. A proper chain of custody should contain details on how the digital evidence was  handled from the moment collected until presented in court.  At European level, there is still neither a unified legal framework nor shared rules that make it  possible to handle digital evidence and its possible exchange in a uniform manner across  Member States”. At international level, the Council of Europe Convention on cybercrime  (Council of Europe, 2001), often referred to as the ‘Budapest Convention’, is the first and most  relevant international treaty on cybercrime and electronic evidence.  At EU level, the European Commission has submitted a proposal for a regulation on production  and preservation for electronic evidence in criminal matters30. Within the Impact Assessment31,  that preceded the above proposal, it is clearly mentioned that “some crimes cannot be  effectively investigated and prosecuted in the EU because of legal constraints in cross-border  access to electronic evidence”.  In the same light, the European Commission proposed on 5 February 2019 to start international  negotiations on cross-border access to electronic evidence, necessary to track down dangerous  criminals and terrorists. This initiative is called “E-evidence - cross-border access to electronic  evidence32” and aims to ensure that the Second Additional Protocol (under negotiation) to the  Council of Europe “Budapest” Convention on Cybercrime  is compatible with EU law, as well as  the proposed EU rules on cross-border access to electronic evidence.  Significant progress has been done in this area, as problems have been identified and actions  have been proposed. Nevertheless, it will take some time until the real impact will be assessed  at Member States level.  30 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52018PC0225&from=EN  31 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0118&from=EN  32 https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/criminal-justice/e-evidence-cross-border-access- electronic-evidence_en  In some cases,  the use of tools  might be  influenced/  restrained by  different  national or  international  regulatory  frameworks.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52018PC0225&from=EN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0118&from=EN https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/criminal-justice/e-evidence-cross-border-access-electronic-evidence_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/criminal-justice/e-evidence-cross-border-access-electronic-evidence_en  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  21  Useful conclusions and recommendations are also provided in:   EU Council conclusions on improving criminal justice in cyberspace, 9 June 201633;   European Informatics Data Exchange Framework for Courts and Evidence34 -  (EVIDENCE), the EU CORDIS project that aimed at creating a Common European  Framework for the correct and harmonised handling of electronic evidence during its  entire life cycle; among the outstanding results of the project we can enumerate The  Digital Forensics Tools Catalogue35 and The Electronic Evidence Categorisation Tool.  In the US, National Institute of Standards and Technology - NIST has developed a Computer  Forensics Tool Testing Program (CFTT)36, to “establish a methodology for testing computer  forensic software tools by developing general tool specifications, test procedures, test criteria,  test sets, and test hardware” to ensure their reliability; a catalogue of tools is provided by NIST  (NIST, 2019).  As regards the admissibility of evidence in court, progress still needs to be done not only at EU  but also at international level; standards that provide guidelines related to the evidence  collection process and forensic methods are also required.  Figure 4 depicts that the communities identify the need of following digital forensic rules when  evidence is collected. 56% of the online survey participants replied that they follow a set of  digital forensic rules during the evidence collection phase, while 6% replied that they have not  identified such a need. Some respondents also indicated some specific frameworks.  Following forensic rules when collecting evidence does not guarantee the admissibility of  evidence in criminal proceedings. However, the development and adoption of a common  framework of digital forensic rules could increase the likelihood of evidence admissibility in  court; this could be beneficial for the communities.

Any proposed platform needs to comply with existing and forthcoming legislation at  national, European and international level. Characteristic examples are the EU General Data  Protection Regulation (Regulation EU 679/2016 (Council E. P., 2016a)), the Network and  Information Security Directive, also known as NIS Directive, (Directive EU 2016/1148 (Council  E. P., 2016b)), the E-evidence framework (European Commission, n.d, a), the EU Cybersecurity  Certification framework (European Commission, n.d., b) and more.  4.2.1 GDPR Implications on the use of different tools  The new EU General Data Protection Regulation was adopted on the 24th of May 2016 and  entered into force on the 25th of May 2018. The objective of the regulation is the “protection of  natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free  movement of personal data”.  The GDPR underlines seven key principles that must be respected by those processing personal  data:   Lawfulness, fairness and transparency: these three core principles are referring to  processor/controller being honest and respecting the regulation.   Purpose limitation: the data must be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate  purposes.   Data minimisation: the volume of data collected should be limited to what is necessary to  fulfil the purposes for which they are processed.   Accuracy: The data must be accurate and kept up to date.   Storage limitation: the data must be stored only for the time period that is strictly  necessary in relation to the purpose for which they were collected.   Integrity and confidentiality: this is clearly a requirement for security of processing.  Among others, data should be protected against unauthorised or unlawful processing  and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. This should be achieved by using  appropriate technical or organisational measures.   Accountability: this principles defines that the controller and the processor shall be  responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, all the above.  Article 6 of the regulation deals with the lawfulness of processing, mainly stating that there must  be a legal basis for the processing, either being a legal obligation, legitimate interest, explicit  consent, or another basis, as explained in the article.  Another important aspect of the GDPR is that it requires the implementation of “privacy by  design” and “privacy by default” principles. This means that controllers and processors must put  in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to implement the data protection  principles and safeguard individual rights.  Article 2, par.2 (d) of the GDPR stipulates that the regulation does not apply to the processing of  personal data “by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation,  detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the  safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security”. As the GDPR does not  apply in these cases, a more specific legislative document was adopted in parallel with the  GDPR, the Directive (EU) 2016/680 on the protection of natural persons regarding the  processing of personal data connected with criminal offences or the execution of criminal  penalties, and on the free movement of such data, which also entered into force on May 25th  2018.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  23  The Directive is designed to protect citizens' fundamental right to data protection when personal  data is processed by law enforcement authorities for law enforcement purposes. The Directive  is expected to facilitate cross-border cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism.  This practically means that LEAs that use tools to process personal data have to do so lawfully,  fairly, and only for a specific purpose, always linked to the fight against crime.  Police and criminal justice authorities are obliged to apply the principles of data protection by  design and data protection by default at the beginning of any personal data processing. When  developing applications, criteria definition needs to be developed first by both communities.  The lawful bases for processing are set out in Article 6 of the GDPR. At least one of these must  apply whenever the processing of personal data takes place: consent, performance of a  contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public task or legitimate interest. Fairness means that  handling of personal data should take place only in ways that people would reasonably expect,  and they should not be used in ways that have unjustified adverse effects on the  individual. Transparent processing is about being clear, open and honest with people from the  start about who the data controller and processors are, and how and why they use personal  data. 37  Additionally, the Directive provides that processing of personal data by these bodies will fall  under the control of Independent Supervisory Authorities; however certain exceptions are  introduced for the judiciary, as Article 45 par. 2 of the Directive stipulates that “Each Member  State shall provide for each supervisory authority not to be competent for the supervision of  processing operations of courts when acting in their judicial capacity”.  Nevertheless, CSIRTs do not fall into the same category, as they are considered data  controllers/processors, as their operations are regulated by the GDPR and not like LE by the  2016/680 Directive38. Notably, recital 49 of the GDPR provides that the processing of personal  data “for the purposes of ensuring network and information security […] by computer security  incident response teams (CSIRTs) constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller  concerned”.  The provisions of recital 5039 could also provide a legal basis for personal data processing,  through national laws, for certain CSIRTs constituencies (e.g. national, governmental): “if the  processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the  exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Union or Member state law may determine  and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be regarded as  compatible and lawful”.  CSIRTs must be very careful, as the principles stated above also apply  to them. Transparency and accountability along with the “right to be forgotten” are important, as  a data subject may request access to its data, or even deletion. Therefore, appropriate  measures should be in place to handle these requests by “locating” the data stored and  processed through different CSIRT tools. When dealing with attacks, the temptation of collecting  too much data should be avoided. Storage limitation should also be applied, and data removed  after some time has passed.  There are significant challenges in cybersecurity, such as threat intelligence that is a service  that needs huge amounts of data, collected over many years, in some cases. Data maximisation  is rather applied to what is collected, as in aggregating any information that could be relevant as  37 https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation- gdpr/principles/lawfulness-fairness-and-transparency/  38 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016L0680  39 http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/recital-50-GDPR.html  https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/lawfulness-fairness-and-transparency/ https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/lawfulness-fairness-and-transparency/ https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016L0680 http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/recital-50-GDPR.htm  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  24  an input. Furthermore, access to certain useful online services, such as WHOIS, have been  restricted due to privacy concerns.  Considering the above, further clarifications are needed as regards the lawful operation of  CSIRTs under GDPR. National CSIRTs can further analyse data protection issues, covering  also other types of CSIRT services that might be offered within their countries. Considerations  of using common platforms and data transfer tools among different countries should also be  made. The EU data protection framework, in particular, the GDPR and LE DP Directive, impose  specific restrictions to CSIRTs and LE also when sharing data with international organisations  and onwards with third countries. Sharing with non-EU countries requires an adequate level of  data protection. This could require CSIRTs and LE to revisit their framework of sharing  information with corresponding authorities of third countries.  4.2.2 NIS Directive and its implications on the use of tools  The EU Directive 2016/1148 concerning measures for a high common level of security of  network and information systems across the Union, known also as the NIS Directive, is the first  piece of EU-wide cybersecurity legislation (Council E. P., 2016b). The goal is to enhance  cybersecurity across the EU, through enhancing national capabilities, cross-border cooperation  and national supervision of critical sectors (ENISA, 2016).  Among other things, the NIS Directive established an EU wide cooperation framework for  national CSIRTs (the CSIRTs Network). Between the tasks attributed to the group are  coordination and exchange of information as regards incidents.  What had been done at EU level through informal groups is now done officially through the  CSIRTs Network. The group already has periodic meetings, supported by ENISA.  Along with the adoption of the NIS Directive, there is also a notable technical development,  namely MeliCERTes, a facility used by the CSIRTs in the EU to cooperate and exchange  information. ENISA will oversee operating the central aspects of the MeliCERTes facility and will  support the operation of the EU CSIRTs Network. National CSIRTs have also been allocated  EU funds, to develop national technical platforms, able to integrate with MeliCERTes.  The conclusion is that soon, the EU CSIRT community will have all the necessary tools to  cooperate properly among themselves.  Along with the NIS Directive, new legislation has been adopted in all Member States,  strengthening the role of the national CSIRT or similar institutions. Every Member State will now  have a stronger national CSIRT and a cyber supervisory scheme covering at least seven  essential industries (energy, banking and financial markets, transport, water, health, digital  operators).  Tools used within this area need to focus more on cooperation and be able to facilitate secure  data exchange among many peers. National CSIRTs should be able to perform analyses at  industry level, but also at national level and to cooperate with other CSIRTs across the EU. New  tools, such as MeliCERTes, must be able to support this exponential growth in the number of  cooperating parties, and sources of information.  However, the NIS Directive does not put too much emphasis on cooperation with LE and the  judiciary.  Besides the demand for “consult and cooperate” with LEAs, expressed in Art. 8, no  other parts of the NIS Directive mention such initiatives. The NIS Directive supports the delivery  of secure and dependable essential services to to EU citizens.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  25  Therefore, this is still a grey area and the questions remain, such as how a fully developed  CSIRT community, equipped with tools and a proper cooperation framework, can also  contribute to the cybercrime investigation lifecycle, by serving LE and the judiciary with the  proper data to identify and incriminate responsible persons.  4.2.3 The role of the cybersecurity certification framework  The EU Cybersecurity Act (Regulation EU 2019/881 (Council E. P., 2019)) establishes an EU  certification framework for information and communication technology (ICT) digital products,  services and processes, which enables the creation of EU certification schemes. Although  several security certification schemes exist in the EU for ICT products, measuring the security  and trust of these products, these are not based on a common framework. After massive  cyberattacks e.g. ransomware cases, the need for providing rated assurance level has also  been highlighted in the area of cybercrime investigation as various tools are used in all  cybercrime investigation lifecycle phases.  The new framework will provide a set of rules, technical requirements, standards and  procedures so that security and trust of products could be measured. Users and service  providers alike will be able to determine the level of security assurance of the products, services  and processes they procure, make available or use.  In particular, each European scheme should specify:   the categories of products and services covered;   the cybersecurity requirements, for example by reference to standards or technical  specifications;   the type of evaluation (e.g. self-assessment or third-party evaluation);   the intended level of assurance (e.g. basic, substantial and/or high).  To describe the cybersecurity risk, a certificate may refer to three assurance levels that result  from estimating the level of risk in relation to the intended use of the product, service or process  (focusing on probability and impact of an incident). The resulting certificate will be recognised in  all EU Member States, making trade easier across different countries.  For instance, evidence management is the key part of a cybercrime investigation and  prosecution. The increasing requirement of storing, preserving, sharing and managing various  forms of digital records used as evidence in a criminal court highlights the need for using tools  that can provide assurance that the data is trustworthy, accurate, complete, secure and  subsequently admissible in a court for prosecuting the suspect.  It is expected that all the tools used by CSIRTs and LE during the cybercrime investigation  lifecycle for collecting evidence, analysing data, investigating cases, communicating etc. will  need to fulfil the requirements set up by a certification scheme.  55% of the online survey participants replied that they are aware of the emerging EU  cybersecurity certification framework. Figure 6 depicts how the Member States see the impact  that EU cybersecurity certification may have on the use of CSIRT/LE tools provided throughout  the cybercrime investigation lifecycle. 54% of the participants see that the security certification  framework will have positive impact on the technical cooperation across the three communities;  in particular, 33% of the respondents consider that the EU cybersecurity certification framework  will provide greater assurance of the forensics data, 12% replied that it will mitigate various risks  that arise during a cybercrime investigation case, while 6% claim that this framework may  improve the tools in terms of software and 3% in terms of hardware.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  26  Figure 5: Replies to question 24A of the online survey  4.2.4 Standards and certifications available  There are several useful best-practice standards for implementing effective cybersecurity.  These standards also cover the use of tools and techniques within an organisation. Therefore, it  is important to understand the role that each standard fulfils, its scope and how it is combined  with other standards.  Certification plays a critical role in increasing trust and security for different products and  services, within communities, and refers to the confirmation of certain characteristics of a  product or service. This can only be beneficial to the EU internal market, as it improves the  functioning conditions by increasing the level of security. The purpose of the Cybersecurity  Certification Framework is to establish an EU level scheme to attest that the evaluated ICT  products, services and processes and comply with specified security requirements for the  purpose of assuring cybersecurity. The CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary can surely find the new  framework as a fit for purpose.  Cybersecurity standards are generally applicable to all organisations no matter what their size is  or the industry/sector they represent. Several people need to work together to develop a  standard, at European level ETSI40 and CEN-CENELEC41 guidelines are followed; while at  international level, people follow the guidelines provided by ISO/IEC standards.  Concerning the international-level cases, the people who are working together aiming to  develop a new standard are independent technical experts nominated by ISO members, for  specific subject areas. The standard development workflow is as follows: they begin the process  with the development of a draft that meets a specific market need; then, this is shared for  commenting and further discussion. The voting process is the key to consensus.

If an agreement is not  reached, then the draft will be modified further and voted on again42.  ISO/IEC 27001 is the international standard for best practice Information Security Management  Systems (ISMS). Its main scope is the protection and preservation of information under the  principles of confidentiality, integrity and availability. The standard offers a set of best-practice  controls that can be applied to an organisation based on the risks it faces and implemented in a  structured manner in order to achieve externally assessed and certified compliance43.  ISO/IEC 27032 is the international standard that focuses on cybersecurity. The standard  provides guidance for improving the state of cybersecurity, drawing out the unique aspects of  that activity and its dependencies on other security domains, in particular:   information security;   network security;   internet security;   critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP)44.  ISO/IEC 27035 is the international standard for incident management. Incident management  forms the crucial first stage of cyber resilience. This standard also includes guidance for  updating policies and processes to strengthen existing controls following analysis of the event  and minimise the risk of recurrence45.  ISO/IEC 27031 is the international standard for ICT readiness for business continuity. The  standard describes the key concepts and principles of ICT readiness for business continuity and  provides a framework of methods and processes to identify and specify all aspects (such as  performance criteria, design, and implementation) for improving an organization's ICT readiness  to ensure business continuity46.  ISO/IEC 22301 is the international standard for business continuity management systems and  forms the final part of cyber resilience. The standard specifies requirements to plan, establish,  implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and continually improve a documented  management system to protect against, reduce the likelihood of occurrence, prepare for,  respond to, and recover from disruptive incidents when they arise47.  The Cloud Security Alliance’s Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) is a set of controls designed to  maximise the security of information for organisations that take advantage of Cloud  technologies48.  The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) \"provides a high-level taxonomy of  cybersecurity outcomes and a methodology to assess and manage those outcomes\". In  particular, NIST CSF provides a policy framework of computer security guidance for how private  sector organizations in the United States can assess and improve their ability to prevent, detect,  and respond to cyber-attacks.  42 https://www.iso.org/developing-standards.html  43 https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html  44 https://www.iso.org/standard/44375.html  45 https://www.iso.org/standard/44379.html  46 https://www.iso.org/standard/44374.html  47 https://www.iso.org/standard/50038.html  48 https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/working-groups/cloud-controls-matrix/  https://www.iso.org/developing-standards.html https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html https://www.iso.org/standard/44375.html https://www.iso.org/standard/44379.html https://www.iso.org/standard/44374.html https://www.iso.org/standard/50038.html https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/working-groups/cloud-controls-matrix/  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  28  5. CONSIDERATION OF  REQUIREMENTS FOR A SHARED  PLATFORM  As the main objective of this report is to streamline cooperation between the communities, there  are different types of requirements that must be considered when using such tools or proposing  initiatives in this area.  5.1 COMPONENTS  The concept of “people, process and technology” has been the cornerstone Information  Technology Infrastructure Library - ITIL49  for many years. These parts are considered the keys  to successful project implementation and organizational change. In other words, for a new  cooperation platform to be successful and operational, an approach that optimises the  relationships between the three is required.   People: It is necessary to identify the key role players from the CSIRT, LE and the  judiciary communities and understand how each of them can contribute in the fight  against cybercrime. The aim is to highlight conflicting or overlapping duties performed by  one community or more. CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary should identify the key  responsibilities for their communities and then link them with the skills required to fulfil  these duties.   Process: The suitable processes in order for an advanced collaboration platform to be  successful need to be defined. Then, process variations, exceptions, interdependencies  and supporting processes should also be considered. The three communities have to  review these processes, make sure that they understand what is expected from each  party and express their concerns for any possible gaps or other issues.   Technology: This part should be the final consideration once the issue is clearly  understood and the solution requirements have been clearly defined. Technology will  cover the needs that people and processes require, but not vice versa. Careful  consideration needs to be given to the automated integration with other existing  platforms.  5.2 GENERAL FEATURES  As identified throughout this study, a shared platform across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary  seems to be an effective solution to the technical challenges highlighted in previous ENISA  reports (ENISA, 2019a). While designing the cooperation platform, there are important technical  aspects that need to be considered. Interoperability, authentication of users and security of  personal data are some of them. A significant aspect that also needs to be considered is the  platform availability, which is ensured at the level of technological infrastructure by various  49 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/business-process- integration/operational-it-processes/itil  FEATURES  Usability, accessibility  (Role-Based Access  Control- RBAC model),  secure architecture - data  security (in transit/at rest);  security by design and by  default, integration with  current tools, workflow  tool, etc. Interoperability  with existing systems  across borders, Ability to  share data with non-EU  based CSIRT/LE entities  (e.g. the U.S. etc.)  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  29  parameters such as network infrastructures that support its operation, software, hardware and  durability - tolerance to risk factors such as power outages, natural disasters, etc.  At this point, there are some initiatives that have already started at EU level e.g. the Horizon  2020 - H202050 project for developing a Lawful evidence collecting & continuity platform  (LOCARD)51. Cross-sharing evidence seems to be also on researchers’ agenda. However, all  the efforts are being done are still in very early stages.  Such a cooperation platform must be built on existing expertise and current developments  within the field. There are plenty of tools available with different features and can be used for  various investigation purposes; this subchapter presents a non-exhaustive list of the features  they have in common.  5.2.1 Security  The platform should provide security and reliability, ensuring the following parameters:   Integrity: it is crucial to ensure that the information has not been tampered. All  communities should be able to use certain datasets, preserving the initial form, while  passing through different “hands”.   Identification, authentication and accountability: As all communities will be working  within the same datasets, they should be able to attribute information to certain  users/institutions. For this purpose, users should be properly identified, authenticated  and a thorough accountability mechanism should be put in place so that every action  performed is traceable.   Confidentiality: All data must remain confidential, assured through the best possible  security measures.   Authorisation and role-based access: Certain institutions might desire to keep certain  datasets confidential or available only to small communities. The platform should allow  authorisation based access as well as role-based access.   Availability: this refers to the availability of information whenever an authorised user  attempts to access it.   Non-repudiation: this is strictly related to accountability.  An example of how a platform should perform is presented below:  A national CSIRT might want to share some Indicators of Compromise (IoC) recently collected  with certain members of the CSIRTs Network. Once the members of the CSIRTs Network have  access, additional information might be added by them to the initial IoC. At some point, enough  data might be available to help LE launch an investigation. At this stage, owners of data  (CSIRTs) might want to authorize certain LE officers to have access to information related to  these incidents. Certain LE might want to open cases based on the initial data and share them  with the other members of the LE community. This could lead to a cross-border case, that would  eventually be followed by a takedown.  The security of the platform requires a complex set of guidelines and rules relating to the  organisation of its administrator and hosting provider, the processes executed, the services  provided, the technical infrastructure available, as well as the legal framework for personal data  protection and security of communications.  50 https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en  51 https://locard.eu/  https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  30  5.2.2 Interoperability  Interoperability refers to the ability to collaborate with different organisations in a homogeneous  and efficient way to achieve common goals. This also involves the ability of two or more  systems to exchange information and then use these information in a useful and meaningful  manner. Interoperability is recognised internationally as one of the most important issues for  achieving efficient operation of information systems in businesses and organisations of all sizes  and industries.  For this situation, interoperability must be assured at the semantic, organizational and technical  layers. The semantic layer has been assured mainly by the work published in 2016 by ENISA  and EUROPOL, on a Common Taxonomy for Law Enforcement and CSIRTs (ENISA  EUROPOL EC3, 2016). Although further work must be done to completely synchronize  terminologies between the two communities, the current taxonomy can provide a satisfactory  level of understanding.  Considering technical interoperability, the aim that is being set is to transfer and use information  in a seamless and efficient way between the parties registered in the platform.  As mentioned in the ENISA report Information sharing and common taxonomies between  CSIRTs and Law Enforcement (ENISA, 2016), although multiple standards exist for the sharing  of information, Structured Threat Intelligence eXpression – STIX52, appears to be the preferred  mechanism for the information exchange between CSIRT and LE communities. As more and  more organisations and vendors support STIX, this seems to be the right choice for such a  platform. In cases where the CSIRT/LE taxonomy does not fit the needs of some constituents,  we can adopt the multi-taxonomy practice. A thorough analysis has to be performed to  determine how many taxonomies/standards have to be supported within the platform.  Organisations might need to implement internal changes as well as to adopt the new  interoperability standards, as some internal processes and procedures might be affected by the  changes. The amount of change needed has to be decided on a case-by-case approach.  At EU level, the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) is a jointly agreed approach to  deliver European public services in an interoperable manner. It offers public administrations  concrete recommendations on how to improve governance of their interoperability activities,  establish cross-organisational relationships, streamline processes supporting end-to-end digital  services, and ensure that both existing and new legislation do not compromise interoperability  efforts53.  5.2.3 Key functionalities  This subchapter will attempt to identify key-shared functionalities that tools must have to  properly accomplish their goals.  Working with digital evidence involves certain measures to be applied, depending on the  operations developed. Accurate collection of logs, not tampering with evidence while collecting  data, correctly identifying the timestamp to correlate different types of events etc. are just a few  items on a long list.  52 https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/  53 https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en  FUNCTIONALITIES  Incident reporting,  evidence management,  anonymisation support,  data analysis capabilities,  visualisations,  investigations cross-  checking and report  production.  https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  31  Like many other digital platforms, the proposed platform will have to follow certain international  standards and other general design features, such as usability, accessibility, interoperability,  security by design and by default, etc.  1. Interoperability: sharing electronic evidence is crucial; however, it must be done in a  way the other parties can read it. Interoperability between platforms and data collecting  tools should be included in the general features of this platform. The platform should also  permit the export data to a certain format, in order to be imported in other tools too.  2. Adherence to international standards: being able to exchange data between parties  means they should be able to understand a common language. Developing an  information-sharing framework or language seems to be one of the key elements. As  discussed by (Biasiotti M. , 2017) currently CybOX, DFAX15 and the Unified Cyber  Ontology (UCO), are the “most suitable standards to represent data and metadata  related to an evidence exchange”. However, these are standards used by LE. CSIRTs  use mainly STIX/TAXII54 standards for exchanging data. A common platform should be  able to understand and translate the different “languages” used by the communities.  3. Preservation of chain of custody: The EVIDENCE55 project developed a proof of  concept application on the digital evidence exchange, which includes support for  maintaining a detailed continuity of evidence (also called a chain of custody). Preserving  the authenticity of evidence collected while transmitted from one entity to another is  crucial. CSIRTs do have more informal methods of collecting data, but LEAs follow many  procedures before acquiring evidence.  4. Accountability: being able to track one’s actions is a necessity, closely linked with the  ability to preserve the chain of custody.  5. Security: being able to preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data  stored and exchanged within the platform is another requirement needs to be  considered.  6. Analytics: this feature allows the thorough analysis of collected data to measure one’s  activity and helps to present statistics on the use of the platform.  5.2.3.1 Incident reporting (ticketing)  A major functionality for the platform is incident reporting and management of the related  “tickets”. Ticketing software converts all incoming reports from multiple channels into tickets. A  ticketing system offers prioritization, tracking and following-up of each case opened in the  system. This can help different entities to communicate better and handle issues more  efficiently. The ticketing software can also provide better statistics on the incident handling  processes.  Therefore, by using a ticketing software, all the data inserted into the platform will be classified  based on tickets/cases. CSIRTs and LE might define and classify cases in a different way.  The platform should allow to ingest data in many forms and organize them according to each  actor’s needs. Data acquired must also be sanitized, so that only pertinent data remain and  collection of irrelevant data to be eliminated.  Current ticketing systems are considered too simple and do not appropriately support large  investigations. The platform should allow for several layers of tickets and regrouping of tickets  into broader folders.  54 https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/  55 http://www.evidenceproject.eu/the-activities/deliverables.html  https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/ http://www.evidenceproject.eu/the-activities/deliverables.html  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  32  5.2.3.2 Evidence management  Management of evidence related to a crime/incident is also of great importance for the  collaborating parties. The platform should provide officials with the ability to track all procedures  regarding digital evidence. The recommended evidence management solution is based on the  data lifecycle stages i.e. the collection, the processing, the storage, the transfer and the  maintenance. The platform must provide a clear insight into the chain of custody for e-evidence.  The final goal is to provide LE and the judiciary with enough evidence to successfully conclude  cybercrime investigations and convict criminals. Evidence management is of utmost importance.  CSIRT processes and procedures might not adhere to the official ones used in court that are  followed by LE and the judiciary.  The platform will have to be supported by a comprehensive framework of data collection and  analysis that will help the involved communities to better manage the evidence.  5.2.3.3 Anonymisation support  Data anonymization is the process in which personally identifiable information, like age, gender,  name, etc., is changed or removed from a set of data so that it would be impossible to  determine the individual the data belongs to. Since the platform will be used by several entities  and will be containing personal data, there is a need for data anonymisation, not only for  security reasons but also to comply with the relative legislation on personal data processing. It  should be noted that anonymised data are not considered personal data, according to the data  protection legislation. Nevertheless, not all cases allow anonymisation and the processing of  personal information may often be necessary for the objectives pursued. In such cases,  pseudonymisation can be used instead. Pseudonymised data still allow for some form of re-  identification of the data subject, while anonymous data do not. Therefore, pseudonymised data  are considered as personal data (Regulation EU 2016/679, recital 26 (Council E. P., 2016a)).  5.2.3.4 Data analysis capabilities, visualisations  Data analysis is the process of transforming raw data into usable information, in order to add  value to the statistical output56. It is different from data visualisation that involves the visual  representation of data, ranging from single charts to comprehensive dashboards. Effective  visualisations significantly reduce the amount of time it takes for someone to process  information and access valuable insights. The platform should provide these types of  functionalities to facilitate the cooperation and interaction across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary.  5.2.3.5 Investigations cross-checking  The platform should be facilitating investigations crosschecking. Investigators and other officials  will be able to identify relationships among people, objects, modi operanti, etc. Thus,  investigation of cases will be easier, while at the same time, de-confliction will be available.  Nevertheless, it is important that the platform to be linked to different sources of data, held by  several entities on their systems.  5.2.3.6 Generated reports  Another very useful functionality of the platform is the automatic generation of reports, during an  investigation or once thesis completed. The reports produced should be customisable and  shareable with the concerned stakeholders. A report could include technical, strategic or other  types of details, depending on who the recipient is. Thus, its content should be easily  understood by the reader and include only information for the specified purposes.  56 https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=2973  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  33  5.2.3.7 Information sharing  The core functionality of such a common platform is the information sharing capability. The  entities need to be able to share information, in a controlled and secure way. Access to  information should be regulated according to the “need-to-know” basis, always in accordance  with the existing legislation.  For achieving the abovementioned objective, different kinds of limitations that might affect the  sharing process has to be taken into account. Even if CSIRTs might be able to share all kinds of  data, LE and judiciary investigations might contain classified data, which cannot be shared with  other communities.  In this respect, it becomes important for the platform to have access restriction capabilities.  Access should be allowed at user or group level. At the same time, sharing and access policy  should be established.  A classification scheme should be put in place to accommodate requirements from all involved  communities. CSIRTs usually use the Traffic Light Protocol - TLP protocol57, while LE and the  judiciary might rely a lot on classified information.  Information sharing should be done at community level (e.g. CSIRTs only) or organizational  level (some CSIRTs and some LEAs). This means the platform should have role-based, group-  based and individual-based sharing capabilities.  5.2.3.8 Access management  The platform should finally provide IT managers with tools and technologies for controlling user  access to critical information, defining and managing the roles and access privileges of  individual network users as well as the circumstances under which users are granted (or  denied) those privileges.  The platform should implement a clear Segregation of Duties (SoD), by disseminating the tasks  and associated privileges for specific processes among multiple people aiming to prevent and  detect errors and irregularities (ISACA, 2019). An indicative example of SoD is provided by  ENISA in form of a matrix (see E ANNEX: SOD MATRIX)  The platform should have strong access management capability as well as strong  authentication in place (e.g. at least two factor authentication). The platform should be able to  define individual users along with user groups or even organisations units (institutions or  communities). Access logs should be widely available, providing details on the user’s actions  within the platform.  57 https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp  https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  34  6. CONCLUSIONS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  6.1 CONCLUSIONS  6.1.1 Filling in the gaps  In this study, we have estimated the degree of maturity of the technical cooperation across  CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary throughout the lifecycle of cybercrime investigation. The main  takeaway is that all three communities are mature, with their own well-established processes in  place and have identified, adopted or developed the proper tools for performing their duties.  The CSIRT community has proven, by far, to be the most sophisticated and flexible in terms of  tools. Members of the community have identified a broad range of tools (either commercial or  open-source), for different kinds of tasks and the more mature members have also taken the  lead in developing certain tools and making them available for the whole community (e.g.  MISP). Steps are being taken currently, at EU level, for enhancing technical cooperation and  the exchange of information among members, via the development of an EU level cooperation  platform (MeliCERTes).  The survey has shown that LE rely heavily on a variety of tools during the stages of cybercrime  investigation. As their job and goals are very specific, it is not a surprise that the same or similar  tools are used by LE across the EU. Nevertheless, due to the fact that the tasks of LE are  related to judicial procedures, LEAs do not have the same flexibility and freedom as the CSIRT  community to use in-house developed tools or even open-source tools. Tools used by LEAs  should provide an adequate level of assurance, so that collected evidence could be admissible  in court.  However, survey responses did indicate notable cooperation between the two communities  however without the use of dedicated tools. Basic tools for communication and information  exchange, such as emails and telephone, are usually used. There are though, several  examples within the Member States, where well-established cooperation mechanisms and tools  are put in place at national level.  Despite the fact that judicial authorities had not provided feedback in the online survey, based  on the results presented in a previous ENISA report (ENISA, 2019a), it had been highlighted  that there is cooperation between LE and the judiciary, while CSIRTs have direct cooperation  with prosecutors and judges, only when CSIRT experts are called as witnesses in court.  6.1.2 Analysing the necessity of a common platform  It is more than obvious that all three communities have different roles within the cybercrime  investigation lifecycle. Nevertheless, reducing cybercrime and its consequences is the desired  outcome for all actors involved. This leads to the conclusion that the parties should strengthen  their cooperation and aim for a faster and more efficient response.  CSIRT community has taken serious steps towards improving inter-CSIRT cooperation in the  EU. Platforms such as MeliCERTes will improve cooperation and incident response across the  EU. The LE community has also taken similar steps to improve LE interagency cooperation  within the EU, through platforms such as SIENA and SIRIUS, hosted by Europol.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  35  The new Regulation proposal regarding European Production and Preservation Orders for  electronic evidence in criminal matters (European Commission, 2018), represents also a big  step forward in harmonising the way information is exchanged in criminal investigations.  All prerequisites leading to successful cooperation across the three communities appear to be in  place. Building a common platform for these three communities that are actively involved in the  cybercrime investigation lifecycle phases should be an important next step to consider at the  policy level. At least, as a start, effort should be directed into drafting the required functionalities  and the technical specifications for designing and subsequently developing such a platform.  When drafting the technical specifications of this platform, all the requirements the communities  have should be considered.  6.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  Some recommendations are proposed for the relevant stakeholders.  6.2.1 Recommendations for ENISA and possibly EUROPOL EC3 and EUROJUST   To closely monitor the developments within the area and support involved parties in  achieving the desired level of technical cooperation.   To consider and promote the adoption of a common digital forensic framework.   To assess the suitability of EU cybersecurity certification framework for cybercrime  investigation tools and services.   To drive efforts towards the development of a common platform, considering all  requirements and constraints expressed by the communities.   To facilitate the sharing of experience at strategic and operational cooperation across the  three communities.   To promote the use of Segregation (or separation) of Duties (SoD) matrices to avoid  overlapping duties across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary in relation to the sharing  information.  6.2.2 Recommendations for CSIRTs   To highlight specific services that can be delivered to LE.   To identify specific requirements that LE and the judiciary might have, in terms of  cooperation at national level, and try to accommodate by providing the necessary  information to them.   To discuss and consider the adoption of a common digital forensic framework.   To develop CSIRT specific requirements for a common cooperation platform.  6.2.3 Recommendations for LE   To develop EU and national level requirements for the CSIRT community, on what types  of information provided by CSIRTs can be useful for LE, throughout the cybercrime  investigation lifecycle.   To discuss and consider the adoption of a common digital forensic framework.   To develop LE specific requirements for a common cooperation platform.  6.2.4 Recommendations for the judiciary   To develop EU level requirements for the CSIRT and the LE community, on what data  can be useful and how to exchange it properly.   To develop evidence collection and management rules in order the digital records to be  admissible in court.   To develop specific requirements for a common cooperation platform.

It is a  community-driven initiative called IHAP (Incident Handling Automation  Project) which was conceptually designed by European CERTs during  several information security events. Its main goal is to give to incident  responders an easy way to collect and process threat intelligence thus  improving the incident handling processes of CERTs. (ENISA, 2019b)  Mattermost Mattermost is an open-source messaging platform that enables secure  team collaboration. (Mattermost, 2019)  Malware Information  Sharing Platform (MISP)  MISP is a free and open-source software helping information sharing of  threat intelligence including cybersecurity indicators.  A threat intelligence platform for gathering, sharing, storing and  correlating IoC of targeted attacks, threat intelligence, financial fraud  information, vulnerability information or even counter-terrorism  information.” (MISP, 2019)  OpenPGP OpenPGP is a non-proprietary protocol for encrypting email  communication using public-key cryptography. It is based on the original  PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) software. The OpenPGP protocol defines  standard formats for encrypted messages, signatures, and certificates  for exchanging public keys. (OpenPGP, 2019)  Role-Based Access  Control (RBAC)  RBAC is access control based on user roles (i.e., a collection of access  authorizations a user receives based on an explicit or implicit  assumption of a given role). Role permissions may be inherited through  a role hierarchy and typically reflect the permissions needed to perform  defined functions within an organization. A given role may apply to a  single individual or to several individuals. (NIST, 2019)  Request Tracker for  Incident Response  (RTIR)  RTIR builds on all the features of RT and provides pre-configured  queues and workflows designed for incident response teams. It is the  tool of choice for many CERT and CSIRT teams all over the globe. RTIR  has tools to correlate key data from incident reports, both from people  and automated tools, to find patterns and link multiple incident reports  with a common root cause incident. (Best Practical, 2019)  The Secure Information  Exchange Network  Application (SIENA)  SIENA is a state-of-the-art platform that meets the communication needs  of EU law enforcement. The platform enables the swift and user-friendly  exchange of operational and strategic crime-related information among:  - Europol’s liaison officers,  - Analysts and experts  - Member States third parties with which Europol has cooperation  agreements. (Europol, 2019)  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  44  SIRIUS The SIRIUS project was created by Europol in October 2017 as a  response to the increasing need of the EU law enforcement community  to access electronic evidence for internet-based investigations, as more  than half of all criminal investigations today include a cross-border  request to access electronic evidence (such as texts, e-mails or  messaging apps). The SIRIUS project, spearheaded by Europol’s  European Counter-Terrorism Centre and European Cybercrime Centre,  in close partnership with Eurojust and the European Judicial Network,  aims to help investigators cope with the complexity and the volume of  information in a rapidly changing online environment, by providing  guidelines on specific Online Service Providers (OSPs) and investigative  tools; and sharing experiences with peers, both online and in person.  Through continued collaboration with Eurojust and the European Judicial  Network, the SIRIUS project is now also open to judicial authorities. The  multidisciplinary SIRIUS community on the restricted platform on the  Europol Platform for Experts has access to a wide range of resources,  updated continually. (EUROPOL, 2019)  Structured Threat  Intelligence eXpression  (STIX)  STIX is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber  threat intelligence (CTI). enables organizations to share CTI with one  another in a consistent and machine-readable manner, allowing security  communities to better understand what computer-based attacks they are  most likely to see and to anticipate and/or respond to those attacks  faster and more effectively. (OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence Technical  Committee (CTI TC), 2019)  Threema Threema is ‘an end-to-end encrypted instant messaging application for  iOS, Android and Windows Phone. In addition to text messaging, users  can make voice calls, send multimedia, locations, voice messages and  files‘. (Threema, 2019)  Taranis Taranis is a software to structure information from various sources about  vulnerabilities. It scans the internet for texts about digital threats and  vulnerabilities in software, hardware, and operating systems. (NCSC-NL,  2019)  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  45  C ANNEX: OPERATION  AVALANCHE & ANDROMEDA  BOTNET TAKEDOWN  An example of joint action and cooperation among several entities around the world was the  takedown of the Andromeda botnet (also known as Gamarue), which took place on 29th  November 2017. It is still considered today as a significant dismantling of the longest-running  malware families. The case included not only cooperation between the public and private  sector, but also coordinated actions among LEAs, judicial authorities and CSIRTs.  According to Microsoft research, Andromeda’s goal was to distribute almost 80 malware  families. Within a period of six months, it was detected that an average of over 1 million  machines were blocked every month.  Earlier in 2016, after several years of investigation, judicial and LE authorities from Germany,  United States of America, along with Europol, Eurojust and other partners had dismantled the  international criminal infrastructure Avalanche, which was used, among others, as a delivery  platform to launch and manage mass global malware attacks such as Andromeda.  While preparing the Avalanche joint action, the German Cybersecurity Authority, the Federal  Office for Information Security (BSI) and the Fraunhofer-Institut für Kommunikation,  Informationsverarbeitung und Ergonomie (FKIE) analysed over 130 TB of captured data and  helped identifying the server structure of the botnet, allowing for the shutdown of thousands of  servers and, effectively, the collapse of the entire criminal network. During the Avalanche  Operation, 5 individuals were arrested, 37 premises were searched, and 39 servers were  seized. Abuse notifications were sent in relation to over 200 compromised servers. Victims of  malware infections were identified in over 180 countries. Avalanche was a remediation  operation as well as a LE operation. The main effect was to sanitize German cyberspace from  the Avalanche botnet but apart from the German victims, feeds with sinkholed data were sent to  CSIRT teams all over the world in order to do victim mitigation.  The dismantling of Andromeda was heavily based on knowledge and intelligence gained during  the Avalanche case by LE, combined with the intelligence provided by private-sector partners.  Europol played a coordination role in both operations.  Thus, on November 29th 2017, the United States of America Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI), in close cooperation with the Luneburg Central Criminal Investigation Inspectorate in  Germany, Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), the Joint Cybercrime Action Task  Force (J-CAT), Eurojust and private sector partners, took jointly action against servers and  domains, which were used to spread the Andromeda malware.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  46  According to Europol 1500 domains of the malicious software were sinkholed, while according  to Microsoft58, during 48 hours of sinkholing59, approximately 2 million unique Andromeda victim  IP addresses from 223 countries were seized.  In parallel, sinkhole measures were necessary, across several countries (both EU and non-EU),  as globally 55 per cent of the computer systems originally infected in Avalanche were still  infected at the time of the joint action. This was the part where CSIRTs were involved in the  operation. When sinkholing is employed at a 100% scale, infected computers can no longer  reach the criminal C&C computer systems and criminals can therefore no longer control the  infected computers. After the operation, the victims’ computers communicated with the LE  servers instead of the attackers C&C. The feeds with victim information (geo-localized IP  address and timestamp) were sent to the responsible national CSIRT in an automatic manner in  order to do further victim mitigation at national level. In this way, the sinkholing infrastructure  captures victims’ IP addresses, which can subsequently be used for notification and follow-up  through dissemination to National CSIRTs and network owners.  In terms of regulatory instruments, the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) process was  used and not the European Investigation Order (EIO).  During the preparation of the Operation Avalanche and the Andromeda botnet takedown,  according to the representative of EC3, the collaborating partners used to have conference calls  every week, with a duration of an average of 2 hours. Communication was based on PGP  channels. Secure information exchange channels were used between LE representatives. It can  be easily understood that private partners are not allowed to have access to certain LE tools for  coordinating the case.  As key cooperation challenge in both cases has been identified, the not well-structured  communication among the public and private partners, LE, judicial authorities and CSIRTs.  Therefore, the need for a coordination platform has been highlighted; its key functionalities  should include:   Information sharing;   Tasking for not overlapping others’ duties and for better monitoring;   Discussion groups; real-time communication is of great importance too;   Sharing of tactics followed; it should be noted that efforts are being done for  developing a manual with best practices;   Capability of creating investigation (user) groups with access rights to certain types of  information.  Furthermore, user-friendliness and accessibility are very important features for a collaboration  platform.  Finally, the security aspect should be considered when designing such a platform as well as  respecting the relevant legislation on personal data protection.  In conclusion, the Andromeda botnet takedown was a significant example of international law  enforcement working together with judicial authorities, CSIRTs and industry partners to identify  the most significant cybercriminals and the dedicated infrastructure they use to distribute  malware on a global scale.  58 https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/12/04/microsoft-teams-up-with-law-enforcement-and-other-partners-to- disrupt-gamarue-andromeda/  59 Sinkholing is an action whereby traffic between infected computers and a criminal infrastructure is redirected to servers  controlled by law enforcement authorities and/or an IT security company.  https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/12/04/microsoft-teams-up-with-law-enforcement-and-other-partners-to-disrupt-gamarue-andromeda/ https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/12/04/microsoft-teams-up-with-law-enforcement-and-other-partners-to-disrupt-gamarue-andromeda/  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  47  D ANNEX: NO MORE  RANSOM  The No More Ransom (NMR)60 initiative could be characterized as an “alternative” and  innovative way of cooperation among LE, CSIRTs, public and private partners. The NMR portal  has helped more than 200.000 victims of ransomware to recover their files free of charge since  it was first launched in July 2016. More than 3 million individual visitors from over 188 countries  have accessed the portal looking for information or for a specific solution to their ransomware  infection61.  More specifically, NMR is an initiative by Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), the  National High-Tech Crime Unit of the Netherlands’ police, Kaspersky Lab and McAfee to help  victims of ransomware to retrieve their encrypted data without having to pay to the criminals.  Ransomware has been around for a number of years and victims are forced to either pay a  ransom or lose their files.  Victims of ransomware can visit the following portal: https://nomoreransom.org, upload samples  of their encrypted files and check if there are available decryption tools for the malware family  that infected their systems. After a quick assessment by the ‘Crypto Sheriff’, if the appropriate  decryption tool is available the victim is prompted to the guidelines to download the tool and  recover their data. Victims’ data are not stored or shared with third parties; the information is  deleted as soon as the assessment is performed.  By restoring access to their infected systems free of charge, the partnership provides users with  a third choice they did not have before, as it counts with more than 90 tools capable of  decrypting over 120 different types of ransomware families62. The tools are provided at the  discretion of the NMR partners.  The NMR portal, initially released in English, is available in 35 other languages.  The initiative is the first public-private partnership of its kind. It is based on the cooperation  between more than 150 partners and it is recognized globally as an excellent effort on  cybercrime remediation since some $108 million profit have been prevented from going to the  pockets of criminals. 42 LEAs, 5 EU Agencies and 101 public and private entities have joined  this project since 2016.  Since the launch of the portal, Politie Police (Belgium), Politia Romana (Romania), Police  Nationale (France) and CERT Polska (Poland), together with other eleven private companies,  have contributed to the development of new unique decryption tools. These tools are presented  in the NMR portal and are available to the public through the related websites.  Many other LEAs and CSIRTs “kindly offer their time and resources to help promote NMR at the  national and international level”.  60 www.nomoreransom.org  61 https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/no-more-ransom-108-million-reasons-to-celebrate-its-third-anniversary  62 https://www.europol.europa.eu/publications-documents/infographic-3rd-anniversary-no-more-ransom  https://nomoreransom.org/ http://www.nomoreransom.org/ https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/no-more-ransom-108-million-reasons-to-celebrate-its-third-anniversary https://www.europol.europa.eu/publications-documents/infographic-3rd-anniversary-no-more-ransom  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  48  The objectives of the NMR project is neither the remediation nor cybercrime prevention.

Collaboration between Computer Security Incident Response Teams  (CSIRTs) and Law Enforcement (LE) is the key to find such information and fighting cybercrime.  A number of attacks that recently hit critical sectors brought about an increased level of  cooperation, partly out of necessity; Wannacry (ENISA, 2017a) and ‘NotPetya’ (an updated  version of Petya) attacks (Europol, 2017a) being the most recent examples.  As mentioned in the Council Note of 31 May 2017 Cybersecurity - Information from the  Commission (Council, EU, 2017), “Conclusions drawn from the WannaCry attack include the  need for CSIRTs, LE authorities and the private sector to work together and the need for LE  authorities to have right tools to investigate these types of crimes and to prosecute criminals”.  The technical aspects, including tools and methodologies used, are an important component of  the cooperation. This report aims to support the cooperation between CSIRTs - in particular,  national and governmental, LE and the judiciary – in particular, prosecutors and judges, in their  fight against cybercrime, by providing information on the technical aspects of the cooperation,  identifying current shortcomings, and formulating and proposing recommendations to enhance  their technical cooperation. Moreover, this report introduces some use cases to present the  interaction among the different actors and the methodology and the tools used when CSIRTs,  LE and the judiciary cooperate for responding to cybercrime.  The data for this report has been collected by means of desk research and an online survey.  The data collected identified a shared platform across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary to be an  effective solution to the technical challenges highlighted in previous ENISA reports. While  designing the cooperation platform, there are important technical aspects that need to be  considered. Interoperability, authentication of users and security of personal data are some of  them. In addition, the platform should always be available, which is ensured at the level of  technological infrastructure by various parameters such as network infrastructures that support  its operation, software, hardware and durability - tolerance to risk factors such as power outages  and natural disasters.  It is generally accepted that there is a reciprocal understanding of the needs between CSIRT  and LE communities; however, information sharing between these communities occurs on an  ad-hoc basis rather than in a systematic manner.  At this point, there are many international initiatives started, some at EU level and some outside  the EU. Cross-sharing evidence seems to be on everyone’s agenda, although we all seem to be  in very early stages.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  6  There are plenty of tools available, belonging to different categories or having different features.  Thus, a cooperation platform should be built taking into account the different functionalities and  features of current tools and developments within the field  Core recommendations of this report on the development of a shared platform to improve  cooperation between CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary include:   ENISA and possibly EUROPOL EC3 and EUROJUST: to drive efforts towards the  development of a common platform, considering all requirements and constraints  expressed by the communities.   CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary with the support of ENISA and possibly EUROPOL EC3 and  EUROJUST: to work together towards a better mutual understanding of the strengths,  needs and limitations of the three communities in relation to the sharing information.   CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary with the support of ENISA and EUROPOL EC3: to facilitate  the sharing of experience at strategic and operational cooperation.   ENISA and possibly EUROPOL EC3 and EUROJUST: to promote the use of Segregation  (or separation) of Duties (SoD) matrices to avoid overlapping duties across CSIRTs, LE  and the judiciary in relation to the sharing information.   CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary with the support of ENISA and EUROPOL EC3: to develop  EU as well as national level requirements for their communities, on what types of  information can be useful from their own perspectives, throughout the cybercrime  investigation lifecycle.   ENISA and possibly EUROPOL EC3 and EUROJUST: to consider and promote the  adoption of a common digital forensics framework and CSIRTs and LE: to discuss and  consider the adoption of it.   ENISA and possibly EUROPOL EC3 and EUROJUST: to assess the suitability of EU  cybersecurity certification framework for cybercrime investigation tools.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  7  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 PURPOSE  Collecting information on current cooperation across CSIRT, LE and the judiciary communities  is a key step to enhance it. In 2019, the ENISA Roadmap on the cooperation between CSIRTs  and LE (ENISA, 2019d) also highlighted the importance of the technical cooperation across the  three communities; the purpose of this report is to better apprehend the technical aspects of the  cooperation and challenges lying ahead.  This report analyses the tools used and tools required by various countries when cooperating in  order to better manage the cybersecurity incidents, identifies the key technical challenges that  prevent or limit effective cooperation, and looks for common tools through which cooperation  can be strengthened and further enhanced.  Importantly, ENISA aims at using this report as a guidance to plan its policy support activities in  the forthcoming period of its annual work programme planning.  1.2 BACKGROUND TO THE REPORT  The ENISA programming document 2019-2021 includes ‘Objective 4.2. CSIRT and other NIS  community building’. Under this objective, ‘Output O.4.2.2 — Support the fight against  cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and LEA’ has the goal to continue supporting the  cooperation between the CSIRT and the law-enforcement communities and the extensions that  this collaboration may have to the judiciary. (ENISA, 2018, p. 53).  This report is a continuation of previous ENISA work, and it contributes to the implementation of  the ENISA programming document 2019-2021, Output O.4.2.2, in particular to what is planned  as project activities under Scenario 2.  1.3 REPORT OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE  1.3.1 Report objectives  The main objective of this report is:   To support collaboration across CSIRTs, in particular, national and governmental, LE,  prosecutors and judges.  1.3.2 Report scope  The report focuses on cooperation between national/governmental CSIRTs, LE and the  judiciary, although most considerations made are largely applicable to CSIRTs in general (i.e.  other than national/governmental CSIRTs).  The geographical coverage is limited to the EU (European Union, 2019) and EFTA (EFTA,  n.d.)1. (See also (ENISA, 2015a). This does not mean however that all these countries are  covered in the report and that no reference to other countries outside the EU and EFTA is  made. Possible specific differences among the EU and EFTA, or between the EU and the  United States, or the EU and Asia, also fall outside the scope of this report. This report does not  seek to provide an exhaustive analysis, but rather focus on a small number of topics influencing  1 In this report ‘n.d.’ stands for ‘no date’ and it is used in the references when no date could be found for the cited source.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  8  cooperation as it might become of interest for cross border investigations; hence, the  geographic scoping is essential to remain limited to the EU only.  The report does not target a specific sector; considerations made can apply to cooperation  between CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary to fight against cybercrime in all sectors (from finance to  energy, from transport to health).  This report does not aim to present an exhaustive set of tools for cooperation across CSIRTs,  LE and the judiciary; rather it seeks to facilitate the drawing of meaningful conclusions and  recommendations for further enhancing their technical cooperation and interaction.  1.4 TARGET AUDIENCE  The intended target audience are CSIRTs (mainly national and governmental CSIRTs but not  limited to them) LE, prosecutors, judges, as well as individuals and organisations with an  interest in Cybersecurity.  For the purposes of this report, the definition of each community is listed below:   Computer security incident response team (CSIRT) or computer emergency  response team (CERT) is ‘an organisation that studies computer and network security  to provide incident response services to victims of attacks, publish alerts concerning  vulnerabilities and threats, and […] offer other information to help improve computer and  network security’. At present, ‘both terms (CERT and CSIRT) are used in a synonymous  manner, with CSIRT being the more precise term’ (ENISA, 2015a, p. 7) (ENISA, 2015b,  p. 12) (ENISA, 2016b, p. 10). Governmental CSIRTs are teams whose constituency are  the public administration networks (ENISA, 2015c);   Law enforcement (LE), police and police agencies are terms used in this report are  synonymous and used to refer to police and police agencies, also used as synonymous.  LE is “any public authority competent for the prevention, investigation, detection or  prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the  safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security” (Council E. P.,  2016c);   Judiciary refers both to prosecutors and judges (a similar approach taken in (Council,  EU, 2017). Prosecutor refers ‘a legal official who accuses someone of committing a  crime, especially in a [criminal] law court’ (Cambridge Dictionary, n.d.). Judge refers to a  person who is in charge of a court of law and who makes final decisions.  Additionally, policy and lawmakers may benefit from select aspects of analysis as well as the  recommendations of this report, as they prepare policies and legislation for enhancing the  cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction with the judiciary.  http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-12711-2017-INIT/en/pdf  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  9  2. METHODOLOGY  2.1 DESK RESEARCH  Initially, desk research was conducted based on publicly available information sources,  including ENISA publications.  Supplementary desk research was conducted to address certain specific topics that the project  team deemed appropriate to examine in more depth following the analysis of the data collected  via the online survey.  2.2 ONLINE SURVEY  An online survey was conducted to collect data to validate and further substantiate some  findings. It was composed of 25 questions (see Annex D of the Roadmap on the cooperation  between CSIRTs and LE— Questions in the online survey (ENISA, 2019d, p. 86)), most of them  with closed answers and some with the possibility to add additional comments and provide more  details related to the answers.  The survey was developed using EUSurvey2, a survey tool that is ‘supported by the European  Commission’s ISA programme, which promotes interoperability solutions for European public  administrations’ (European Commission, n.d. b).  The invitation to complete the survey was disseminated via:   A closed ENISA mailing list of European national and governmental CSIRTs.   A Europol mailing list of the European Union Cybercrime Task Force (EUCTF), which is  composed of the heads of the designated national cybercrime units throughout the EU  Member States and Europol. The EUCTF3 is an interagency group formed to allow the  heads of National Cybercrime Units of EU member states, Iceland, Norway and  Switzerland, along with representatives from  Europol, CEPOL, the European  Commission and Eurojust to discuss the strategic and operational issues related to  cybercrime investigations and prosecutions within the EU and beyond (Council, EU,  2017b, p. 13).  The survey was launched in June 2019 and was open for around 2 weeks. The data collected  via the online survey was used to validate the data collected through the desk research.  A total of 33 replies4 were received, of these, 32 were from EU Member States (European  Union, n.d.) and EFTA countries (EFTA, n.d.) and 1 from a non-EU/non-EFTA country. It must  be noted that the reply from non-EU/non-EFTA country was somewhat in line with the other  replies received and has been used to formulate general considerations.  2 https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/home/welcome  3 In execution of the JHA Council conclusions of 27-28 November 2008 and of the 26 April 2010, Europol together with the  European Commission and the EU Member States have set up the European Union cybercrime task force (EUCTF)  composed of the Heads of the designated national cybercrime units throughout the EU Member States and Europol. The  EUCTF is an interagency group formed to allow the Heads of Cybercrime Units, Europol, the European Commission and  Eurojust to discuss the strategic and operational issues related to cybercrime investigations and prosecutions within the  EU and beyond.  4 ENISA is not privy of the exact number of recipients of the Europol list. The ENISA mailing list is approximately 63.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  10  Figure 1: Overview of communities of respondents to the online survey  Of the 32 EU and EFTA respondents, 10 respondents were from the CSIRT community, 21 from  the LE community and 1 belonged to both of these communities.  2.2.1 Data used to develop the recommendations  The recommendations in Chapter 6, have been developed based on research findings and the  results of this report.  2.3 CONTRIBUTION BY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS  ENISA selected five external subject-matter experts from the list of NIS experts compiled  following the ENISA CEI5 (Ref. ENISA M-CEI-17-T01) (ENISA, n.d.).  Three of them contributed to this report by supporting the data collection and the drafting while  two were reviewers. The two CEI experts contributing as reviewers reviewed this report in  several rounds including the first draft in September 2019, an intermediate draft in early October  2019, and the final draft in late October 2019. They reviewed it in addition to ENISA reviewers  and other external reviewers.  All five experts contributed ad personam.  These experts contributed inter alia with their expertise in Network and Information Security  (NIS) aspects of cybercrime, including but not limited to CSIRT and law enforcement  cooperation, operational cooperation, information sharing to handle incidents and to fight  against cybercrime.  5 The ENISA CEI list comprises of experts in various NIS subject-matters that have been selected according to a procedure  in line with the ENISA financial regulation; these experts are called upon by ENISA from time to time to support the Agency  in carrying out its operational duties.

TOOLS USED IN THE CYBERCRIME  INVESTIGATION LIFECYCLE  This chapter aims at outlining the similarities and differences of the most common and  recognised tools used by CSIRTs and LE during the whole lifecycle of a cybercrime  investigation. As the roles of CSIRTs and LE are not the same, some tools may be used by  CSIRTs, some others from LE and some by both communities. The goal is to enumerate the  main tools or tool categories/types used by both communities, at the same time providing as  many examples as possible.  3.1 MAIN TOOLS USED IN CYBERCRIME INVESTIGATION LIFECYCLE  In general, the cycle of investigation starts when the authorities, CSIRTs, Law Enforcement  Agencies (LEAs) or judicial authorities become aware that a cybersecurity incident or a  cybercrime has taken place. This information may reach the authorities from multiple sources,  e.g. a report from a victim (individual or representative of a legal entity), monitoring of online  illegal activities by officials, information published on the media, information from CSIRTs or a  LEA of another country, etc.  Figure 2: Incident handling process flow  Source: “ENISA Good Practice Guide for Incident Management”:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practice-guide-for-incident-management  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practice-guide-for-incident-management  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  12  A first responder, that may need to visit the ‘crime scene’, should take the appropriate measures  to secure the scene, use appropriate tools and collect any available digital evidence, always  following lawful procedures, according to the country’s legislation (ENISA, 2019c).  After the first response, a thorough investigation needs to take place by an investigator, in order  to get the full extent of the criminal activity, identify the victims, the damages and any losses,  find the real identities of the perpetrators and any others involved in the crime. Tools for  analysis and investigation are used in this phase.  To fully understand the crime that has been committed, the investigators firstly must collect  information from multiple sources, e.g. interviews with the victim(s), requests to Internet Service  Providers (ISPs), etc. They will possibly need to exchange information and cooperate with  authorities from other countries, using tools for cooperation and secure communication. They  may also need to deal with information in digital form, applying digital forensics techniques and  tools in any seized equipment (e.g. collected during a search at a suspect’s house). After all this  information is collected, it must be analysed, so that the investigator identifies the perpetrator(s),  based on the evidence.  The final step of the investigation is bringing the case to justice (if the action was taken by LE)  or taking any other appropriate measures to remediate the incident (if any action was taken by  CSIRTs), using specific tools for remediation.  The following sections, although not exclusive, outline the possible phases followed in an  incident response/ cybercrime investigation (ENISA, 2010) (SANS, 2019), (CREST, 2019). In  brief, the report will present:   Tools for reporting;   Tools for evidence collection;   Tools for analysis and investigation;   Tools for remediation;   Tools for coordination and information sharing;   Tools for secure communication.  3.2 TOOLS FOR REPORTING  Reporting is the first step within the cybercrime investigation lifecycle. CSIRTs and LE become  aware, by different sources (open-source intelligence, monitoring services, reports of citizens,  reports of IT administrator of companies etc.) of cybersecurity incidents that have taken place. It  should be noted that not all cybersecurity incidents are cybercrimes (so LE do not need to be  informed) and not all cybercrimes are considered cybersecurity incidents (so CSIRTs do not  need to be informed). This means that CSIRTs and LE do not always have the same interest in  incidents or investigations, which also affects the way they further handle each case.  Nevertheless, there are cases that may interest both CSIRTs and LE, so the need still exists for  information exchange. Reporting is also important to avoid duplication of efforts and resources  by CSIRTs and LE working on the same case (evidence collection, analysis, etc.). Reporting  could be considered as part of the information sharing process.  Regarding the reporting to the judiciary, due to the role of the CSIRT community, direct  reporting from CSIRTs to the judiciary is rare (ENISA, 2019a). It is generally accepted that there  is communication, on the one side, between LE and the judiciary and, on the other side,  between CSIRTs and LE. This means that there is an indirect communication between CSIRTs  and the judiciary, via LEAs. CSIRTs typically support LE during the investigation of an alleged  cybercrime. Cybersecurity incidents can be a source of illicit activities harbouring cybercrime.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  13  The judicial authorities in several Member States direct the investigations for cybercrime.  From the answers provided by the participants in the online survey, there are no common tools  for reporting and communication between CSIRTs and LE. The most traditional way of reporting  is via email and telephone calls. Especially in urgent cases, direct contact between people is the  most efficient way of communication.  Secure communication channels are also of great  importance and for this reason, largely PGP solutions are used.  A need for using a common language with terms that can be easily understood had been  highlighted by the three communities (ENISA, 2017, p. 38); hence, a common taxonomy has  been created, namely ‘Common Taxonomy for Law Enforcement and The National Network of  CSIRTs’6, and it is used by CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary. The objective of the document  created is to “support the CSIRTs and the public prosecutors in their dealing with LE in cases of  criminal investigations, by providing a common taxonomy for the classification of incidents”.  3.3 TOOLS FOR EVIDENCE COLLECTION  Evidence is perhaps the most important aspect of an investigation. Digital evidence has its own  life cycle and digital forensics is an enormous modern scientific sector. CSIRTs, LE and the  judiciary are interested in evidence collection, each community from their own standpoint.  Evidence collection is important in order to identify, prosecute and convict criminals. LE handle  and examine digital evidence with the purpose of further presenting their findings in court. On  the contrary, CSIRTs’ purpose when handling digital evidence is to identify the source of the  cyber-attack, its effects and its consequences as fast as possible. Although evidence collection  seems to be mostly a LE specific activity, CSIRTs can also offer assistance in this area.  According to the online survey results, various digital forensic techniques are used for collecting  evidence; the most frequently used are the following:   Memory forensics;   Network forensics;   Cloud forensics;   Computer forensics;   Mobile forensics;   IoT forensics;   OSINT (Twitter analysis, web crawling etc.);   TOR browser forensics (TOR network research, TOR nodes analysis etc.);   Darknet forensics [Darknet website enumeration, Tools research (GPG tools, databases),  etc.];   Physical forensics (physical evidence).  6 https://www.europol.europa.eu/publications-documents/common-taxonomy-for-law-enforcement-and-csirts  https://www.europol.europa.eu/publications-documents/common-taxonomy-for-law-enforcement-and-csirts  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  14  Figure 3: Replies to Question 10 of the online survey  For the above-mentioned techniques, the respondents identified the use of several different  tools either commercial or free or open-source or developed in-house. The major issue with  evidence collection is the admissibility in criminal prosecutions. This means that someone can  collect evidence using many different tools, simple or more complicated, commercial or open-  source. It is important, though, especially for LE to collect evidence that will be admissible to the  judicial procedures and in front of a court. From a CSIRT perspective, what is of great  importance is the timing to collect evidence, so any tool can be used, even those developed in-  house if it supports the normal activities of a CSIRT.  Some weaknesses of such tools have been highlighted by the participants of the online survey  and are presented below:   Slow speed of tools: this is also related to the evolution of disc/memory spaces;   Rapid growth of tools: this means that tools get outdated very quickly;   High cost of commercial tools: this could be an issue for certain LEAs, and need to be  addressed by the seller;   Limited options and functionalities of some tools: in addition to that, not all the tools  support all the operating systems.  9%  13%  13%  13%  16%  22%  31%  34%  50%  50%  53%  75%  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80%  Other  IoT forensics  Darknet forensics  No answer provided  TOR browser forensics  Digital forensics and Blockchain  Physical forensics  Mobile forensics  Network forensics  Digital forensics and OSINT  Memory forensics  Computer forensics  Replies  10. How the investigations are carried out? Which is the most common used forensic  technique?  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  15  3.4 TOOLS FOR ANALYSIS AND INVESTIGATION  On the one hand, LE investigate cybercrime in order to identify the people who are involved in  criminal activities and bring them to justice. Once evidence is collected, it must be analysed to  provide useful information or intelligence for LE and prosecution authorities. On the other hand,  CSIRTs analyse the evidence for the purpose of mitigating cyber threats and protecting the  infrastructure and data of an organisation.  The analysis is performed based on the evidence collected. There are traditional analysis  techniques and tools that can be used by analysts during an investigation of any type of crime.  During the analysis phase, the analyst looks for relationships among entities, sequences of  events, movement of money, narcotics, stolen goods or other commodities, activities involved in  a criminal operation, etc.  According to the respondents, for analysis purposes, both commercial and open-source tools  can be used as well as the skills of investigators and analysts.  Investigation techniques include not only data analysis but also several other traditional LE  methods, such as interviewing of victims and suspects, undercover surveillance, access to non-  public sources of information and more.  There are certain trends that seem to affect investigation and identification that have been  identified as challenges by several organisations in the online survey:   The analysis of “big data” by the LE is not considered an easy task; it is often time-  consuming and requires specific knowledge;   The Carrier-grade NAT (CGN)7 technology also makes it difficult for LE to reveal the  identity of criminals, as several users are hidden behind the same IP address;   The Internet of Things (IoT) is an issue discussed mainly because forensic analysis of IoT  devices is not a straightforward task in most cases;   Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers an automated analysis that can be performed by LEAs, but  this approach raises legal, ethical and technological issues.   Analysis of cryptocurrencies transactions, which is fundamental for identifying the money  flow, is often related to online criminal activities. Many online services exist that offer  mixing and obfuscation services, making it difficult for LEAs to trace users behind digital  wallets.  3.5 TOOLS FOR REMEDIATION  Remediation is a highly complex activity, with the purpose of restoring the systems and services  damaged during an attack/incident.  The respondents from LEAs in the online survey did not indicate that restoration/remediation is  part of their duty. Most of them mentioned that they focus mainly on the evidence collection  phase.  CSIRT respondents indicated that systems recovery is part of their post-incident duties.  Responses did not indicate clearly defined tools or activities, but merely that some national  CSIRTs can perform such activities as coordinators or consultants.  Important aspects to be considered regarding remediation:  7 https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/are-you-sharing-same-ip-address-criminal-law-enforcement-call-for-end- of-carrier-grade-nat-cgn-to-increase-accountability-online  https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/are-you-sharing-same-ip-address-criminal-law-enforcement-call-for-end-of-carrier-grade-nat-cgn-to-increase-accountability-online https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/are-you-sharing-same-ip-address-criminal-law-enforcement-call-for-end-of-carrier-grade-nat-cgn-to-increase-accountability-online  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  16   Remediation operations are specific per each system. Only the owner of a system can  choose the appropriate tools and activities for remediation, depending on the specificities  of the environment.   Remediation is usually an activity within a bigger domain called “Business Continuity and  Disaster Recovery”. It involves many prerequisites to be in place, specific procedures,  tools and people.    Choosing the right tools to perform remediation depends on the environment that must  be restored. There are different types of data backup (e.g. cloud, on-site, Redundant  Array of Independent Disks - RAID, tapes etc.).   National CSIRTs might be involved in coordination activities as regards remediation; they  might need to be actively involved only when they manage the systems or have in-depth  experience in certain technologies.   Nobody, within the respondents, indicated specific tools to be used in the remediation  phase.  3.6 TOOLS FOR COORDINATION (AND INFORMATION SHARING)  Due to the borderless nature of cybercrime and cybersecurity incidents, the same incident may  affect several countries. In such cases, it is important for CSIRTs and LEAs of different  countries to be able to work together on the same cases, exchange information and take  coordinated actions, according to their mandates.  Within the LE community and specifically in the field of cybercrime, cooperation among LEAs of  the EU Member States and a few Third countries takes place through Europol, the European  Cybercrime Centre and in major cases through the Joint Cyber-crime Action Taskforce (J-  CAT)8.  Europol’s position at the heart of the European security governance system allows it to serve as  a:   support centre for law enforcement operations;   a hub for information on criminal activities;   centre for law enforcement expertise.  Europol also supports the law enforcement activities of the Member States through a network of  liaison officers. This network consists of liaison officers who are responsible for facilitating the  exchange of information between the Member States; each liaison officer represents his/her  Member States. In this way, messages and requests from one country to another are sent  through the liaison bureau.  The European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)9 was set up “to strengthen the law enforcement  response to cybercrime in the EU and thus to help protect European citizens, businesses and  governments from online crime”. EC3 has been involved in tens of high-profile operations. One  big innovation that took place within the EC3 is the establishment of the J-CAT. “J-CAT’s  objective is to drive intelligence-led, coordinated action against key cybercrime threats and  targets by facilitating the joint identification, prioritisation, preparation and initiation of cross-  border investigations and operations by its partners.”10  8 https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/joint-cybercrime-action-taskforce  9 https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3  10 https://www.europol.europa.eu/  https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/joint-cybercrime-action-taskforce https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3 https://www.europol.europa.eu/  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  17  Another mechanism for coordinating actions during major cyberattacks against information  systems is the “Law Enforcement – Emergency Response Protocol (LE ERP)”. The LE ERP has  been recognised by the EU Council and the Member States as one of the key mechanisms at  EU level providing an EU coordinated response to large-scale cybersecurity incidents and  crises11. LE ERP includes setting up Europol’s Virtual Command Post, a secure communication  channel to facilitate real-time critical communications and on a need-to-know basis with the  different stakeholder groups.  It should be also noted that according to the Directive on Attacks against Information Systems  2013/40/EU12 and the Council of Europe’s Convention on Cyber-crime13, networks of 24/7  contact points have been established, so that direct communication and information exchange  can take place among relevant LEAs of Member States in cases of attacks against information  systems, but also several types of cybercrime.  Coordination plays an important role in incident response. Most often cybercrime cases or  cybersecurity incidents have a cross-border dimension, meaning that there is a need for a  certain level of coordination. CSIRTs usually take the lead in collecting large amounts of data  related to malicious activities, a part of which could end up in LE related investigations that later  will lead to the identification and incrimination of culprits.  The path to incrimination is challenging, according to a study published by Third Way on their  website14; less than 1% of cybercrimes in the United States see an enforcement action taken  against the attackers. In addition, for that 1%, there is immense cooperation and coordination  effort in place.  In recent years, many successful takedown operations have taken place as a result of the  cooperation across CSIRTs, LE and private sector players15.  The online survey responses indicate a basic level of cooperation taking place between CSIRTs  and LE, but mostly with regular tools such as phone or email.  There are clear signs of cooperation within communities, but not necessarily among  communities. For example, the majority of CSIRTs across the EU are using the same tools such  as a Request Tracker for Incident Response (RTIR)16 ticketing system (Hall, 2015), Malware  Information Sharing Platform (MISP)17 or other similar malware information-sharing platforms,  messaging, email clients, etc.  The CSIRT community is also supported by EU level initiatives, such as the CSIRTs network  established by the NIS Directive (ENISA, 2016), Trusted Introducer and the specific activities  that ENISA has supported over the last years. A common technical platform for cooperation and  exchange of information is also under development (MeliCERTes18).  Survey responses suggest that the members of the CSIRT community have more skills and  resources to develop in-house applications. Several tools mentioned by the respondents are  11 Draft Council Conclusions on EU Coordinated Response to Large-Scale Cybersecurity Incidents and Crises,10085/18,  19 June 2018.  12 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32013L0040  13 https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/0900001680081561  14 https://www.thirdway.org/report/to-catch-a-hacker-toward-a-comprehensive-strategy-to-identify-pursue-and-punish- malicious-cyber-actors  15 https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/%E2%80%98avalanche%E2%80%99-network-dismantled-in- international-cyber-operation  16 https://bestpractical.com/rtir  17 https://www.misp-project.org/  18 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/call-tender-advance-melicertes-facility-used-csirts-eu-cooperate-and- exchange-information  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32013L0040 https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/0900001680081561 https://www.thirdway.org/report/to-catch-a-hacker-toward-a-comprehensive-strategy-to-identify-pursue-and-punish-malicious-cyber-actors https://www.thirdway.org/report/to-catch-a-hacker-toward-a-comprehensive-strategy-to-identify-pursue-and-punish-malicious-cyber-actors https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/%E2%80%98avalanche%E2%80%99-network-dismantled-in-international-cyber-operation https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/%E2%80%98avalanche%E2%80%99-network-dismantled-in-international-cyber-operation https://bestpractical.com/rtir https://www.misp-project.org/ https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/call-tender-advance-melicertes-facility-used-csirts-eu-cooperate-and-exchange-information https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/call-tender-advance-melicertes-facility-used-csirts-eu-cooperate-and-exchange-information  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  18  developed by members of the CSIRT community. In addition, they intensely rely on open-source  software. On the other side, LE use mainly commercial tools but they can also rely on tools  developed by the CSIRT community.  The LE community presents similar signs of inter-member cooperation. Survey responses  indicate, in general, that LEAs across the EU use mainly similar tools and do make use of the  cooperation mechanisms put in place at EU level. There is a strong level of cooperation and  coordination at EU level through EUROPOL, that hosts some EU wide available cooperation  tools (e.g. SIENA19, SIRIUS 20). EUROPOL also established EC3 to “strengthen the law  enforcement response to cyber-crime in the EU”21.  However, the online survey responses do not indicate the use of advanced coordination tools  between the two communities. Cooperation does take place, but only basic tools such as email  and telephone are used. There are though, several examples where well-established  cooperation mechanisms and tools are put in place.  One is in the UK, where the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the National Cyber Security  Centre (NCSC) are tasked with responding to different aspects of cyber-attacks22. In this  respect, NCA investigates the most serious and complex attacks affecting the UK while NCSC  protects critical services from cyber-attacks. According to the source, this model was tested  “during the WannaCry attack in which the NCA led the criminal investigation, while the NCSC  developed advice on limiting damage, protecting uninfected computers, and establishing the  scale of the incident”. The online survey replies identify NSCS using several internal  cooperation tools developed by the NCA.  Based on the interviews conducted for preparing the Roadmap on the cooperation between  CSIRTs and LE (ENISA, 2019d), the Malta Police Force - Cyber Crime Unit23, is currently  working on a project for implementing MISP and other information-sharing platforms between  CSIRT and LEAs.  The Belgium Federal Computer Crime Unit also mentioned that they are using a coordination  tool developed by their national CSIRT.  The French National Police created a CSIRT for supporting investigation. As a full member of  the French CSIRT community and TF-CSIRTs Network, it shares information directly with  CSIRTs by using a MISP.  Some coordination tools used by the CSIRT community are the following:   Incident response ticketing systems - RTIR;   Messaging platforms – Mattermost24, Threema25;   Software to structure information – Taranis26;   Collecting and processing security feeds (such as log files) – IntelMQ27.  19 https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/information-exchange/secure-information-exchange- network-application-siena  20 https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/europol-launches-sirius-platform-to-facilitate-online-investigations  21 https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3  22 https://www.computerweekly.com/news/450430399/UK-cyber-defenders-set-to-build-on-existing-capability  23 https://pulizija.gov.mt/en/police-force/police-sections/Pages/Cyber-Crime-Unit.aspx  24 https://mattermost.com  25 https://threema.ch/en  26 https://github.com/NCSC-NL/taranis3/wiki  27 https://github.com/certtools/intelmq  https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/information-exchange/secure-information-exchange-network-application-siena https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/information-exchange/secure-information-exchange-network-application-siena https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/europol-launches-sirius-platform-to-facilitate-online-investigations https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3 https://www.computerweekly.com/news/450430399/UK-cyber-defenders-set-to-build-on-existing-capability https://pulizija.gov.mt/en/police-force/police-sections/Pages/Cyber-Crime-Unit.aspx https://mattermost.com/ https://threema.ch/en https://github.com/NCSC-NL/taranis3/wiki https://github.com/certtools/intelmq  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  19  Among others, two coordination tools used by the LE community are the following:   Secure information exchange network application – SIENA;   A platform for facilitating online investigations – SIRIUS.  3.7 TOOLS FOR SECURE COMMUNICATION  When dealing with cybercrime, secure communication is of the highest importance. The  processing and sharing of sensitive data require appropriate protection.  Section 4.2.1 of the ENISA report Tools and Methodologies to Support Cooperation between  CSIRTs and Law Enforcement (ENISA, 2017, p. 28) provides more insights into the types of  tools used by each community.  The most significant tool that is used for information exchange among LEAs in different  countries is Europol’s SIENA. SIENA ensures the secure exchange of sensitive and restricted  information among LE of Member States.  Other than the above, the organisations make use of encrypted emails to communicate  between themselves.  The online survey did not reveal any serious progress in this area as the CSIRT community  continues to use OpenPGP28 besides other protocols that provide end-to-end encryption over  the network, such as Transport Secure Layer (TLS). Tools enumerated in the previous  subchapter also provide certain levels of security.  It is worthwhile to mention the MeliCERTes platform, serving as a network for establishing  confidence and trust among the national CSIRTs of the Member States and for promoting swift  and effective operational cooperation. A modular platform that interlaces various services that  not only offers a complete security incident management solution but also allows CSIRTs to  share information and collaborate with each other within verified trust circles. Each module  specialises in a task essential to security incident management29.  In some cases, LE rely on secure email services, while in the few cases where using CSIRT  powered tools, they rely on the security provided by the developers. EU level cooperation  platforms, hosted by Europol, offer adequate levels of protection, but can only be used for “LE  to LE” type of cooperation.  28 https://www.openpgp.org/about/  29 https://github.com/melicertes/csp  https://www.openpgp.org/about/ https://github.com/melicertes/csp  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  20  4. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  4.1 REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR USING TOOLS DURING  INVESTIGATIONS  This subchapter examines different types of restrictions/constraints that CSIRTs and LEAs  might have when using specific tools. Currently criminal investigations may also have a digital  dimension. The many ways information technology impacts our lives have also influenced the  way criminal investigations are conducted.  Over the last decade, the use of digital evidence in  the LE and justice sector has encountered an exponential increase in Europe. Digital evidence  has become important not only for cybercrime but for all sorts of crimes.  The authors of Handling and Exchanging Electronic Evidence Across Europe, (Biasiotti M. J.,  2018) provide useful insights on how digital evidence is currently handled in the EU. They  mention that although Member States might have in place-varied legislation that regulates the  collection and handling of digital evidence, there are two elements that must be guaranteed in  any case, that is relevance and authenticity. Nevertheless, these requirements are difficult to be  met due to some peculiar characteristics of digital evidence, namely fragility and immateriality  (difficult to associate with physical objects). That is why the “chain of custody” becomes very  important. A proper chain of custody should contain details on how the digital evidence was  handled from the moment collected until presented in court.  At European level, there is still neither a unified legal framework nor shared rules that make it  possible to handle digital evidence and its possible exchange in a uniform manner across  Member States”. At international level, the Council of Europe Convention on cybercrime  (Council of Europe, 2001), often referred to as the ‘Budapest Convention’, is the first and most  relevant international treaty on cybercrime and electronic evidence.  At EU level, the European Commission has submitted a proposal for a regulation on production  and preservation for electronic evidence in criminal matters30. Within the Impact Assessment31,  that preceded the above proposal, it is clearly mentioned that “some crimes cannot be  effectively investigated and prosecuted in the EU because of legal constraints in cross-border  access to electronic evidence”.  In the same light, the European Commission proposed on 5 February 2019 to start international  negotiations on cross-border access to electronic evidence, necessary to track down dangerous  criminals and terrorists. This initiative is called “E-evidence - cross-border access to electronic  evidence32” and aims to ensure that the Second Additional Protocol (under negotiation) to the  Council of Europe “Budapest” Convention on Cybercrime  is compatible with EU law, as well as  the proposed EU rules on cross-border access to electronic evidence.  Significant progress has been done in this area, as problems have been identified and actions  have been proposed. Nevertheless, it will take some time until the real impact will be assessed  at Member States level.  30 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52018PC0225&from=EN  31 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0118&from=EN  32 https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/criminal-justice/e-evidence-cross-border-access- electronic-evidence_en  In some cases,  the use of tools  might be  influenced/  restrained by  different  national or  international  regulatory  frameworks.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52018PC0225&from=EN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0118&from=EN https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/criminal-justice/e-evidence-cross-border-access-electronic-evidence_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/criminal-justice/e-evidence-cross-border-access-electronic-evidence_en  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  21  Useful conclusions and recommendations are also provided in:   EU Council conclusions on improving criminal justice in cyberspace, 9 June 201633;   European Informatics Data Exchange Framework for Courts and Evidence34 -  (EVIDENCE), the EU CORDIS project that aimed at creating a Common European  Framework for the correct and harmonised handling of electronic evidence during its  entire life cycle; among the outstanding results of the project we can enumerate The  Digital Forensics Tools Catalogue35 and The Electronic Evidence Categorisation Tool.  In the US, National Institute of Standards and Technology - NIST has developed a Computer  Forensics Tool Testing Program (CFTT)36, to “establish a methodology for testing computer  forensic software tools by developing general tool specifications, test procedures, test criteria,  test sets, and test hardware” to ensure their reliability; a catalogue of tools is provided by NIST  (NIST, 2019).  As regards the admissibility of evidence in court, progress still needs to be done not only at EU  but also at international level; standards that provide guidelines related to the evidence  collection process and forensic methods are also required.  Figure 4 depicts that the communities identify the need of following digital forensic rules when  evidence is collected. 56% of the online survey participants replied that they follow a set of  digital forensic rules during the evidence collection phase, while 6% replied that they have not  identified such a need. Some respondents also indicated some specific frameworks.  Following forensic rules when collecting evidence does not guarantee the admissibility of  evidence in criminal proceedings. However, the development and adoption of a common  framework of digital forensic rules could increase the likelihood of evidence admissibility in  court; this could be beneficial for the communities.

Any proposed platform needs to comply with existing and forthcoming legislation at  national, European and international level. Characteristic examples are the EU General Data  Protection Regulation (Regulation EU 679/2016 (Council E. P., 2016a)), the Network and  Information Security Directive, also known as NIS Directive, (Directive EU 2016/1148 (Council  E. P., 2016b)), the E-evidence framework (European Commission, n.d, a), the EU Cybersecurity  Certification framework (European Commission, n.d., b) and more.  4.2.1 GDPR Implications on the use of different tools  The new EU General Data Protection Regulation was adopted on the 24th of May 2016 and  entered into force on the 25th of May 2018. The objective of the regulation is the “protection of  natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free  movement of personal data”.  The GDPR underlines seven key principles that must be respected by those processing personal  data:   Lawfulness, fairness and transparency: these three core principles are referring to  processor/controller being honest and respecting the regulation.   Purpose limitation: the data must be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate  purposes.   Data minimisation: the volume of data collected should be limited to what is necessary to  fulfil the purposes for which they are processed.   Accuracy: The data must be accurate and kept up to date.   Storage limitation: the data must be stored only for the time period that is strictly  necessary in relation to the purpose for which they were collected.   Integrity and confidentiality: this is clearly a requirement for security of processing.  Among others, data should be protected against unauthorised or unlawful processing  and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. This should be achieved by using  appropriate technical or organisational measures.   Accountability: this principles defines that the controller and the processor shall be  responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, all the above.  Article 6 of the regulation deals with the lawfulness of processing, mainly stating that there must  be a legal basis for the processing, either being a legal obligation, legitimate interest, explicit  consent, or another basis, as explained in the article.  Another important aspect of the GDPR is that it requires the implementation of “privacy by  design” and “privacy by default” principles. This means that controllers and processors must put  in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to implement the data protection  principles and safeguard individual rights.  Article 2, par.2 (d) of the GDPR stipulates that the regulation does not apply to the processing of  personal data “by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation,  detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the  safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security”. As the GDPR does not  apply in these cases, a more specific legislative document was adopted in parallel with the  GDPR, the Directive (EU) 2016/680 on the protection of natural persons regarding the  processing of personal data connected with criminal offences or the execution of criminal  penalties, and on the free movement of such data, which also entered into force on May 25th  2018.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  23  The Directive is designed to protect citizens' fundamental right to data protection when personal  data is processed by law enforcement authorities for law enforcement purposes. The Directive  is expected to facilitate cross-border cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism.  This practically means that LEAs that use tools to process personal data have to do so lawfully,  fairly, and only for a specific purpose, always linked to the fight against crime.  Police and criminal justice authorities are obliged to apply the principles of data protection by  design and data protection by default at the beginning of any personal data processing. When  developing applications, criteria definition needs to be developed first by both communities.  The lawful bases for processing are set out in Article 6 of the GDPR. At least one of these must  apply whenever the processing of personal data takes place: consent, performance of a  contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public task or legitimate interest. Fairness means that  handling of personal data should take place only in ways that people would reasonably expect,  and they should not be used in ways that have unjustified adverse effects on the  individual. Transparent processing is about being clear, open and honest with people from the  start about who the data controller and processors are, and how and why they use personal  data. 37  Additionally, the Directive provides that processing of personal data by these bodies will fall  under the control of Independent Supervisory Authorities; however certain exceptions are  introduced for the judiciary, as Article 45 par. 2 of the Directive stipulates that “Each Member  State shall provide for each supervisory authority not to be competent for the supervision of  processing operations of courts when acting in their judicial capacity”.  Nevertheless, CSIRTs do not fall into the same category, as they are considered data  controllers/processors, as their operations are regulated by the GDPR and not like LE by the  2016/680 Directive38. Notably, recital 49 of the GDPR provides that the processing of personal  data “for the purposes of ensuring network and information security […] by computer security  incident response teams (CSIRTs) constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller  concerned”.  The provisions of recital 5039 could also provide a legal basis for personal data processing,  through national laws, for certain CSIRTs constituencies (e.g. national, governmental): “if the  processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the  exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Union or Member state law may determine  and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be regarded as  compatible and lawful”.  CSIRTs must be very careful, as the principles stated above also apply  to them. Transparency and accountability along with the “right to be forgotten” are important, as  a data subject may request access to its data, or even deletion. Therefore, appropriate  measures should be in place to handle these requests by “locating” the data stored and  processed through different CSIRT tools. When dealing with attacks, the temptation of collecting  too much data should be avoided. Storage limitation should also be applied, and data removed  after some time has passed.  There are significant challenges in cybersecurity, such as threat intelligence that is a service  that needs huge amounts of data, collected over many years, in some cases. Data maximisation  is rather applied to what is collected, as in aggregating any information that could be relevant as  37 https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation- gdpr/principles/lawfulness-fairness-and-transparency/  38 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016L0680  39 http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/recital-50-GDPR.html  https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/lawfulness-fairness-and-transparency/ https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/lawfulness-fairness-and-transparency/ https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016L0680 http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/recital-50-GDPR.htm  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  24  an input. Furthermore, access to certain useful online services, such as WHOIS, have been  restricted due to privacy concerns.  Considering the above, further clarifications are needed as regards the lawful operation of  CSIRTs under GDPR. National CSIRTs can further analyse data protection issues, covering  also other types of CSIRT services that might be offered within their countries. Considerations  of using common platforms and data transfer tools among different countries should also be  made. The EU data protection framework, in particular, the GDPR and LE DP Directive, impose  specific restrictions to CSIRTs and LE also when sharing data with international organisations  and onwards with third countries. Sharing with non-EU countries requires an adequate level of  data protection. This could require CSIRTs and LE to revisit their framework of sharing  information with corresponding authorities of third countries.  4.2.2 NIS Directive and its implications on the use of tools  The EU Directive 2016/1148 concerning measures for a high common level of security of  network and information systems across the Union, known also as the NIS Directive, is the first  piece of EU-wide cybersecurity legislation (Council E. P., 2016b). The goal is to enhance  cybersecurity across the EU, through enhancing national capabilities, cross-border cooperation  and national supervision of critical sectors (ENISA, 2016).  Among other things, the NIS Directive established an EU wide cooperation framework for  national CSIRTs (the CSIRTs Network). Between the tasks attributed to the group are  coordination and exchange of information as regards incidents.  What had been done at EU level through informal groups is now done officially through the  CSIRTs Network. The group already has periodic meetings, supported by ENISA.  Along with the adoption of the NIS Directive, there is also a notable technical development,  namely MeliCERTes, a facility used by the CSIRTs in the EU to cooperate and exchange  information. ENISA will oversee operating the central aspects of the MeliCERTes facility and will  support the operation of the EU CSIRTs Network. National CSIRTs have also been allocated  EU funds, to develop national technical platforms, able to integrate with MeliCERTes.  The conclusion is that soon, the EU CSIRT community will have all the necessary tools to  cooperate properly among themselves.  Along with the NIS Directive, new legislation has been adopted in all Member States,  strengthening the role of the national CSIRT or similar institutions. Every Member State will now  have a stronger national CSIRT and a cyber supervisory scheme covering at least seven  essential industries (energy, banking and financial markets, transport, water, health, digital  operators).  Tools used within this area need to focus more on cooperation and be able to facilitate secure  data exchange among many peers. National CSIRTs should be able to perform analyses at  industry level, but also at national level and to cooperate with other CSIRTs across the EU. New  tools, such as MeliCERTes, must be able to support this exponential growth in the number of  cooperating parties, and sources of information.  However, the NIS Directive does not put too much emphasis on cooperation with LE and the  judiciary.  Besides the demand for “consult and cooperate” with LEAs, expressed in Art. 8, no  other parts of the NIS Directive mention such initiatives. The NIS Directive supports the delivery  of secure and dependable essential services to to EU citizens.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  25  Therefore, this is still a grey area and the questions remain, such as how a fully developed  CSIRT community, equipped with tools and a proper cooperation framework, can also  contribute to the cybercrime investigation lifecycle, by serving LE and the judiciary with the  proper data to identify and incriminate responsible persons.  4.2.3 The role of the cybersecurity certification framework  The EU Cybersecurity Act (Regulation EU 2019/881 (Council E. P., 2019)) establishes an EU  certification framework for information and communication technology (ICT) digital products,  services and processes, which enables the creation of EU certification schemes. Although  several security certification schemes exist in the EU for ICT products, measuring the security  and trust of these products, these are not based on a common framework. After massive  cyberattacks e.g. ransomware cases, the need for providing rated assurance level has also  been highlighted in the area of cybercrime investigation as various tools are used in all  cybercrime investigation lifecycle phases.  The new framework will provide a set of rules, technical requirements, standards and  procedures so that security and trust of products could be measured. Users and service  providers alike will be able to determine the level of security assurance of the products, services  and processes they procure, make available or use.  In particular, each European scheme should specify:   the categories of products and services covered;   the cybersecurity requirements, for example by reference to standards or technical  specifications;   the type of evaluation (e.g. self-assessment or third-party evaluation);   the intended level of assurance (e.g. basic, substantial and/or high).  To describe the cybersecurity risk, a certificate may refer to three assurance levels that result  from estimating the level of risk in relation to the intended use of the product, service or process  (focusing on probability and impact of an incident). The resulting certificate will be recognised in  all EU Member States, making trade easier across different countries.  For instance, evidence management is the key part of a cybercrime investigation and  prosecution. The increasing requirement of storing, preserving, sharing and managing various  forms of digital records used as evidence in a criminal court highlights the need for using tools  that can provide assurance that the data is trustworthy, accurate, complete, secure and  subsequently admissible in a court for prosecuting the suspect.  It is expected that all the tools used by CSIRTs and LE during the cybercrime investigation  lifecycle for collecting evidence, analysing data, investigating cases, communicating etc. will  need to fulfil the requirements set up by a certification scheme.  55% of the online survey participants replied that they are aware of the emerging EU  cybersecurity certification framework. Figure 6 depicts how the Member States see the impact  that EU cybersecurity certification may have on the use of CSIRT/LE tools provided throughout  the cybercrime investigation lifecycle. 54% of the participants see that the security certification  framework will have positive impact on the technical cooperation across the three communities;  in particular, 33% of the respondents consider that the EU cybersecurity certification framework  will provide greater assurance of the forensics data, 12% replied that it will mitigate various risks  that arise during a cybercrime investigation case, while 6% claim that this framework may  improve the tools in terms of software and 3% in terms of hardware.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  26  Figure 5: Replies to question 24A of the online survey  4.2.4 Standards and certifications available  There are several useful best-practice standards for implementing effective cybersecurity.  These standards also cover the use of tools and techniques within an organisation. Therefore, it  is important to understand the role that each standard fulfils, its scope and how it is combined  with other standards.  Certification plays a critical role in increasing trust and security for different products and  services, within communities, and refers to the confirmation of certain characteristics of a  product or service. This can only be beneficial to the EU internal market, as it improves the  functioning conditions by increasing the level of security. The purpose of the Cybersecurity  Certification Framework is to establish an EU level scheme to attest that the evaluated ICT  products, services and processes and comply with specified security requirements for the  purpose of assuring cybersecurity. The CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary can surely find the new  framework as a fit for purpose.  Cybersecurity standards are generally applicable to all organisations no matter what their size is  or the industry/sector they represent. Several people need to work together to develop a  standard, at European level ETSI40 and CEN-CENELEC41 guidelines are followed; while at  international level, people follow the guidelines provided by ISO/IEC standards.  Concerning the international-level cases, the people who are working together aiming to  develop a new standard are independent technical experts nominated by ISO members, for  specific subject areas. The standard development workflow is as follows: they begin the process  with the development of a draft that meets a specific market need; then, this is shared for  commenting and further discussion. The voting process is the key to consensus.

If an agreement is not  reached, then the draft will be modified further and voted on again42.  ISO/IEC 27001 is the international standard for best practice Information Security Management  Systems (ISMS). Its main scope is the protection and preservation of information under the  principles of confidentiality, integrity and availability. The standard offers a set of best-practice  controls that can be applied to an organisation based on the risks it faces and implemented in a  structured manner in order to achieve externally assessed and certified compliance43.  ISO/IEC 27032 is the international standard that focuses on cybersecurity. The standard  provides guidance for improving the state of cybersecurity, drawing out the unique aspects of  that activity and its dependencies on other security domains, in particular:   information security;   network security;   internet security;   critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP)44.  ISO/IEC 27035 is the international standard for incident management. Incident management  forms the crucial first stage of cyber resilience. This standard also includes guidance for  updating policies and processes to strengthen existing controls following analysis of the event  and minimise the risk of recurrence45.  ISO/IEC 27031 is the international standard for ICT readiness for business continuity. The  standard describes the key concepts and principles of ICT readiness for business continuity and  provides a framework of methods and processes to identify and specify all aspects (such as  performance criteria, design, and implementation) for improving an organization's ICT readiness  to ensure business continuity46.  ISO/IEC 22301 is the international standard for business continuity management systems and  forms the final part of cyber resilience. The standard specifies requirements to plan, establish,  implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and continually improve a documented  management system to protect against, reduce the likelihood of occurrence, prepare for,  respond to, and recover from disruptive incidents when they arise47.  The Cloud Security Alliance’s Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) is a set of controls designed to  maximise the security of information for organisations that take advantage of Cloud  technologies48.  The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) \"provides a high-level taxonomy of  cybersecurity outcomes and a methodology to assess and manage those outcomes\". In  particular, NIST CSF provides a policy framework of computer security guidance for how private  sector organizations in the United States can assess and improve their ability to prevent, detect,  and respond to cyber-attacks.  42 https://www.iso.org/developing-standards.html  43 https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html  44 https://www.iso.org/standard/44375.html  45 https://www.iso.org/standard/44379.html  46 https://www.iso.org/standard/44374.html  47 https://www.iso.org/standard/50038.html  48 https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/working-groups/cloud-controls-matrix/  https://www.iso.org/developing-standards.html https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html https://www.iso.org/standard/44375.html https://www.iso.org/standard/44379.html https://www.iso.org/standard/44374.html https://www.iso.org/standard/50038.html https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/working-groups/cloud-controls-matrix/  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  28  5. CONSIDERATION OF  REQUIREMENTS FOR A SHARED  PLATFORM  As the main objective of this report is to streamline cooperation between the communities, there  are different types of requirements that must be considered when using such tools or proposing  initiatives in this area.  5.1 COMPONENTS  The concept of “people, process and technology” has been the cornerstone Information  Technology Infrastructure Library - ITIL49  for many years. These parts are considered the keys  to successful project implementation and organizational change. In other words, for a new  cooperation platform to be successful and operational, an approach that optimises the  relationships between the three is required.   People: It is necessary to identify the key role players from the CSIRT, LE and the  judiciary communities and understand how each of them can contribute in the fight  against cybercrime. The aim is to highlight conflicting or overlapping duties performed by  one community or more. CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary should identify the key  responsibilities for their communities and then link them with the skills required to fulfil  these duties.   Process: The suitable processes in order for an advanced collaboration platform to be  successful need to be defined. Then, process variations, exceptions, interdependencies  and supporting processes should also be considered. The three communities have to  review these processes, make sure that they understand what is expected from each  party and express their concerns for any possible gaps or other issues.   Technology: This part should be the final consideration once the issue is clearly  understood and the solution requirements have been clearly defined. Technology will  cover the needs that people and processes require, but not vice versa. Careful  consideration needs to be given to the automated integration with other existing  platforms.  5.2 GENERAL FEATURES  As identified throughout this study, a shared platform across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary  seems to be an effective solution to the technical challenges highlighted in previous ENISA  reports (ENISA, 2019a). While designing the cooperation platform, there are important technical  aspects that need to be considered. Interoperability, authentication of users and security of  personal data are some of them. A significant aspect that also needs to be considered is the  platform availability, which is ensured at the level of technological infrastructure by various  49 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/business-process- integration/operational-it-processes/itil  FEATURES  Usability, accessibility  (Role-Based Access  Control- RBAC model),  secure architecture - data  security (in transit/at rest);  security by design and by  default, integration with  current tools, workflow  tool, etc. Interoperability  with existing systems  across borders, Ability to  share data with non-EU  based CSIRT/LE entities  (e.g. the U.S. etc.)  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  29  parameters such as network infrastructures that support its operation, software, hardware and  durability - tolerance to risk factors such as power outages, natural disasters, etc.  At this point, there are some initiatives that have already started at EU level e.g. the Horizon  2020 - H202050 project for developing a Lawful evidence collecting & continuity platform  (LOCARD)51. Cross-sharing evidence seems to be also on researchers’ agenda. However, all  the efforts are being done are still in very early stages.  Such a cooperation platform must be built on existing expertise and current developments  within the field. There are plenty of tools available with different features and can be used for  various investigation purposes; this subchapter presents a non-exhaustive list of the features  they have in common.  5.2.1 Security  The platform should provide security and reliability, ensuring the following parameters:   Integrity: it is crucial to ensure that the information has not been tampered. All  communities should be able to use certain datasets, preserving the initial form, while  passing through different “hands”.   Identification, authentication and accountability: As all communities will be working  within the same datasets, they should be able to attribute information to certain  users/institutions. For this purpose, users should be properly identified, authenticated  and a thorough accountability mechanism should be put in place so that every action  performed is traceable.   Confidentiality: All data must remain confidential, assured through the best possible  security measures.   Authorisation and role-based access: Certain institutions might desire to keep certain  datasets confidential or available only to small communities. The platform should allow  authorisation based access as well as role-based access.   Availability: this refers to the availability of information whenever an authorised user  attempts to access it.   Non-repudiation: this is strictly related to accountability.  An example of how a platform should perform is presented below:  A national CSIRT might want to share some Indicators of Compromise (IoC) recently collected  with certain members of the CSIRTs Network. Once the members of the CSIRTs Network have  access, additional information might be added by them to the initial IoC. At some point, enough  data might be available to help LE launch an investigation. At this stage, owners of data  (CSIRTs) might want to authorize certain LE officers to have access to information related to  these incidents. Certain LE might want to open cases based on the initial data and share them  with the other members of the LE community. This could lead to a cross-border case, that would  eventually be followed by a takedown.  The security of the platform requires a complex set of guidelines and rules relating to the  organisation of its administrator and hosting provider, the processes executed, the services  provided, the technical infrastructure available, as well as the legal framework for personal data  protection and security of communications.  50 https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en  51 https://locard.eu/  https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  30  5.2.2 Interoperability  Interoperability refers to the ability to collaborate with different organisations in a homogeneous  and efficient way to achieve common goals. This also involves the ability of two or more  systems to exchange information and then use these information in a useful and meaningful  manner. Interoperability is recognised internationally as one of the most important issues for  achieving efficient operation of information systems in businesses and organisations of all sizes  and industries.  For this situation, interoperability must be assured at the semantic, organizational and technical  layers. The semantic layer has been assured mainly by the work published in 2016 by ENISA  and EUROPOL, on a Common Taxonomy for Law Enforcement and CSIRTs (ENISA  EUROPOL EC3, 2016). Although further work must be done to completely synchronize  terminologies between the two communities, the current taxonomy can provide a satisfactory  level of understanding.  Considering technical interoperability, the aim that is being set is to transfer and use information  in a seamless and efficient way between the parties registered in the platform.  As mentioned in the ENISA report Information sharing and common taxonomies between  CSIRTs and Law Enforcement (ENISA, 2016), although multiple standards exist for the sharing  of information, Structured Threat Intelligence eXpression – STIX52, appears to be the preferred  mechanism for the information exchange between CSIRT and LE communities. As more and  more organisations and vendors support STIX, this seems to be the right choice for such a  platform. In cases where the CSIRT/LE taxonomy does not fit the needs of some constituents,  we can adopt the multi-taxonomy practice. A thorough analysis has to be performed to  determine how many taxonomies/standards have to be supported within the platform.  Organisations might need to implement internal changes as well as to adopt the new  interoperability standards, as some internal processes and procedures might be affected by the  changes. The amount of change needed has to be decided on a case-by-case approach.  At EU level, the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) is a jointly agreed approach to  deliver European public services in an interoperable manner. It offers public administrations  concrete recommendations on how to improve governance of their interoperability activities,  establish cross-organisational relationships, streamline processes supporting end-to-end digital  services, and ensure that both existing and new legislation do not compromise interoperability  efforts53.  5.2.3 Key functionalities  This subchapter will attempt to identify key-shared functionalities that tools must have to  properly accomplish their goals.  Working with digital evidence involves certain measures to be applied, depending on the  operations developed. Accurate collection of logs, not tampering with evidence while collecting  data, correctly identifying the timestamp to correlate different types of events etc. are just a few  items on a long list.  52 https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/  53 https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en  FUNCTIONALITIES  Incident reporting,  evidence management,  anonymisation support,  data analysis capabilities,  visualisations,  investigations cross-  checking and report  production.  https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  31  Like many other digital platforms, the proposed platform will have to follow certain international  standards and other general design features, such as usability, accessibility, interoperability,  security by design and by default, etc.  1. Interoperability: sharing electronic evidence is crucial; however, it must be done in a  way the other parties can read it. Interoperability between platforms and data collecting  tools should be included in the general features of this platform. The platform should also  permit the export data to a certain format, in order to be imported in other tools too.  2. Adherence to international standards: being able to exchange data between parties  means they should be able to understand a common language. Developing an  information-sharing framework or language seems to be one of the key elements. As  discussed by (Biasiotti M. , 2017) currently CybOX, DFAX15 and the Unified Cyber  Ontology (UCO), are the “most suitable standards to represent data and metadata  related to an evidence exchange”. However, these are standards used by LE. CSIRTs  use mainly STIX/TAXII54 standards for exchanging data. A common platform should be  able to understand and translate the different “languages” used by the communities.  3. Preservation of chain of custody: The EVIDENCE55 project developed a proof of  concept application on the digital evidence exchange, which includes support for  maintaining a detailed continuity of evidence (also called a chain of custody). Preserving  the authenticity of evidence collected while transmitted from one entity to another is  crucial. CSIRTs do have more informal methods of collecting data, but LEAs follow many  procedures before acquiring evidence.  4. Accountability: being able to track one’s actions is a necessity, closely linked with the  ability to preserve the chain of custody.  5. Security: being able to preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data  stored and exchanged within the platform is another requirement needs to be  considered.  6. Analytics: this feature allows the thorough analysis of collected data to measure one’s  activity and helps to present statistics on the use of the platform.  5.2.3.1 Incident reporting (ticketing)  A major functionality for the platform is incident reporting and management of the related  “tickets”. Ticketing software converts all incoming reports from multiple channels into tickets. A  ticketing system offers prioritization, tracking and following-up of each case opened in the  system. This can help different entities to communicate better and handle issues more  efficiently. The ticketing software can also provide better statistics on the incident handling  processes.  Therefore, by using a ticketing software, all the data inserted into the platform will be classified  based on tickets/cases. CSIRTs and LE might define and classify cases in a different way.  The platform should allow to ingest data in many forms and organize them according to each  actor’s needs. Data acquired must also be sanitized, so that only pertinent data remain and  collection of irrelevant data to be eliminated.  Current ticketing systems are considered too simple and do not appropriately support large  investigations. The platform should allow for several layers of tickets and regrouping of tickets  into broader folders.  54 https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/  55 http://www.evidenceproject.eu/the-activities/deliverables.html  https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/ http://www.evidenceproject.eu/the-activities/deliverables.html  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  32  5.2.3.2 Evidence management  Management of evidence related to a crime/incident is also of great importance for the  collaborating parties. The platform should provide officials with the ability to track all procedures  regarding digital evidence. The recommended evidence management solution is based on the  data lifecycle stages i.e. the collection, the processing, the storage, the transfer and the  maintenance. The platform must provide a clear insight into the chain of custody for e-evidence.  The final goal is to provide LE and the judiciary with enough evidence to successfully conclude  cybercrime investigations and convict criminals. Evidence management is of utmost importance.  CSIRT processes and procedures might not adhere to the official ones used in court that are  followed by LE and the judiciary.  The platform will have to be supported by a comprehensive framework of data collection and  analysis that will help the involved communities to better manage the evidence.  5.2.3.3 Anonymisation support  Data anonymization is the process in which personally identifiable information, like age, gender,  name, etc., is changed or removed from a set of data so that it would be impossible to  determine the individual the data belongs to. Since the platform will be used by several entities  and will be containing personal data, there is a need for data anonymisation, not only for  security reasons but also to comply with the relative legislation on personal data processing. It  should be noted that anonymised data are not considered personal data, according to the data  protection legislation. Nevertheless, not all cases allow anonymisation and the processing of  personal information may often be necessary for the objectives pursued. In such cases,  pseudonymisation can be used instead. Pseudonymised data still allow for some form of re-  identification of the data subject, while anonymous data do not. Therefore, pseudonymised data  are considered as personal data (Regulation EU 2016/679, recital 26 (Council E. P., 2016a)).  5.2.3.4 Data analysis capabilities, visualisations  Data analysis is the process of transforming raw data into usable information, in order to add  value to the statistical output56. It is different from data visualisation that involves the visual  representation of data, ranging from single charts to comprehensive dashboards. Effective  visualisations significantly reduce the amount of time it takes for someone to process  information and access valuable insights. The platform should provide these types of  functionalities to facilitate the cooperation and interaction across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary.  5.2.3.5 Investigations cross-checking  The platform should be facilitating investigations crosschecking. Investigators and other officials  will be able to identify relationships among people, objects, modi operanti, etc. Thus,  investigation of cases will be easier, while at the same time, de-confliction will be available.  Nevertheless, it is important that the platform to be linked to different sources of data, held by  several entities on their systems.  5.2.3.6 Generated reports  Another very useful functionality of the platform is the automatic generation of reports, during an  investigation or once thesis completed. The reports produced should be customisable and  shareable with the concerned stakeholders. A report could include technical, strategic or other  types of details, depending on who the recipient is. Thus, its content should be easily  understood by the reader and include only information for the specified purposes.  56 https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=2973  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  33  5.2.3.7 Information sharing  The core functionality of such a common platform is the information sharing capability. The  entities need to be able to share information, in a controlled and secure way. Access to  information should be regulated according to the “need-to-know” basis, always in accordance  with the existing legislation.  For achieving the abovementioned objective, different kinds of limitations that might affect the  sharing process has to be taken into account. Even if CSIRTs might be able to share all kinds of  data, LE and judiciary investigations might contain classified data, which cannot be shared with  other communities.  In this respect, it becomes important for the platform to have access restriction capabilities.  Access should be allowed at user or group level. At the same time, sharing and access policy  should be established.  A classification scheme should be put in place to accommodate requirements from all involved  communities. CSIRTs usually use the Traffic Light Protocol - TLP protocol57, while LE and the  judiciary might rely a lot on classified information.  Information sharing should be done at community level (e.g. CSIRTs only) or organizational  level (some CSIRTs and some LEAs). This means the platform should have role-based, group-  based and individual-based sharing capabilities.  5.2.3.8 Access management  The platform should finally provide IT managers with tools and technologies for controlling user  access to critical information, defining and managing the roles and access privileges of  individual network users as well as the circumstances under which users are granted (or  denied) those privileges.  The platform should implement a clear Segregation of Duties (SoD), by disseminating the tasks  and associated privileges for specific processes among multiple people aiming to prevent and  detect errors and irregularities (ISACA, 2019). An indicative example of SoD is provided by  ENISA in form of a matrix (see E ANNEX: SOD MATRIX)  The platform should have strong access management capability as well as strong  authentication in place (e.g. at least two factor authentication). The platform should be able to  define individual users along with user groups or even organisations units (institutions or  communities). Access logs should be widely available, providing details on the user’s actions  within the platform.  57 https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp  https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  34  6. CONCLUSIONS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  6.1 CONCLUSIONS  6.1.1 Filling in the gaps  In this study, we have estimated the degree of maturity of the technical cooperation across  CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary throughout the lifecycle of cybercrime investigation. The main  takeaway is that all three communities are mature, with their own well-established processes in  place and have identified, adopted or developed the proper tools for performing their duties.  The CSIRT community has proven, by far, to be the most sophisticated and flexible in terms of  tools. Members of the community have identified a broad range of tools (either commercial or  open-source), for different kinds of tasks and the more mature members have also taken the  lead in developing certain tools and making them available for the whole community (e.g.  MISP). Steps are being taken currently, at EU level, for enhancing technical cooperation and  the exchange of information among members, via the development of an EU level cooperation  platform (MeliCERTes).  The survey has shown that LE rely heavily on a variety of tools during the stages of cybercrime  investigation. As their job and goals are very specific, it is not a surprise that the same or similar  tools are used by LE across the EU. Nevertheless, due to the fact that the tasks of LE are  related to judicial procedures, LEAs do not have the same flexibility and freedom as the CSIRT  community to use in-house developed tools or even open-source tools. Tools used by LEAs  should provide an adequate level of assurance, so that collected evidence could be admissible  in court.  However, survey responses did indicate notable cooperation between the two communities  however without the use of dedicated tools. Basic tools for communication and information  exchange, such as emails and telephone, are usually used. There are though, several  examples within the Member States, where well-established cooperation mechanisms and tools  are put in place at national level.  Despite the fact that judicial authorities had not provided feedback in the online survey, based  on the results presented in a previous ENISA report (ENISA, 2019a), it had been highlighted  that there is cooperation between LE and the judiciary, while CSIRTs have direct cooperation  with prosecutors and judges, only when CSIRT experts are called as witnesses in court.  6.1.2 Analysing the necessity of a common platform  It is more than obvious that all three communities have different roles within the cybercrime  investigation lifecycle. Nevertheless, reducing cybercrime and its consequences is the desired  outcome for all actors involved. This leads to the conclusion that the parties should strengthen  their cooperation and aim for a faster and more efficient response.  CSIRT community has taken serious steps towards improving inter-CSIRT cooperation in the  EU. Platforms such as MeliCERTes will improve cooperation and incident response across the  EU. The LE community has also taken similar steps to improve LE interagency cooperation  within the EU, through platforms such as SIENA and SIRIUS, hosted by Europol.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  35  The new Regulation proposal regarding European Production and Preservation Orders for  electronic evidence in criminal matters (European Commission, 2018), represents also a big  step forward in harmonising the way information is exchanged in criminal investigations.  All prerequisites leading to successful cooperation across the three communities appear to be in  place. Building a common platform for these three communities that are actively involved in the  cybercrime investigation lifecycle phases should be an important next step to consider at the  policy level. At least, as a start, effort should be directed into drafting the required functionalities  and the technical specifications for designing and subsequently developing such a platform.  When drafting the technical specifications of this platform, all the requirements the communities  have should be considered.  6.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  Some recommendations are proposed for the relevant stakeholders.  6.2.1 Recommendations for ENISA and possibly EUROPOL EC3 and EUROJUST   To closely monitor the developments within the area and support involved parties in  achieving the desired level of technical cooperation.   To consider and promote the adoption of a common digital forensic framework.   To assess the suitability of EU cybersecurity certification framework for cybercrime  investigation tools and services.   To drive efforts towards the development of a common platform, considering all  requirements and constraints expressed by the communities.   To facilitate the sharing of experience at strategic and operational cooperation across the  three communities.   To promote the use of Segregation (or separation) of Duties (SoD) matrices to avoid  overlapping duties across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary in relation to the sharing  information.  6.2.2 Recommendations for CSIRTs   To highlight specific services that can be delivered to LE.   To identify specific requirements that LE and the judiciary might have, in terms of  cooperation at national level, and try to accommodate by providing the necessary  information to them.   To discuss and consider the adoption of a common digital forensic framework.   To develop CSIRT specific requirements for a common cooperation platform.  6.2.3 Recommendations for LE   To develop EU and national level requirements for the CSIRT community, on what types  of information provided by CSIRTs can be useful for LE, throughout the cybercrime  investigation lifecycle.   To discuss and consider the adoption of a common digital forensic framework.   To develop LE specific requirements for a common cooperation platform.  6.2.4 Recommendations for the judiciary   To develop EU level requirements for the CSIRT and the LE community, on what data  can be useful and how to exchange it properly.   To develop evidence collection and management rules in order the digital records to be  admissible in court.   To develop specific requirements for a common cooperation platform.

It is a  community-driven initiative called IHAP (Incident Handling Automation  Project) which was conceptually designed by European CERTs during  several information security events. Its main goal is to give to incident  responders an easy way to collect and process threat intelligence thus  improving the incident handling processes of CERTs. (ENISA, 2019b)  Mattermost Mattermost is an open-source messaging platform that enables secure  team collaboration. (Mattermost, 2019)  Malware Information  Sharing Platform (MISP)  MISP is a free and open-source software helping information sharing of  threat intelligence including cybersecurity indicators.  A threat intelligence platform for gathering, sharing, storing and  correlating IoC of targeted attacks, threat intelligence, financial fraud  information, vulnerability information or even counter-terrorism  information.” (MISP, 2019)  OpenPGP OpenPGP is a non-proprietary protocol for encrypting email  communication using public-key cryptography. It is based on the original  PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) software. The OpenPGP protocol defines  standard formats for encrypted messages, signatures, and certificates  for exchanging public keys. (OpenPGP, 2019)  Role-Based Access  Control (RBAC)  RBAC is access control based on user roles (i.e., a collection of access  authorizations a user receives based on an explicit or implicit  assumption of a given role). Role permissions may be inherited through  a role hierarchy and typically reflect the permissions needed to perform  defined functions within an organization. A given role may apply to a  single individual or to several individuals. (NIST, 2019)  Request Tracker for  Incident Response  (RTIR)  RTIR builds on all the features of RT and provides pre-configured  queues and workflows designed for incident response teams. It is the  tool of choice for many CERT and CSIRT teams all over the globe. RTIR  has tools to correlate key data from incident reports, both from people  and automated tools, to find patterns and link multiple incident reports  with a common root cause incident. (Best Practical, 2019)  The Secure Information  Exchange Network  Application (SIENA)  SIENA is a state-of-the-art platform that meets the communication needs  of EU law enforcement. The platform enables the swift and user-friendly  exchange of operational and strategic crime-related information among:  - Europol’s liaison officers,  - Analysts and experts  - Member States third parties with which Europol has cooperation  agreements. (Europol, 2019)  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  44  SIRIUS The SIRIUS project was created by Europol in October 2017 as a  response to the increasing need of the EU law enforcement community  to access electronic evidence for internet-based investigations, as more  than half of all criminal investigations today include a cross-border  request to access electronic evidence (such as texts, e-mails or  messaging apps). The SIRIUS project, spearheaded by Europol’s  European Counter-Terrorism Centre and European Cybercrime Centre,  in close partnership with Eurojust and the European Judicial Network,  aims to help investigators cope with the complexity and the volume of  information in a rapidly changing online environment, by providing  guidelines on specific Online Service Providers (OSPs) and investigative  tools; and sharing experiences with peers, both online and in person.  Through continued collaboration with Eurojust and the European Judicial  Network, the SIRIUS project is now also open to judicial authorities. The  multidisciplinary SIRIUS community on the restricted platform on the  Europol Platform for Experts has access to a wide range of resources,  updated continually. (EUROPOL, 2019)  Structured Threat  Intelligence eXpression  (STIX)  STIX is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber  threat intelligence (CTI). enables organizations to share CTI with one  another in a consistent and machine-readable manner, allowing security  communities to better understand what computer-based attacks they are  most likely to see and to anticipate and/or respond to those attacks  faster and more effectively. (OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence Technical  Committee (CTI TC), 2019)  Threema Threema is ‘an end-to-end encrypted instant messaging application for  iOS, Android and Windows Phone. In addition to text messaging, users  can make voice calls, send multimedia, locations, voice messages and  files‘. (Threema, 2019)  Taranis Taranis is a software to structure information from various sources about  vulnerabilities. It scans the internet for texts about digital threats and  vulnerabilities in software, hardware, and operating systems. (NCSC-NL,  2019)  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  45  C ANNEX: OPERATION  AVALANCHE & ANDROMEDA  BOTNET TAKEDOWN  An example of joint action and cooperation among several entities around the world was the  takedown of the Andromeda botnet (also known as Gamarue), which took place on 29th  November 2017. It is still considered today as a significant dismantling of the longest-running  malware families. The case included not only cooperation between the public and private  sector, but also coordinated actions among LEAs, judicial authorities and CSIRTs.  According to Microsoft research, Andromeda’s goal was to distribute almost 80 malware  families. Within a period of six months, it was detected that an average of over 1 million  machines were blocked every month.  Earlier in 2016, after several years of investigation, judicial and LE authorities from Germany,  United States of America, along with Europol, Eurojust and other partners had dismantled the  international criminal infrastructure Avalanche, which was used, among others, as a delivery  platform to launch and manage mass global malware attacks such as Andromeda.  While preparing the Avalanche joint action, the German Cybersecurity Authority, the Federal  Office for Information Security (BSI) and the Fraunhofer-Institut für Kommunikation,  Informationsverarbeitung und Ergonomie (FKIE) analysed over 130 TB of captured data and  helped identifying the server structure of the botnet, allowing for the shutdown of thousands of  servers and, effectively, the collapse of the entire criminal network. During the Avalanche  Operation, 5 individuals were arrested, 37 premises were searched, and 39 servers were  seized. Abuse notifications were sent in relation to over 200 compromised servers. Victims of  malware infections were identified in over 180 countries. Avalanche was a remediation  operation as well as a LE operation. The main effect was to sanitize German cyberspace from  the Avalanche botnet but apart from the German victims, feeds with sinkholed data were sent to  CSIRT teams all over the world in order to do victim mitigation.  The dismantling of Andromeda was heavily based on knowledge and intelligence gained during  the Avalanche case by LE, combined with the intelligence provided by private-sector partners.  Europol played a coordination role in both operations.  Thus, on November 29th 2017, the United States of America Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI), in close cooperation with the Luneburg Central Criminal Investigation Inspectorate in  Germany, Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), the Joint Cybercrime Action Task  Force (J-CAT), Eurojust and private sector partners, took jointly action against servers and  domains, which were used to spread the Andromeda malware.  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  46  According to Europol 1500 domains of the malicious software were sinkholed, while according  to Microsoft58, during 48 hours of sinkholing59, approximately 2 million unique Andromeda victim  IP addresses from 223 countries were seized.  In parallel, sinkhole measures were necessary, across several countries (both EU and non-EU),  as globally 55 per cent of the computer systems originally infected in Avalanche were still  infected at the time of the joint action. This was the part where CSIRTs were involved in the  operation. When sinkholing is employed at a 100% scale, infected computers can no longer  reach the criminal C&C computer systems and criminals can therefore no longer control the  infected computers. After the operation, the victims’ computers communicated with the LE  servers instead of the attackers C&C. The feeds with victim information (geo-localized IP  address and timestamp) were sent to the responsible national CSIRT in an automatic manner in  order to do further victim mitigation at national level. In this way, the sinkholing infrastructure  captures victims’ IP addresses, which can subsequently be used for notification and follow-up  through dissemination to National CSIRTs and network owners.  In terms of regulatory instruments, the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) process was  used and not the European Investigation Order (EIO).  During the preparation of the Operation Avalanche and the Andromeda botnet takedown,  according to the representative of EC3, the collaborating partners used to have conference calls  every week, with a duration of an average of 2 hours. Communication was based on PGP  channels. Secure information exchange channels were used between LE representatives. It can  be easily understood that private partners are not allowed to have access to certain LE tools for  coordinating the case.  As key cooperation challenge in both cases has been identified, the not well-structured  communication among the public and private partners, LE, judicial authorities and CSIRTs.  Therefore, the need for a coordination platform has been highlighted; its key functionalities  should include:   Information sharing;   Tasking for not overlapping others’ duties and for better monitoring;   Discussion groups; real-time communication is of great importance too;   Sharing of tactics followed; it should be noted that efforts are being done for  developing a manual with best practices;   Capability of creating investigation (user) groups with access rights to certain types of  information.  Furthermore, user-friendliness and accessibility are very important features for a collaboration  platform.  Finally, the security aspect should be considered when designing such a platform as well as  respecting the relevant legislation on personal data protection.  In conclusion, the Andromeda botnet takedown was a significant example of international law  enforcement working together with judicial authorities, CSIRTs and industry partners to identify  the most significant cybercriminals and the dedicated infrastructure they use to distribute  malware on a global scale.  58 https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/12/04/microsoft-teams-up-with-law-enforcement-and-other-partners-to- disrupt-gamarue-andromeda/  59 Sinkholing is an action whereby traffic between infected computers and a criminal infrastructure is redirected to servers  controlled by law enforcement authorities and/or an IT security company.  https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/12/04/microsoft-teams-up-with-law-enforcement-and-other-partners-to-disrupt-gamarue-andromeda/ https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/12/04/microsoft-teams-up-with-law-enforcement-and-other-partners-to-disrupt-gamarue-andromeda/  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  47  D ANNEX: NO MORE  RANSOM  The No More Ransom (NMR)60 initiative could be characterized as an “alternative” and  innovative way of cooperation among LE, CSIRTs, public and private partners. The NMR portal  has helped more than 200.000 victims of ransomware to recover their files free of charge since  it was first launched in July 2016. More than 3 million individual visitors from over 188 countries  have accessed the portal looking for information or for a specific solution to their ransomware  infection61.  More specifically, NMR is an initiative by Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), the  National High-Tech Crime Unit of the Netherlands’ police, Kaspersky Lab and McAfee to help  victims of ransomware to retrieve their encrypted data without having to pay to the criminals.  Ransomware has been around for a number of years and victims are forced to either pay a  ransom or lose their files.  Victims of ransomware can visit the following portal: https://nomoreransom.org, upload samples  of their encrypted files and check if there are available decryption tools for the malware family  that infected their systems. After a quick assessment by the ‘Crypto Sheriff’, if the appropriate  decryption tool is available the victim is prompted to the guidelines to download the tool and  recover their data. Victims’ data are not stored or shared with third parties; the information is  deleted as soon as the assessment is performed.  By restoring access to their infected systems free of charge, the partnership provides users with  a third choice they did not have before, as it counts with more than 90 tools capable of  decrypting over 120 different types of ransomware families62. The tools are provided at the  discretion of the NMR partners.  The NMR portal, initially released in English, is available in 35 other languages.  The initiative is the first public-private partnership of its kind. It is based on the cooperation  between more than 150 partners and it is recognized globally as an excellent effort on  cybercrime remediation since some $108 million profit have been prevented from going to the  pockets of criminals. 42 LEAs, 5 EU Agencies and 101 public and private entities have joined  this project since 2016.  Since the launch of the portal, Politie Police (Belgium), Politia Romana (Romania), Police  Nationale (France) and CERT Polska (Poland), together with other eleven private companies,  have contributed to the development of new unique decryption tools. These tools are presented  in the NMR portal and are available to the public through the related websites.  Many other LEAs and CSIRTs “kindly offer their time and resources to help promote NMR at the  national and international level”.  60 www.nomoreransom.org  61 https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/no-more-ransom-108-million-reasons-to-celebrate-its-third-anniversary  62 https://www.europol.europa.eu/publications-documents/infographic-3rd-anniversary-no-more-ransom  https://nomoreransom.org/ http://www.nomoreransom.org/ https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/no-more-ransom-108-million-reasons-to-celebrate-its-third-anniversary https://www.europol.europa.eu/publications-documents/infographic-3rd-anniversary-no-more-ransom  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  48  The objectives of the NMR project is neither the remediation nor cybercrime prevention. This is  a stand-alone approach that provides decryption tools only for certain ransom threats i.e.  HildaCrypt63, Muhstik64, GalactiCryper65, Avest66, Yatron67, FortuneCrypt68, WannaCryFake69,  Syrk70, JSWorm 4.071, Iams00rry72, ZeroFucks73, and Mira74. Technical cooperation is required  between the ‘Associated partners’ who provide the decryption tools and the ‘Supporting  partners’ who inform the public. This cooperation focuses on:   providing decryption tools   circulating the related link for accessing the portal  In Figure 7 below, the infographic shows data about the partners are available:  Figure 7: No More Ransom Project  63 https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html#HildaCrypt  64 https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html#Muhstik  65 https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html#GalactiCryper  66 https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html#Avest  67 https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html#Yatron  68 https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html#FortuneCrypt  69 https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html#WannaCryFake  70 https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html#WannaCryFake  71 https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html#JSWorm40  72 https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html#Iams00rry  73 https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html#ZeroFucks  74 https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html#Mira  AN OVERVIEW ON ENHANCING TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTs AND LE  DECEMBER 2019  49  E ANNEX: SOD MATRIX  Cybercrime fighting activities  C S  IR T  s  L E  J u  d g  e s  P ro  s e c u  to rs  Training topics (e.g. technical skills etc.)  Prior to incident/crime  Delivering/participating in training ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ Problem-solving and critical thinking skills  Collecting cyber threat intelligence ✔ ✔  ✔ Knowledge of cyber threat intelligence landscape  Analysis of vulnerabilities and threats ✔ ✔  ✔  Development and distribution of tools for  preventive and reactive mitigation  Issuing recommendations for new vulnerabilities  and threats ✔  Dealing with specific types of threats and  vulnerabilities  Advising potential victims on preventive  measures against cybercrime ✔ ✔  Raising awareness on preventive measures against  cybercrime  During the incident/crime  Discovery of the cyber security incident/crime ✔ ✔  Digital investigations; forensics tools; penetration  testing; vulnerability scanning; flow analysis  Identification and classification of the cyber  security incident/crime ✔ ✔  ✔ Incident and crime classification and identification  Identify the type and severity of the compromise ✔ ✔  ✔  Knowledge of cyber threats and incident response  procedures  Evidence collection ✔ ✔  ✔  Knowledge of what kind of data to collect;  organisation skills  Providing technical expertise ✔  Technical skills  Preserving the evidence that may be crucial for  the detection of a crime in a criminal trial ✔ ✔  ✔ Digital investigations; forensics tools;  Advising the victim to report / obligation to report  a cybercrime to law enforcement (LE) ✔  ✔  Obligations and restriction on information sharing;  communication channels  Duty to inform the victim of a cybercrime ✔ ✔  ✔  Obligations and restrictions to the information  sharing  Duty to inform other stakeholders/authorities  (operators of vulnerable systems, data  protection authorities, telecommunications  authorities, etc.)  ✔  Obligations and rules for information sharing  among communities.

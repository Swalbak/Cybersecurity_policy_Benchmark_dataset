The ACSC has developed this guidance to assist organisations to understand the risks of deploying and provide specific  configuration requirements for the Viasat Mobile Dynamic Defense (MDD) system to handle sensitive or classified data.  This security configuration guide does not replace the Information Security Manual (ISM), however where a technical  conflict arises the most current document shall take priority.  Audience  To use this guide, readers should be familiar with basic networking concepts, be an experienced mobile device system  administrator, and be or have access to an experienced network administrator.  Parts of this guide will make reference to product features that will require the engagement of other software,  networking equipment or other Mobile Device Management (MDM) vendors. While every effort has been made to  ensure content involving any third-party vendor products is correct at the time of writing, organisations should always  check with these vendors when planning their system implementation. Note, mention of third-party products is not a  specific endorsement of that vendor over another, and they are used for illustrative purposes only.  Some security configuration instructions within this guide are complex, and if implemented incorrectly could reduce the  security of the device, the network or the organisation’s overall security posture. These instructions should only be  implemented by experienced systems administrators and should be used in conjunction with thorough testing.  Purpose  This guide provides information for organisations on Viasat Mobile Dynamic Defense (MDD) and potential security risks  that should be considered before being introduced into their mobile fleet. A threat risk assessment should be  undertaken by organisations so that they completely understand the risks present in the deployment model they have  selected.  This guide is to be used with the security configuration guides for mobile devices developed by the ACSC. Organisations  are required to meet all existing PROTECTED level security configurations as outlined in the configuration guides for the  mobile devices.  The advice in this guide relates to use of the MDD platform within Australia. Organisations and individuals seeking to  use devices overseas should also refer to the ACSC’s Travelling Overseas With Electronic Devices  publication.  System functionality and user experience will be affected by the implementation of this guide. Authorising officers  should consider the balance of user requirements and security, as not all advice may be appropriate for every user or  environment.  Organisations should seek approval from their authorising officer to allow for the formal acceptance of the risks. Refer  to the applying a risk-based approach to cyber security section of the ISM for more information.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/travelling-overseas-electronic-devices  2  General advice  When newer versions of MDD are released, there is potential for new security implications and authorising officers  should seek additional guidance if required. In the absence of additional guidance, ASD advises:   Upgrade to the latest version of MDD as new versions provide security enhancements and address known  vulnerabilities. This is consistent with ASD’s advice to install the latest versions of software and patch operating  system vulnerabilities as communicated in the ISM and the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents.  Mobile device vendors and software providers provide explanatory notes regarding the content of their security  updates. This information may help organisations quantify the risk posed if they do not update.  Introduction to mobile device security  In this guide, mobile device security advice centres on the three security tenets of:   device integrity   data at rest   data in transit.  ASD evaluates device cryptographic implementations, to determine the device configuration necessary to reduce  handling requirements of devices used for the processing or storing of sensitive or classified data. It is each  organisation’s responsibility to configure the device according to ASD advice, and assess that the applications  implemented by an organisation use the available cryptographic protections appropriately.  Configuration advice regarding device integrity, aims to provide a level of protection suitable for sensitive or classified  mobile devices, assuming an adversary has physical access to the device while it is powered on and in a locked state.  Configuration advice and device evaluation draws upon:   key hierarchy and architecture evaluation   cryptographic implementation assessment   operating system architecture   configuration assessment under typical deployment scenarios.  It is the organisation’s responsibility to configure the device according to this advice in order to achieve the desired  integrity outcomes.  Configuration advice regarding the protection of data at rest, aims to provide a level of protection suitable for sensitive  or classified data stored on mobile devices. This advice assumes an adversary has physical access to the device while it  is powered on and in a locked state. Configuration advice and device evaluation draw upon configuration assessment  and details of application implementation including availability of security features.  Configuration advice regarding the protection of data in transit, aims to provide a suitable level of protection for the  sensitive or classified data traversing a network, while assuming an adversary is able to intercept traffic.  It is each organisation’s responsibility to configure their devices according to ASD advice and support and maintain  appropriate VPN infrastructure to support the VPN tunnels. Such infrastructure is out of scope for this guide.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  3  Supervised devices  ASD guidance advises that all devices handling sensitive or classified data be supervised. Supervision is configured via  MDD enrolment. Supervision of devices handling government data is necessary to ensure that the correct policies and  configurations are applied throughout the lifecycle of a device.  4  Advice to authorising officers  The ACSC has developed the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents to help organisations and their  authorising officers mitigate cyber security incidents caused by various cyber threats. The most prominent set of these  mitigation strategies is known as the Essential Eight. While the strategies were developed for workstations and servers,  much of the functionality described exists on modern smartphones as well. Consequently, the risks are just as  important to consider on mobile devices.  The assessed MDD product interacts with Samsung Galaxy mobile devices. Users and administrators will need to  implement all of the security configurations as specified in the Security Configuration Guide – Samsung Galaxy S10,  S20 and Note 20 Devices publication. The minimal configuration requirements for mobile devices shall target the  PROTECTED level controls. The configuration guide outlines the risks of deploying and specific configuration  requirements for the Samsung Galaxy mobile devices to handle sensitive or classified data.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/security-configuration-guide-samsung-galaxy-s10-s20-and-note-20-devices https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/security-configuration-guide-samsung-galaxy-s10-s20-and-note-20-devices  5  MDD platform features and risk considerations  The following table describes certain features within MDD and the risk considerations that users, administrators and  risk owners will need to consider.  Feature Description and Risk Considerations  Requirement at  PROTECTED  ‘Whitelist’,  ‘Signature  Whitelist’ and  ‘Blacklist’  The ‘Whitelist’ will allow third-party applications onto the device, but it  does not disable system apps. ‘Signature Whitelist’ enables the ability to  define a set of android application signatures to the ‘Whitelist’ on the  provisioned device. When the device is provisioned, third-party  applications are uninstalled. However, if third-party applications are  installed through the MDD, they are automatically allowed. ‘Blacklist’ will  block third-party applications and disable system applications.  For simplicity, ‘Whitelist’ and ‘Signature Whitelist’ should be enabled and  leave the accepted applications list blank, unless there is a use case the  ‘Blacklist’ should be the focus of administrators to deny unrequired system  applications.  Without this control, unauthorised applications may be installed onto the  mobile device and affect the security of the device and network.  Mandatory  Firewall This control will allow mobile devices to connect to a specified set of  Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, hosts or subnets. Enabling the firewall  control allows devices to only connect to pre-defined networks.  Mandatory  Auditing MDD allows administrators to configure the audit logging on the mobile  device. Monitoring the logs of the mobile devices will provide  administrators additional context regarding unusual or suspicious activity.  Mandatory  Actuations Actuations allows configuration of mobile devices to perform certain  actions when a specified event occurs on the device (e.g. A user enters  their password incorrectly 5 consecutive times the phone, actuations can  automatically reset the phone to factory defaults).  Organisation  decision  Mandatory Apps The behaviour of mandatory applications (installed or always running) on  the device can be adjusted in accordance with operational requirements  and threat risk assessments.  Organisation  decision  Managed Wi-Fi Configuration of Wi-Fi SSID ‘Whitelist’ will allow devices to only connect to  known networks.  Mandatory  Password Policy Configuration of type, history, screen timeout, lifetime, maximum number  of failures until wipe, minimum password length, sequential and repeating  characters and customisation of the lock screen banner.  Refer to the ISM password controls for additional guidance.  Mandatory  6  Local Admin Allow Local Administrator on the device. This allows for policy changes on  device even after the device has been provisioned. If local admin is  disabled, the only way to reprovision device is through a factory reset  through the device, QR code or the MDD provisioning portal.  Organisation  decision  Operator Allows for operator mode on the device that can modify a defined subset  of the basic policy configurations on the device.  Organisation  decision  QR scanner Reprovision/Modify device profiles without using USB tethered connection.  There is a requirement for the client to trust a provisioning station before  accepting QR code to modify profile settings.  Recommended  Managed  certificates  QR certificate management for devices. Mandatory if QR  scanner is  enabled.  7  MDD – Recommended configuration items  The following outlines the MDD configuration items on mobile devices and the requirement for use at the PROTECTED  classification. Administrators must include a threat risk assessment matrix for PROTECTED and bespoke use cases, and  have a complete understanding of the risks associated with their decision around implementing a particular control.  Item Description and Risk Considerations  Requirement at  PROTECTED  New Admins Enables new device administrator applications. Organisation  decision  Factory Reset This configuration item will disable a local reset of the device to factory  settings.  If this setting is enabled and the device under goes factory reset, the device  will be unsupervised.  Organisation  decision  Android VPN Allows the VPN to be specified in the device settings.  All data communications for the Samsung Galaxy platform handling  government data must be through an Always On ‘StrongSwan’ VPN. The  Samsung Galaxy platform offers two versions of VPN client – OpenVPN and  StrongSwan. The StrongSwan client is enforced via the kernel and therefore  offers a stronger security claim for the VPN tunnel.  Recommended  Audio Recording Disables applications from using audio recordings. If enabled applications  may inadvertently record sensitive conversations.  Organisation  decision  Autofill service Enables the Autofill service application to be used. Similar to a password  manager, the device stores user information such as usernames and  passwords and then automatically completes forms when asked for them.  Recommended  Backup services Disables applications from using the Samsung cloud services to back up  data from the device.  Enabling this service may allow the transfer of sensitive government data  to the Samsung cloud service.  Not  recommended  Bluetooth Allows the device to use Bluetooth to connect to other devices and be used  to increase location accuracy.  If the use case does not require this feature, then this feature should be  disabled. This will reduce the attack surface on the device.  Organisation  decision  Bluetooth  Tethering  Allows the mobile device to share their network connection to other device  through Bluetooth connection.  If this item is enabled, the network can be exposed to other devices.  Not  recommended  8  Camera Photos and videos taken with the camera application are stored locally and  may be transferred automatically to locations that do not have sufficient  protection for sensitive government data.  Organisation  decision  Cell Data Mobile devices can be enabled to use cell data for internet connectivity.  The use of the always on StrongSwan VPN is recommended if using GSM  cellular data.  Organisation  decision  Certificate  management  Disable the ability of the user to modify the certificates on the device.  If this feature is enabled users will be able to manage the certificates on  the device. This includes self-signed certificates.  Organisation  decision  Developer mode Developer mode can be enabled allowing for mobile application  development. This configuration item will allow users to access system  level controls and should only be used for testing and development.  Not  recommended  External Encrypt Enforces encryption of external storage such as SD cards.  If this item is not enabled, external storage can be ejected from the mobile  device and contents read on another device.  Mandatory  Google Auto Sync Enables synchronisation of the data on a mobile device to a google  account.  This configuration item allows data on a mobile device to be stored and  updated on an external server hosted by Google.  Not  recommended  Google Backups The mobile device is backed up with a google account.  This configuration item allows data on a mobile device to be stored and  updated on an external server hosted by Google.  Not  recommended  GPS This item configuration enables GPS to be used by the mobile device.  Information based on the device’s physical location is obtained and used by  the mobile device and third-party applications for various location-based  services.  Organisation  decision  Lock Notifications This will enable notifications to appear while the device is in a locked state.  Applications can send notification to the device, which can reveal  information and details of applications on the device.  Not  recommended  Microphone Applications requiring the devices microphone can be enabled or disabled.  This configuration item provides an additional control on apps and services  that are allowed to access the device microphone.  Organisation  decision  MMS Multimedia messaging service can be enabled on the device allowing  images, videos or sound clips to be sent and received. Sensitive information  can be transmitted through this service without appropriate safeguards in  place.  Not  recommended  9  Mock Locations The location of the physical device can be specified, instead of using the  device’s actual location. This enabled when developer mode is on. This  mode is usually used for testing and development purposes.  Not  recommended  Over-The-Air  Updates  The mobile device can be enabled to use Over-The-Air (OTA) android  updates. This will enable wireless updates of the OS, firmware or  application software.  Recommended  SD card Enables SD cards to be used by the device.  If the SD card contains malicious software, it can infect the mobile device.  Furthermore, sensitive information can be stored on the SD card and easily  transferred to another device. If enabled, the External Encrypt feature must  also be enabled.  Organisation  decision  Smart Lock Android can allow the bypass of security locked screen based on constant  movement (proximity to user), location, recognised voice or connection to  a device.  Not  recommended  SMS Short message service (SMS) allows text messaging to be sent and received  from the device.  Organisation  decision  Unknown Sources Disable the installation of APKs from Unknown Sources onto the device.  If enabled, APKs from unknown source/s can be installed on to the device.  Installing APKs from unknown sources can compromise the mobile device.  Recommended  USB Debugging Enabled in conjunction with developer mode turned on, this configuration  item allows applications to be copied via USB to the device.  Applications with malicious code can be transferred to the device. This  configuration is primarily used for testing purposes.  Not  recommended  USB Host Storage Allows the mobile device to act as a host for another device through a USB  connection (i.e. with an On The Go [OTG] adapter).  This configuration allows a mobile device to connect to external peripherals  such as a USB storage device.  Not  recommended  USB Mass Storage Through a physical USB connection and enabling this configuration item,  external mass storage such as flash drives and USB sticks can be connected  to the mobile device.  This would enable transfer of information between the device and external  storage. This can expose the device to malicious applications or  executables, and potentially unauthorised transfer of information.  Not  recommended.  USB Tethering The mobile device can be configured to share network connection to other  devices via USB connection. If this configuration is enabled, the mobile  device can act as an open gateway to the network.  Not  recommended  10  Video Recording Videos taken with the camera application are stored locally and may be  transferred automatically to locations that do not have sufficient  protections for government data.  Organisation  decision  WAP Push Wireless application protocol (WAP) push allows content such as web links  to be pushed to the mobile device.  Messages containing web links can direct users to untrusted websites,  which can present additional risks to the user and the device.  If there is a requirement to use this feature, organisations needs to  understand and accept the risks. Infrastructure (push proxy gateway) will  be required to support this feature.  Organisation  decision  Wi-Fi Enabling this configuration item will enable the mobile device to establish a  Wi-Fi connection.  System risk owners and administrators will need to assess risks associated  with the type of network that the mobile device will be connecting too.  Organisation  decision  Wi-Fi Direct Wi-Fi Direct allows a mobile device to have a direct connection with  another device, to transfer and receive data. If the connecting device is not  with an organisation supervised device, transferring and receiving of  sensitive government data will not have sufficient protection.  Not  recommended  Wi-Fi Tethering Wi-Fi tethering allows mobile device to share mobile data connection with  external devices.  Not  recommended  11  Knox – Recommended configuration items  The following table outlines the Knox configuration items available on Knox enabled mobile devices and the  requirement for use at the PROTECTED classification. Administrators need to perform a formal threat risk assessment  and have a complete understanding of the risks associated with their decision around implementing a particular  control.  Item Description and Risk Considerations  Requirement at  PROTECTED  Airplane Forces airplane mode to be on. The user will still be able to disable airplane  mode but this will trigger a fault and audit event.  Organisation  decision  Android Beam Enable Android beam, a NFC data transfer. Not  recommended  Block Non-Mil  Accounts  Switching this feature off will not block accounts which do not end in ‘.mil’.  If this feature is switched on, only accounts ending in ‘.mil’ are allowed to  be accessed by the mobile device. All other accounts are blocked.  Organisation  decision  Browser Autofill Enables login and personal information to be stored and automatically  filled into web forms. This will support different complex  passwords/passphrases to be used on webpages.  Recommended  Cell Voice Enabling this feature will allow voice calls to be made. A potential risk is  communication of sensitive information.  Recommended  Crash report Enabling this feature allows crash reports to be generated by the mobile  device in the event of an application not responding.  If disabled, technical reporting is not provided, making identification of  technical errors or potentially malicious applications difficult to determine.  Organisation  decision  Fingerprint  Unlock  If disabled the mobile device will not be able to be unlocked through  fingerprint recognition. Depending on the mobile device, the fingerprint  recognition system and the reliability can vary.  Organisation  decision  Google Play Enable the Google play store application to run.  Google play is a shop front for Android applications that can be installed  onto the mobile device. Unauthorised or potentially malicious applications  can be installed onto the device. The ‘Whitelist’, ‘Signature Whitelist’ and  ‘Blacklist’ feature can minimise this risk.  Not  recommended  Lockscreen  Camera  Enable the camera icon to appear on the phone lock screen.  If enabled, the camera can be easily used even when the mobile device is in  a locked state. This allows sensitive material to be photographed.  Organisation  decision  12  Lockscreen Icons Icons such as phone will be allowed to appear on the locked screen. This  will allow shortcuts to different applications (login will still be required).  The associated risk depends on the application. If an application contains  sensitive information then displaying the icon on the locked screen can  expose the types of applications, and the role of the device, to adversaries  if the device is lost or stolen.  Organisation  decision  Multi-user mode This is applied to tablet devices, if enabled multiple users are able to access  a single tablet device. As multiple users are able to access the tablet, users  can potentially access sensitive data from other accounts on that tablet  device.  Organisation  decision  NFC Enable Near-Field-Communication (NFC) will allow other devices to  communicate with the mobile device.  Organisation  decision  Samsung beam Builds on the functionality of the Android beam feature, where content can  be shared using NFC and Wi-Fi direct (peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connection).  If enabled, peer-to-peer communication can occur between devices. A  peer-to-peer connection to other devices, which may be external to the  organisation fleet, can present high risk to the device and the network.  Not  recommended  Samsung Voice  Google Assistant  Bixby  Personal voice activated assistant applications carry out the user’s  command by voice input. These applications may process conversation  taking place around the device at any time. Should these applications be  used, there is a risk that sensitive or classified conversations will be  transmitted, and the data could then be stored and processed by the voice  assistant servers without sufficient protections for classified government  data.  Not  recommended  Share via list Enable the ‘Share Via’ list to appear. If enabled, the user would be able to  share sensitive information through different applications with insufficient  protection for sensitive or classified data.  Not  recommended  YouTube Enable the use of the YouTube application. Allows videos to be streamed to  the device. User activities can also be monitored and tracked by the  application.  Not  recommended  13  MDD Premium – Recommended configuration  items  The following table outlines the MDD premium configuration items. It requires a premium Samsung Knox licence. The  table displays the requirement for use at the PROTECTED classification. Administrators need to perform a formal threat  risk assessment and have a complete understanding of the risks associated with their decision around implementing a  particular control.  Item Description and Risk Considerations  Requirement at  PROTECTED  Audit Log Enable Knox audit logging.  If disabled, monitoring the device activities will become difficult for error  identification and detecting possible security breaches.  Recommended  Auto Touch  sensitivity  If enabled the touchscreen sensitivity is enabled, the device is able to  automatically adjust the touchscreen’s sensitivity.  Organisation  decision  Bluetooth low  energy  Enables Bluetooth low energy which is used for increased location accuracy  and connection to devices.  If the use case does not require this feature, then this feature should be  disabled. This will reduce the attack surface on the device.  Organisation  decision  Certificate  revocation  Enable Knox certificate revocation.  Without this enabled, certificates will not be validated for against a known  list of revoked certificates. This can potentially allow invalid and  untrustworthy certificates to be used on the mobile device.  Recommended  LED indicator Disable the light emitting diode (LED) indicator on the device.  The LED indicator is used to indicate the status of the device and for  application notifications.  Organisation  decision  Online certificate  status protocol  The online certificate status protocol (OCSP) is an internet protocol used to  obtain the revocation status of certificates.  If disabled, the status of revocation certificates will be unknown to the  device.  Recommended  Tactical mode The mobile device is forced into airplane mode. User will not be able to  disable airplane mode.  If disabled the mobile device is not locked down and able to communicate.  Organisation  decision  14  Wi-Fi scanning Disables Wi-Fi scanning for increase location accuracy.  If enabled, the mobile device will use the Wi-Fi antenna to complement the  GPS and mobile tower information to increase the location accuracy of the  device.  Organisation  decision  15  Glossary of cyber security terms  Term Meaning  application control An approach in which only an explicitly defined set of approved  applications permitted to execute on systems.

The ACSC has developed this guidance to assist organisations to understand the risks of deploying and provide specific  configuration requirements for the Viasat Mobile Dynamic Defense (MDD) system to handle sensitive or classified data.  This security configuration guide does not replace the Information Security Manual (ISM), however where a technical  conflict arises the most current document shall take priority.  Audience  To use this guide, readers should be familiar with basic networking concepts, be an experienced mobile device system  administrator, and be or have access to an experienced network administrator.  Parts of this guide will make reference to product features that will require the engagement of other software,  networking equipment or other Mobile Device Management (MDM) vendors. While every effort has been made to  ensure content involving any third-party vendor products is correct at the time of writing, organisations should always  check with these vendors when planning their system implementation. Note, mention of third-party products is not a  specific endorsement of that vendor over another, and they are used for illustrative purposes only.  Some security configuration instructions within this guide are complex, and if implemented incorrectly could reduce the  security of the device, the network or the organisation’s overall security posture. These instructions should only be  implemented by experienced systems administrators and should be used in conjunction with thorough testing.  Purpose  This guide provides information for organisations on Viasat Mobile Dynamic Defense (MDD) and potential security risks  that should be considered before being introduced into their mobile fleet. A threat risk assessment should be  undertaken by organisations so that they completely understand the risks present in the deployment model they have  selected.  This guide is to be used with the security configuration guides for mobile devices developed by the ACSC. Organisations  are required to meet all existing PROTECTED level security configurations as outlined in the configuration guides for the  mobile devices.  The advice in this guide relates to use of the MDD platform within Australia. Organisations and individuals seeking to  use devices overseas should also refer to the ACSC’s Travelling Overseas With Electronic Devices  publication.  System functionality and user experience will be affected by the implementation of this guide. Authorising officers  should consider the balance of user requirements and security, as not all advice may be appropriate for every user or  environment.  Organisations should seek approval from their authorising officer to allow for the formal acceptance of the risks. Refer  to the applying a risk-based approach to cyber security section of the ISM for more information.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/travelling-overseas-electronic-devices  2  General advice  When newer versions of MDD are released, there is potential for new security implications and authorising officers  should seek additional guidance if required. In the absence of additional guidance, ASD advises:   Upgrade to the latest version of MDD as new versions provide security enhancements and address known  vulnerabilities. This is consistent with ASD’s advice to install the latest versions of software and patch operating  system vulnerabilities as communicated in the ISM and the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents.  Mobile device vendors and software providers provide explanatory notes regarding the content of their security  updates. This information may help organisations quantify the risk posed if they do not update.  Introduction to mobile device security  In this guide, mobile device security advice centres on the three security tenets of:   device integrity   data at rest   data in transit.  ASD evaluates device cryptographic implementations, to determine the device configuration necessary to reduce  handling requirements of devices used for the processing or storing of sensitive or classified data. It is each  organisation’s responsibility to configure the device according to ASD advice, and assess that the applications  implemented by an organisation use the available cryptographic protections appropriately.  Configuration advice regarding device integrity, aims to provide a level of protection suitable for sensitive or classified  mobile devices, assuming an adversary has physical access to the device while it is powered on and in a locked state.  Configuration advice and device evaluation draws upon:   key hierarchy and architecture evaluation   cryptographic implementation assessment   operating system architecture   configuration assessment under typical deployment scenarios.  It is the organisation’s responsibility to configure the device according to this advice in order to achieve the desired  integrity outcomes.  Configuration advice regarding the protection of data at rest, aims to provide a level of protection suitable for sensitive  or classified data stored on mobile devices. This advice assumes an adversary has physical access to the device while it  is powered on and in a locked state. Configuration advice and device evaluation draw upon configuration assessment  and details of application implementation including availability of security features.  Configuration advice regarding the protection of data in transit, aims to provide a suitable level of protection for the  sensitive or classified data traversing a network, while assuming an adversary is able to intercept traffic.  It is each organisation’s responsibility to configure their devices according to ASD advice and support and maintain  appropriate VPN infrastructure to support the VPN tunnels. Such infrastructure is out of scope for this guide.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  3  Supervised devices  ASD guidance advises that all devices handling sensitive or classified data be supervised. Supervision is configured via  MDD enrolment. Supervision of devices handling government data is necessary to ensure that the correct policies and  configurations are applied throughout the lifecycle of a device.  4  Advice to authorising officers  The ACSC has developed the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents to help organisations and their  authorising officers mitigate cyber security incidents caused by various cyber threats. The most prominent set of these  mitigation strategies is known as the Essential Eight. While the strategies were developed for workstations and servers,  much of the functionality described exists on modern smartphones as well. Consequently, the risks are just as  important to consider on mobile devices.  The assessed MDD product interacts with Samsung Galaxy mobile devices. Users and administrators will need to  implement all of the security configurations as specified in the Security Configuration Guide – Samsung Galaxy S10,  S20 and Note 20 Devices publication. The minimal configuration requirements for mobile devices shall target the  PROTECTED level controls. The configuration guide outlines the risks of deploying and specific configuration  requirements for the Samsung Galaxy mobile devices to handle sensitive or classified data.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/security-configuration-guide-samsung-galaxy-s10-s20-and-note-20-devices https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/security-configuration-guide-samsung-galaxy-s10-s20-and-note-20-devices  5  MDD platform features and risk considerations  The following table describes certain features within MDD and the risk considerations that users, administrators and  risk owners will need to consider.  Feature Description and Risk Considerations  Requirement at  PROTECTED  ‘Whitelist’,  ‘Signature  Whitelist’ and  ‘Blacklist’  The ‘Whitelist’ will allow third-party applications onto the device, but it  does not disable system apps. ‘Signature Whitelist’ enables the ability to  define a set of android application signatures to the ‘Whitelist’ on the  provisioned device. When the device is provisioned, third-party  applications are uninstalled. However, if third-party applications are  installed through the MDD, they are automatically allowed. ‘Blacklist’ will  block third-party applications and disable system applications.  For simplicity, ‘Whitelist’ and ‘Signature Whitelist’ should be enabled and  leave the accepted applications list blank, unless there is a use case the  ‘Blacklist’ should be the focus of administrators to deny unrequired system  applications.  Without this control, unauthorised applications may be installed onto the  mobile device and affect the security of the device and network.  Mandatory  Firewall This control will allow mobile devices to connect to a specified set of  Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, hosts or subnets. Enabling the firewall  control allows devices to only connect to pre-defined networks.  Mandatory  Auditing MDD allows administrators to configure the audit logging on the mobile  device. Monitoring the logs of the mobile devices will provide  administrators additional context regarding unusual or suspicious activity.  Mandatory  Actuations Actuations allows configuration of mobile devices to perform certain  actions when a specified event occurs on the device (e.g. A user enters  their password incorrectly 5 consecutive times the phone, actuations can  automatically reset the phone to factory defaults).  Organisation  decision  Mandatory Apps The behaviour of mandatory applications (installed or always running) on  the device can be adjusted in accordance with operational requirements  and threat risk assessments.  Organisation  decision  Managed Wi-Fi Configuration of Wi-Fi SSID ‘Whitelist’ will allow devices to only connect to  known networks.  Mandatory  Password Policy Configuration of type, history, screen timeout, lifetime, maximum number  of failures until wipe, minimum password length, sequential and repeating  characters and customisation of the lock screen banner.  Refer to the ISM password controls for additional guidance.  Mandatory  6  Local Admin Allow Local Administrator on the device. This allows for policy changes on  device even after the device has been provisioned. If local admin is  disabled, the only way to reprovision device is through a factory reset  through the device, QR code or the MDD provisioning portal.  Organisation  decision  Operator Allows for operator mode on the device that can modify a defined subset  of the basic policy configurations on the device.  Organisation  decision  QR scanner Reprovision/Modify device profiles without using USB tethered connection.  There is a requirement for the client to trust a provisioning station before  accepting QR code to modify profile settings.  Recommended  Managed  certificates  QR certificate management for devices. Mandatory if QR  scanner is  enabled.  7  MDD – Recommended configuration items  The following outlines the MDD configuration items on mobile devices and the requirement for use at the PROTECTED  classification. Administrators must include a threat risk assessment matrix for PROTECTED and bespoke use cases, and  have a complete understanding of the risks associated with their decision around implementing a particular control.  Item Description and Risk Considerations  Requirement at  PROTECTED  New Admins Enables new device administrator applications. Organisation  decision  Factory Reset This configuration item will disable a local reset of the device to factory  settings.  If this setting is enabled and the device under goes factory reset, the device  will be unsupervised.  Organisation  decision  Android VPN Allows the VPN to be specified in the device settings.  All data communications for the Samsung Galaxy platform handling  government data must be through an Always On ‘StrongSwan’ VPN. The  Samsung Galaxy platform offers two versions of VPN client – OpenVPN and  StrongSwan. The StrongSwan client is enforced via the kernel and therefore  offers a stronger security claim for the VPN tunnel.  Recommended  Audio Recording Disables applications from using audio recordings. If enabled applications  may inadvertently record sensitive conversations.  Organisation  decision  Autofill service Enables the Autofill service application to be used. Similar to a password  manager, the device stores user information such as usernames and  passwords and then automatically completes forms when asked for them.  Recommended  Backup services Disables applications from using the Samsung cloud services to back up  data from the device.  Enabling this service may allow the transfer of sensitive government data  to the Samsung cloud service.  Not  recommended  Bluetooth Allows the device to use Bluetooth to connect to other devices and be used  to increase location accuracy.  If the use case does not require this feature, then this feature should be  disabled. This will reduce the attack surface on the device.  Organisation  decision  Bluetooth  Tethering  Allows the mobile device to share their network connection to other device  through Bluetooth connection.  If this item is enabled, the network can be exposed to other devices.  Not  recommended  8  Camera Photos and videos taken with the camera application are stored locally and  may be transferred automatically to locations that do not have sufficient  protection for sensitive government data.  Organisation  decision  Cell Data Mobile devices can be enabled to use cell data for internet connectivity.  The use of the always on StrongSwan VPN is recommended if using GSM  cellular data.  Organisation  decision  Certificate  management  Disable the ability of the user to modify the certificates on the device.  If this feature is enabled users will be able to manage the certificates on  the device. This includes self-signed certificates.  Organisation  decision  Developer mode Developer mode can be enabled allowing for mobile application  development. This configuration item will allow users to access system  level controls and should only be used for testing and development.

This configuration item allows data on a mobile device to be stored and  updated on an external server hosted by Google.  Not  recommended  Google Backups The mobile device is backed up with a google account.  This configuration item allows data on a mobile device to be stored and  updated on an external server hosted by Google.  Not  recommended  GPS This item configuration enables GPS to be used by the mobile device.  Information based on the device’s physical location is obtained and used by  the mobile device and third-party applications for various location-based  services.  Organisation  decision  Lock Notifications This will enable notifications to appear while the device is in a locked state.  Applications can send notification to the device, which can reveal  information and details of applications on the device.  Not  recommended  Microphone Applications requiring the devices microphone can be enabled or disabled.  This configuration item provides an additional control on apps and services  that are allowed to access the device microphone.  Organisation  decision  MMS Multimedia messaging service can be enabled on the device allowing  images, videos or sound clips to be sent and received. Sensitive information  can be transmitted through this service without appropriate safeguards in  place.  Not  recommended  9  Mock Locations The location of the physical device can be specified, instead of using the  device’s actual location. This enabled when developer mode is on. This  mode is usually used for testing and development purposes.  Not  recommended  Over-The-Air  Updates  The mobile device can be enabled to use Over-The-Air (OTA) android  updates. This will enable wireless updates of the OS, firmware or  application software.  Recommended  SD card Enables SD cards to be used by the device.  If the SD card contains malicious software, it can infect the mobile device.  Furthermore, sensitive information can be stored on the SD card and easily  transferred to another device. If enabled, the External Encrypt feature must  also be enabled.  Organisation  decision  Smart Lock Android can allow the bypass of security locked screen based on constant  movement (proximity to user), location, recognised voice or connection to  a device.  Not  recommended  SMS Short message service (SMS) allows text messaging to be sent and received  from the device.  Organisation  decision  Unknown Sources Disable the installation of APKs from Unknown Sources onto the device.  If enabled, APKs from unknown source/s can be installed on to the device.  Installing APKs from unknown sources can compromise the mobile device.  Recommended  USB Debugging Enabled in conjunction with developer mode turned on, this configuration  item allows applications to be copied via USB to the device.  Applications with malicious code can be transferred to the device. This  configuration is primarily used for testing purposes.  Not  recommended  USB Host Storage Allows the mobile device to act as a host for another device through a USB  connection (i.e. with an On The Go [OTG] adapter).  This configuration allows a mobile device to connect to external peripherals  such as a USB storage device.  Not  recommended  USB Mass Storage Through a physical USB connection and enabling this configuration item,  external mass storage such as flash drives and USB sticks can be connected  to the mobile device.  This would enable transfer of information between the device and external  storage. This can expose the device to malicious applications or  executables, and potentially unauthorised transfer of information.  Not  recommended.  USB Tethering The mobile device can be configured to share network connection to other  devices via USB connection. If this configuration is enabled, the mobile  device can act as an open gateway to the network.  Not  recommended  10  Video Recording Videos taken with the camera application are stored locally and may be  transferred automatically to locations that do not have sufficient  protections for government data.  Organisation  decision  WAP Push Wireless application protocol (WAP) push allows content such as web links  to be pushed to the mobile device.  Messages containing web links can direct users to untrusted websites,  which can present additional risks to the user and the device.  If there is a requirement to use this feature, organisations needs to  understand and accept the risks. Infrastructure (push proxy gateway) will  be required to support this feature.  Organisation  decision  Wi-Fi Enabling this configuration item will enable the mobile device to establish a  Wi-Fi connection.  System risk owners and administrators will need to assess risks associated  with the type of network that the mobile device will be connecting too.  Organisation  decision  Wi-Fi Direct Wi-Fi Direct allows a mobile device to have a direct connection with  another device, to transfer and receive data. If the connecting device is not  with an organisation supervised device, transferring and receiving of  sensitive government data will not have sufficient protection.  Not  recommended  Wi-Fi Tethering Wi-Fi tethering allows mobile device to share mobile data connection with  external devices.  Not  recommended  11  Knox – Recommended configuration items  The following table outlines the Knox configuration items available on Knox enabled mobile devices and the  requirement for use at the PROTECTED classification. Administrators need to perform a formal threat risk assessment  and have a complete understanding of the risks associated with their decision around implementing a particular  control.  Item Description and Risk Considerations  Requirement at  PROTECTED  Airplane Forces airplane mode to be on. The user will still be able to disable airplane  mode but this will trigger a fault and audit event.  Organisation  decision  Android Beam Enable Android beam, a NFC data transfer. Not  recommended  Block Non-Mil  Accounts  Switching this feature off will not block accounts which do not end in ‘.mil’.  If this feature is switched on, only accounts ending in ‘.mil’ are allowed to  be accessed by the mobile device. All other accounts are blocked.  Organisation  decision  Browser Autofill Enables login and personal information to be stored and automatically  filled into web forms. This will support different complex  passwords/passphrases to be used on webpages.  Recommended  Cell Voice Enabling this feature will allow voice calls to be made. A potential risk is  communication of sensitive information.  Recommended  Crash report Enabling this feature allows crash reports to be generated by the mobile  device in the event of an application not responding.  If disabled, technical reporting is not provided, making identification of  technical errors or potentially malicious applications difficult to determine.  Organisation  decision  Fingerprint  Unlock  If disabled the mobile device will not be able to be unlocked through  fingerprint recognition. Depending on the mobile device, the fingerprint  recognition system and the reliability can vary.  Organisation  decision  Google Play Enable the Google play store application to run.  Google play is a shop front for Android applications that can be installed  onto the mobile device. Unauthorised or potentially malicious applications  can be installed onto the device. The ‘Whitelist’, ‘Signature Whitelist’ and  ‘Blacklist’ feature can minimise this risk.  Not  recommended  Lockscreen  Camera  Enable the camera icon to appear on the phone lock screen.  If enabled, the camera can be easily used even when the mobile device is in  a locked state. This allows sensitive material to be photographed.  Organisation  decision  12  Lockscreen Icons Icons such as phone will be allowed to appear on the locked screen. This  will allow shortcuts to different applications (login will still be required).  The associated risk depends on the application. If an application contains  sensitive information then displaying the icon on the locked screen can  expose the types of applications, and the role of the device, to adversaries  if the device is lost or stolen.  Organisation  decision  Multi-user mode This is applied to tablet devices, if enabled multiple users are able to access  a single tablet device. As multiple users are able to access the tablet, users  can potentially access sensitive data from other accounts on that tablet  device.  Organisation  decision  NFC Enable Near-Field-Communication (NFC) will allow other devices to  communicate with the mobile device.  Organisation  decision  Samsung beam Builds on the functionality of the Android beam feature, where content can  be shared using NFC and Wi-Fi direct (peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connection).  If enabled, peer-to-peer communication can occur between devices. A  peer-to-peer connection to other devices, which may be external to the  organisation fleet, can present high risk to the device and the network.  Not  recommended  Samsung Voice  Google Assistant  Bixby  Personal voice activated assistant applications carry out the user’s  command by voice input. These applications may process conversation  taking place around the device at any time. Should these applications be  used, there is a risk that sensitive or classified conversations will be  transmitted, and the data could then be stored and processed by the voice  assistant servers without sufficient protections for classified government  data.  Not  recommended  Share via list Enable the ‘Share Via’ list to appear. If enabled, the user would be able to  share sensitive information through different applications with insufficient  protection for sensitive or classified data.  Not  recommended  YouTube Enable the use of the YouTube application. Allows videos to be streamed to  the device. User activities can also be monitored and tracked by the  application.  Not  recommended  13  MDD Premium – Recommended configuration  items  The following table outlines the MDD premium configuration items. It requires a premium Samsung Knox licence. The  table displays the requirement for use at the PROTECTED classification. Administrators need to perform a formal threat  risk assessment and have a complete understanding of the risks associated with their decision around implementing a  particular control.  Item Description and Risk Considerations  Requirement at  PROTECTED  Audit Log Enable Knox audit logging.  If disabled, monitoring the device activities will become difficult for error  identification and detecting possible security breaches.  Recommended  Auto Touch  sensitivity  If enabled the touchscreen sensitivity is enabled, the device is able to  automatically adjust the touchscreen’s sensitivity.  Organisation  decision  Bluetooth low  energy  Enables Bluetooth low energy which is used for increased location accuracy  and connection to devices.  If the use case does not require this feature, then this feature should be  disabled. This will reduce the attack surface on the device.  Organisation  decision  Certificate  revocation  Enable Knox certificate revocation.  Without this enabled, certificates will not be validated for against a known  list of revoked certificates. This can potentially allow invalid and  untrustworthy certificates to be used on the mobile device.  Recommended  LED indicator Disable the light emitting diode (LED) indicator on the device.  The LED indicator is used to indicate the status of the device and for  application notifications.  Organisation  decision  Online certificate  status protocol  The online certificate status protocol (OCSP) is an internet protocol used to  obtain the revocation status of certificates.  If disabled, the status of revocation certificates will be unknown to the  device.  Recommended  Tactical mode The mobile device is forced into airplane mode. User will not be able to  disable airplane mode.  If disabled the mobile device is not locked down and able to communicate.  Organisation  decision  14  Wi-Fi scanning Disables Wi-Fi scanning for increase location accuracy.  If enabled, the mobile device will use the Wi-Fi antenna to complement the  GPS and mobile tower information to increase the location accuracy of the  device.

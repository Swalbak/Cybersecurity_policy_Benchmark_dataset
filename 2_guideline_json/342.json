Targets include any  connected device, such as computers and mobile phones; however,  cybercriminals have been increasingly targeting cloud infrastructures. 1  This type of attack has not attracted much attention from law  enforcement agencies and its abuse is rarely reported 2 , mainly because  of its relatively few negative consequences. Nevertheless, organisations  may notice higher IT costs, degraded computer components, increased  electricity consumption and reduced employee productivity caused by  slower workstations. 3  2  13%  22%  21%2%  21%  18%  3% Other  Jsecoin  XMRig  RubyMiner  Cryptoloot  Coinhive  WannaMine  Figure 1: Top cryptomining malware globally .

Until its  closure, in March 2019, it had been highly abused by threat actors who  injected code into hacked websites to mine the Monero cryptocurrency  and divert funds to their own pockets. After its closure, the volume of  web-based cryptojacking hits dropped by 78% during the second half of  2019. 4  As a result of this decrease, cybercriminals begun focusing on  higher value targets, such as powerful servers 9 and cloud infrastructures.  1  Coinhive’s place at the top has since been taken 9 by Jsecoin (22%), XMRig  (21%) and Cryptoloot (21%). The distribution of top cryptomining malware  globally is presented in Figure 1.  _More attacks on cloud infrastructures  An increasing trend was visible in the first half of 2019, regarding incidents  of cryptocurrency-mining attacks on the cloud. 15,25  Cloud environments  usually employ mechanisms that tailor resources on-demand and are  therefore lucrative targets for running mining software. However, this  comes at the expense of website owners, who in turn need to pay higher  bills for exceeding quotas. 15  In the first half of 2019, vulnerabilities in cloud  container software increased by 46% compared with the same period in  2018. 26  Attackers have been successful in exploiting application  programming interfaces (APIs) and container management platforms in  order to install malicious images (e.g. Docker and Kubernetes) and mine  cryptocurrencies. 25  7  __Incidents  April 2019_Cryptojacking campaign dubbed Beapy,  exploited the EternalBlue vulnerability and affected  enterprises in China3  May 2019_Monero-mining malware PCASTLE  mostly targeted China-based systems, by employing  fileless arrival techniques19  Over 50.000 servers belonging to companies in the healthcare,  telecommunications, media and IT sectors were found to be  infected by malware mining the TurtleCoin (TRTL) cryptocurrency. 20  A new malware family named BlackSquid, utilized eight known  exploits including EternalBlue and DoublePulsar and subsequently  spread to web servers across Thailand and the United States so as  to deliver Monero mining scripts. 17,21  August 2019_Cryptojacking malware found in 11  RubyGem language repositories, exposing thousands  of users to cryptomining code22  8  Trends  _Shift towards file-based cryptomining  In 2019, a decline in browser-based cryptojacking in favour of file-based  cryptomining was noticed. File-based cryptomining 27  attacks spread  through malware and made use of pre-existing exploits on unpatched  operating systems such as EternalBlue and other high-risk vulnerabilities.  Factors contributing to this shift were the closure of the popular web-  based mining provider Coinhive 1  and the decline in cryptocurrency  values. 10  Another factor is that file-based cryptomining has always been  more efficient than web-based mining, being 25 times more profitable. 3  Threat actors adapted their malware with additional tools, to extract  sensitive information from the victim’s computer.  _Worldwide cryptojacking attacks are  decreasing  In 2019, a downwards trend 5 , in cryptojacking attacks was noticed, mainly  due to the closure of Coinhive 6 , the coordinated efforts of law  enforcement agencies, and the depreciation of the Monero  cryptocurrency . However, as cryptojacking attacks have been known to  follow cryptocurrency values, a service similar to Coinhive may emerge,  and fuel a new spike. Early statistics for 2020, show a 30% increase year-  on-year in March.  9  _Monero remained the cryptocurrency of  choice Similar to previous trends, Monero (XMR) was the cryptocurrency of choice  for 2019 cryptojacking activities. The reason is two-fold; first, Monero is  focused on privacy and anonymity and, therefore, the transactions cannot  be traced. Second, the Proof-of-Work algorithm is designed to make  mining viable with a standard CPU as opposed to specialized hardware. In  Q3 2019, 32% of exchanges traded privacy coins such as Monero.  However, in anticipation of new anti-money laundering regulations, many  exchanges opted to delist privacy coins.  _Most targeted countries  Figure 2: Most target countries by cryptojacking. Source: Trend Micro7  10  Attack Vectors  _Techniques  Cyber criminals used the following techniques to run or deliver  cryptominers:   by incorporating cryptojacking capabilities in existing malware; 10   by compromising websites; 11   by persistent drive-by attacks; 12   using social networks; 13   using mobile apps and app stores; 14   using exploit kits; 15   using advertising networks and malvertising; 16   using removable media; 17   and using wormable cryptominers. 18  File-based  mining  $750K  Browser- based  mining  $30K  Figure 3: How much can a coin-mining botnet make in 30 days? Source: Broadcom 3  11  _Proposed actions   Monitor battery usage on users’ devices and, in the case of suspicious  spikes in CPU usage, scan for the presence of file-based miners.   Implement content filtering to filter out unwanted attachments, e-mails  with malicious content and spam.   Implement filtering of the stratum mining protocol as well as blacklisting  the IP addresses and domains of popular mining pools.   Install end-point protection by means of anti-virus programs or  cryptominer blocking browser plug-ins.   Conduct regular security audits to detect network anomalies.   Implement robust vulnerability and patch management.   Use whitelisting to prevent unknown executables from being executed  at the endpoints.   Invest in raising users’ awareness of crytojacking, especially with regard  to secure browsing behaviour.   Implement patches and fixes against well-known exploits, such as  Eternal Blue, on less obvious targets, such as queue management  systems, POS terminals, and even vending machines.   Monitor and blacklist common cryptomining executables.

Source: Trend Micro7  10  Attack Vectors  _Techniques  Cyber criminals used the following techniques to run or deliver  cryptominers:   by incorporating cryptojacking capabilities in existing malware; 10   by compromising websites; 11   by persistent drive-by attacks; 12   using social networks; 13   using mobile apps and app stores; 14   using exploit kits; 15   using advertising networks and malvertising; 16   using removable media; 17   and using wormable cryptominers. 18  File-based  mining  $750K  Browser- based  mining  $30K  Figure 3: How much can a coin-mining botnet make in 30 days? Source: Broadcom 3  11  _Proposed actions   Monitor battery usage on users’ devices and, in the case of suspicious  spikes in CPU usage, scan for the presence of file-based miners.   Implement content filtering to filter out unwanted attachments, e-mails  with malicious content and spam.   Implement filtering of the stratum mining protocol as well as blacklisting  the IP addresses and domains of popular mining pools.   Install end-point protection by means of anti-virus programs or  cryptominer blocking browser plug-ins.   Conduct regular security audits to detect network anomalies.   Implement robust vulnerability and patch management.   Use whitelisting to prevent unknown executables from being executed  at the endpoints.   Invest in raising users’ awareness of crytojacking, especially with regard  to secure browsing behaviour.   Implement patches and fixes against well-known exploits, such as  Eternal Blue, on less obvious targets, such as queue management  systems, POS terminals, and even vending machines.   Monitor and blacklist common cryptomining executables.

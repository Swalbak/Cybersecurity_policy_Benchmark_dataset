CONCLUSIONS 13  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  JULY 2019  3  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  Electronic trust services are a range of services around digital signatures, digital certificates,  electronic seals, timestamps, etc. which are used in electronic transactions, to make them secure.  eIDAS, an EU regulation, is the EU wide legal framework ensuring interoperability and security of  these electronic trust services across the EU. One of the goals of eIDAS is to ensure that  electronic transactions can have the same legal standing as traditional paper based transactions.  eIDAS is important for the European digital market because it allows businesses and citizens to  work and use services across the EU. The eIDAS regulation was adopted in July 2014 and came  into force in 2016.  Article 19 of eIDAS introduces mandatory security breach notification requirements for TSPs in  the EU:   Trust service providers notify the national supervisory body about security breaches with  significant impact.   National supervisory bodies inform each other and ENISA if there is cross-border impact.   National supervisory bodies send annual summary reports about the notified breaches  to ENISA and the Commission.  This document, the Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2018 gives an aggregated  overview of these breaches, showing root causes, statistics and trends. It marks the third round  of security incident reporting for the EU’s trust services sector. The annual summary reporting  for 2018 totalled 18 incident reports, i.e. incidents with significant impact on the trust services. A  total of 28 EU countries and one 1 EFTA country take part  in annual summary reporting. We expect a further increase  of notified incidents, due increased adoption of trust  services market and growing familiarity with this breach  reporting process:  The key statistics relating to the 2018 incidents are:   Malicious actions and system failures are the  dominant root causes of reported incidents: In  the case of system failure, the corresponding  percentage (39% of the total) is consistent with  1 14  18  0  10  20  2016 2017 2018  Total number of notified  security breaches 2016 -  2018  MALICIOUS  ACTIONS  Malicious actions  have been  increasing rapidly  since last year  (7% of the total in  2017) and now  account for almost  two fifths of the  reported incidents  (39% of the total).  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  JULY 2019  4  the previous year (36% of the total in 2017). Malicious actions have been increasing  rapidly since last year (7% of the total in 2017) and now account for almost two fifths of  the reported incidents (39% of the total).   A few but critical security breaches with cross border impact: Just under a quarter  of the reported incidents had a cross border impact. Although the ratio is small, the  seriousness of the incidents was high as 75% of them were classified as level 4  (severe) and 5 (disastrous) in terms of severity. The latter highlights the importance of  cross-border collaboration and information sharing among the MS.   Qualified e-signatures certificates creation the most affected service: Roughly,  half of the incidents reported affected the qualified creation of qualified certificates for  e-signatures.   Most of incidents had significant impact, just one was disastrous: Half of the  incidents were submitted as “severity level 3” (significant impact) but only a minor 5%  of the total incidents reported (one incident) was characterized as disastrous.  ENISA will provide advice and input on the upcoming eIDAS review by the Commission, due  mid-2020. The Agency will also continue to support the national supervisory bodies with  implementing the breach reporting under Article 19 eIDAS and to work towards making this  process efficient and effective, yielding useful data, for the supervising bodies, for the  authorities of other sectors, as well as for the trust service providers and the organisations  relying on these trust services.  5%  5%  17%  5%  5%  17%  22%  44%  22%  22%  17%  0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50%  Signature certificate creation/verification  Web. authentication certificate creation/verification  Signature creation (on behalf of the signer)  Timestamp creation  Certificate validation  Other service  Seal certificate creation  Signature certificate creation  Website authentication certificate creation  Timestamp creation  Certificate validation  Incidents affecting services (detailed)  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  JULY 2019  5  1. INTRODUCTION  According to Article 19 of the eIDAS Regulation1, Electronic Trust Service Providers in the EU  have to notify the national supervisory bodies in their country about security incidents. Annually  the supervisory bodies send summaries of these incident reports to ENISA. Subsequently  ENISA publishes an aggregated overview of these security incidents. This document gives an  aggregate overview of the security incident reports submitted by the supervisory bodies over  2018.  This annual report marks the third round of security incident reporting in the EU’s trust services  sector, covering the security incidents of 2018.  This document only contains aggregated and anonymized information about incidents and does  not include details about individual countries or individual trust service providers. Detailed  discussions about the reported security incidents take place in the ENISA Article 19 expert  group, which is an informal group of experts from national supervisory bodies focusing on the  practical implementation of Article 19. The group is currently chaired by a representative from  RTR, the Austrian regulatory authority. ENISA acts as the secretariat and supports the group  with analysis, drafting, logistics, etc.  1 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification  and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC, can be consulted at  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  JULY 2019  6  2. INCIDENT REPORTING FRAMEWORK  AND EXAMPLES OF INCIDENTS  Article 19 of eIDAS requires trust service providers in the EU to assess risks and take  appropriate security measures to mitigate security breaches. Article 19 also introduces  mandatory security breach notification requirements these providers:   Trust service providers notify the national supervisory body about security breaches with  significant impact.   National supervisory bodies inform each other and ENISA if there is cross-border impact.   National supervisory bodies send annual summary reports about the notified breaches  to ENISA and the Commission.  We give some specific examples of incidents to give an idea of the kind of incidents, which were  notified to the national supervisory bodies:   A human error in issuing qualified certificates  Duration: months  Services affected: qualified creation of qualified certificates for e-signatures, Cause:  human error  Level of severity: 3 – significant  A TSP issued two qualified certificates whose subject contained the name of the  registration officer instead of the persons to whom the certificates should have been  issued. There was no impact on personal data except the registration officer’s name.  The certificates were revoked and the TSP informed all registration authorities about  possible sources of error in the process of issuing a qualified certificate. Moreover, the  registration platform was changed so that it is no longer possible that a registration  officer issues a qualified certificate to him/herself.   Attack by DDoS against hardware provider IP addressing  Duration: minutes  Services affected: qualified creation of qualified certificates for e-signatures, e-seals,  Article 19  of eIDAS  requires  trust service  providers in  the EU to  assess risks  and take  appropriate  security  measures to  mitigate  security  breaches.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  JULY 2019  7  website authentication and qualified creation of qualified e-timestamps  Cause: malicious actions  Level of severity: 4 – severe  A DDoS attack against hardware provider IP addressing caused saturation  phenomena in the links with the international carriers resulting in high use of the links  with the national carriers. The incident had a cross border impact. The provider  informed all affected customers and afterwards contacted the hardware provider to  open a ticket.   Network cable damage caused unavailability of trust services for roughly a day  Duration: hours  Services affected: qualified creation of qualified e-timestamps  Cause: third party failures,  Level of severity: 4 - severe  Damage to a network cable, was caused by fire of a nearby electric cable, and led to  unavailability of trust services for almost 100 subscribers. The incident had no impact  on personal data. Users and internet service providers were informed after incident  detection.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  JULY 2019  8  3. ANALYSIS OF REPORTED INCIDENTS  The 2018 annual summary reporting, by the 28 EU Member States and 1 EFTA country  participating in this process, included in total 18 security incidents2. This is only the third round  of annual summary reporting, because eIDAS came into force only recently, on the 1st of July  2016.  We expect the number of notified security breaches to continue to increase as the trust services  market continues to grow and providers become more familiar with the breach reporting  process.  3.1 ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  For 2018 the most common root causes of security incidents were system failures (7 incidents,  39% of the total) and malicious actions (7 incidents, 39% of the total). The latter is significantly  higher than in 2017 when malicious actions accounted for just one incident. Only a tenth of the  incidents are third party failures, another tenth are human errors.  2 Note that two of the reported incidents were indicated as level 2 severity (insignificant impact) and included in the analysis  39%  39%  11%  11%  Root causes of trust services security incidents - 2018  System failures  Malicious actions  Human errors  Third party failures  1  14  18  0  5  10  15  20  2016 2017 2018  Reported incidents over the period 2016 - 2018  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  JULY 2019  9  3.2 DETAILED CAUSES  The four most common causes of incidents are software bugs, hardware failures, DDoS attacks  and policy/procedure flaws.  3.3 SERVICES AFFECTED  In this section we look which services were impacted by incidents.  3.3.1 Trust services affected in detail  Most of the reported incidents affected the qualified signature certificate creation (44% of total  incidents). This is consistent with last year. Website authentication certificate creation, seal  certificate creation and timestamp creation were the second most affected services among the  qualified ones. (22% of total incidents for each service). Approximately a fifth of the reported  incidents (17% of total) affected the validation of e-signatures/e-seals.  5%  5%  17%  5%  5%  17%  22%  44%  22%  22%  17%  0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50%  Signature certificate creation/verification  Web. authentication certificate creation/verification  Signature creation (on behalf of the signer)  Timestamp creation  Certificate validation  Other service  Seal certificate creation  Signature certificate creation  Website authentication certificate creation  Timestamp creation  Certificate validation  Incidents affecting services (detailed)  1  1  4  3  3  1  1  1  3  2  1  0 1 2 3 4  Human error in issuing qualified certificates  Cryptanalysis  Software bug  Denial of service attack  Hardware failure  Power cut  Faulty software change/update  Overload  Policy or procedure flaw  Theft or loss of data  Theft or loss of equipment  Detailed causes of trust services security incidents - 2018  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  JULY 2019  10  3.3.2 Qualified versus non-qualified  This year, approximately three quarters of the total incidents had an impact on qualified services  (i.e. qualified signature certificate creation, qualified seal certificate creation, etc.). The  corresponding percentage for non-qualified services is just over a quarter. Note that one  incident report could involve multiple trust services, which explains why the percentages in the  charts here add up to more than 100%.  3.4 SECURITY INCIDENTS WITH CROSS BORDER IMPACT  Approximately one quarter of the security incidents (4 incidents, 22%) had an impact across  borders, in the other EU Member States. In most cases of cross border impact, supervisory  bodies informed other MS by initiating the cross-border incident notification procedure.  Half of the incidents with cross-border impact were rated as severe (level 4) and a quarter of  them were reported as disastrous (level 5) indicating the importance of cross-border  collaboration and information sharing. Incidents without cross-border impact were less critical as  only 30% of them were submitted as severe while most of them (57%) were classified as level 3  (significant impact) in terms of severity.  22%  78%  Cross-border impact - Trust Services security incidents  Cross-border impact No cross-border impact  78%  28%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  Incidents affecting services (Qualified/Non-qualified)  Qualified services Non qualified services  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  JULY 2019  11  3.5 LEVEL OF SEVERITY  In 2018 half of the reported incidents had severity level 3 (significant impact), while a third of the  incidents were severe.

CONCLUSIONS  Two years after the adoption of the eIDAS regulation, the electronic trust services market is  growing, as is the number of applications and processes relying on electronic identities. eIDAS  is becoming an enabler for the single digital market. Web certificates (for HTTPS, i.e. SSL/TLS)  are now the norm, thanks to innovative projects, like ‘Let’s encrypt’, and the joint work of the  web browser manufacturers. The collaboration between the supervisory bodies across the EU is  delivering results. ENISA looks forward to continuing to support the supervisory bodies across  the EU as well as the Commission, with the security aspects of implementing eIDAS.  We make some general observations below:   Cross eIDAS collaboration and information sharing: Under eIDAS there is a  cooperation network of authorities for national electronic identity systems, and there is  a group of national supervisory bodies for the electronic trust services market. But from  a security perspective these areas are closely related. Security issues with an  electronic identity system, often have an impact on trust services, for example, many  certificate authorities use electronic identities for authentication. Similarly, security  issues with electronic trust services, often have an impact on eID systems, for  example, many eID systems are built with trust services. Collaboration and information  sharing related to incidents, threats, good practices, etc. is important.   Situational awareness: We believe situational awareness about vulnerabilities and  threats will help the supervisory bodies to do a more effective supervision. ENISA will  continue to facilitate information sharing between the relevant authorities and  supervisory bodies.   Connecting the security supervision of NISD, eIDAS, and European Electronic  Communication Code (EECC): The start of 2019 saw a very successful campaign of  cyberattacks. The attack, referred to as DNSpionage, used weaknesses in TLD to  poison DNS, to obtain fake web certificates, and subsequently man-in-the-middle traffic  between employees and the targeted organizations. Media reports suggest the  attackers have been highly successful in capturing large amounts of information from  these organizations. This attack touches different areas, under different EU laws. This  attack shows why it is so important to establish a close connection with regular  information exchange and updates between eIDAS, the EECC and the Digital  infrastructures part of the NIS Directive.   Security supervision of non-qualified web certificates: A crucial part of the trust  services market are the web certificates, used for HTTPS and other TLS encrypted  channels. However, it is not easy to supervise this area. Providers of these certificates  are not obliged to register with a national supervisory body and many organizations  use providers outside the EU. The ex-post (light-touch) supervision regime for digital  service providers, under the NIS Directive, could be an option.  The Commission will be reviewing the eIDAS regulation in 2020. We look forward to supporting  this eIDAS review and contributing with advice.  ENISA looks  forward to  continuing to  support the  supervisory  bodies across  the EU as well as  the Commission,  with the security  aspects of  implementing  eIDAS  T P  -A K  -1 9 -0  0 1 -E  N -N  ABOUT ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) is working to make Europe cyber  secure since 2004.

There was no impact on personal data except the registration officer’s name.  The certificates were revoked and the TSP informed all registration authorities about  possible sources of error in the process of issuing a qualified certificate. Moreover, the  registration platform was changed so that it is no longer possible that a registration  officer issues a qualified certificate to him/herself.   Attack by DDoS against hardware provider IP addressing  Duration: minutes  Services affected: qualified creation of qualified certificates for e-signatures, e-seals,  Article 19  of eIDAS  requires  trust service  providers in  the EU to  assess risks  and take  appropriate  security  measures to  mitigate  security  breaches.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  JULY 2019  7  website authentication and qualified creation of qualified e-timestamps  Cause: malicious actions  Level of severity: 4 – severe  A DDoS attack against hardware provider IP addressing caused saturation  phenomena in the links with the international carriers resulting in high use of the links  with the national carriers. The incident had a cross border impact. The provider  informed all affected customers and afterwards contacted the hardware provider to  open a ticket.   Network cable damage caused unavailability of trust services for roughly a day  Duration: hours  Services affected: qualified creation of qualified e-timestamps  Cause: third party failures,  Level of severity: 4 - severe  Damage to a network cable, was caused by fire of a nearby electric cable, and led to  unavailability of trust services for almost 100 subscribers. The incident had no impact  on personal data. Users and internet service providers were informed after incident  detection.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  JULY 2019  8  3. ANALYSIS OF REPORTED INCIDENTS  The 2018 annual summary reporting, by the 28 EU Member States and 1 EFTA country  participating in this process, included in total 18 security incidents2. This is only the third round  of annual summary reporting, because eIDAS came into force only recently, on the 1st of July  2016.  We expect the number of notified security breaches to continue to increase as the trust services  market continues to grow and providers become more familiar with the breach reporting  process.  3.1 ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  For 2018 the most common root causes of security incidents were system failures (7 incidents,  39% of the total) and malicious actions (7 incidents, 39% of the total). The latter is significantly  higher than in 2017 when malicious actions accounted for just one incident. Only a tenth of the  incidents are third party failures, another tenth are human errors.  2 Note that two of the reported incidents were indicated as level 2 severity (insignificant impact) and included in the analysis  39%  39%  11%  11%  Root causes of trust services security incidents - 2018  System failures  Malicious actions  Human errors  Third party failures  1  14  18  0  5  10  15  20  2016 2017 2018  Reported incidents over the period 2016 - 2018  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  JULY 2019  9  3.2 DETAILED CAUSES  The four most common causes of incidents are software bugs, hardware failures, DDoS attacks  and policy/procedure flaws.  3.3 SERVICES AFFECTED  In this section we look which services were impacted by incidents.  3.3.1 Trust services affected in detail  Most of the reported incidents affected the qualified signature certificate creation (44% of total  incidents). This is consistent with last year. Website authentication certificate creation, seal  certificate creation and timestamp creation were the second most affected services among the  qualified ones. (22% of total incidents for each service). Approximately a fifth of the reported  incidents (17% of total) affected the validation of e-signatures/e-seals.  5%  5%  17%  5%  5%  17%  22%  44%  22%  22%  17%  0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50%  Signature certificate creation/verification  Web. authentication certificate creation/verification  Signature creation (on behalf of the signer)  Timestamp creation  Certificate validation  Other service  Seal certificate creation  Signature certificate creation  Website authentication certificate creation  Timestamp creation  Certificate validation  Incidents affecting services (detailed)  1  1  4  3  3  1  1  1  3  2  1  0 1 2 3 4  Human error in issuing qualified certificates  Cryptanalysis  Software bug  Denial of service attack  Hardware failure  Power cut  Faulty software change/update  Overload  Policy or procedure flaw  Theft or loss of data  Theft or loss of equipment  Detailed causes of trust services security incidents - 2018  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  JULY 2019  10  3.3.2 Qualified versus non-qualified  This year, approximately three quarters of the total incidents had an impact on qualified services  (i.e. qualified signature certificate creation, qualified seal certificate creation, etc.). The  corresponding percentage for non-qualified services is just over a quarter. Note that one  incident report could involve multiple trust services, which explains why the percentages in the  charts here add up to more than 100%.  3.4 SECURITY INCIDENTS WITH CROSS BORDER IMPACT  Approximately one quarter of the security incidents (4 incidents, 22%) had an impact across  borders, in the other EU Member States. In most cases of cross border impact, supervisory  bodies informed other MS by initiating the cross-border incident notification procedure.  Half of the incidents with cross-border impact were rated as severe (level 4) and a quarter of  them were reported as disastrous (level 5) indicating the importance of cross-border  collaboration and information sharing. Incidents without cross-border impact were less critical as  only 30% of them were submitted as severe while most of them (57%) were classified as level 3  (significant impact) in terms of severity.  22%  78%  Cross-border impact - Trust Services security incidents  Cross-border impact No cross-border impact  78%  28%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  Incidents affecting services (Qualified/Non-qualified)  Qualified services Non qualified services  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2018  JULY 2019  11  3.5 LEVEL OF SEVERITY  In 2018 half of the reported incidents had severity level 3 (significant impact), while a third of the  incidents were severe.

CONCLUSIONS  Two years after the adoption of the eIDAS regulation, the electronic trust services market is  growing, as is the number of applications and processes relying on electronic identities. eIDAS  is becoming an enabler for the single digital market. Web certificates (for HTTPS, i.e. SSL/TLS)  are now the norm, thanks to innovative projects, like ‘Let’s encrypt’, and the joint work of the  web browser manufacturers. The collaboration between the supervisory bodies across the EU is  delivering results. ENISA looks forward to continuing to support the supervisory bodies across  the EU as well as the Commission, with the security aspects of implementing eIDAS.  We make some general observations below:   Cross eIDAS collaboration and information sharing: Under eIDAS there is a  cooperation network of authorities for national electronic identity systems, and there is  a group of national supervisory bodies for the electronic trust services market. But from  a security perspective these areas are closely related. Security issues with an  electronic identity system, often have an impact on trust services, for example, many  certificate authorities use electronic identities for authentication. Similarly, security  issues with electronic trust services, often have an impact on eID systems, for  example, many eID systems are built with trust services. Collaboration and information  sharing related to incidents, threats, good practices, etc. is important.   Situational awareness: We believe situational awareness about vulnerabilities and  threats will help the supervisory bodies to do a more effective supervision. ENISA will  continue to facilitate information sharing between the relevant authorities and  supervisory bodies.   Connecting the security supervision of NISD, eIDAS, and European Electronic  Communication Code (EECC): The start of 2019 saw a very successful campaign of  cyberattacks. The attack, referred to as DNSpionage, used weaknesses in TLD to  poison DNS, to obtain fake web certificates, and subsequently man-in-the-middle traffic  between employees and the targeted organizations. Media reports suggest the  attackers have been highly successful in capturing large amounts of information from  these organizations. This attack touches different areas, under different EU laws. This  attack shows why it is so important to establish a close connection with regular  information exchange and updates between eIDAS, the EECC and the Digital  infrastructures part of the NIS Directive.   Security supervision of non-qualified web certificates: A crucial part of the trust  services market are the web certificates, used for HTTPS and other TLS encrypted  channels. However, it is not easy to supervise this area. Providers of these certificates  are not obliged to register with a national supervisory body and many organizations  use providers outside the EU. The ex-post (light-touch) supervision regime for digital  service providers, under the NIS Directive, could be an option.  The Commission will be reviewing the eIDAS regulation in 2020. We look forward to supporting  this eIDAS review and contributing with advice.  ENISA looks  forward to  continuing to  support the  supervisory  bodies across  the EU as well as  the Commission,  with the security  aspects of  implementing  eIDAS  T P  -A K  -1 9 -0  0 1 -E  N -N  ABOUT ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) is working to make Europe cyber  secure since 2004.

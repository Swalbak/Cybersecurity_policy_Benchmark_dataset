Section 6.2 identifies any additional requirements for the Security 193  Policy that are documented in other publications. Section 6.3 provides descriptions of the 194  structure of the Security Policy and how the requirements in sections 6.1 and 6.2 map into that 195  structure. Appendix A indicates specific details for the module information that will be entered 196  in table format within the Web Cryptik application. 197  Modifications 198  Modifications to ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 - Cryptographic module security policy - will 199  follow a similar format as in ISO/IEC 24759. For additions to test requirements, new Test 200  Evidence (TEs) or Vendor Evidence (VEs) will be listed by increasing the “sequence_number.” 201  Modifications can include a combination of additions using underline and deletions using 202  strikethrough. If no changes are required, the paragraph will indicate “No change.” 203  ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B includes security policy requirements in bulleted form but does not 204  include ways to format the required information. Modifications are addressed by adding 205  formatting guidance (e.g., tables, images, etc.), adding underlined text, or using strikethrough for 206  deletion. If no changes are required, the paragraph will indicate “No change.” Additional 207  guidance may also be included to address requirements presented in SP 800-140, SP 800-140A, 208  SP 800-140C, SP 800-140D, SP 800-140E, and SP 800-140F. 209  Security requirements 210  Changes to ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 and ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B 211  Requirements 212  All requirements from ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 and ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B apply and are 213  required in the security policy as applicable.  214  ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B uses the same section naming convention as ISO/IEC 19790 section 7 - 215  Security requirements. For example, Annex B section B.2.1 is named “General” and B.2.2 is 216  named “Cryptographic module specification,” which is the same as ISO/IEC 19790 section 7.1 217  and section 7.2, respectively. Therefore, the format of the security policy shall be presented in 218  the same order as indicated in Annex B, starting with “General” and ending with “Mitigation of 219  other attacks.” If sections are not applicable, they shall be marked as such in the security policy.  220  ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 – Cryptographic module security policy requirements are modified 221  as indicated below: 222  No Change. 223  NIST SP 800-140Br1 2pd  CMVP Security Policy Requirements  October 2022  3  ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B requirements are modified as indicated below: 224  B.2.1 General 225  226  No Change. 227  228  B.2.2 Cryptographic module specification 229  230  • Illustrative diagram, schematic or photograph of the module. A photograph included for 231  hardware modules. If the security policy encompasses multiple versions of the module, 232  each version is represented separately or annotated that the representation is illustrated 233  for all versions. For a software or , firmware, hybrid, or a sub-chip cryptographic module, 234  the security policy includes a block diagram that illustrates: 235  o the location of the logical object of the software or firmware module with respect 236  to the operating system, other supporting applications and the cryptographic 237  boundary so that all the logical and physical layers between the logical object and 238  the cryptographic boundary are clearly defined; and 239  o the interactions of the Logical Object - the interactions of the logical object of the 240  software or firmware module with the operating system and other supporting 241  applications resident within the cryptographic boundary. 242  o Tested Operational Environment’s Physical Perimeter (TOEPP) – location of the 243  cryptographic module with respect to the TOEPP that is part of the module’s 244  tested configuration but may be outside the module’s cryptographic boundary, so 245  that all the logical and physical layers between the cryptographic module and the 246  TOEPP are clearly defined.  This also includes a description and components list 247  of the TOEPP. 248  • Precise definition of the module’s physical TOEPP and cryptographic boundariesy: 249  250  B.2.3 Cryptographic module interfaces 251  252  No Change. 253  254  B.2.4 Roles, services, and authentication 255  256  No Change. 257  258  B.2.5 Software/Firmware security 259  260  NIST SP 800-140Br1 2pd  CMVP Security Policy Requirements  October 2022  4  No Change. 261  262  B.2.6 Operational environment 263  264  No Change. 265  266  B.2.7 Physical security 267  268  No Change. 269  270  B.2.8 Non-invasive security 271  272  No Change. 273  274  B.2.9 Sensitive security parameters management 275  276  • Provide a key SSP table specifying the key SSP type(s), strength(s) in bits, security 277  function(s), security function certification number(s), where and how the key(s) SSP(s) is 278  generated, whether the key(s) SSP(s) is imported or exported what method(s) is used to 279  input or output the SSP(s), any SSP generation and establishment method used and 280  indicate any related keys SSPs. 281  • Specify the electronic and manual key SSP I/O method(s). 282  • Specify the SSP storage technique(s) areas, formats (encrypted or plaintext), and 283  persistence types (dynamic or static). 284  285  B.2.10 Self-tests 286  287  No Change. 288  289  B.2.11 Life-cycle assurance 290  291  No Change. 292  293  B.2.12 Mitigation of other attacks 294  295  No Change. 296  297  NIST SP 800-140Br1 2pd  CMVP Security Policy Requirements  October 2022  5  Documentation requirement additions 298  In addition to ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 and ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B, other publications and 299  documents specify documentation requirements for the Security Policy. Many of these 300  requirements relate to specific conditions and configurations of modules and would not be 301  applicable in many cases. 302  These additional requirements are listed for each section of the Security Policy, grouped by the 303  source publication or document and reference the specific section from the document where the 304  requirement is stated. Where possible, they are direct statements from the source documents and 305  would often require the original context to best understand the requirement. 306  307  B.2.1 General 308  309  No Additions. 310  311  B.2.2 Cryptographic module specification 312  313  SP800-140:VE02.20.04 314  1.

All of the requirement statements are organized into appropriately named and 376  numbered sub-sections (i.e. 1.2- Security Levels, 2.1 – Purpose or Use). Each sub-section 377  identifies the applicable requirements and provides any clarifying and explanatory notes for that 378  sub-section. 379  A significant portion of the security policy information will be structured and interrelated. These 380  tables can be input through Web Cryptik or uploaded in JSON format which would follow a 381  provided schema and table relationship constraints. 382  The text/picture portions of the security policy will be entered into a provided Microsoft Word 383  template document, which follows a specific structure. Within this document are content controls 384  serving as placeholders for the structured content in Web Cryptik and/or the uploaded JSON file. 385  In this update to 140B and the corresponding update to Web Cryptik, the labs/vendors will be 386  selecting algorithms, modes, and properties from the sets that have been tested through the 387  CAVP process. This will replace the previous process of separately enter that information. 388  Part of the initial information labs/vendors enter into Web Cryptik will be the CAVP Certificate 389  numbers associated with the algorithm tests for that particular module. Web Cryptik will then 390  retrieve and display the relevant information from the CAVP system. Each algorithm/operational 391  environment entry will be listed, along with the set of properties for that test. The lab/vendor will 392  then select the specific items that are implemented in the module. When algorithms are tested in 393  multiple operating environments, they will each have a separate entry in the list. 394  The selected subset will be saved, maintained with the rest of the module’s information, and used 395  to generate the Tested Algorithm table in the Security Policy. 396  All this information (the structured JSON, the uploaded document, and the selected CAVP test 397  information) will be combined into the final security policy and provided as a PDF file. Any 398  changes to the security policy would require making changes to the corresponding source and 399  generating a new version. 400  401  1.0 General 402  403  NIST SP 800-140Br1 2pd  CMVP Security Policy Requirements  October 2022  8  1.1 Overview 404  405  Notes: Overview information desired by the vendor 406  407  Input Method: Template Document 408  409  1.2 Security Levels 410  Annex B Requirement Statements 411  1.

This could include a reference to a specific Publication 1436  NIST SP 800-140Br1 2pd  CMVP Security Policy Requirements  October 2022  40  Section, IG, etc. This is where appropriate bit strength caveats should be included 1437  for KAS and KTS. 1438  o Algorithms – what Algorithms from the tested and allowed lists are part of the 1439  implementation. Include prerequisites. 1440  o Algorithm Properties – If a subset of the available properties are used, specify. 1441  • What is meant by Implementations of Security Functions 1442  o A module can (and often does) have more than one implementation for a given 1443  Security Function type 1444   A KTS that uses an authenticated encryption mode vs. separate encryption 1445  and authentication would both be KTS but would have two 1446  implementation entries 1447   A SigVer could be used for role/identity authentication and also for an 1448  integrity test 1449   Block Cipher could include modes for storage (XTS) or as part of a KTS 1450   The same algorithm could be used with different key sizes to support 1451  different sizes 1452  o For many modules, there would likely be one SFI for a SF type. 1453  • Why these wouldn’t just map directly to Services 1454  o At times, these could map directly to services, particularly for modules like 1455  software libraries. 1456  o Documenting in this manner will clarify which algorithms are actual services 1457  provided and which are supporting or prerequisite 1458  o When the same category SF algorithms are used for different functions and 1459  therefore different services, there should be separate SFIs. Many modules have 1460  multiple DigSigVer implementations. For example, one for authentication during 1461  an SSH connection and one for the module startup integrity test. These should be 1462  separately defined as implementations and then mapped to different services. 1463  o Requiring the Services to map directly to the Security Functions seems to 1464  overreach into the vendor’s design of their module. The Services and 1465  corresponding level of granularity should be left to the vendor to determine. 1466  • There should only be entries for top-level functions. For example, if SHA2-256 is only 1467  used for Hash DRBG, then it shouldn’t be included as a separate Secure Hash entry. And, 1468  if the DRBG is only a supporting function (for example, just a prerequisite to Symmetric 1469  Key Generation), then DRBG shouldn’t be a separate entry in this table. The Services 1470  table will include the Security Function Implementations, so often that will likely 1471  determine what is a top-level entry. 1472  • All the supporting and prerequisite algorithms for that implementation would be included 1473  in the Algorithms column. 1474  • Every tested and allowed algorithm should be included somewhere in this table. 1475  NIST SP 800-140Br1 2pd  CMVP Security Policy Requirements  October 2022  41  • Every SFI should be included in the Services table. 1476  1477  Entropy Sources (2.9) 1478  1479  Table 11.

Document Revisions 1677  Edition Date Change  Revision 1  (r1)  [date] This revision introduces four significant changes to SP 800- 140B:  1. Defines a more detailed structure and organization for  the Security Policy  2. Captures Security Policy requirements that are defined  outside of ISO/IEC 19790 and ISO/IEC 24759  3. Builds the Security Policy document as a combination  of the subsection information  4. Generates the approved algorithm table based on  lab/vendor selections from the algorithm tests  1678  In October 2022, the following changes were made to the document for the second public draft: 1679  • Section 6.1 – Included additional changes to ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B requirements in 1680  the following sub-sections: 1681  o B.2.2 Cryptographic module specification – added TOEPP description 1682  o B.2.9 Sensitive security parameters management – updated SSP wording and 1683  specified SSP storage techniques. 1684  • Section 6.2 – Removed references to security policy requirements included in 1685  Implementation Guidance. These will be identified and tracked separately. 1686  • Section 6.3 1687  o Simplified security policy document structure by combining and reordering 1688  subsections. 1689  o Changed input method for rich text sections of the security policy from entering 1690  subsections separately in Web Cryptik to including them directly in a template 1691  document. 1692  o Indicated which subsections and columns are optional 1693  o Removed Implementation Guidance requirements specifications (see item above). 1694  Note that these requirements remain applicable but will be identified and tracked 1695  separately. 1696  o Added tables to Appendix A 1697   Executable Code Sets – Software/Firmware/Hybrid (2.3) 1698   Modes of Operation (2.5) 1699  o Changed tables in Appendix A 1700   Operating Environments – Hardware (2.3) 1701   Operating Environments – Software/Firmware/Hybrid (2.3) 1702   Entropy Sources (2.9) 1703  NIST SP 800-140Br1 2pd  CMVP Security Policy Requirements  October 2022  50   SSPs (9.4) 1704   Pre-Operational Self-Tests (10.1) 1705   Conditional Self-Tests (10.2) 1706   Error States (10.3) 1707  1.

Section 6.2 identifies any additional requirements for the Security 193  Policy that are documented in other publications. Section 6.3 provides descriptions of the 194  structure of the Security Policy and how the requirements in sections 6.1 and 6.2 map into that 195  structure. Appendix A indicates specific details for the module information that will be entered 196  in table format within the Web Cryptik application. 197  Modifications 198  Modifications to ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 - Cryptographic module security policy - will 199  follow a similar format as in ISO/IEC 24759. For additions to test requirements, new Test 200  Evidence (TEs) or Vendor Evidence (VEs) will be listed by increasing the “sequence_number.” 201  Modifications can include a combination of additions using underline and deletions using 202  strikethrough. If no changes are required, the paragraph will indicate “No change.” 203  ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B includes security policy requirements in bulleted form but does not 204  include ways to format the required information. Modifications are addressed by adding 205  formatting guidance (e.g., tables, images, etc.), adding underlined text, or using strikethrough for 206  deletion. If no changes are required, the paragraph will indicate “No change.” Additional 207  guidance may also be included to address requirements presented in SP 800-140, SP 800-140A, 208  SP 800-140C, SP 800-140D, SP 800-140E, and SP 800-140F. 209  Security requirements 210  Changes to ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 and ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B 211  Requirements 212  All requirements from ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 and ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B apply and are 213  required in the security policy as applicable.  214  ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B uses the same section naming convention as ISO/IEC 19790 section 7 - 215  Security requirements. For example, Annex B section B.2.1 is named “General” and B.2.2 is 216  named “Cryptographic module specification,” which is the same as ISO/IEC 19790 section 7.1 217  and section 7.2, respectively. Therefore, the format of the security policy shall be presented in 218  the same order as indicated in Annex B, starting with “General” and ending with “Mitigation of 219  other attacks.” If sections are not applicable, they shall be marked as such in the security policy.  220  ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 – Cryptographic module security policy requirements are modified 221  as indicated below: 222  No Change. 223  NIST SP 800-140Br1 2pd  CMVP Security Policy Requirements  October 2022  3  ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B requirements are modified as indicated below: 224  B.2.1 General 225  226  No Change. 227  228  B.2.2 Cryptographic module specification 229  230  • Illustrative diagram, schematic or photograph of the module. A photograph included for 231  hardware modules. If the security policy encompasses multiple versions of the module, 232  each version is represented separately or annotated that the representation is illustrated 233  for all versions. For a software or , firmware, hybrid, or a sub-chip cryptographic module, 234  the security policy includes a block diagram that illustrates: 235  o the location of the logical object of the software or firmware module with respect 236  to the operating system, other supporting applications and the cryptographic 237  boundary so that all the logical and physical layers between the logical object and 238  the cryptographic boundary are clearly defined; and 239  o the interactions of the Logical Object - the interactions of the logical object of the 240  software or firmware module with the operating system and other supporting 241  applications resident within the cryptographic boundary. 242  o Tested Operational Environment’s Physical Perimeter (TOEPP) – location of the 243  cryptographic module with respect to the TOEPP that is part of the module’s 244  tested configuration but may be outside the module’s cryptographic boundary, so 245  that all the logical and physical layers between the cryptographic module and the 246  TOEPP are clearly defined.  This also includes a description and components list 247  of the TOEPP. 248  • Precise definition of the module’s physical TOEPP and cryptographic boundariesy: 249  250  B.2.3 Cryptographic module interfaces 251  252  No Change. 253  254  B.2.4 Roles, services, and authentication 255  256  No Change. 257  258  B.2.5 Software/Firmware security 259  260  NIST SP 800-140Br1 2pd  CMVP Security Policy Requirements  October 2022  4  No Change. 261  262  B.2.6 Operational environment 263  264  No Change. 265  266  B.2.7 Physical security 267  268  No Change. 269  270  B.2.8 Non-invasive security 271  272  No Change. 273  274  B.2.9 Sensitive security parameters management 275  276  • Provide a key SSP table specifying the key SSP type(s), strength(s) in bits, security 277  function(s), security function certification number(s), where and how the key(s) SSP(s) is 278  generated, whether the key(s) SSP(s) is imported or exported what method(s) is used to 279  input or output the SSP(s), any SSP generation and establishment method used and 280  indicate any related keys SSPs. 281  • Specify the electronic and manual key SSP I/O method(s). 282  • Specify the SSP storage technique(s) areas, formats (encrypted or plaintext), and 283  persistence types (dynamic or static). 284  285  B.2.10 Self-tests 286  287  No Change. 288  289  B.2.11 Life-cycle assurance 290  291  No Change. 292  293  B.2.12 Mitigation of other attacks 294  295  No Change. 296  297  NIST SP 800-140Br1 2pd  CMVP Security Policy Requirements  October 2022  5  Documentation requirement additions 298  In addition to ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 and ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B, other publications and 299  documents specify documentation requirements for the Security Policy.

All of the requirement statements are organized into appropriately named and 376  numbered sub-sections (i.e. 1.2- Security Levels, 2.1 – Purpose or Use). Each sub-section 377  identifies the applicable requirements and provides any clarifying and explanatory notes for that 378  sub-section. 379  A significant portion of the security policy information will be structured and interrelated. These 380  tables can be input through Web Cryptik or uploaded in JSON format which would follow a 381  provided schema and table relationship constraints. 382  The text/picture portions of the security policy will be entered into a provided Microsoft Word 383  template document, which follows a specific structure. Within this document are content controls 384  serving as placeholders for the structured content in Web Cryptik and/or the uploaded JSON file. 385  In this update to 140B and the corresponding update to Web Cryptik, the labs/vendors will be 386  selecting algorithms, modes, and properties from the sets that have been tested through the 387  CAVP process. This will replace the previous process of separately enter that information. 388  Part of the initial information labs/vendors enter into Web Cryptik will be the CAVP Certificate 389  numbers associated with the algorithm tests for that particular module. Web Cryptik will then 390  retrieve and display the relevant information from the CAVP system. Each algorithm/operational 391  environment entry will be listed, along with the set of properties for that test. The lab/vendor will 392  then select the specific items that are implemented in the module. When algorithms are tested in 393  multiple operating environments, they will each have a separate entry in the list. 394  The selected subset will be saved, maintained with the rest of the module’s information, and used 395  to generate the Tested Algorithm table in the Security Policy. 396  All this information (the structured JSON, the uploaded document, and the selected CAVP test 397  information) will be combined into the final security policy and provided as a PDF file. Any 398  changes to the security policy would require making changes to the corresponding source and 399  generating a new version. 400  401  1.0 General 402  403  NIST SP 800-140Br1 2pd  CMVP Security Policy Requirements  October 2022  8  1.1 Overview 404  405  Notes: Overview information desired by the vendor 406  407  Input Method: Template Document 408  409  1.2 Security Levels 410  Annex B Requirement Statements 411  1.

This could include a reference to a specific Publication 1436  NIST SP 800-140Br1 2pd  CMVP Security Policy Requirements  October 2022  40  Section, IG, etc. This is where appropriate bit strength caveats should be included 1437  for KAS and KTS. 1438  o Algorithms – what Algorithms from the tested and allowed lists are part of the 1439  implementation. Include prerequisites. 1440  o Algorithm Properties – If a subset of the available properties are used, specify. 1441  • What is meant by Implementations of Security Functions 1442  o A module can (and often does) have more than one implementation for a given 1443  Security Function type 1444   A KTS that uses an authenticated encryption mode vs. separate encryption 1445  and authentication would both be KTS but would have two 1446  implementation entries 1447   A SigVer could be used for role/identity authentication and also for an 1448  integrity test 1449   Block Cipher could include modes for storage (XTS) or as part of a KTS 1450   The same algorithm could be used with different key sizes to support 1451  different sizes 1452  o For many modules, there would likely be one SFI for a SF type. 1453  • Why these wouldn’t just map directly to Services 1454  o At times, these could map directly to services, particularly for modules like 1455  software libraries. 1456  o Documenting in this manner will clarify which algorithms are actual services 1457  provided and which are supporting or prerequisite 1458  o When the same category SF algorithms are used for different functions and 1459  therefore different services, there should be separate SFIs. Many modules have 1460  multiple DigSigVer implementations. For example, one for authentication during 1461  an SSH connection and one for the module startup integrity test. These should be 1462  separately defined as implementations and then mapped to different services. 1463  o Requiring the Services to map directly to the Security Functions seems to 1464  overreach into the vendor’s design of their module. The Services and 1465  corresponding level of granularity should be left to the vendor to determine. 1466  • There should only be entries for top-level functions. For example, if SHA2-256 is only 1467  used for Hash DRBG, then it shouldn’t be included as a separate Secure Hash entry. And, 1468  if the DRBG is only a supporting function (for example, just a prerequisite to Symmetric 1469  Key Generation), then DRBG shouldn’t be a separate entry in this table. The Services 1470  table will include the Security Function Implementations, so often that will likely 1471  determine what is a top-level entry. 1472  • All the supporting and prerequisite algorithms for that implementation would be included 1473  in the Algorithms column. 1474  • Every tested and allowed algorithm should be included somewhere in this table. 1475  NIST SP 800-140Br1 2pd  CMVP Security Policy Requirements  October 2022  41  • Every SFI should be included in the Services table. 1476  1477  Entropy Sources (2.9) 1478  1479  Table 11.

Document Revisions 1677  Edition Date Change  Revision 1  (r1)  [date] This revision introduces four significant changes to SP 800- 140B:  1. Defines a more detailed structure and organization for  the Security Policy  2. Captures Security Policy requirements that are defined  outside of ISO/IEC 19790 and ISO/IEC 24759  3. Builds the Security Policy document as a combination  of the subsection information  4. Generates the approved algorithm table based on  lab/vendor selections from the algorithm tests  1678  In October 2022, the following changes were made to the document for the second public draft: 1679  • Section 6.1 – Included additional changes to ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B requirements in 1680  the following sub-sections: 1681  o B.2.2 Cryptographic module specification – added TOEPP description 1682  o B.2.9 Sensitive security parameters management – updated SSP wording and 1683  specified SSP storage techniques. 1684  • Section 6.2 – Removed references to security policy requirements included in 1685  Implementation Guidance. These will be identified and tracked separately. 1686  • Section 6.3 1687  o Simplified security policy document structure by combining and reordering 1688  subsections. 1689  o Changed input method for rich text sections of the security policy from entering 1690  subsections separately in Web Cryptik to including them directly in a template 1691  document. 1692  o Indicated which subsections and columns are optional 1693  o Removed Implementation Guidance requirements specifications (see item above). 1694  Note that these requirements remain applicable but will be identified and tracked 1695  separately. 1696  o Added tables to Appendix A 1697   Executable Code Sets – Software/Firmware/Hybrid (2.3) 1698   Modes of Operation (2.5) 1699  o Changed tables in Appendix A 1700   Operating Environments – Hardware (2.3) 1701   Operating Environments – Software/Firmware/Hybrid (2.3) 1702   Entropy Sources (2.9) 1703  NIST SP 800-140Br1 2pd  CMVP Security Policy Requirements  October 2022  50   SSPs (9.4) 1704   Pre-Operational Self-Tests (10.1) 1705   Conditional Self-Tests (10.2) 1706   Error States (10.3) 1707  1.

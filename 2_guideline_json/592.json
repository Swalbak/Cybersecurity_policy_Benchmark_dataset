A natural question for anyone to ask is  “how often do cyber security incidents occur?”, “what was their impact?”, “what causes them?” But  unfortunately, when it comes to security incidents we are usually navigating in the dark.  Organisations often do not detect incidents when they happen and there is hardly any reporting  about incidents to government authorities or the public. This makes it hard (for anyone) to  understand which are the threats causing these incidents, what is the impact, etc.  Without this  information it is also hard to appreciate what is going well and what could be improved.  In 2013 the EU published a cyber-security strategy focusing on preventing large scale failures and  attacks on network and information systems. A cornerstone of the cyber security strategy is the  obligation for businesses providing critical services to report about security incidents. The strategy  follows discussions in many countries about tighter regulation on cyber security issues – and  particularly the lack of legislation, which obliges organizations to take appropriate security measures  and to report about past incidents.  The proposed NIS Directive mentions cloud computing explicitly. This is not surprising. Cloud  infrastructures play an increasingly important role in the digital society.  A large part of the EU’s  Digital Agenda is the European cloud strategy which aims to speed up adoption of cloud computing  for financial and economic benefits. ENISA has often underlined the security opportunities of cloud  computing. Cloud computing is becoming the backbone of the EU’s digital society. It is easy to see  that certain cloud security incidents could have a major impact in society. In this paper we look at  how incident reporting about cloud security incidents could be implemented in an effective and  efficient way. It needs to be underlined that this document is not a guide on how to implement the  Proposed NIS Directive but a first step towards studying how to implement incident reporting in  cloud computing deployed services.  We asked a range of experts from industry and public sector to give their perspective on the issue of  cloud security incident reporting. Which incidents should be reported, what should be reported, how  we can use reporting to improve security. Some key issues which were raised:   It is difficult to assess the criticality of the cloud services for a national regulator. There are  many interdependencies, different layers of the cloud stack, different deployment models  and different kind of data stored. A lot depends on the specific setting – and often the cloud  computing customer is in the best position to judge the criticality and the potential impact  of incidents.   Cloud services are often based on other cloud services; they are distributed systems and  built up in several layers. Incident reporting is different in these different layers.   From the cloud customer’s point of view, most standard contracts do not commit providers  to reporting about security incidents to customers. Even though, some cloud providers do  have dashboards where some incidents are published and explained.   From the provider’s side, it is up to the customer to include incident reporting obligations in  contracts. For this reason, in many cloud contracts incident reporting is not addressed.   Incident reporting is becoming more and more common in regulated sectors, like energy and  finance where operators need to report incidents to regulators.   Incident reporting should be part of a bi-directional flow of information where providers  report about security incidents to authorities and authorities’ feedback common threats and  common issues to the cloud providers so they can improve security and resilience.  In this report we analyse how cloud providers, customers in critical sectors, and government  authorities can set up cloud security incident reporting schemes, in four use case scenarios:  http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_directive_en.pdf  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  iv  A. One cloud for one critical information infrastructure sector;  B. One cloud for multiple critical sectors;  C. One governmental cloud;  D. One widely used cloud.  Based on the feedback received from experts we present two schemes for cloud security incident  reporting that cover those four cases. The parties involved are the cloud service provider (CSP), the  cloud operator or customer, the national competent authority and the collaboration network.  We make several recommendations in this report. Summarizing them:   We recommend customers in critical sectors to address incident reporting in their contracts  and SLAs [recommendation 2]. We encourage setting the scope after conducting a national  ICT infrastructure risk assessment [recommendation 1]. In a number of countries there are  now legislative initiatives forcing operators in critical sectors [recommendation 3] to report  about security incidents, and this means that these customers should include incident  reporting in their contracts with cloud service providers.   We recommend government authorities, which are responsible for governmental cloud  programs or government IT to address incident reporting obligations in their security  requirements [recommendation 4]. Incident reports provide a valuable crosscheck on the  effectiveness of the security measures in place, and the security of the procured cloud  services overall. Information sharing between all parties in a reporting framework  [recommendation 5] will enhance knowledge on good practices in reporting cloud security  incidents.   We also encourage providers to discuss and agree on the scope [recommendation 6], start  small and the authorities to encourage voluntary incident reporting schemes, because it is  important that government and the public get information about common threats and the  overall impact of security incidents in cloud computing [recommendation 7]. Incident  reporting would also enable government authorities to better inform the private sector  about threats and common root causes. Obviously there is a catch-22 here: If nobody shares  incident reports, then nobody will benefit from sharing [recommendation 8]. Providers  should jointly start with voluntary reporting schemes and engage with the government  authorities about how incident reporting can help the providers to address problems.  ENISA has frequently highlighted the important security challenges of cloud computing. Some cloud  service providers are leading the way in implementing state-of-the-art security measures. In cloud  computing, using the economies of scale, a high-level of security becomes affordable also for small  customers. We look forward to working with cloud providers and (public and private) customers to  improve the transparency in cloud computing security by implementing efficient and effective  incident reporting schemes across sectors and across the EU.

Some years  ago most organisations have begun switching to outsource their applications and data to large  datacentres, hosting providers and cloud providers. Commissioner Kroes, responsible for the  implementation of the EU’s Digital Agenda, has remarked that cloud services are becoming the  backbone of our digital society. Public data about the uptake of cloud computing shows that in a  short time the majority of organisations will be dependent on cloud computing. Large cloud  providers will be serving tens of millions of end-users. Cloud computing services are increasingly  playing an important role for society and the economy. The EU’s cloud strategy, published in 2012,  aims to speed up adoption of cloud computing for financial and economic benefits. ENISA has often  underlined the security benefits of cloud computing. The Japanese government, for example, after  the large earthquake of 2011, actively promoted cloud computing as a way to improve the resilience  of information infrastructures to withstand natural disasters.  The increased dependency of society on cloud computing makes cloud computing also relevant from  a national CIIP (Critical Information Infrastructure Protection) perspective. Cloud computing is, in a  way, a double-edged sword: On the one hand, cloud computing offers important benefits in terms of  information security and resilience, for example in the face of DDoS attacks. On the other hand, the  concentration of IT resources in a few large datacentres implies that failures or cyber-attacks could  have a large impact on society and the economy.  The 2009 CIIP action plan already calls for discussions on a governance strategy for cloud computing.  The EC’s 2013 Cyber security strategy focuses on preventing large scale failures of, and large scale  attacks on, network and information systems in the EU.  The strategy explicitly includes cloud  computing services in scope. It is widely acknowledged that the current lack of transparency about  network and information security incidents complicates efforts by government authorities and  industry to increase the resilience of our critical information infrastructures. A cornerstone of the  EU’s cyber security strategy is to extend incident reporting obligations to other critical information  infrastructures, besides the telecom sector1.  In this report we take a CIIP perspective on cloud computing. We analyse how reporting about  significant Network and Information Security (NIS) incidents could be implemented for cloud  computing services.  Goal  The benefits of incident reporting are well known and widely supported: information sharing, the  dissemination of lessons learnt and experience exchange, identification of route causes and  mitigation techniques, data and trend analysis are some of the most important advantages of a large  scale reporting scheme.  The goal of this report is to provide government authorities (ministries, regulators, cyber security  agencies) with an overview of issues and challenges when implementing (national and pan- European) schemes for reporting about significant security incidents in cloud computing.  We also provide government authorities with guidance on the first steps that could be taken to  implement voluntary reporting schemes.  1  In the electronic communications sector the reform of Framework directive introduced obligations for  providers to assess risks, to take appropriate security measures and to report about significant incidents. These  provisions have now been implemented across the EU.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  2  This document is not a guide on how to implement the Proposed NIS Directive but how to  implement incident reporting in cloud computing deployed services.  Target audience  This report is targeted at:   government authorities in the EU (ministries, regulators, cyber security agencies, et cetera),  who are involved with the protection of critical information infrastructures and/or the  supervision of IT e-government services, electronic communication services, large data  centres, IT used in critical sectors, etc.   operators of critical infrastructure who consider using cloud computing to support their core  services, cloud providers with customers in critical sectors or performing vital functions, and  cloud providers who play a critical role in the digital society.  Scope  In this report we take a CIIP perspective on cloud computing. We focus on reporting network and  information security incidents involving cloud computing services.  We do not address all kinds of cloud computing services, but we restrict ourselves to those cloud  computing services2, which when failing or attacked, could have a major impact on the society or the  economy.  This mirrors the scope of the CIIP action plan and the EU’s cyber security strategy,  focussing on:   Cloud services which are used by operators of critical infrastructures (transport, energy, et  cetera) to support their core services.   Cloud services which are by themselves critical, being key enablers of services in the digital  society.  This means we look at public cloud services, which anyone can subscribe to, as well as private and  community clouds, which are dedicated for one customer or a community of customers. Also we  look at supply chain management, including cloud services which are directly or indirectly used by  operators.  This report does not address personal data or personal data protection3 in detail – although some  security incidents could well have an impact on personal data. From a CIIP perspective the focus is  on incidents with a significant impact on the society and the economy, while from a data protection  perspective the focus is on the impact to the individual. Also, while cloud users may have their own  individual end users (i.e. employees or customers using the service procured) we primarily focus on  the cloud user’s relationship with its cloud provider.  2  Cloud computing definition by the National Institution of Standards and Technology (NIST) : Cloud computing  is a model for enabling convenient, on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing  resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and  released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.  3  Note that under data protection legislation even very small incidents have to be reported to data protection  authorities, while CIIP legislation specifically focusses only on large failures and large attacks, which could have  a major impact on the society or economy.  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://www.nist.gov/  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  3  Methodology  The recommendations and guidance in this report were developed in cooperation with an expert  working group including representatives of the stakeholders mentioned in previous paragraphs,  major cloud service providers, government agencies, industry association, and the customers of  cloud services, both in the public and in the private sector.  Their input was collected using an on- line survey and a series of more open-ended interviews.  The intention was to identify their views,  best practices in incident reporting, both in Europe and abroad, with a particular focus on Critical  Information Infrastructures.  Structure  This document is structured as follows:   In Section 2 we introduce the notion of cloud security incidents, first by defining the cloud  computing model and introducing different types of cloud services;   In Section 3 we give an overview of the related legislative initiatives, summarizing the EU’s  CIIP directive, Article 13a of the electronic communications framework, and Article 14 of the  proposed NIS directive; all the activities the community is taking towards a common  framework for reporting incidents and improve network resilience across the EU.   In Section 4 we explain and give examples of cloud security incidents to focus on their  criticality for the citizens.   In Section 5 we summarize the views and perspectives of the experts in the ENISA expert  group on the specific topic and more specifically, to report the technical details of cloud  security incident reporting.   In Section 6 we list the challenges when reporting cloud security incident by elaborating on  four (4) use cases.   In Section 7 we conclude with a set of high level recommendations for national authorities.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  4  2 Definitions: Cloud computing services  This section introduces cloud computing services model and explains most “incident related” terms  that will be used throughout this report.  2.1 Cloud computing services model  NIST developed a reference architecture for cloud computing, explaining the different existing types  of cloud computing and all the actors and processes involved4. Different types of cloud services, each  involve different types of technology and assets. We give an overview below – see Figure 1.   Infrastructure as a Service: In IaaS the provider delivers storage (virtual databases) or  computing resources (virtual hardware), via the internet. Examples include Amazon’s Elastic  Compute Cloud, Google’s Compute Engine, Amazon Simple Storage Service, Google Cloud  Storage, Microsoft Windows Azure Storage, Rackspace, et cetera. Customers start and stop  virtual machines, or they store or access data.   Platform as a Service: In PaaS, the provider delivers a platform for customers to run  applications on (typically web applications). Often PaaS providers supply software  development tools to construct applications for the platform. Typical types of applications  that run on these platforms are scripts (PHP, Python, e.g.) or byte code (Java servlets, C#).  Examples include Google App engine, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, et cetera.   Software as a Service: In SaaS, the provider delivers fully-fledged software or applications,  via the Internet. Applications range from email servers, email clients, document editors, or  customer relationship management systems. SaaS services can often be accessed with a  browser or a web services client.   Facilities: Facilities are the basic IT resources which underlies all types of cloud services  (IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS), network, housing, cooling, power.   Organisation: Organisation is the human resources, the processes and the policies and  procedures that maintain the facilities and support the delivery of services.  Figure 1 Map of different technologies across different types of cloud services  4  http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=909505  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  5  Note that some providers only offer IaaS or PaaS services, some providers only offer SaaS. SaaS  providers often run their applications on IaaS or PaaS infrastructures.  2.2 Definitions  In this section we give definitions5 of terms that are widely used across this report:   Incident: A breach of security or a loss of integrity that has impact on the operation of  network and information system core services, which public administrations and market  operators provide. The “reportable incident” is the one that has deemed significant impact.   Incident Reporting: The procedure by which the reporting party (cloud provider or cloud  operator) shall submit to the national competent authority a report with information on the  incident, on ad-hoc basis.   Impact: A measure reflecting the average number of affected parameters/assets per  incident, to show   Root cause: The reason that caused the incident.   Parameters: the criteria to be used to measure impact of an incident.   Thresholds: The specific values of the parameters that when overpassed, the impact of the  incident is deemed significant and the incident falls into the incident reporting scope.   Early warning: The procedure based on which the dissemination of information on incident  is done in a fast way to the interested companies to alert them of an on-going attack or  other incident, so that immediate action could be taken.   Threat: A threat is an event or a circumstance which could cause a security incident.  5  The definitions are based on the Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting adopted for cloud computing incident reporting:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents- reporting/Technical%20Guidelines%20on%20Incident%20Reporting/technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/Technical%20Guidelines%20on%20Incident%20Reporting/technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/Technical%20Guidelines%20on%20Incident%20Reporting/technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  6  3 Background: Policy context  In this section we summarize relevant EU policy and legislative initiatives on CIIP and security  incident reporting.  3.1 EC Communications on CIIP  The Communication on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) issued by the EC in 2009  aimed to improve preparedness, security and resilience, with the goal to protect Europe from large  scale cyber-attacks and failures. The motivation for this communication was that Information and  Communication Technology (ICT) is increasingly intertwined in our daily activities, and that some ICT  infrastructures form a vital part of the European economy and society, either because they provide  essential services (such as emergency communications) or because they underpin other critical  infrastructures. ENISA is responsible for a range of activities mentioned in the CIIP action plan.  The CIIP communication defines Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs)6 as all ICT systems which  are either,  a) critical infrastructure themselves, or;  b) essential for the operation of other critical infrastructures.  This builds on the definition of critical infrastructures in COM(2005) 576; “Critical infrastructures  include those physical resources, services, and information technology facilities, networks and  infrastructure assets which, if disrupted or destroyed, would have a serious impact on the health,  safety, security or economic well-being of citizens or the effective functioning of governments”.  COM(2011) 163 notes that: “It is essential to strengthen discussions on the best governance  strategies for emerging technologies with a global impact, such as cloud computing. These  discussions should certainly include, but not be limited to, the appropriate governance framework for  the protection of personal data. Trust is essential in order to reap its full benefits”.  In its Conclusions on CIIP of 27 May 2011, the Council of the European Union stressed the pressing  need to make ICT systems and networks resilient and secure to all possible disruptions, whether  accidental or intentional; to develop across the Union a high level of preparedness, security and  resilience capabilities and to upgrade technical competences to help Europe face the challenge of  network and information infrastructure protection; and to foster Member States' cooperation by  developing incident cooperation mechanisms between them.  Two Ministerial Conferences on CIIP took place respectively in Tallinn in 2009 and in Balatonfüred in  2011. Tallinn started the debate on the general direction of the European efforts towards an  increased network and information security for the future. Balatonfüred provided a forum to take  stock of progress, assess lessons learnt and discuss the challenges ahead and next steps. It also  investigated the way forward to engaging all stakeholders and in particular the private sector.  In 2011, the EC took stock of the results achieved so far and indicated future steps. The CIIP  communication emphasises the need to identify best governance strategies for cloud computing,  and that these discussions should include, but not be limited to the protection of personal data.  The European Parliament Resolution of 12 June 2012 on \"Critical Information Infrastructure  Protection: towards global cyber-security\" broadly endorsed the 2011 Communication and made  recommendations to the Commission for the way forward. Many of these recommendations have  6 The OECD defines CII as those information systems and networks, the disruption or destruction of which would have a serious impact on  the health, safety, security, or economic well-being of citizens, or on the effective functioning of government or the economy. Both  definitions are equivalent.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2005/com2005_0576en01.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2011:0163:FIN:EN:PDF http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/sede/dv/sede150611cccybersecurity_/sede150611cccybersecurity_en.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2011:0163:FIN:EN:PDF http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P7-TA-2012-0237&language=EN&ring=A7-2012-0167 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P7-TA-2012-0237&language=EN&ring=A7-2012-0167  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  7  been taken on board in the Cyber security strategy and proposal for a Directive on network and  information security published in 2013.  3.2 Article 13a of the Framework directive  The reform of the EU legal framework for electronic communications, which was adopted in 2009  and was transposed by most EU countries around May 2011, adds Article 13a to the Framework  Directive (2009/140/EC). Article 13a addresses the security and integrity7 of public electronic  communications networks and services. The legislation concerns national regulatory authorities  (NRAs) and providers of public electronic communications networks and services8. It has three main  provisions:   NRAs must ensure that e-Comms providers take appropriate steps to guarantee the security  and resilience of electronic communication networks and services.   Providers of electronic communication networks and services must report significant  incidents to competent authorities (NRAs)   NRAs must provide a summary of significant incidents to ENISA and the EC.  In other words, Article 13a asks EU Member States to set up a reporting scheme for significant  incidents. The actors and information flows in Article 13a are depicted in Figure 6.  Figure 2 Actors and information flows in Article 13a  Article 13a of the Framework directive, together with Article 4 of the e-Privacy directive, are  currently the only EU directives that oblige providers to report security incidents. Both directives are  limited to electronic communications networks and services. Article 15 of the draft regulation on  electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions, requires that trust service  providers have to undertake extensive security measures and notify competent bodies of any breach  7 Here integrity means network integrity, which is often called availability or continuity in information security literature.  8 More information on Article13a can be found here:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting  Network or  service  provider  Competent  national  authority  EC and ENISA National  authorities  abroad and ENISA  3  6  Victims  Public  2  4  1  1  Security measures  Notification  Informing  Summary reporting  4  5  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/regframeforec_dec2009.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0058:EN:HTML http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0238:FIN:en:PDF https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  8  of security and loss of integrity with significant impact on the trust service provided and on personal  data maintained therein.  3.3 Proposal for a Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive  In 2013 the European Commission communicated its Cyber Security Strategy and proposed a  European Network and Information Security Directive. The key motivation for the directive was that  several member states are taking action to improve cyber security, but there is no common and  consistent approach across the EU. The NIS directive was proposed to ensure a level playing field for  businesses across the EU and to avoid a weakest link9.  The main pillars of the proposed NIS directive include: (1) the implementation of national NIS  strategies and the national NIS cooperation plans, (2) the enforcement of CERTs,  (3) the cooperation  between competent authorities and (4) the enhancement of security of the NIS systems of public  administrations and market operators.  These will need to be implemented by Member States.  One of the main goals of the proposed NIS directive is to extend Article 13a of the Framework  directive beyond the electronic communications sector, to cover other critical information  infrastructures: Article14 of the proposed NIS Directive.  The scope of Article14 of the proposed NIS directive applies to government administrations and  ‘market operators’:  (a) providers of information society services which enable the provision of other information  society services  (b) operators of critical infrastructure which is essential for the maintenance of vital economic  and societal activities in the fields of energy, transport, banking, stock exchanges and health.  The legal text of Article 14 can be (graphically) summarized as follows.  Figure 3 Information flows and actors described in Article 14  9 The DIginotar incident underscores how an incident in one country can have an impact across the border.

(blue dotted arrow) National competent authorities should ensure that public  administrations and market operators take appropriate technical and organisational security  measures to protect network and information systems underpinning their core services10.  2. (red arrow) When a significant security incident occurs, the public administrator or market  operator should notify the competent authority.  3. (black dash-dotted arrow) Depending on the circumstance, the competent authority might  inform the public or require the market operator to do so.  4. (black dashed arrow) Annually, the competent authority should send summary reports  about the incidents to the cooperation network, which includes all competent authorities  across the EU.  The cooperation network should discuss about past incidents, lessons learnt, ex-post, common  issues, et cetera, and agrees on a common, harmonized approach.  10  Article 15 of the NIS Directive (“Implementation and enforcement”) gives competent authorities the power  to request market operators to do a self-assessment, to undergo an audit, and/or to investigate cases of non- compliance.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  10  4 Critical cloud computing  In some settings cloud computing services can be critical. We distinguish two cases:   Case 1: Cloud computing services which are used by operators of critical infrastructure to  support the delivery of their core services, in cases where the reliability of the underlying  cloud technology is itself essential to the safe functioning of the critical service.   Case 2: Cloud computing services which are critical in themselves, i.e. if failing there would  be a significant impact on health safety, security or economic well-being of EU citizens or the  effective functioning EU governments.  In this section we give specific examples of settings where cloud computing services are critical.  Note that we mention names of specific customers, specific providers and specific services, but they  are intended as examples. We do not intend to single out specific organisations or specific services  for criticism or praise.  4.1 Cloud services which underpin critical infrastructure  Cloud services are increasingly being used in critical sectors. Below we give some example from the  finance, transport and health sector11:   The Air Traffic Managements solutions for the Singe European Sky (SESAR) aims at  developing the new generation air traffic management system capable of ensuring the  safety and fluidity of air transport worldwide over the next 30 years. SESAR is funding a  project on a secure Cloud for Air Traffic Management.12   In the US, the FAA released their cloud computing strategy and announced a $91 million  contract for Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Microsoft to create a cloud email  system for the agency. The agency also announced the transition of their air traffic  management systems onto cloud networks in the future.   NASDAQ OMX FinQloud is a cloud computing platform, which runs on Amazon Web Services,  to monitor compliance requirements (execution compliance and surveillance systems) for  high frequency trading operators13.   A Slovenia-based railway operator has selected a cloud-based platform to centralize  passenger, freight and logistics information systems across its rail network14.   A big oil company adopted a private cloud model for preproduction systems, testing  environment and data processing – 60% of the company’s infrastructure is virtual15.   Another major oil company in the United States adopted PaaS to collect and process  information for early warning systems16.   In Luxembourg the government has issues guidelines on how to implement cloud in the  finance sector. The new law enriches the Luxembourg legal framework of the cloud  computing and the service industry in general.17  11 Directive Annex II, critical sectors: Energy, Transport, Banking, Financial market, Health sector.  12  http://www.sesarju.eu/programme/workpackages/wpe/research-projects-results-second-call-1304  13 http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/nasdaq-finqloud/  14 http://blog.executivebiz.com/2013/08/ibm-to-help-intl-rail-operator-install-cloud-it-system-roman-koritnik-comments/  15  http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9225827/Shell_Oil_targets_hybrid_cloud_as_fix_for_energy_saving_agile_IT?taxonomyId=158 &pageNumber=2  16  http://www.spgindia.org/spg_2012/spgp160.pdf  17  http://www.newsletter-nautadutilh.com/EN/xzine/information_-  _communication_technology/luxembourg_le_droit_de_revendiquer_ses_donn%C3%A9es%20aupr%C3%A8s_dun_fournisseur_de_solutio  http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/atc_comms_services/swim/documentation/media/cloud_computing/FAA%20Cloud%20Computing%20Strategy%20v1.0.pdf http://www.sesarju.eu/programme/workpackages/wpe/research-projects-results-second-call-1304 http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/nasdaq-finqloud/ http://blog.executivebiz.com/2013/08/ibm-to-help-intl-rail-operator-install-cloud-it-system-roman-koritnik-comments/ http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9225827/Shell_Oil_targets_hybrid_cloud_as_fix_for_energy_saving_agile_IT?taxonomyId=158&pageNumber=2 http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9225827/Shell_Oil_targets_hybrid_cloud_as_fix_for_energy_saving_agile_IT?taxonomyId=158&pageNumber=2 http://www.spgindia.org/spg_2012/spgp160.pdf http://www.newsletter-nautadutilh.com/EN/xzine/information_-_communication_technology/luxembourg_le_droit_de_revendiquer_ses_donn%C3%A9es%20aupr%C3%A8s_dun_fournisseur_de_solutions_cloud_failli/luxembourg_the_right_to_claim_back_data_from_bankrupt_cloud_comp http://www.newsletter-nautadutilh.com/EN/xzine/information_-_communication_technology/luxembourg_le_droit_de_revendiquer_ses_donn%C3%A9es%20aupr%C3%A8s_dun_fournisseur_de_solutions_cloud_failli/luxembourg_the_right_to_claim_back_data_from_bankrupt_cloud_comp  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  11  There have been incidents affecting cloud services, which impacted critical infrastructure.  We give  some examples below:   In 2011, Finish IT operator Tieto faced an incident for (in some cases) several weeks,  affecting 50 of the company customers in both private and public sectors.  The impact was  felt across Sweden18. Some customers suffered minimal effects over a number of days;  others lost their IT services for several weeks. The causes were traced back to hardware  failures. This incident had an immediate effect to the citizens, since the IT system was  supporting for the process of provisioning drugs to patients all over the country.   In 2013, the NASDAQ OMX crashed for three hours, with a major financial impact on  brokers. The problem was traced to a connectivity issue between an exchange participant  and the industry processor, which meant the system, was unable to disseminate  consolidated quotes and trades19.  4.2 Cloud services which underpin the digital society  Cloud computing services have become critical for the digital society as a whole, even if they are not  directly supporting critical infrastructures. Some cloud services which are used by many citizens in  everyday life or by many companies. In these cases major security incidents could have a large  impact in society.  We give some examples of outages:   August 2013, Amazon Web Services suffers an outage, taking down Vine, Instagram and  other applications for an hour. This outage shows that no proper redundancy policy is  applied correctly.20.   March 2013, Microsoft’s email infrastructures suffered a loss of availability for nearly 16  hours affecting business critical services.  The causes stemmed from a faulty software  update. The number of users affected has not been disclosed21.   January 2013, Dropbox suffered a substantial loss of service for more than 15 hours affecting  all users across the globe22.   October 2011, millions of Blackberry users across Europe, Middle East and Africa suffered an  outage lasting three days. The company has about 70m users around the world. Speculation  is that most of the global customer base may have been affected at some point during this  time.  For providers it is difficult to estimate the number of end-users or organizations affected by an  incident, especially when they affect IaaS/PaaS.  It is also hard to assess the number of end-users  and organisations depending on a cloud computing service.  One reason is that knock-on effects can  create cascading failures when IaaS/PaaS providers offer services to other organizations, which in  turn provide services to third parties. This long supply chain makes it difficult to measure the impact  of incidents or the criticality of a service in terms of the number of end-users, because the number  of end-users cannot be easily estimated by the service provider.  ns_cloud_failli/luxembourg_the_right_to_claim_back_data_from_bankrupt_cloud_computing_providers/luxembourg_the_right_to_claim _back_data_from_bankrupt_cloud_computing_providers.html?cid=4&xzine_id=4945&aid=14382  18  https://www.msb.se/RibData/Filer/pdf/26170.pdf  19  http://www.bankingtech.com/161382/nasdaq-omx-connectivity-disaster-highlights-stumbling-markets/  20  http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-26/another-amazon-outage-exposes-the-clouds-dark-lining  21  https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/240150826/microsoft-cloud-outage-blamed-on-faulty-update.htm  22  http://www.crn.com/slide-shows/channel-programs/240146101/5-companies-that-dropped-the- ball.htm?pgno=5  http://www.newsletter-nautadutilh.com/EN/xzine/information_-_communication_technology/luxembourg_le_droit_de_revendiquer_ses_donn%C3%A9es%20aupr%C3%A8s_dun_fournisseur_de_solutions_cloud_failli/luxembourg_the_right_to_claim_back_data_from_bankrupt_cloud_comp http://www.newsletter-nautadutilh.com/EN/xzine/information_-_communication_technology/luxembourg_le_droit_de_revendiquer_ses_donn%C3%A9es%20aupr%C3%A8s_dun_fournisseur_de_solutions_cloud_failli/luxembourg_the_right_to_claim_back_data_from_bankrupt_cloud_comp https://www.msb.se/RibData/Filer/pdf/26170.pdf http://www.bankingtech.com/161382/nasdaq-omx-connectivity-disaster-highlights-stumbling-markets/ http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-26/another-amazon-outage-exposes-the-clouds-dark-lining https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/240150826/microsoft-cloud-outage-blamed-on-faulty-update.htm http://www.crn.com/slide-shows/channel-programs/240146101/5-companies-that-dropped-the-ball.htm?pgno=5 http://www.crn.com/slide-shows/channel-programs/240146101/5-companies-that-dropped-the-ball.htm?pgno=5  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  12  5 Perspectives on Cloud Security Incident reporting  To gain a better understanding of the views and perspectives of experts on the topic of cloud  security incident reporting we conducted an online survey and several interviews with experts from  industry, industry associations, government, and academia. In this section we show and analyse the  responses from the survey and we discuss the highlights from the interview by including quotes from  experts which are representative.  5.1 Results from survey and interviews  5.1.1 Participants and respondents  In total we conducted 15 interviews and 25 questionnaires. Figure 8 provides an overview of the  different participants in the interviews and their roles respectively.  Figure 4 Overview of stakeholders participating in the Interviews and Survey  Some of the topics we included in this collection of information are:   Incentives for reporting;   Compulsory vs Voluntary reporting;   Services in scope of reporting outages;   Sectors in scope of reporting outages;   Incidents in scope of reporting;   Parameters to be used to measure the impact of an outage;   Cross border incidents.  5.1.2 Services in scope  In the survey we asked participants which type of services should be in scope.  Figure 9 shows the  results of the survey. It shows that most respondents believe priority should be given to services that  support critical information infrastructure (SaaS, IaaS and PaaS). Secondly, providers should report  about incidents affecting services with large numbers of end-users or/and customers and thirdly  incidents affecting services with a wide geographic spread (entire country or cross border) should be  reported.  Note that respondents disagree about whether or not public or private clouds should be in scope.  Half of the respondents say public clouds should not be in scope, half of the respondents say private  clouds should not be in scope.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  13  Figure 5 Services in scope  When discussing this topic in interviews experts reiterated the difficulty of making clear distinctions  between IaaS, SaaS, PaaS, public and private clouds. Every cloud provider has developed their own  platforms and different types of cloud resources are used in different settings:  “The distinctions between different IaaS, SaaS and PaaS architectures are less important than the  impact on people.  This creates problems because we, infrastructure companies, don’t always know  the impact of an outage on users with less tangible aspects such as trust which are key to the future  development of the industry across Europe.”  5.1.3 Sectors in scope  In the survey we asked respondents which incidents should be in scope. From the answers it  becomes clear that incidents affecting the email services of an oil and gas company should not be in  scope of reporting, unless there is an impact on core business processes (i.e. if the loss of oil and/or  gas supply). Figure 10 shows the answers in more detail.  When discussing with experts in which sectors incident reporting should be mandatory, it was often  mentioned that cloud computing is almost becoming a critical sector in itself. In fact, many experts  currently sustain that cloud computing is becoming the backbone of the digital society:  86%  81%  90%  28%  90%  38%  38%  43%  71%  45%  62%  60%  14%  19%  10%  72%  10%  62%  62%  57%  29%  55%  38%  40%  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 120%  IaaS/PaaS with large number of customers  IaaS/PaaS with large number of end- users  IaaS/PaaS underlying critical information infrastructure  SaaS, not sector specific  SaaS supporting critical infrastructures  Cloud services with a minimum number of end-users  Cloud services with a minimum number of servers/processors  Cloud services with a minimum number of organisations  Cloud services with a large geographic spread (entire country, cross border)  Public cloud services  Private cloud services  Partner/Community Clouds  Yes  No  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  14  “Cloud services are themselves part of the critical infrastructure that supports many companies in our  country and across Europe.”  Figure 6 Sectors in scope  At the same time, one issue that was often mentioned in this context was that cloud service  providers are hardly in a position to assess a-priori the criticality of their services because of the  potential knock-on effect of outages. The impact of an outage depends on the kind of security  measures customers took.  5.1.4 Cloud security incidents in scope  In the survey we asked respondents which incidents should be in scope of incident reporting. We  first presented experts with a rough classification of the incidents according to their impact in 5  severity levels; for each level we provided one practical example. Then we asked the experts to  indicate which incidents should be reported. The impact scale is presented below:   Impact 0: Something went wrong in an exercise or a test. No impact on users.   Impact 1: Incident had impact on assets, but no direct impact on customers.   Impact 2: Incident had impact on assets, but only minor impact on customers.   Impact 3: Incident had impact on customers.   Impact 4: Incident had major impact on customers.  48%  67%  62%  81%  67%  19%  29%  28%  23%  33%  14%  19%  52%  57%  24%  10%  5%  5%  14%  29%  14%  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 120%  Finance  Healthcare  eGovernment  Industrial Control Systems (SCADA)  Transport  Generic IT  Electronic Communications  1 (Important) 2 (Less Important) 3 (Minor Importance)  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  15  The answers from the respondents are summarized in figure 11. Most experts agreed that incidents  with impact 3 or higher should be reported to authorities and should be the focus of information  exchange across the sector and between member states.  Figure 7 Impact based classification of incidents  When discussing this topic with experts, some experts remarked that often providers are not in a  position to determine the severity of an incident, and/or if an incident had an impact on the core  business operations of customers.  “We need to filter incident reports according to the impact but at the time an incident occurs we may  not have enough information to be sure what the consequences were.”  5.1.5 Incident report parameters  In the survey we asked respondents about which parameters should be included in incident reports.  Figure 12 shows the responses of the experts. The most important parameter to report about is the  criticality of the data or assets affected. This is in line with the fact that most experts would like to  focus first on incident reporting in critical sectors. Besides this, most experts agree that incident  reports should include information about the number of end users affected, the impact on  customers (loss of data access, the geographic spread, and the duration of the cloud security  incident.  Many interviewees said that the number of users can not be the only measure of the consequences  for society; while some users might be inconvenienced by losing access to their files, for  governments and other critical infrastructures the impact could be much more serious. The  “significance” of an incident is something crucial to assess e.g. the temporary loss of access to an  entertainment service, even if it affects many people, is very different from the risk of death due to a  long-lived power outage in mid-winter, or a problem with air-traffic control. Finally, we emphasise  that the impact must be significantly life-threatening for many people and/or cause or risk major  long-lived economic harm.  Many experts reiterated the need to collect useful data that can be used to understand issues and  increase the resilience of services, focusing on the impact of an outage. Some experts raised the  issue that it is sometimes hard for providers to assess the full impact of an incident because cloud  service providers do not always know the full impact of an incident in society or in critical sectors.  0,00%  10,00%  20,00%  30,00%  40,00%  50,00%  60,00%  70,00%  80,00%  90,00%  100,00%  Impact 0 Impact 1 Impact 2 Impact 3 Impact 4  10,50%  32,50%  49,20%  92%  100%  Impact  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  16  Most experts agreed on the fact that there is a need to share information about root causes and  measures to mitigate common incidents.  Figure 8 Parameters to measure impact on Cloud supporting CIIs  Finally, as discussed before, interdependencies across services, across society, makes it difficult to  identify all the end users or customers impacted.  This, in turn, makes it hard to calculate the  geographic spread of an incident, for example. It seems that providers of IaaS and PaaS providers  can only estimate the impact of incidents in technical terms. An estimation of the number of end- users affected can be done only at a later stage.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  17  5.1.6 Incentives to foster incident reporting  In the survey we asked respondents about the potential incentives for providers to partake in  setting up incident reporting schemes.  Figure 9 Incentives for incident reporting  In the interviews with experts one of the key success factors mentioned was “trust” between the  information sharing parties. In competitive commercial environments, including cloud service  provision, the level of trust required to support information sharing is difficult to achieve without  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%  Legal protection for reporter (information in a report cannot normally be used in legal action)  Guarantees of confidentiality, non-disclosure agreements  Anonymity for reporter (national agencies and other companies cannot tell who filed a report)  Access to incident reports of other providers (only organization who submits reports can…  Access to statistical summaries sent to all participants every 6 months.

The main incentives for organizations to participate in  a reporting scheme were considered to be:   legal protection for the respective parties  to encourage participation;   non-disclosure agreements or anonymity for the different parties;   ability to access the incident reports of other Cloud service providers;   access to statistical summaries sent to all participants annually;   a “one stop shop” – to coordinate the distribution of incident information across European,  national and industry reporting systems.  Many experts were of the opinion that even if the provider is obliged to inform competent  authorities, the incident reports should still be anonymised.  ‘’[…] it is important not to disclose the identity of the organisations suffering the incident but at the  same time provide sufficient detail for others to know that they might be affected.  This could be  more difficult for critical Clouds – where if an incident report mentioned a power company running a  particular PLC then readers could infer that this might be one of two or three companies across  Europe.”  Most experts stressed the importance of anonymity in encouraging participation, especially in the  start-up period when companies still need to gain trust in the scheme. Some experts raised the issue  that in some smaller countries (with few providers) even anonymous reporting could be difficult. The  main fear of providers is to lose customers if it becomes public that certain cloud services had  suffered failures.  Another issue which was often raised by experts, was the fact that companies might lose a  competitive advantage if other companies chose not to participate. From this perspective it seems  that a legal requirement to partake in incident reporting scheme is necessary. Finally, some experts  remarked that the issues of confidentiality would decrease as the reporting scheme matures and  trust in the reporting scheme grows.  5.1.7 Compulsory or voluntary reporting of cloud security incidents  In the survey we asked respondents about whether or not incident reporting should be legally  required or voluntary. It should be mentioned here that there are not many examples of existing  voluntary incident reporting schemes.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  19  Figure 10 Ways to develop cloud incident reporting  Figure 14 shows the view of the experts. Most respondents are in favour of compulsory national  schemes including the reporting to an EU agency (80%). Many respondents would also be in favour  of voluntary national schemes, including reporting to an EU agency (47%). Respondents did not  favour local reporting schemes, without sharing incident reports with a European agency. This is in  line with the fact that most experts agree that incident reporting is most useful when the incident  reports can be shared across sectors and across borders via an European agency.  In the interviews expert raised some issues with voluntary reporting schemes, expressing a concern  about under-reporting.  In voluntary schemes the reporting becomes biased, especially for some  classes of incidents which are not directly visible outside the company. On the other hand experts  acknowledged that cloud computing is still a new market and that over-regulation could stifle  innovation. This could be of concern for European companies as cloud services are being developed  with minimal regulatory intervention in Asia and North America.  “It is important to develop a framework that is simple rather than develop complex taxonomies or  lists of incidents that would change over time.  Over-regulation of a new industry needs to be  avoided.”  Experts also raised the concern that multiple national and international reporting schemes could  make it hard for providers to comply. The experts we interviewed all strongly supported ENISA’s  potential role in aligning and harmonizing the different reporting schemes, particularly for small  member states. The interviewees also stressed the need for Europe to act together and to develop a  coherent Cloud strategy.  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%  a.

Note that in the proposed NIS directive there are provisions for sharing  incident reports between authorities from different countries. In the interviews the experts  identified a number of further cross challenges with cross border sharing of incidents: :  1) Legislative and regulatory concerns - some governments cannot export data beyond their  national borders, this may limit the submission of incident information affecting government  systems in particular;  2) Jurisdictional issues – Clouds raise complex jurisdictional issues where customers are in one  state, buying services from another that are implemented using systems in a third country.  It can be difficult to determine where such incidents should be reported.  Existing statutes  establish jurisdiction in the State where a service is being purchased but the application and  interpretation of the laws is often not well understood by many customers.  3) Trust across national borders –several of the interviewees mentioned the need to exclude  incidents that might affect national security;  4) Integration of national and international systems.  The interviewees stressed that it is  important to minimise the regulatory burdens on a new and growing industry and to  establish a level playing field across all member states when sharing across borders.  Larger companies that have more complex cross-border operations typically have access to legal  departments that can identify their responsibilities. Smaller companies tend to have more simple  operations and more straightforward obligations. One expert remarked:  “We do not have any uniform, single system for reporting incidents because there are many different  companies in our group working in different member states.  I get regular updates from across the  group but the details are different. The development of a single European reporting system might  help provide us with common reporting standards.”  Other interviewees stressed the benefits to smaller member states where the costs of coordinating  incident reporting could be shared.  A European system for incident reporting could increase the  consistency of information available within companies.  5.1.9 Statistics and post-incident analysis  We also addressed the topic off post-incident analysis in the interviews. By exchanging lessons learnt  with other providers, it becomes easier for providers to address trends and issues emerging across  the EU. Post-incident analysis can also help government authorities to take policy initiatives.  In responses to the survey, experts indicated they support publishing statistical information about  incident reports, aggregating them across Europe.  Statistical information should include:  1. Number of incidents per root cause (e.g. incidents caused by cyber-attack)  2. Percentage of users affected per root cause (e.g. 1% of Cloud users in the EU were affected  by cyber-attacks)  3. Number of users affected per root cause (e.g. 50 end users were affected by an attack).  4. Total impact per service (e.g. UPS failures caused Cloud service outages of approx. 20 million  user hours)  5. Percentage of impact per root cause (e.g. power failures caused 37% of the total Cloud  service user hours affected by outages)  6. Percentage of incidents per root cause (e.g. half of incidents EU wide are caused by human  error).  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  21  The interviewees confirmed that aggregated information would be useful to many different  stakeholders.  Some participants supported the development of a European system that was  independent from security service vendors.  Others argued that aggregate data can inform future  regulatory requirements and reinforce ENISA’s role in providing a bridge between EU legislation and  the industry. Most experts interviewed supported the compilation and dissemination of statistical  overviews. However, statistical summaries do not always provide a realistic view. It is important for  regulators to supplement these overviews with additional studies into the detailed causes of  incidents involving critical cloud infrastructures.  5.2 Summary of responses and interviews   Services in scope:  o Services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) supporting core systems of critical infrastructures;  o Services that are used by large number of end users  o Services covering large geographic spread   Focus on critical sectors like finance, health, energy, transport and e-Government.   Criticality of the service and impact of incidents should be analysed on a case-by-case basis.   Incidents affecting availability, resulting to loss of services, should be reported.   Incidents affecting data integrity and confidentiality could be reported.   Parameters to report about:  o Number of users affected;  o Duration of the incident;  o Services affected (criticality of data or services);  o Geographic spread   There is a need to set reporting thresholds for these parameters.   A single reporting scheme and a single reporting template is needed for providers and  operators.   In the start-up phase the right conditions and incentives should be created (anonymity,  confidentiality).   Cross border sharing of incident reports with other authorities is crucial  Post incident analysis and statistical information are important outcomes of pan-EU incident  reporting. It is important to have bi-directional sharing schemes, where authorities feedback  analysis and statistics to providers.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  22  6 Incident Reporting Use Cases  The incidents mentioned in previous section are reality; yet, it is still a challenge to explain in each  case which would be the process to report them to national competent authorities. In need of this  clarification, below we depict 4 use cases of incidents, presenting the challenges in place and suggest  how in each scenario, incident reporting would be realized.  6.1 Reporting Cloud security incidents by operators in critical sectors  6.1.1 Use case A: One community cloud- one critical sector  One cloud provider offers services (IaaS, PaaS) to the finance sector (critical sector); more specifically  in two banks with data located in country X and in one bank with data located in country Y. The  banks have built services on the top of the cloud infrastructure, supporting financial data of theirs  customers and every day transactions. The contract terms have been specified to the customer’s  needs, having the banks to insist on their own standard term of secured unlimited liability for  defined types of breaches or loss, notably breach of regulatory on security requirements such as  breaches giving rise to regulatory fines. Same applies for in-house implementation of a private cloud  in a bank.  When an incident occurs it impacts the availability of services and the datacentres of all banking  organisations. The cloud provider, bonded by the contractual agreement with the client (in this case  the bank), is obliged to report more information on the breach (light blue line). The reporting is  based on customer specific data included in the SLA and/or contract. Currently there is no common  template for all providers to use, to meet the SLA requirements of reporting.  The provider needs to report the technical data of the incident. The cloud provider is not aware of  the services build on top of the IaaS/PaaS contracted, thus is not aware of the criticality of the data  and/or services. In this case the report sent to the National Competent Authority (NCA), is sent by  the operator, in this case the banking institutions. The operator will add more information on the  impact of the breach to its core services and will need to provide this to the NCA. Since we talk  about a cross border incident, each banking institution needs to send this to the NCA of the  respective country. The NCA in this case could be the national finance regulatory authority. The  scheme is depicted below:  Bank Bank  Bank  NCA NCA  o th  er  c  o u  n tr  y  Bank  Cloud  Cloud Service Provider  Cloud  Cloud  Figure 11 One community/ private cloud- one critical sector  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  23  6.1.2 Use case B: Public Cloud – Multiple critical sectors  One cloud provider offers services (IaaS, PaaS) to the finance sector and energy sector (critical  sectors); the services built upon the contracted services are linked to availability of the core services  to the customer (financial transactions and power supply). When a breach occurs to the cloud  provider, he is obliged according to the contractual agreement or/and the service level agreement  (SLA) to report the incidents to the customers (light blue line). As in the previous use case, the  information included in the report is customer specific – in this case different for the banking sector  and the energy sector. A common template across providers, to satisfy the reporting requirements  to their customers could be a starting point in harmonising incident reporting in the cloud.  The different customers, in this case the banks and the energy supplier, since their core service has  faced a loss of availability, will need to report to the NCAs. The information required by the provider,  combined with the impact assessment of the operator, would be sent to the NCAs by the operator;  in this specific case since we talk about two different critical sectors, the reports should be sent to  the according NCAs, namely to the national finance regulatory authority and to the energy regulator.  In this case we talk about “multiple-NCA”. The scheme is depicted below:  Bank Power  Supplier  Finance NCA Energy NCA  Cloud Service Provider  Cloud  Bank  Cloud  Power  Supplier  Cloud  Figure 12 Public Cloud – Many critical sectors  6.1.3 Challenges of implementing security incident reporting  We analyse the challenges of security incidents reporting in the case of critical sectors:   Challenge 1: Definition of roles and mandate  Clear guidelines on how the incident reporting data flow will take place, “which will be the  specific appointed NCAs”, “which are the operators falling in scope”, “which are the  incidents in scope” need to be provided by the governmental authorities, always in  conjuction with other European countries. The governemental authorities in each country  need to define the roles of the different parties involved in the incident reporting  framework. The NCA is the according regulatory body to receive the reports, however in  each section the NCA is a different body i.e. for Banking sector is the National finance  regulator, for Energy the according Energy regulator, in general the public bodies that have a  regulatory mandate that includes networks and information security.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  24  Critical service operator should report to the NCA. This means that a NCA should be defined  per sector (and have the information security aspect in their mandate. In scope should fall all  incidents that affect core services of the critical infrastructure and cause significant impact.  To measure impact the operator needs to get metrics and classify them against specific  thresholds i.e. number of citizens affected etc. The thresholds will be set by the NCAs after  consulting the CII operators. This part of the reporting framework would need to be  addressed by governmental authorities in order to be realized;   Challenge 2: Reporting clause in the contractual agreement  The provider needs to report to the critical infrastructures operator (a national risk  assessment should take place to indicate the national critical infrastructures and investigate  which of the core services are depending on cloud) according to the contract or SLA. The  customer (in this case the CII operator needs to judge which critical infrastructures  implemented in the cloud, are in scope). The scope of reporting incidents is determined in  the contract (mandatory), and usually all incidents need to be reported or the provider  operates a dashboard for the customer to monitor the service performance. This is one  challenge the operator should mitigate by specifying this requirement when agreeing on the  contract terms (reporting times, reporting flow, templates etc.).   Challenge 3: Template for reporting information  This report should include several technical information like: duration of breach,  remediation time, systems affected, root cause, mitigation actions, addressing the positions  taken on how to isolate the areas affected, remediation actions etc.; confidential  information trusted only between the provider and the customer are also included in this  report (name of provider, contact point etc.).  The operator would have to share information on the type of services affected, give specific  values to justify that the impact parameters measurements were over the set thresholds and  provide feedback on remedial actions and lessons learnt, adding data on the impact  assessment and subsequent root causes. Both reports the one from the provider and the  one from the operator will need to be sent to the NCA for them to have a concrete idea of  the entire incident and in the end which services affect citizens in a large scale.  The need for a consolidated template is evident, so that NCAs will be able to collect and  aggregate the data received. The reporting templates serve two purposes: a single reporting  template is more efficient for providers with customers in different sectors, in different  countries, avoiding the need for different reports with different content. a single reporting  template makes it easier for authorities to discuss and exchange incident reports across  sectors and across the EU.   Challenge 4: Cross border security incidents  An incident can affect operators in different countries causing a cross boarder incident.  Operators will report the incident in their respective NCA’s. However the NCA’s need to have  a communciation channel between themselves. The report to the NCA would need to  include information on the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and on the customer, and will need  to cross check this data with the NCA of the other country affected, in order to avoid  duplication of notification of incidents.   Challenge 5: Bi-directional flow  The NCA will need to send a summarized report to the collaboration network. Together with  the the collaboration network, the NCA should provide feedback to the operator and the  provider, i.e. providing a threat landscape overview, issuing recommendations etc. The  collaboration network of authorities can support the governmental authorities in this task  creating this way a benefit to the customers and providers.   Challenge 6: A harmonized approach  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  25  A common reporting template for all providers could be a starting point towards  harmonizing incident reporting. ENISA in this report makes a proposal on a common- flexible  template to support the reporting scheme suggested.  6.2 Reporting by cloud service providers to authorities  6.2.1 Use case C: Governmental Clouds  One cloud provider (situated in country X) offers IaaS/ PaaS/ SaaS services to administrative bodies  in country X (out sourced private – community cloud). The provider offers the potential of  administrative institutions of the neighbour country Z to use the same services. The service provided  is used by the tax offices and customers to perform tax declaration. The sector is not critical as such,  but the data processed are.  In this case, as in case A, the user will insist on using his standard terms, the ones in accordance with  the security requirements of the governmental authority.  The provider has signed a contract with the administrative institutions. When an incident happens,  impacting the availability of the core systems of the customers, the provider will send, according to  the contractual terms, a report with the technical specifications, the causes and remediation actions  to the customer. Two challenges emerge in this case: which will be the NCA in this scheme; and who  will need to report the provider or the operator. Since the provider is dedicated to this service, he  would be able to provide a full report including impact analysis. However in the cases we have  analysed until now, the operator is the one that reports to the NCA, since it is the one that collects  more information on the scale of the impact (and is aware of the criticality of the services and data  processed). The scheme is depicted below:  Public  Administration  Public  Administration  Public  Administration  Public  Administration  C o  u n  tr y  b o  rd e  r  Cloud Service Provider  Cloud  NCA NCA  Figure 13 Governmental Clouds  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  26  6.2.2 Use case D: public cloud - non critical sectors  In this case, we describe a typical cloud provision model: a public cloud provider that offers services  (SaaS, PaaS), like mailing services or applications, to many customers. The customers vary from SMEs  and users, to operators that offer these services to other end users (supply chain of service  provision). These customers are across different countries (the provider is not aware of their  customers locations). When an incident occurs, affecting the service, the provider is obliged (if  according to the contractual terms or/and SLAs) to report details of the incident.  In the case of informing the end-users, possibly a report (or a press release) would be enough to  inform them of the security breach.  This incident (could be business critical, meaning that could  disrupt the daily operation of an enterprise) has major impact in society, causing loss of availability  to a great number of users. Thus it should be reported. The appropriate party to report this incident  is the provider of the services, estimating the total number of users affected. The challenge in this  case is one: which the NCA involved in this scheme.  The scheme is depicted below:  End  User  End  User  Enterprise  SME  NCA  SME  SME  End  user  End  user  Cloud Service Provider  Cloud  Figure 14 Public cloud - non critical sectors  6.2.3 Challenges of implementing security incident reporting   Challenge 1: Reporting process  The key difference of this use cases from the previous ones is that now the provider will be  the one that needs to judge when to report a security breach to the competent authorities.  Based on a case by cases analysis, the provider will need to report to the NCA on a voluntary  basis. The cases, for which the provider needs to report, have to be clarified;   Challenge 2: Impact estimation  The reporting requirements for incidents having a “significant impact” could be overly broad  and counterproductive when implemented by individual Member States. Cloud provider  doesn’t always know the precise impact, due to cascading effect and interdependencies.  For  this reason the NCAs should agree together with the CSP on a common approach to address  the “significant impact estimation”. The knowledge of CSPs would be very valuable at this  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  27  point, to explain how to measure loss of availability or continuity of a service offered and to  set clear metrics i.e. CPU performance, MB loss etc.  The provider will need to indicate the parameters and thresholds according to which the  incident has significant impact and needs to be reported. The thresholds need to be agreed  between the NCA and the cloud provide, giving the values above which the provider will  need to report;   Challenge 3: Information sharing  The provider will need to inform the respective NCA on the root causes, the impact  assessed, the services affected and the users/clients affected. The information on the initial  and subsequent causes should also be included; same applies for the services affected and  the impact parameters.   Challenge 4: Scope of reporting  The scope of the incident reporting is not the same as in the previous cases. Large scale  incidents should be reported, meaning incidents that affect many users in many different  countries causing significant impact; the cloud provider might not even be aware of the  exact number of users affected;   Challenge 5: Definition of roles  As in the previous case, the competent authority receiving the reports should be defined.  However in this case, the problem is more complicated: where in the previous case the  sector regulator that has a mandate on information security, would play the role of the  competent authority, in this case there in no regulatory body to take the responsibility.  Government should cooperate with the CSP to find the respective governmental authority to   Challenge 6: Voluntary reporting  Sharing aggregate data of incidents with competent authorities could also be made possible  by a voluntary information sharing model of industry. Clear guidelines on how the reporting  could be implemented for cloud providers need to be defined by the national authorities.  Lessons learnt are the most important fact of information sharing for both governmental  authorities and industry.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  28  6.3 Summary of reporting flows  In this section we depict in one image, the reporting flows as discussed with the previous sections:  Cloud Provider  Critical  Infrastructure  Critical  Infrastructure  NCA  EU Networks  (NCAs, ENISA)  Cloud Provider  User UserSME SME  1  2  3  4  1  Figure 15 Cloud incident reporting scheme  We summarize the reporting flows depicted below:  1. (blue arrows) Reporting of the cloud provider to the customer as described in the  contract/SLA clause. The report is customer specific and includes technical information on  the incident, duration, area impacted, remediation time, systems affected that caused the  incident, root cause and mitigation actions. It also includes information like provider name,  contact point etc. In some cases – in the simple end-users, the provider is not requested to  send an incident report but to make the incident public.  2. (red arrow) The operator of the critical infrastructure/ services reports to the National  Competent Authority (NCA). In addition to the technical report sent by the provider, the  operator includes specific data on the impact caused (make an impact “estimation”).  The  operator informs the NCA on the root causes, the impact assessed, the services affected and  the users/clients affected. The operator’s report contains information about the cloud  services affected and the impact parameters, combined with data on the impact on its core  services.  3. (dashed red arrow) The cloud provider reports an incident directly to the NCA. This reporting  applies only to major NIS incidents affecting large number of users. The provider sends a  report including this information to the competent authority.  4. (black dashed arrow) When relevant the national authority shares summaries of incidents’  reports that occurred to a network of authorities across the EU.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  29  7 Recommendations  7.1 General recommendations  We make several high-level recommendations about NIS incident reporting in cloud computing. We  target mostly the government authorities (ministries, regulators, et cetera) tasked with ICT risk  assessments and supervision of critical ICT (e.g. electronic communications, domain name registers,  domains, certificate authorities, et cetera) in general, because we believe national regulators are  fundamental in fostering transparency about NIS incidents and exchange of NIS practices.   Recommendation 1: Set scope with a national ICT infrastructure risk assessment  The ICT sector is rapidly changing; besides the quick changes in the traditional electronic  communications services, recent years there is a wide range of other ICT services which are  becoming more and more widely used, and hence more critical. Authorities should conduct  risk assessments, periodically, and in this way determine the critical parts of the national ICT  infrastructure. These critical parts should be targeted with specific (CIIP or other) regulation  and reporting of network and information security incidents (NIS incidents) should be used  by regulators to understand the state of security and resilience of this infrastructure.   Recommendation 2: Prioritize critical sectors and interdependencies  Priority should be given to the critical information infrastructure used in the critical sectors  (defined by the CIP directive (2008/114/EC) – energy, oil, gas, roads, rails, air transport,  waterways, shipping and ports excluding those telecoms sectors already covered by Article  13a. It is important to identify the cyclic dependencies between critical services, for  example, the dependencies between the energy sector and the ICT sector.  Power outages,  for instance, often have an impact ICT infrastructure such as electronic communication  networks. This infrastructure may also be needed to manage the power outage. In fact in  some countries23 there is a priority scheme for supplying fuel to data centres during large  crises.   Recommendation 3: Only critical parts of cloud computing should be in scope  Cloud computing is now becoming the backbone of our digital society.  At the same time it is  not easy to identify all the cloud computing services which, if failing, could have a severe  impact in society. Authorities should translate their national ICT infrastructure risk  assessment to specific thresholds for specific services, and in this way target only the critical  cloud computing services.   Recommendation 4: Use EU wide NIS incident reporting as a driver for discussing NIS  Incident reporting and sharing summaries of these reports nationally, with the sector and in  pan-EU fora24, lead to a better understanding of security and resilience of IT infrastructure  and to a discussion about best practices. An active role needs to be played by the national  authorities who need to set up national reporting schemes for NIS incidents and act as a  filter for the sharing of incident reports across borders. National reporting can then be used  as a basis for a better understanding of the security and resilience of large ICT  infrastructures in the EU. Sharing of incident reports across borders naturally leads to  o a common vocabulary/terminology for speaking about threats and causes, it  provides a cross-check on the risk assessments (performed by companies) across the  EU;  23  Japan for instance.  24  In interviews some experts referred to the concept of “European NIS incidents”.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  30  o a starting point for discussion with the industry about which security measures and  practices worked and if something more should be done;  o an EU wide view of common threats and common causes which can provide useful  information for ICT service providers and cloud  providers in particular.   Recommendation 5: Harmonized cloud incident reporting schemes  Many experts from industry and government warned for the risk of unnecessary costs due to  national differences in implementing NIS incident reporting in cloud computing, especially  because cloud providers often work across borders, which means that customers and  regulators from several countries are involved. To allow for a level playing field and a  competitive single digital market it is important to harmonize the implementation of  incident reporting legislation whenever possible. There are several areas which should be  addressed.  o Common vocabulary and format: For the sake of efficiency authorities should agree on  common vocabulary and terminology when speaking about incidents. This is important  for customers, who may be dealing with multiple cloud providers, for providers, who  may be dealing with regulators and customers from multiple countries, and for  authorities, who may be dealing with incident reports from providers in different  countries. Common digital formats for NIS incident reports (an XML scheme e.g.) would  greatly facilitate the implementation of incident reporting for providers, customers and  regulators;  o Common deadlines and procedures: For the same reason it is important to agree on  common procedures for reporting. For example, authorities across the different sectors,  across the EU could agree on a two-step procedure where a brief notification is sent  within hours and a full report is sent within days25;  o Common terminology for causes: One of the key goals of incident reporting is to  understand the causes of incidents. By using a single terminology for (root) causes and  threats authorities can more easily get an EU wide picture and understand risks in their  countries better using the information about incidents which occurred across borders. In  the context of the implementation of incident reporting under Article 13a ENISA  introduced 5 root cause categories (Human Errors, System Failures, Malicious actions,  Natural phenomena, Third party failures), which are used as a high-level classification. A  vocabulary of more detailed causes (power cut, cable cut, DDoS attack) could then be  used to analyse incidents in more detail;  o Common impact parameters: It may be difficult to agree across the EU about common  reporting thresholds because different countries have different size and different ICT  dependencies. At the same time, a first step towards understanding the national  differences is to agree first on a set of common impact parameters, such as the number  of customers (or organisations) affected, the range of services affected, the  consequences for customers affected, the geographic spread of incidents.   Recommendation 6: Think big, but start small  The field of NIS is growing and becoming more complex. There is also a wide range of  different types of NIS incidents, ranging from everyday nuisances such as small power cuts  affecting electronic communications, to organized attacks by criminals, severe natural  phenomena affecting data centres, and so on.  It may be tempting to try to address a wide  range of incidents rather sooner than later, but it might be more effective to focus on a  25  Such a set up would follow the two-step procedure described by the EC regarding the implementation of  Article 4 of the e-Privacy directive, and it is in line with the two-step reporting process most EU member states  use in the implementation  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  31  small subset of incidents and a small subset of cloud services first and extend scope only at a  later stage. An iterative approach is particularly useful when addressing large and complex  problems26.  Useful scope restrictions could be for instance to focus only on cloud service  outages, because outages are easy to detect and measure quantitatively, or a subset of  services, IaaS e.g., because these services are more standardized and are used more like a  utility infrastructure than other cloud services.   Recommendation 7: Authorities should collaborate with industry and develop voluntary  reporting schemes  Most industry experts advocated in favour of starting with voluntary reporting schemes.  Authorities should take this opportunity to collaborate with the industry and start piloting  voluntary schemes, supporting this way the aforementioned idea of starting from a subset of  services, and then moving to a larger one.   Recommendation 8: Pan-EU sharing  All experts were strongly in favour of reporting schemes involving pan-EU sharing of  information, as opposed to more isolated national reporting schemes. By sharing summaries  of incident reports with other authorities, they can discuss trends, common threats, as well  as security measures and best practices. Only in this way can authorities feed-back relevant  information to the industry. As a by-product, the sharing of incident reports will also  contribute to harmonization, by introducing a single pan-EU terminology and vocabulary to  discuss about threats, assets, and cloud security in general.  We believe national authorities should take an active role in engaging the cloud computing  customers and cloud computing providers and pilot with them basic reporting schemes for NIS  incidents in cloud computing. We look forward to facilitate this process and support authorities and  providers with agreeing on efficient and effective reporting schemes, which provides the right  information to authorities, citizens, customers and cloud providers without creating unnecessary  costs for cloud providers and cloud customers.  7.2 Outlook  Security is often cited as an issue in cloud computing- partly because of general considerations  arising from loss of control and lock-in of the customer and partly because data protection laws  require providers to take appropriate measures, leaving security in a second place.  Cloud infrastructures now form a cornerstone of the digital society.  Partly in consequence, the EU’s  2012 cloud strategy aims to speed up the adoption of cloud computing as an enabler for financial  and economic development. However, the increasing reliance on common technologies also raises  concerns about the resilience of critical information infrastructures. It is widely acknowledged that  the current lack of information about network and information security incidents can prevent  government authorities and industry from taking action to mitigate the risks of future incidents. The  EU’s Proposal on the NIS strategy aims to address this problem by extending incident reporting  obligations to a wide range of critical information infrastructures.  This report has analysed barriers and incentives for reporting incidents that involve cloud  computing.  We have described how the exchange of lessons learnt can help to increase the  resilience of cloud computing services.  The benefits of reporting incidents include: information  sharing, experience exchange, identification of route causes and mitigations, data and trend analysis  etc. The aim has been to provide government authorities (ministries, regulators, cyber security  agencies) with an overview of issues and challenges when implementing national and pan-European  26  It is indeed de-facto standard for software development now.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  32  schemes for reporting incidents in cloud computing.  The closing sections have also provided  recommendations on the first steps that European and national agencies can take to implement  future reporting scehemes.  This is just a first approach of a topic that will concern us more in depth in the future. ENISA, having  the experience of a reporting scheme from been involved in Article13a reporting framework, will  support all the relevant parties, competent authorities, providers and operators, to achieve a  harmonised approach across all Member States.

A natural question for anyone to ask is  “how often do cyber security incidents occur?”, “what was their impact?”, “what causes them?” But  unfortunately, when it comes to security incidents we are usually navigating in the dark.  Organisations often do not detect incidents when they happen and there is hardly any reporting  about incidents to government authorities or the public. This makes it hard (for anyone) to  understand which are the threats causing these incidents, what is the impact, etc.  Without this  information it is also hard to appreciate what is going well and what could be improved.  In 2013 the EU published a cyber-security strategy focusing on preventing large scale failures and  attacks on network and information systems. A cornerstone of the cyber security strategy is the  obligation for businesses providing critical services to report about security incidents. The strategy  follows discussions in many countries about tighter regulation on cyber security issues – and  particularly the lack of legislation, which obliges organizations to take appropriate security measures  and to report about past incidents.  The proposed NIS Directive mentions cloud computing explicitly. This is not surprising. Cloud  infrastructures play an increasingly important role in the digital society.  A large part of the EU’s  Digital Agenda is the European cloud strategy which aims to speed up adoption of cloud computing  for financial and economic benefits. ENISA has often underlined the security opportunities of cloud  computing. Cloud computing is becoming the backbone of the EU’s digital society. It is easy to see  that certain cloud security incidents could have a major impact in society. In this paper we look at  how incident reporting about cloud security incidents could be implemented in an effective and  efficient way. It needs to be underlined that this document is not a guide on how to implement the  Proposed NIS Directive but a first step towards studying how to implement incident reporting in  cloud computing deployed services.  We asked a range of experts from industry and public sector to give their perspective on the issue of  cloud security incident reporting. Which incidents should be reported, what should be reported, how  we can use reporting to improve security. Some key issues which were raised:   It is difficult to assess the criticality of the cloud services for a national regulator. There are  many interdependencies, different layers of the cloud stack, different deployment models  and different kind of data stored. A lot depends on the specific setting – and often the cloud  computing customer is in the best position to judge the criticality and the potential impact  of incidents.   Cloud services are often based on other cloud services; they are distributed systems and  built up in several layers. Incident reporting is different in these different layers.   From the cloud customer’s point of view, most standard contracts do not commit providers  to reporting about security incidents to customers. Even though, some cloud providers do  have dashboards where some incidents are published and explained.   From the provider’s side, it is up to the customer to include incident reporting obligations in  contracts. For this reason, in many cloud contracts incident reporting is not addressed.   Incident reporting is becoming more and more common in regulated sectors, like energy and  finance where operators need to report incidents to regulators.   Incident reporting should be part of a bi-directional flow of information where providers  report about security incidents to authorities and authorities’ feedback common threats and  common issues to the cloud providers so they can improve security and resilience.  In this report we analyse how cloud providers, customers in critical sectors, and government  authorities can set up cloud security incident reporting schemes, in four use case scenarios:  http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_directive_en.pdf  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  iv  A. One cloud for one critical information infrastructure sector;  B. One cloud for multiple critical sectors;  C. One governmental cloud;  D. One widely used cloud.  Based on the feedback received from experts we present two schemes for cloud security incident  reporting that cover those four cases. The parties involved are the cloud service provider (CSP), the  cloud operator or customer, the national competent authority and the collaboration network.  We make several recommendations in this report. Summarizing them:   We recommend customers in critical sectors to address incident reporting in their contracts  and SLAs [recommendation 2]. We encourage setting the scope after conducting a national  ICT infrastructure risk assessment [recommendation 1]. In a number of countries there are  now legislative initiatives forcing operators in critical sectors [recommendation 3] to report  about security incidents, and this means that these customers should include incident  reporting in their contracts with cloud service providers.   We recommend government authorities, which are responsible for governmental cloud  programs or government IT to address incident reporting obligations in their security  requirements [recommendation 4]. Incident reports provide a valuable crosscheck on the  effectiveness of the security measures in place, and the security of the procured cloud  services overall. Information sharing between all parties in a reporting framework  [recommendation 5] will enhance knowledge on good practices in reporting cloud security  incidents.   We also encourage providers to discuss and agree on the scope [recommendation 6], start  small and the authorities to encourage voluntary incident reporting schemes, because it is  important that government and the public get information about common threats and the  overall impact of security incidents in cloud computing [recommendation 7]. Incident  reporting would also enable government authorities to better inform the private sector  about threats and common root causes. Obviously there is a catch-22 here: If nobody shares  incident reports, then nobody will benefit from sharing [recommendation 8]. Providers  should jointly start with voluntary reporting schemes and engage with the government  authorities about how incident reporting can help the providers to address problems.  ENISA has frequently highlighted the important security challenges of cloud computing. Some cloud  service providers are leading the way in implementing state-of-the-art security measures. In cloud  computing, using the economies of scale, a high-level of security becomes affordable also for small  customers. We look forward to working with cloud providers and (public and private) customers to  improve the transparency in cloud computing security by implementing efficient and effective  incident reporting schemes across sectors and across the EU.

Some years  ago most organisations have begun switching to outsource their applications and data to large  datacentres, hosting providers and cloud providers. Commissioner Kroes, responsible for the  implementation of the EU’s Digital Agenda, has remarked that cloud services are becoming the  backbone of our digital society. Public data about the uptake of cloud computing shows that in a  short time the majority of organisations will be dependent on cloud computing. Large cloud  providers will be serving tens of millions of end-users. Cloud computing services are increasingly  playing an important role for society and the economy. The EU’s cloud strategy, published in 2012,  aims to speed up adoption of cloud computing for financial and economic benefits. ENISA has often  underlined the security benefits of cloud computing. The Japanese government, for example, after  the large earthquake of 2011, actively promoted cloud computing as a way to improve the resilience  of information infrastructures to withstand natural disasters.  The increased dependency of society on cloud computing makes cloud computing also relevant from  a national CIIP (Critical Information Infrastructure Protection) perspective. Cloud computing is, in a  way, a double-edged sword: On the one hand, cloud computing offers important benefits in terms of  information security and resilience, for example in the face of DDoS attacks. On the other hand, the  concentration of IT resources in a few large datacentres implies that failures or cyber-attacks could  have a large impact on society and the economy.  The 2009 CIIP action plan already calls for discussions on a governance strategy for cloud computing.  The EC’s 2013 Cyber security strategy focuses on preventing large scale failures of, and large scale  attacks on, network and information systems in the EU.  The strategy explicitly includes cloud  computing services in scope. It is widely acknowledged that the current lack of transparency about  network and information security incidents complicates efforts by government authorities and  industry to increase the resilience of our critical information infrastructures. A cornerstone of the  EU’s cyber security strategy is to extend incident reporting obligations to other critical information  infrastructures, besides the telecom sector1.  In this report we take a CIIP perspective on cloud computing. We analyse how reporting about  significant Network and Information Security (NIS) incidents could be implemented for cloud  computing services.  Goal  The benefits of incident reporting are well known and widely supported: information sharing, the  dissemination of lessons learnt and experience exchange, identification of route causes and  mitigation techniques, data and trend analysis are some of the most important advantages of a large  scale reporting scheme.  The goal of this report is to provide government authorities (ministries, regulators, cyber security  agencies) with an overview of issues and challenges when implementing (national and pan- European) schemes for reporting about significant security incidents in cloud computing.  We also provide government authorities with guidance on the first steps that could be taken to  implement voluntary reporting schemes.  1  In the electronic communications sector the reform of Framework directive introduced obligations for  providers to assess risks, to take appropriate security measures and to report about significant incidents. These  provisions have now been implemented across the EU.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  2  This document is not a guide on how to implement the Proposed NIS Directive but how to  implement incident reporting in cloud computing deployed services.  Target audience  This report is targeted at:   government authorities in the EU (ministries, regulators, cyber security agencies, et cetera),  who are involved with the protection of critical information infrastructures and/or the  supervision of IT e-government services, electronic communication services, large data  centres, IT used in critical sectors, etc.   operators of critical infrastructure who consider using cloud computing to support their core  services, cloud providers with customers in critical sectors or performing vital functions, and  cloud providers who play a critical role in the digital society.  Scope  In this report we take a CIIP perspective on cloud computing. We focus on reporting network and  information security incidents involving cloud computing services.  We do not address all kinds of cloud computing services, but we restrict ourselves to those cloud  computing services2, which when failing or attacked, could have a major impact on the society or the  economy.  This mirrors the scope of the CIIP action plan and the EU’s cyber security strategy,  focussing on:   Cloud services which are used by operators of critical infrastructures (transport, energy, et  cetera) to support their core services.   Cloud services which are by themselves critical, being key enablers of services in the digital  society.  This means we look at public cloud services, which anyone can subscribe to, as well as private and  community clouds, which are dedicated for one customer or a community of customers. Also we  look at supply chain management, including cloud services which are directly or indirectly used by  operators.  This report does not address personal data or personal data protection3 in detail – although some  security incidents could well have an impact on personal data. From a CIIP perspective the focus is  on incidents with a significant impact on the society and the economy, while from a data protection  perspective the focus is on the impact to the individual. Also, while cloud users may have their own  individual end users (i.e. employees or customers using the service procured) we primarily focus on  the cloud user’s relationship with its cloud provider.  2  Cloud computing definition by the National Institution of Standards and Technology (NIST) : Cloud computing  is a model for enabling convenient, on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing  resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and  released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.  3  Note that under data protection legislation even very small incidents have to be reported to data protection  authorities, while CIIP legislation specifically focusses only on large failures and large attacks, which could have  a major impact on the society or economy.  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://www.nist.gov/  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  3  Methodology  The recommendations and guidance in this report were developed in cooperation with an expert  working group including representatives of the stakeholders mentioned in previous paragraphs,  major cloud service providers, government agencies, industry association, and the customers of  cloud services, both in the public and in the private sector.  Their input was collected using an on- line survey and a series of more open-ended interviews.  The intention was to identify their views,  best practices in incident reporting, both in Europe and abroad, with a particular focus on Critical  Information Infrastructures.  Structure  This document is structured as follows:   In Section 2 we introduce the notion of cloud security incidents, first by defining the cloud  computing model and introducing different types of cloud services;   In Section 3 we give an overview of the related legislative initiatives, summarizing the EU’s  CIIP directive, Article 13a of the electronic communications framework, and Article 14 of the  proposed NIS directive; all the activities the community is taking towards a common  framework for reporting incidents and improve network resilience across the EU.   In Section 4 we explain and give examples of cloud security incidents to focus on their  criticality for the citizens.   In Section 5 we summarize the views and perspectives of the experts in the ENISA expert  group on the specific topic and more specifically, to report the technical details of cloud  security incident reporting.   In Section 6 we list the challenges when reporting cloud security incident by elaborating on  four (4) use cases.   In Section 7 we conclude with a set of high level recommendations for national authorities.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  4  2 Definitions: Cloud computing services  This section introduces cloud computing services model and explains most “incident related” terms  that will be used throughout this report.  2.1 Cloud computing services model  NIST developed a reference architecture for cloud computing, explaining the different existing types  of cloud computing and all the actors and processes involved4. Different types of cloud services, each  involve different types of technology and assets. We give an overview below – see Figure 1.   Infrastructure as a Service: In IaaS the provider delivers storage (virtual databases) or  computing resources (virtual hardware), via the internet. Examples include Amazon’s Elastic  Compute Cloud, Google’s Compute Engine, Amazon Simple Storage Service, Google Cloud  Storage, Microsoft Windows Azure Storage, Rackspace, et cetera. Customers start and stop  virtual machines, or they store or access data.   Platform as a Service: In PaaS, the provider delivers a platform for customers to run  applications on (typically web applications). Often PaaS providers supply software  development tools to construct applications for the platform. Typical types of applications  that run on these platforms are scripts (PHP, Python, e.g.) or byte code (Java servlets, C#).  Examples include Google App engine, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, et cetera.   Software as a Service: In SaaS, the provider delivers fully-fledged software or applications,  via the Internet. Applications range from email servers, email clients, document editors, or  customer relationship management systems. SaaS services can often be accessed with a  browser or a web services client.   Facilities: Facilities are the basic IT resources which underlies all types of cloud services  (IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS), network, housing, cooling, power.   Organisation: Organisation is the human resources, the processes and the policies and  procedures that maintain the facilities and support the delivery of services.  Figure 1 Map of different technologies across different types of cloud services  4  http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=909505  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  5  Note that some providers only offer IaaS or PaaS services, some providers only offer SaaS. SaaS  providers often run their applications on IaaS or PaaS infrastructures.  2.2 Definitions  In this section we give definitions5 of terms that are widely used across this report:   Incident: A breach of security or a loss of integrity that has impact on the operation of  network and information system core services, which public administrations and market  operators provide. The “reportable incident” is the one that has deemed significant impact.   Incident Reporting: The procedure by which the reporting party (cloud provider or cloud  operator) shall submit to the national competent authority a report with information on the  incident, on ad-hoc basis.   Impact: A measure reflecting the average number of affected parameters/assets per  incident, to show   Root cause: The reason that caused the incident.   Parameters: the criteria to be used to measure impact of an incident.   Thresholds: The specific values of the parameters that when overpassed, the impact of the  incident is deemed significant and the incident falls into the incident reporting scope.   Early warning: The procedure based on which the dissemination of information on incident  is done in a fast way to the interested companies to alert them of an on-going attack or  other incident, so that immediate action could be taken.   Threat: A threat is an event or a circumstance which could cause a security incident.  5  The definitions are based on the Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting adopted for cloud computing incident reporting:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents- reporting/Technical%20Guidelines%20on%20Incident%20Reporting/technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/Technical%20Guidelines%20on%20Incident%20Reporting/technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/Technical%20Guidelines%20on%20Incident%20Reporting/technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  6  3 Background: Policy context  In this section we summarize relevant EU policy and legislative initiatives on CIIP and security  incident reporting.  3.1 EC Communications on CIIP  The Communication on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) issued by the EC in 2009  aimed to improve preparedness, security and resilience, with the goal to protect Europe from large  scale cyber-attacks and failures. The motivation for this communication was that Information and  Communication Technology (ICT) is increasingly intertwined in our daily activities, and that some ICT  infrastructures form a vital part of the European economy and society, either because they provide  essential services (such as emergency communications) or because they underpin other critical  infrastructures. ENISA is responsible for a range of activities mentioned in the CIIP action plan.  The CIIP communication defines Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs)6 as all ICT systems which  are either,  a) critical infrastructure themselves, or;  b) essential for the operation of other critical infrastructures.  This builds on the definition of critical infrastructures in COM(2005) 576; “Critical infrastructures  include those physical resources, services, and information technology facilities, networks and  infrastructure assets which, if disrupted or destroyed, would have a serious impact on the health,  safety, security or economic well-being of citizens or the effective functioning of governments”.  COM(2011) 163 notes that: “It is essential to strengthen discussions on the best governance  strategies for emerging technologies with a global impact, such as cloud computing. These  discussions should certainly include, but not be limited to, the appropriate governance framework for  the protection of personal data. Trust is essential in order to reap its full benefits”.  In its Conclusions on CIIP of 27 May 2011, the Council of the European Union stressed the pressing  need to make ICT systems and networks resilient and secure to all possible disruptions, whether  accidental or intentional; to develop across the Union a high level of preparedness, security and  resilience capabilities and to upgrade technical competences to help Europe face the challenge of  network and information infrastructure protection; and to foster Member States' cooperation by  developing incident cooperation mechanisms between them.  Two Ministerial Conferences on CIIP took place respectively in Tallinn in 2009 and in Balatonfüred in  2011. Tallinn started the debate on the general direction of the European efforts towards an  increased network and information security for the future. Balatonfüred provided a forum to take  stock of progress, assess lessons learnt and discuss the challenges ahead and next steps. It also  investigated the way forward to engaging all stakeholders and in particular the private sector.  In 2011, the EC took stock of the results achieved so far and indicated future steps. The CIIP  communication emphasises the need to identify best governance strategies for cloud computing,  and that these discussions should include, but not be limited to the protection of personal data.  The European Parliament Resolution of 12 June 2012 on \"Critical Information Infrastructure  Protection: towards global cyber-security\" broadly endorsed the 2011 Communication and made  recommendations to the Commission for the way forward. Many of these recommendations have  6 The OECD defines CII as those information systems and networks, the disruption or destruction of which would have a serious impact on  the health, safety, security, or economic well-being of citizens, or on the effective functioning of government or the economy. Both  definitions are equivalent.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2005/com2005_0576en01.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2011:0163:FIN:EN:PDF http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/sede/dv/sede150611cccybersecurity_/sede150611cccybersecurity_en.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2011:0163:FIN:EN:PDF http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P7-TA-2012-0237&language=EN&ring=A7-2012-0167 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P7-TA-2012-0237&language=EN&ring=A7-2012-0167  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  7  been taken on board in the Cyber security strategy and proposal for a Directive on network and  information security published in 2013.  3.2 Article 13a of the Framework directive  The reform of the EU legal framework for electronic communications, which was adopted in 2009  and was transposed by most EU countries around May 2011, adds Article 13a to the Framework  Directive (2009/140/EC). Article 13a addresses the security and integrity7 of public electronic  communications networks and services. The legislation concerns national regulatory authorities  (NRAs) and providers of public electronic communications networks and services8. It has three main  provisions:   NRAs must ensure that e-Comms providers take appropriate steps to guarantee the security  and resilience of electronic communication networks and services.   Providers of electronic communication networks and services must report significant  incidents to competent authorities (NRAs)   NRAs must provide a summary of significant incidents to ENISA and the EC.  In other words, Article 13a asks EU Member States to set up a reporting scheme for significant  incidents. The actors and information flows in Article 13a are depicted in Figure 6.  Figure 2 Actors and information flows in Article 13a  Article 13a of the Framework directive, together with Article 4 of the e-Privacy directive, are  currently the only EU directives that oblige providers to report security incidents. Both directives are  limited to electronic communications networks and services. Article 15 of the draft regulation on  electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions, requires that trust service  providers have to undertake extensive security measures and notify competent bodies of any breach  7 Here integrity means network integrity, which is often called availability or continuity in information security literature.  8 More information on Article13a can be found here:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting  Network or  service  provider  Competent  national  authority  EC and ENISA National  authorities  abroad and ENISA  3  6  Victims  Public  2  4  1  1  Security measures  Notification  Informing  Summary reporting  4  5  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/regframeforec_dec2009.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0058:EN:HTML http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0238:FIN:en:PDF https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  8  of security and loss of integrity with significant impact on the trust service provided and on personal  data maintained therein.  3.3 Proposal for a Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive  In 2013 the European Commission communicated its Cyber Security Strategy and proposed a  European Network and Information Security Directive. The key motivation for the directive was that  several member states are taking action to improve cyber security, but there is no common and  consistent approach across the EU. The NIS directive was proposed to ensure a level playing field for  businesses across the EU and to avoid a weakest link9.  The main pillars of the proposed NIS directive include: (1) the implementation of national NIS  strategies and the national NIS cooperation plans, (2) the enforcement of CERTs,  (3) the cooperation  between competent authorities and (4) the enhancement of security of the NIS systems of public  administrations and market operators.  These will need to be implemented by Member States.  One of the main goals of the proposed NIS directive is to extend Article 13a of the Framework  directive beyond the electronic communications sector, to cover other critical information  infrastructures: Article14 of the proposed NIS Directive.  The scope of Article14 of the proposed NIS directive applies to government administrations and  ‘market operators’:  (a) providers of information society services which enable the provision of other information  society services  (b) operators of critical infrastructure which is essential for the maintenance of vital economic  and societal activities in the fields of energy, transport, banking, stock exchanges and health.  The legal text of Article 14 can be (graphically) summarized as follows.  Figure 3 Information flows and actors described in Article 14  9 The DIginotar incident underscores how an incident in one country can have an impact across the border.

(blue dotted arrow) National competent authorities should ensure that public  administrations and market operators take appropriate technical and organisational security  measures to protect network and information systems underpinning their core services10.  2. (red arrow) When a significant security incident occurs, the public administrator or market  operator should notify the competent authority.  3. (black dash-dotted arrow) Depending on the circumstance, the competent authority might  inform the public or require the market operator to do so.  4. (black dashed arrow) Annually, the competent authority should send summary reports  about the incidents to the cooperation network, which includes all competent authorities  across the EU.  The cooperation network should discuss about past incidents, lessons learnt, ex-post, common  issues, et cetera, and agrees on a common, harmonized approach.  10  Article 15 of the NIS Directive (“Implementation and enforcement”) gives competent authorities the power  to request market operators to do a self-assessment, to undergo an audit, and/or to investigate cases of non- compliance.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  10  4 Critical cloud computing  In some settings cloud computing services can be critical. We distinguish two cases:   Case 1: Cloud computing services which are used by operators of critical infrastructure to  support the delivery of their core services, in cases where the reliability of the underlying  cloud technology is itself essential to the safe functioning of the critical service.   Case 2: Cloud computing services which are critical in themselves, i.e. if failing there would  be a significant impact on health safety, security or economic well-being of EU citizens or the  effective functioning EU governments.  In this section we give specific examples of settings where cloud computing services are critical.  Note that we mention names of specific customers, specific providers and specific services, but they  are intended as examples. We do not intend to single out specific organisations or specific services  for criticism or praise.  4.1 Cloud services which underpin critical infrastructure  Cloud services are increasingly being used in critical sectors. Below we give some example from the  finance, transport and health sector11:   The Air Traffic Managements solutions for the Singe European Sky (SESAR) aims at  developing the new generation air traffic management system capable of ensuring the  safety and fluidity of air transport worldwide over the next 30 years. SESAR is funding a  project on a secure Cloud for Air Traffic Management.12   In the US, the FAA released their cloud computing strategy and announced a $91 million  contract for Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Microsoft to create a cloud email  system for the agency. The agency also announced the transition of their air traffic  management systems onto cloud networks in the future.   NASDAQ OMX FinQloud is a cloud computing platform, which runs on Amazon Web Services,  to monitor compliance requirements (execution compliance and surveillance systems) for  high frequency trading operators13.   A Slovenia-based railway operator has selected a cloud-based platform to centralize  passenger, freight and logistics information systems across its rail network14.   A big oil company adopted a private cloud model for preproduction systems, testing  environment and data processing – 60% of the company’s infrastructure is virtual15.   Another major oil company in the United States adopted PaaS to collect and process  information for early warning systems16.   In Luxembourg the government has issues guidelines on how to implement cloud in the  finance sector. The new law enriches the Luxembourg legal framework of the cloud  computing and the service industry in general.17  11 Directive Annex II, critical sectors: Energy, Transport, Banking, Financial market, Health sector.  12  http://www.sesarju.eu/programme/workpackages/wpe/research-projects-results-second-call-1304  13 http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/nasdaq-finqloud/  14 http://blog.executivebiz.com/2013/08/ibm-to-help-intl-rail-operator-install-cloud-it-system-roman-koritnik-comments/  15  http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9225827/Shell_Oil_targets_hybrid_cloud_as_fix_for_energy_saving_agile_IT?taxonomyId=158 &pageNumber=2  16  http://www.spgindia.org/spg_2012/spgp160.pdf  17  http://www.newsletter-nautadutilh.com/EN/xzine/information_-  _communication_technology/luxembourg_le_droit_de_revendiquer_ses_donn%C3%A9es%20aupr%C3%A8s_dun_fournisseur_de_solutio  http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/atc_comms_services/swim/documentation/media/cloud_computing/FAA%20Cloud%20Computing%20Strategy%20v1.0.pdf http://www.sesarju.eu/programme/workpackages/wpe/research-projects-results-second-call-1304 http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/nasdaq-finqloud/ http://blog.executivebiz.com/2013/08/ibm-to-help-intl-rail-operator-install-cloud-it-system-roman-koritnik-comments/ http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9225827/Shell_Oil_targets_hybrid_cloud_as_fix_for_energy_saving_agile_IT?taxonomyId=158&pageNumber=2 http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9225827/Shell_Oil_targets_hybrid_cloud_as_fix_for_energy_saving_agile_IT?taxonomyId=158&pageNumber=2 http://www.spgindia.org/spg_2012/spgp160.pdf http://www.newsletter-nautadutilh.com/EN/xzine/information_-_communication_technology/luxembourg_le_droit_de_revendiquer_ses_donn%C3%A9es%20aupr%C3%A8s_dun_fournisseur_de_solutions_cloud_failli/luxembourg_the_right_to_claim_back_data_from_bankrupt_cloud_comp http://www.newsletter-nautadutilh.com/EN/xzine/information_-_communication_technology/luxembourg_le_droit_de_revendiquer_ses_donn%C3%A9es%20aupr%C3%A8s_dun_fournisseur_de_solutions_cloud_failli/luxembourg_the_right_to_claim_back_data_from_bankrupt_cloud_comp  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  11  There have been incidents affecting cloud services, which impacted critical infrastructure.  We give  some examples below:   In 2011, Finish IT operator Tieto faced an incident for (in some cases) several weeks,  affecting 50 of the company customers in both private and public sectors.  The impact was  felt across Sweden18. Some customers suffered minimal effects over a number of days;  others lost their IT services for several weeks. The causes were traced back to hardware  failures. This incident had an immediate effect to the citizens, since the IT system was  supporting for the process of provisioning drugs to patients all over the country.   In 2013, the NASDAQ OMX crashed for three hours, with a major financial impact on  brokers. The problem was traced to a connectivity issue between an exchange participant  and the industry processor, which meant the system, was unable to disseminate  consolidated quotes and trades19.  4.2 Cloud services which underpin the digital society  Cloud computing services have become critical for the digital society as a whole, even if they are not  directly supporting critical infrastructures. Some cloud services which are used by many citizens in  everyday life or by many companies. In these cases major security incidents could have a large  impact in society.  We give some examples of outages:   August 2013, Amazon Web Services suffers an outage, taking down Vine, Instagram and  other applications for an hour. This outage shows that no proper redundancy policy is  applied correctly.20.   March 2013, Microsoft’s email infrastructures suffered a loss of availability for nearly 16  hours affecting business critical services.  The causes stemmed from a faulty software  update. The number of users affected has not been disclosed21.   January 2013, Dropbox suffered a substantial loss of service for more than 15 hours affecting  all users across the globe22.   October 2011, millions of Blackberry users across Europe, Middle East and Africa suffered an  outage lasting three days. The company has about 70m users around the world. Speculation  is that most of the global customer base may have been affected at some point during this  time.  For providers it is difficult to estimate the number of end-users or organizations affected by an  incident, especially when they affect IaaS/PaaS.  It is also hard to assess the number of end-users  and organisations depending on a cloud computing service.  One reason is that knock-on effects can  create cascading failures when IaaS/PaaS providers offer services to other organizations, which in  turn provide services to third parties. This long supply chain makes it difficult to measure the impact  of incidents or the criticality of a service in terms of the number of end-users, because the number  of end-users cannot be easily estimated by the service provider.  ns_cloud_failli/luxembourg_the_right_to_claim_back_data_from_bankrupt_cloud_computing_providers/luxembourg_the_right_to_claim _back_data_from_bankrupt_cloud_computing_providers.html?cid=4&xzine_id=4945&aid=14382  18  https://www.msb.se/RibData/Filer/pdf/26170.pdf  19  http://www.bankingtech.com/161382/nasdaq-omx-connectivity-disaster-highlights-stumbling-markets/  20  http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-26/another-amazon-outage-exposes-the-clouds-dark-lining  21  https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/240150826/microsoft-cloud-outage-blamed-on-faulty-update.htm  22  http://www.crn.com/slide-shows/channel-programs/240146101/5-companies-that-dropped-the- ball.htm?pgno=5  http://www.newsletter-nautadutilh.com/EN/xzine/information_-_communication_technology/luxembourg_le_droit_de_revendiquer_ses_donn%C3%A9es%20aupr%C3%A8s_dun_fournisseur_de_solutions_cloud_failli/luxembourg_the_right_to_claim_back_data_from_bankrupt_cloud_comp http://www.newsletter-nautadutilh.com/EN/xzine/information_-_communication_technology/luxembourg_le_droit_de_revendiquer_ses_donn%C3%A9es%20aupr%C3%A8s_dun_fournisseur_de_solutions_cloud_failli/luxembourg_the_right_to_claim_back_data_from_bankrupt_cloud_comp https://www.msb.se/RibData/Filer/pdf/26170.pdf http://www.bankingtech.com/161382/nasdaq-omx-connectivity-disaster-highlights-stumbling-markets/ http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-26/another-amazon-outage-exposes-the-clouds-dark-lining https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/240150826/microsoft-cloud-outage-blamed-on-faulty-update.htm http://www.crn.com/slide-shows/channel-programs/240146101/5-companies-that-dropped-the-ball.htm?pgno=5 http://www.crn.com/slide-shows/channel-programs/240146101/5-companies-that-dropped-the-ball.htm?pgno=5  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  12  5 Perspectives on Cloud Security Incident reporting  To gain a better understanding of the views and perspectives of experts on the topic of cloud  security incident reporting we conducted an online survey and several interviews with experts from  industry, industry associations, government, and academia. In this section we show and analyse the  responses from the survey and we discuss the highlights from the interview by including quotes from  experts which are representative.  5.1 Results from survey and interviews  5.1.1 Participants and respondents  In total we conducted 15 interviews and 25 questionnaires. Figure 8 provides an overview of the  different participants in the interviews and their roles respectively.  Figure 4 Overview of stakeholders participating in the Interviews and Survey  Some of the topics we included in this collection of information are:   Incentives for reporting;   Compulsory vs Voluntary reporting;   Services in scope of reporting outages;   Sectors in scope of reporting outages;   Incidents in scope of reporting;   Parameters to be used to measure the impact of an outage;   Cross border incidents.  5.1.2 Services in scope  In the survey we asked participants which type of services should be in scope.  Figure 9 shows the  results of the survey. It shows that most respondents believe priority should be given to services that  support critical information infrastructure (SaaS, IaaS and PaaS). Secondly, providers should report  about incidents affecting services with large numbers of end-users or/and customers and thirdly  incidents affecting services with a wide geographic spread (entire country or cross border) should be  reported.  Note that respondents disagree about whether or not public or private clouds should be in scope.  Half of the respondents say public clouds should not be in scope, half of the respondents say private  clouds should not be in scope.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  13  Figure 5 Services in scope  When discussing this topic in interviews experts reiterated the difficulty of making clear distinctions  between IaaS, SaaS, PaaS, public and private clouds. Every cloud provider has developed their own  platforms and different types of cloud resources are used in different settings:  “The distinctions between different IaaS, SaaS and PaaS architectures are less important than the  impact on people.  This creates problems because we, infrastructure companies, don’t always know  the impact of an outage on users with less tangible aspects such as trust which are key to the future  development of the industry across Europe.”  5.1.3 Sectors in scope  In the survey we asked respondents which incidents should be in scope. From the answers it  becomes clear that incidents affecting the email services of an oil and gas company should not be in  scope of reporting, unless there is an impact on core business processes (i.e. if the loss of oil and/or  gas supply). Figure 10 shows the answers in more detail.  When discussing with experts in which sectors incident reporting should be mandatory, it was often  mentioned that cloud computing is almost becoming a critical sector in itself. In fact, many experts  currently sustain that cloud computing is becoming the backbone of the digital society:  86%  81%  90%  28%  90%  38%  38%  43%  71%  45%  62%  60%  14%  19%  10%  72%  10%  62%  62%  57%  29%  55%  38%  40%  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 120%  IaaS/PaaS with large number of customers  IaaS/PaaS with large number of end- users  IaaS/PaaS underlying critical information infrastructure  SaaS, not sector specific  SaaS supporting critical infrastructures  Cloud services with a minimum number of end-users  Cloud services with a minimum number of servers/processors  Cloud services with a minimum number of organisations  Cloud services with a large geographic spread (entire country, cross border)  Public cloud services  Private cloud services  Partner/Community Clouds  Yes  No  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  14  “Cloud services are themselves part of the critical infrastructure that supports many companies in our  country and across Europe.”  Figure 6 Sectors in scope  At the same time, one issue that was often mentioned in this context was that cloud service  providers are hardly in a position to assess a-priori the criticality of their services because of the  potential knock-on effect of outages. The impact of an outage depends on the kind of security  measures customers took.  5.1.4 Cloud security incidents in scope  In the survey we asked respondents which incidents should be in scope of incident reporting. We  first presented experts with a rough classification of the incidents according to their impact in 5  severity levels; for each level we provided one practical example. Then we asked the experts to  indicate which incidents should be reported. The impact scale is presented below:   Impact 0: Something went wrong in an exercise or a test. No impact on users.   Impact 1: Incident had impact on assets, but no direct impact on customers.   Impact 2: Incident had impact on assets, but only minor impact on customers.   Impact 3: Incident had impact on customers.   Impact 4: Incident had major impact on customers.  48%  67%  62%  81%  67%  19%  29%  28%  23%  33%  14%  19%  52%  57%  24%  10%  5%  5%  14%  29%  14%  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 120%  Finance  Healthcare  eGovernment  Industrial Control Systems (SCADA)  Transport  Generic IT  Electronic Communications  1 (Important) 2 (Less Important) 3 (Minor Importance)  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  15  The answers from the respondents are summarized in figure 11. Most experts agreed that incidents  with impact 3 or higher should be reported to authorities and should be the focus of information  exchange across the sector and between member states.  Figure 7 Impact based classification of incidents  When discussing this topic with experts, some experts remarked that often providers are not in a  position to determine the severity of an incident, and/or if an incident had an impact on the core  business operations of customers.  “We need to filter incident reports according to the impact but at the time an incident occurs we may  not have enough information to be sure what the consequences were.”  5.1.5 Incident report parameters  In the survey we asked respondents about which parameters should be included in incident reports.  Figure 12 shows the responses of the experts. The most important parameter to report about is the  criticality of the data or assets affected. This is in line with the fact that most experts would like to  focus first on incident reporting in critical sectors. Besides this, most experts agree that incident  reports should include information about the number of end users affected, the impact on  customers (loss of data access, the geographic spread, and the duration of the cloud security  incident.  Many interviewees said that the number of users can not be the only measure of the consequences  for society; while some users might be inconvenienced by losing access to their files, for  governments and other critical infrastructures the impact could be much more serious. The  “significance” of an incident is something crucial to assess e.g. the temporary loss of access to an  entertainment service, even if it affects many people, is very different from the risk of death due to a  long-lived power outage in mid-winter, or a problem with air-traffic control. Finally, we emphasise  that the impact must be significantly life-threatening for many people and/or cause or risk major  long-lived economic harm.  Many experts reiterated the need to collect useful data that can be used to understand issues and  increase the resilience of services, focusing on the impact of an outage. Some experts raised the  issue that it is sometimes hard for providers to assess the full impact of an incident because cloud  service providers do not always know the full impact of an incident in society or in critical sectors.  0,00%  10,00%  20,00%  30,00%  40,00%  50,00%  60,00%  70,00%  80,00%  90,00%  100,00%  Impact 0 Impact 1 Impact 2 Impact 3 Impact 4  10,50%  32,50%  49,20%  92%  100%  Impact  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  16  Most experts agreed on the fact that there is a need to share information about root causes and  measures to mitigate common incidents.  Figure 8 Parameters to measure impact on Cloud supporting CIIs  Finally, as discussed before, interdependencies across services, across society, makes it difficult to  identify all the end users or customers impacted.  This, in turn, makes it hard to calculate the  geographic spread of an incident, for example. It seems that providers of IaaS and PaaS providers  can only estimate the impact of incidents in technical terms. An estimation of the number of end- users affected can be done only at a later stage.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  17  5.1.6 Incentives to foster incident reporting  In the survey we asked respondents about the potential incentives for providers to partake in  setting up incident reporting schemes.  Figure 9 Incentives for incident reporting  In the interviews with experts one of the key success factors mentioned was “trust” between the  information sharing parties. In competitive commercial environments, including cloud service  provision, the level of trust required to support information sharing is difficult to achieve without  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%  Legal protection for reporter (information in a report cannot normally be used in legal action)  Guarantees of confidentiality, non-disclosure agreements  Anonymity for reporter (national agencies and other companies cannot tell who filed a report)  Access to incident reports of other providers (only organization who submits reports can…  Access to statistical summaries sent to all participants every 6 months.

The main incentives for organizations to participate in  a reporting scheme were considered to be:   legal protection for the respective parties  to encourage participation;   non-disclosure agreements or anonymity for the different parties;   ability to access the incident reports of other Cloud service providers;   access to statistical summaries sent to all participants annually;   a “one stop shop” – to coordinate the distribution of incident information across European,  national and industry reporting systems.  Many experts were of the opinion that even if the provider is obliged to inform competent  authorities, the incident reports should still be anonymised.  ‘’[…] it is important not to disclose the identity of the organisations suffering the incident but at the  same time provide sufficient detail for others to know that they might be affected.  This could be  more difficult for critical Clouds – where if an incident report mentioned a power company running a  particular PLC then readers could infer that this might be one of two or three companies across  Europe.”  Most experts stressed the importance of anonymity in encouraging participation, especially in the  start-up period when companies still need to gain trust in the scheme. Some experts raised the issue  that in some smaller countries (with few providers) even anonymous reporting could be difficult. The  main fear of providers is to lose customers if it becomes public that certain cloud services had  suffered failures.  Another issue which was often raised by experts, was the fact that companies might lose a  competitive advantage if other companies chose not to participate. From this perspective it seems  that a legal requirement to partake in incident reporting scheme is necessary. Finally, some experts  remarked that the issues of confidentiality would decrease as the reporting scheme matures and  trust in the reporting scheme grows.  5.1.7 Compulsory or voluntary reporting of cloud security incidents  In the survey we asked respondents about whether or not incident reporting should be legally  required or voluntary. It should be mentioned here that there are not many examples of existing  voluntary incident reporting schemes.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  19  Figure 10 Ways to develop cloud incident reporting  Figure 14 shows the view of the experts. Most respondents are in favour of compulsory national  schemes including the reporting to an EU agency (80%). Many respondents would also be in favour  of voluntary national schemes, including reporting to an EU agency (47%). Respondents did not  favour local reporting schemes, without sharing incident reports with a European agency. This is in  line with the fact that most experts agree that incident reporting is most useful when the incident  reports can be shared across sectors and across borders via an European agency.  In the interviews expert raised some issues with voluntary reporting schemes, expressing a concern  about under-reporting.  In voluntary schemes the reporting becomes biased, especially for some  classes of incidents which are not directly visible outside the company. On the other hand experts  acknowledged that cloud computing is still a new market and that over-regulation could stifle  innovation. This could be of concern for European companies as cloud services are being developed  with minimal regulatory intervention in Asia and North America.  “It is important to develop a framework that is simple rather than develop complex taxonomies or  lists of incidents that would change over time.  Over-regulation of a new industry needs to be  avoided.”  Experts also raised the concern that multiple national and international reporting schemes could  make it hard for providers to comply. The experts we interviewed all strongly supported ENISA’s  potential role in aligning and harmonizing the different reporting schemes, particularly for small  member states. The interviewees also stressed the need for Europe to act together and to develop a  coherent Cloud strategy.  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%  a.

Note that in the proposed NIS directive there are provisions for sharing  incident reports between authorities from different countries. In the interviews the experts  identified a number of further cross challenges with cross border sharing of incidents: :  1) Legislative and regulatory concerns - some governments cannot export data beyond their  national borders, this may limit the submission of incident information affecting government  systems in particular;  2) Jurisdictional issues – Clouds raise complex jurisdictional issues where customers are in one  state, buying services from another that are implemented using systems in a third country.  It can be difficult to determine where such incidents should be reported.  Existing statutes  establish jurisdiction in the State where a service is being purchased but the application and  interpretation of the laws is often not well understood by many customers.  3) Trust across national borders –several of the interviewees mentioned the need to exclude  incidents that might affect national security;  4) Integration of national and international systems.  The interviewees stressed that it is  important to minimise the regulatory burdens on a new and growing industry and to  establish a level playing field across all member states when sharing across borders.  Larger companies that have more complex cross-border operations typically have access to legal  departments that can identify their responsibilities. Smaller companies tend to have more simple  operations and more straightforward obligations. One expert remarked:  “We do not have any uniform, single system for reporting incidents because there are many different  companies in our group working in different member states.  I get regular updates from across the  group but the details are different. The development of a single European reporting system might  help provide us with common reporting standards.”  Other interviewees stressed the benefits to smaller member states where the costs of coordinating  incident reporting could be shared.  A European system for incident reporting could increase the  consistency of information available within companies.  5.1.9 Statistics and post-incident analysis  We also addressed the topic off post-incident analysis in the interviews. By exchanging lessons learnt  with other providers, it becomes easier for providers to address trends and issues emerging across  the EU. Post-incident analysis can also help government authorities to take policy initiatives.  In responses to the survey, experts indicated they support publishing statistical information about  incident reports, aggregating them across Europe.  Statistical information should include:  1. Number of incidents per root cause (e.g. incidents caused by cyber-attack)  2. Percentage of users affected per root cause (e.g. 1% of Cloud users in the EU were affected  by cyber-attacks)  3. Number of users affected per root cause (e.g. 50 end users were affected by an attack).  4. Total impact per service (e.g. UPS failures caused Cloud service outages of approx. 20 million  user hours)  5. Percentage of impact per root cause (e.g. power failures caused 37% of the total Cloud  service user hours affected by outages)  6. Percentage of incidents per root cause (e.g. half of incidents EU wide are caused by human  error).  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  21  The interviewees confirmed that aggregated information would be useful to many different  stakeholders.  Some participants supported the development of a European system that was  independent from security service vendors.  Others argued that aggregate data can inform future  regulatory requirements and reinforce ENISA’s role in providing a bridge between EU legislation and  the industry. Most experts interviewed supported the compilation and dissemination of statistical  overviews. However, statistical summaries do not always provide a realistic view. It is important for  regulators to supplement these overviews with additional studies into the detailed causes of  incidents involving critical cloud infrastructures.  5.2 Summary of responses and interviews   Services in scope:  o Services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) supporting core systems of critical infrastructures;  o Services that are used by large number of end users  o Services covering large geographic spread   Focus on critical sectors like finance, health, energy, transport and e-Government.   Criticality of the service and impact of incidents should be analysed on a case-by-case basis.   Incidents affecting availability, resulting to loss of services, should be reported.   Incidents affecting data integrity and confidentiality could be reported.   Parameters to report about:  o Number of users affected;  o Duration of the incident;  o Services affected (criticality of data or services);  o Geographic spread   There is a need to set reporting thresholds for these parameters.   A single reporting scheme and a single reporting template is needed for providers and  operators.   In the start-up phase the right conditions and incentives should be created (anonymity,  confidentiality).   Cross border sharing of incident reports with other authorities is crucial  Post incident analysis and statistical information are important outcomes of pan-EU incident  reporting. It is important to have bi-directional sharing schemes, where authorities feedback  analysis and statistics to providers.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  22  6 Incident Reporting Use Cases  The incidents mentioned in previous section are reality; yet, it is still a challenge to explain in each  case which would be the process to report them to national competent authorities. In need of this  clarification, below we depict 4 use cases of incidents, presenting the challenges in place and suggest  how in each scenario, incident reporting would be realized.  6.1 Reporting Cloud security incidents by operators in critical sectors  6.1.1 Use case A: One community cloud- one critical sector  One cloud provider offers services (IaaS, PaaS) to the finance sector (critical sector); more specifically  in two banks with data located in country X and in one bank with data located in country Y. The  banks have built services on the top of the cloud infrastructure, supporting financial data of theirs  customers and every day transactions. The contract terms have been specified to the customer’s  needs, having the banks to insist on their own standard term of secured unlimited liability for  defined types of breaches or loss, notably breach of regulatory on security requirements such as  breaches giving rise to regulatory fines. Same applies for in-house implementation of a private cloud  in a bank.  When an incident occurs it impacts the availability of services and the datacentres of all banking  organisations. The cloud provider, bonded by the contractual agreement with the client (in this case  the bank), is obliged to report more information on the breach (light blue line). The reporting is  based on customer specific data included in the SLA and/or contract. Currently there is no common  template for all providers to use, to meet the SLA requirements of reporting.  The provider needs to report the technical data of the incident. The cloud provider is not aware of  the services build on top of the IaaS/PaaS contracted, thus is not aware of the criticality of the data  and/or services. In this case the report sent to the National Competent Authority (NCA), is sent by  the operator, in this case the banking institutions. The operator will add more information on the  impact of the breach to its core services and will need to provide this to the NCA. Since we talk  about a cross border incident, each banking institution needs to send this to the NCA of the  respective country. The NCA in this case could be the national finance regulatory authority. The  scheme is depicted below:  Bank Bank  Bank  NCA NCA  o th  er  c  o u  n tr  y  Bank  Cloud  Cloud Service Provider  Cloud  Cloud  Figure 11 One community/ private cloud- one critical sector  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  23  6.1.2 Use case B: Public Cloud – Multiple critical sectors  One cloud provider offers services (IaaS, PaaS) to the finance sector and energy sector (critical  sectors); the services built upon the contracted services are linked to availability of the core services  to the customer (financial transactions and power supply). When a breach occurs to the cloud  provider, he is obliged according to the contractual agreement or/and the service level agreement  (SLA) to report the incidents to the customers (light blue line). As in the previous use case, the  information included in the report is customer specific – in this case different for the banking sector  and the energy sector. A common template across providers, to satisfy the reporting requirements  to their customers could be a starting point in harmonising incident reporting in the cloud.  The different customers, in this case the banks and the energy supplier, since their core service has  faced a loss of availability, will need to report to the NCAs. The information required by the provider,  combined with the impact assessment of the operator, would be sent to the NCAs by the operator;  in this specific case since we talk about two different critical sectors, the reports should be sent to  the according NCAs, namely to the national finance regulatory authority and to the energy regulator.  In this case we talk about “multiple-NCA”. The scheme is depicted below:  Bank Power  Supplier  Finance NCA Energy NCA  Cloud Service Provider  Cloud  Bank  Cloud  Power  Supplier  Cloud  Figure 12 Public Cloud – Many critical sectors  6.1.3 Challenges of implementing security incident reporting  We analyse the challenges of security incidents reporting in the case of critical sectors:   Challenge 1: Definition of roles and mandate  Clear guidelines on how the incident reporting data flow will take place, “which will be the  specific appointed NCAs”, “which are the operators falling in scope”, “which are the  incidents in scope” need to be provided by the governmental authorities, always in  conjuction with other European countries. The governemental authorities in each country  need to define the roles of the different parties involved in the incident reporting  framework. The NCA is the according regulatory body to receive the reports, however in  each section the NCA is a different body i.e. for Banking sector is the National finance  regulator, for Energy the according Energy regulator, in general the public bodies that have a  regulatory mandate that includes networks and information security.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  24  Critical service operator should report to the NCA. This means that a NCA should be defined  per sector (and have the information security aspect in their mandate. In scope should fall all  incidents that affect core services of the critical infrastructure and cause significant impact.  To measure impact the operator needs to get metrics and classify them against specific  thresholds i.e. number of citizens affected etc. The thresholds will be set by the NCAs after  consulting the CII operators. This part of the reporting framework would need to be  addressed by governmental authorities in order to be realized;   Challenge 2: Reporting clause in the contractual agreement  The provider needs to report to the critical infrastructures operator (a national risk  assessment should take place to indicate the national critical infrastructures and investigate  which of the core services are depending on cloud) according to the contract or SLA. The  customer (in this case the CII operator needs to judge which critical infrastructures  implemented in the cloud, are in scope). The scope of reporting incidents is determined in  the contract (mandatory), and usually all incidents need to be reported or the provider  operates a dashboard for the customer to monitor the service performance. This is one  challenge the operator should mitigate by specifying this requirement when agreeing on the  contract terms (reporting times, reporting flow, templates etc.).   Challenge 3: Template for reporting information  This report should include several technical information like: duration of breach,  remediation time, systems affected, root cause, mitigation actions, addressing the positions  taken on how to isolate the areas affected, remediation actions etc.; confidential  information trusted only between the provider and the customer are also included in this  report (name of provider, contact point etc.).  The operator would have to share information on the type of services affected, give specific  values to justify that the impact parameters measurements were over the set thresholds and  provide feedback on remedial actions and lessons learnt, adding data on the impact  assessment and subsequent root causes. Both reports the one from the provider and the  one from the operator will need to be sent to the NCA for them to have a concrete idea of  the entire incident and in the end which services affect citizens in a large scale.  The need for a consolidated template is evident, so that NCAs will be able to collect and  aggregate the data received. The reporting templates serve two purposes: a single reporting  template is more efficient for providers with customers in different sectors, in different  countries, avoiding the need for different reports with different content. a single reporting  template makes it easier for authorities to discuss and exchange incident reports across  sectors and across the EU.   Challenge 4: Cross border security incidents  An incident can affect operators in different countries causing a cross boarder incident.  Operators will report the incident in their respective NCA’s. However the NCA’s need to have  a communciation channel between themselves. The report to the NCA would need to  include information on the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and on the customer, and will need  to cross check this data with the NCA of the other country affected, in order to avoid  duplication of notification of incidents.   Challenge 5: Bi-directional flow  The NCA will need to send a summarized report to the collaboration network. Together with  the the collaboration network, the NCA should provide feedback to the operator and the  provider, i.e. providing a threat landscape overview, issuing recommendations etc. The  collaboration network of authorities can support the governmental authorities in this task  creating this way a benefit to the customers and providers.   Challenge 6: A harmonized approach  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  25  A common reporting template for all providers could be a starting point towards  harmonizing incident reporting. ENISA in this report makes a proposal on a common- flexible  template to support the reporting scheme suggested.  6.2 Reporting by cloud service providers to authorities  6.2.1 Use case C: Governmental Clouds  One cloud provider (situated in country X) offers IaaS/ PaaS/ SaaS services to administrative bodies  in country X (out sourced private – community cloud). The provider offers the potential of  administrative institutions of the neighbour country Z to use the same services. The service provided  is used by the tax offices and customers to perform tax declaration. The sector is not critical as such,  but the data processed are.  In this case, as in case A, the user will insist on using his standard terms, the ones in accordance with  the security requirements of the governmental authority.  The provider has signed a contract with the administrative institutions. When an incident happens,  impacting the availability of the core systems of the customers, the provider will send, according to  the contractual terms, a report with the technical specifications, the causes and remediation actions  to the customer. Two challenges emerge in this case: which will be the NCA in this scheme; and who  will need to report the provider or the operator. Since the provider is dedicated to this service, he  would be able to provide a full report including impact analysis. However in the cases we have  analysed until now, the operator is the one that reports to the NCA, since it is the one that collects  more information on the scale of the impact (and is aware of the criticality of the services and data  processed). The scheme is depicted below:  Public  Administration  Public  Administration  Public  Administration  Public  Administration  C o  u n  tr y  b o  rd e  r  Cloud Service Provider  Cloud  NCA NCA  Figure 13 Governmental Clouds  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  26  6.2.2 Use case D: public cloud - non critical sectors  In this case, we describe a typical cloud provision model: a public cloud provider that offers services  (SaaS, PaaS), like mailing services or applications, to many customers. The customers vary from SMEs  and users, to operators that offer these services to other end users (supply chain of service  provision). These customers are across different countries (the provider is not aware of their  customers locations). When an incident occurs, affecting the service, the provider is obliged (if  according to the contractual terms or/and SLAs) to report details of the incident.  In the case of informing the end-users, possibly a report (or a press release) would be enough to  inform them of the security breach.  This incident (could be business critical, meaning that could  disrupt the daily operation of an enterprise) has major impact in society, causing loss of availability  to a great number of users. Thus it should be reported. The appropriate party to report this incident  is the provider of the services, estimating the total number of users affected. The challenge in this  case is one: which the NCA involved in this scheme.  The scheme is depicted below:  End  User  End  User  Enterprise  SME  NCA  SME  SME  End  user  End  user  Cloud Service Provider  Cloud  Figure 14 Public cloud - non critical sectors  6.2.3 Challenges of implementing security incident reporting   Challenge 1: Reporting process  The key difference of this use cases from the previous ones is that now the provider will be  the one that needs to judge when to report a security breach to the competent authorities.  Based on a case by cases analysis, the provider will need to report to the NCA on a voluntary  basis. The cases, for which the provider needs to report, have to be clarified;   Challenge 2: Impact estimation  The reporting requirements for incidents having a “significant impact” could be overly broad  and counterproductive when implemented by individual Member States. Cloud provider  doesn’t always know the precise impact, due to cascading effect and interdependencies.  For  this reason the NCAs should agree together with the CSP on a common approach to address  the “significant impact estimation”. The knowledge of CSPs would be very valuable at this  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  27  point, to explain how to measure loss of availability or continuity of a service offered and to  set clear metrics i.e. CPU performance, MB loss etc.  The provider will need to indicate the parameters and thresholds according to which the  incident has significant impact and needs to be reported. The thresholds need to be agreed  between the NCA and the cloud provide, giving the values above which the provider will  need to report;   Challenge 3: Information sharing  The provider will need to inform the respective NCA on the root causes, the impact  assessed, the services affected and the users/clients affected. The information on the initial  and subsequent causes should also be included; same applies for the services affected and  the impact parameters.   Challenge 4: Scope of reporting  The scope of the incident reporting is not the same as in the previous cases. Large scale  incidents should be reported, meaning incidents that affect many users in many different  countries causing significant impact; the cloud provider might not even be aware of the  exact number of users affected;   Challenge 5: Definition of roles  As in the previous case, the competent authority receiving the reports should be defined.  However in this case, the problem is more complicated: where in the previous case the  sector regulator that has a mandate on information security, would play the role of the  competent authority, in this case there in no regulatory body to take the responsibility.  Government should cooperate with the CSP to find the respective governmental authority to   Challenge 6: Voluntary reporting  Sharing aggregate data of incidents with competent authorities could also be made possible  by a voluntary information sharing model of industry. Clear guidelines on how the reporting  could be implemented for cloud providers need to be defined by the national authorities.  Lessons learnt are the most important fact of information sharing for both governmental  authorities and industry.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  28  6.3 Summary of reporting flows  In this section we depict in one image, the reporting flows as discussed with the previous sections:  Cloud Provider  Critical  Infrastructure  Critical  Infrastructure  NCA  EU Networks  (NCAs, ENISA)  Cloud Provider  User UserSME SME  1  2  3  4  1  Figure 15 Cloud incident reporting scheme  We summarize the reporting flows depicted below:  1. (blue arrows) Reporting of the cloud provider to the customer as described in the  contract/SLA clause. The report is customer specific and includes technical information on  the incident, duration, area impacted, remediation time, systems affected that caused the  incident, root cause and mitigation actions. It also includes information like provider name,  contact point etc. In some cases – in the simple end-users, the provider is not requested to  send an incident report but to make the incident public.  2. (red arrow) The operator of the critical infrastructure/ services reports to the National  Competent Authority (NCA). In addition to the technical report sent by the provider, the  operator includes specific data on the impact caused (make an impact “estimation”).  The  operator informs the NCA on the root causes, the impact assessed, the services affected and  the users/clients affected. The operator’s report contains information about the cloud  services affected and the impact parameters, combined with data on the impact on its core  services.  3. (dashed red arrow) The cloud provider reports an incident directly to the NCA. This reporting  applies only to major NIS incidents affecting large number of users. The provider sends a  report including this information to the competent authority.  4. (black dashed arrow) When relevant the national authority shares summaries of incidents’  reports that occurred to a network of authorities across the EU.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  29  7 Recommendations  7.1 General recommendations  We make several high-level recommendations about NIS incident reporting in cloud computing. We  target mostly the government authorities (ministries, regulators, et cetera) tasked with ICT risk  assessments and supervision of critical ICT (e.g. electronic communications, domain name registers,  domains, certificate authorities, et cetera) in general, because we believe national regulators are  fundamental in fostering transparency about NIS incidents and exchange of NIS practices.   Recommendation 1: Set scope with a national ICT infrastructure risk assessment  The ICT sector is rapidly changing; besides the quick changes in the traditional electronic  communications services, recent years there is a wide range of other ICT services which are  becoming more and more widely used, and hence more critical. Authorities should conduct  risk assessments, periodically, and in this way determine the critical parts of the national ICT  infrastructure. These critical parts should be targeted with specific (CIIP or other) regulation  and reporting of network and information security incidents (NIS incidents) should be used  by regulators to understand the state of security and resilience of this infrastructure.   Recommendation 2: Prioritize critical sectors and interdependencies  Priority should be given to the critical information infrastructure used in the critical sectors  (defined by the CIP directive (2008/114/EC) – energy, oil, gas, roads, rails, air transport,  waterways, shipping and ports excluding those telecoms sectors already covered by Article  13a. It is important to identify the cyclic dependencies between critical services, for  example, the dependencies between the energy sector and the ICT sector.  Power outages,  for instance, often have an impact ICT infrastructure such as electronic communication  networks. This infrastructure may also be needed to manage the power outage. In fact in  some countries23 there is a priority scheme for supplying fuel to data centres during large  crises.   Recommendation 3: Only critical parts of cloud computing should be in scope  Cloud computing is now becoming the backbone of our digital society.  At the same time it is  not easy to identify all the cloud computing services which, if failing, could have a severe  impact in society. Authorities should translate their national ICT infrastructure risk  assessment to specific thresholds for specific services, and in this way target only the critical  cloud computing services.   Recommendation 4: Use EU wide NIS incident reporting as a driver for discussing NIS  Incident reporting and sharing summaries of these reports nationally, with the sector and in  pan-EU fora24, lead to a better understanding of security and resilience of IT infrastructure  and to a discussion about best practices. An active role needs to be played by the national  authorities who need to set up national reporting schemes for NIS incidents and act as a  filter for the sharing of incident reports across borders. National reporting can then be used  as a basis for a better understanding of the security and resilience of large ICT  infrastructures in the EU. Sharing of incident reports across borders naturally leads to  o a common vocabulary/terminology for speaking about threats and causes, it  provides a cross-check on the risk assessments (performed by companies) across the  EU;  23  Japan for instance.  24  In interviews some experts referred to the concept of “European NIS incidents”.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  30  o a starting point for discussion with the industry about which security measures and  practices worked and if something more should be done;  o an EU wide view of common threats and common causes which can provide useful  information for ICT service providers and cloud  providers in particular.   Recommendation 5: Harmonized cloud incident reporting schemes  Many experts from industry and government warned for the risk of unnecessary costs due to  national differences in implementing NIS incident reporting in cloud computing, especially  because cloud providers often work across borders, which means that customers and  regulators from several countries are involved. To allow for a level playing field and a  competitive single digital market it is important to harmonize the implementation of  incident reporting legislation whenever possible. There are several areas which should be  addressed.  o Common vocabulary and format: For the sake of efficiency authorities should agree on  common vocabulary and terminology when speaking about incidents. This is important  for customers, who may be dealing with multiple cloud providers, for providers, who  may be dealing with regulators and customers from multiple countries, and for  authorities, who may be dealing with incident reports from providers in different  countries. Common digital formats for NIS incident reports (an XML scheme e.g.) would  greatly facilitate the implementation of incident reporting for providers, customers and  regulators;  o Common deadlines and procedures: For the same reason it is important to agree on  common procedures for reporting. For example, authorities across the different sectors,  across the EU could agree on a two-step procedure where a brief notification is sent  within hours and a full report is sent within days25;  o Common terminology for causes: One of the key goals of incident reporting is to  understand the causes of incidents. By using a single terminology for (root) causes and  threats authorities can more easily get an EU wide picture and understand risks in their  countries better using the information about incidents which occurred across borders. In  the context of the implementation of incident reporting under Article 13a ENISA  introduced 5 root cause categories (Human Errors, System Failures, Malicious actions,  Natural phenomena, Third party failures), which are used as a high-level classification. A  vocabulary of more detailed causes (power cut, cable cut, DDoS attack) could then be  used to analyse incidents in more detail;  o Common impact parameters: It may be difficult to agree across the EU about common  reporting thresholds because different countries have different size and different ICT  dependencies. At the same time, a first step towards understanding the national  differences is to agree first on a set of common impact parameters, such as the number  of customers (or organisations) affected, the range of services affected, the  consequences for customers affected, the geographic spread of incidents.   Recommendation 6: Think big, but start small  The field of NIS is growing and becoming more complex. There is also a wide range of  different types of NIS incidents, ranging from everyday nuisances such as small power cuts  affecting electronic communications, to organized attacks by criminals, severe natural  phenomena affecting data centres, and so on.  It may be tempting to try to address a wide  range of incidents rather sooner than later, but it might be more effective to focus on a  25  Such a set up would follow the two-step procedure described by the EC regarding the implementation of  Article 4 of the e-Privacy directive, and it is in line with the two-step reporting process most EU member states  use in the implementation  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  31  small subset of incidents and a small subset of cloud services first and extend scope only at a  later stage. An iterative approach is particularly useful when addressing large and complex  problems26.  Useful scope restrictions could be for instance to focus only on cloud service  outages, because outages are easy to detect and measure quantitatively, or a subset of  services, IaaS e.g., because these services are more standardized and are used more like a  utility infrastructure than other cloud services.   Recommendation 7: Authorities should collaborate with industry and develop voluntary  reporting schemes  Most industry experts advocated in favour of starting with voluntary reporting schemes.  Authorities should take this opportunity to collaborate with the industry and start piloting  voluntary schemes, supporting this way the aforementioned idea of starting from a subset of  services, and then moving to a larger one.   Recommendation 8: Pan-EU sharing  All experts were strongly in favour of reporting schemes involving pan-EU sharing of  information, as opposed to more isolated national reporting schemes. By sharing summaries  of incident reports with other authorities, they can discuss trends, common threats, as well  as security measures and best practices. Only in this way can authorities feed-back relevant  information to the industry. As a by-product, the sharing of incident reports will also  contribute to harmonization, by introducing a single pan-EU terminology and vocabulary to  discuss about threats, assets, and cloud security in general.  We believe national authorities should take an active role in engaging the cloud computing  customers and cloud computing providers and pilot with them basic reporting schemes for NIS  incidents in cloud computing. We look forward to facilitate this process and support authorities and  providers with agreeing on efficient and effective reporting schemes, which provides the right  information to authorities, citizens, customers and cloud providers without creating unnecessary  costs for cloud providers and cloud customers.  7.2 Outlook  Security is often cited as an issue in cloud computing- partly because of general considerations  arising from loss of control and lock-in of the customer and partly because data protection laws  require providers to take appropriate measures, leaving security in a second place.  Cloud infrastructures now form a cornerstone of the digital society.  Partly in consequence, the EU’s  2012 cloud strategy aims to speed up the adoption of cloud computing as an enabler for financial  and economic development. However, the increasing reliance on common technologies also raises  concerns about the resilience of critical information infrastructures. It is widely acknowledged that  the current lack of information about network and information security incidents can prevent  government authorities and industry from taking action to mitigate the risks of future incidents. The  EU’s Proposal on the NIS strategy aims to address this problem by extending incident reporting  obligations to a wide range of critical information infrastructures.  This report has analysed barriers and incentives for reporting incidents that involve cloud  computing.  We have described how the exchange of lessons learnt can help to increase the  resilience of cloud computing services.  The benefits of reporting incidents include: information  sharing, experience exchange, identification of route causes and mitigations, data and trend analysis  etc. The aim has been to provide government authorities (ministries, regulators, cyber security  agencies) with an overview of issues and challenges when implementing national and pan-European  26  It is indeed de-facto standard for software development now.  Cloud Security Incident Reporting  Framework for reporting about major cloud security incidents  December 2013  Page  32  schemes for reporting incidents in cloud computing.  The closing sections have also provided  recommendations on the first steps that European and national agencies can take to implement  future reporting scehemes.  This is just a first approach of a topic that will concern us more in depth in the future. ENISA, having  the experience of a reporting scheme from been involved in Article13a reporting framework, will  support all the relevant parties, competent authorities, providers and operators, to achieve a  harmonised approach across all Member States.

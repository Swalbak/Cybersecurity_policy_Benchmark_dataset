BIBLIOGRAPHY/REFERENCES 52  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  5  Executive summary  The benefits of the European digital economy and society can only be fully attained under the  premise of cybersecurity. All layers of society can be affected and the EU needs to be ready to  respond to massive (large-scale and cross-border) cyberattacks and cyber crises. Cross-border  interdependencies have highlighted the need for effective cooperation between EU Member  States and EU institutions for a faster response and proper coordination of efforts at all levels  (strategic, operational, technical and communications). Under this perspective, it is important  not only to define interoperable terms in EU risk management (RM) and regulatory frameworks,  but also to develop common/comparative risk scales, which will allow for the interpretation of the  risk analysis outputs that result from different RM methods, so that the risk levels are  comparable.  This document presents the EU RM toolbox, a solution proposed by ENISA to address  interoperability concerns related to the use of information security RM methods. The toolbox  aims to facilitate the smooth integration of various RM methods in an organisation’s  environment or across organisations and bridge the gaps associated with the methods’  disparate respective approaches. With the help of the toolbox, shareholders will be able to have  a common understanding of risks and report interoperable risk assessment results to the  community and competent authorities.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  6  1. Introduction  1.1. Purpose and scope  This report is part of ENISA’s project ‘Building interoperable EU risk management frameworks  vol. 02’, which extends and builds on prior work carried out in 2021 and produced the following  reports:  1. Interoperable EU Risk Management Framework  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/interoperable-eu-risk-management- framework);  2. Compendium of Risk Management Frameworks with Potential Interoperability  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/compendium-of-risk-management- frameworks).  The interoperable EU RM toolbox (also referred to in this document as the ‘toolbox’) aims to  provide a reference framework that supports the interpretation, comparison and aggregation of  the results produced by different risk assessment methods. The EU RM toolbox will allow  different stakeholders to work on common threats and risk scenarios and compare their risk  levels, even if they are assessed through different or proprietary tools and methods. Such  comparative results on the security posture of the organisations will allow different  organisations, along with policymakers and regulators, to develop an integrated view on the  cybersecurity posture of organisations against specific and/or emerging threats in specific  sectors, and across different sectors and countries.  To this end, the EU RM toolbox will provide directions and facilitate the comparison and  interpretation of the cybersecurity readiness of different information systems infrastructures  against a specific threat scenario or a set of threat scenarios (e.g. physical threats).  The objective of this document is to define a scheme and the required set of components  (common terminology, assets classification, threat taxonomy and impact/risk scales) that will  allow for the interpretation of the risk analysis outputs that result from different RM frameworks.  1.2. Report structure  This report includes four sections: Section 1 (Introduction) defines the toolbox’s purpose and  scope; Section 2 (Interoperable EU RM toolbox) presents the concept, the scheme and the  components of the toolbox; Section 3 (Method of use) outlines the way in which the EU RM  toolbox will be used by stakeholders; and Section 4 (Toolbox evolvement) proposes ways in  which the toolbox can be further enriched with additional information to achieve its long-term  objectives. Section 5 (Conclusions) summarises our conclusions.

Interoperable EU RM toolbox  2.1. Method of work  The EU RM toolbox has been designed and developed by building on the directions provided in  the 2022 ENISA report Interoperable EU Risk Management Framework, so as to facilitate the  uptake of a coordinated and interoperable RM framework that would provide a consistent  methodology and risk assessment practices among Member States.  To design the EU RM toolbox, the results of assessing the potential interoperability of several  prominent RM frameworks and methodologies, as included in the previous report, were  considered. The toolbox is comprised of the main elements that were identified and assessed  as important for the interoperability of RM methods, including the identification and  categorisation of assets, the identification of threats, the description of attack scenarios, the  assessment and comparison of risk levels, along with a common vocabulary that facilitates the  understanding of the outcomes of different RM methods.  Finally, also drawing from the outcome of the 2022 ENISA report Interoperable EU Risk  Management Framework, the method used to apply the toolbox follows the basic RM processes  included in ISO/IEC 27005:2018 and the information technology security risk management  methodology (ITSRM2) method, as these were shown by the report to have provided extended  opportunities for supporting interoperability.  2.2. EU RM toolbox description  The EU RM toolbox aims to provide stakeholders with a reference framework to align their RM  efforts so that they have a common understanding about risks and associated risk levels,  regardless of the RM approach they adopt and the tool(s) they use. Having said that, the EU  RM toolbox respects the peculiarities of the corresponding RM methods and does not modify  the way that organisations have been working towards the management of their information  security risks. With the EU RM toolbox, stakeholders will be able to use interoperable  components to compare results with other organisations for specific risk scenarios, even when  using different RM methods and tools.  With the use of the EU RM toolbox, regulatory and supervisory bodies can have a horizontal  view of the risk levels and the security posture of the organisations in a specific sector or in their  domain of authority or jurisdiction, with regard to specific threats and risk scenarios (possible  adverse events that can affect the organisation’s strategy and objectives), and can therefore  appropriately guide them. The alignment of the stakeholders’ respective RM efforts and the  normalisation of the corresponding results, using a reference framework and common metrics  for risk levels, will help these entities better compare the outcomes and produce tangible results  that will easily guide them in their follow-up activities.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  9  Figure 1: The role of the EU RM toolbox and its positioning in the RM process  Figure 1 demonstrates the positioning of the EU RM toolbox with respect to the use case  scenarios and the corresponding tools that the organisations utilise in their environment. The  EU RM toolbox acts as an intermediate and abstract layer between the use case scenarios (i.e.  the set of risk scenarios against which the organisation or a competent authority wants to  assess risk levels) and the organisation-adopted RM methodology that is used for this  assessment. To this end, the toolbox does not aim to alter the way that organisations manage  risks internally. Instead, it provides stakeholders with the means to have a common  understanding on risk scenarios and unambiguously interpret involved assets and threats prior  to using the RM tools of their choice to assess risks, but also the means to interpret their  calculated risk levels towards interoperable results.  Having said that, the toolbox interprets risk scenarios developed using the toolbox’s  terminology, assets classifications and threats taxonomies to the respective risk assessment  methodologies, and normalises the risk assessment results to a common risk matrix that  provides comparable results.  Using the ITSRM2 as a reference framework for the RM activities, the EU RM toolbox facilitates  the alignment of RM activities in four RM functions (Figure 1).  • Establish a common understanding on the activities that will be undertaken  during the RM process. The EU RM toolbox provides a set of interoperable terms  based on RM and regulatory frameworks as well as international standards that are  used to establish the context of RM. This allows for an unambiguous description and  understanding of the RM activities, regardless of the RM methodology used. If  necessary, mappings between the EU RM toolbox and respective RM methodologies  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  10  terminology will complement the toolbox in the future, so that no ambiguous activities  will emerge.  • Define the scope of the environment in which the risk assessment process will  be applied. The EU RM toolbox contributes to this function by providing a  classification of assets to categorise those involved in a risk scenario, and the  organisation’s additional assets found in the scoped environment. This classification  facilitates the development of unambiguous risk scenarios and the proper interpretation  for the respective assets that will be considered in the risk assessment process.  Having identified and classified their assets using the provided categories, the  organisations will be able to identify whether and how a risk or attack scenario applies  to their environment (i.e. check whether assets found in the organisation’s environment  are used or are affected by a specific risk scenario).  • Identify risk scenarios related to a specific threat or group of threats. The high- level risk scenarios related to a specific threat or group of threats that are being  investigated with the use of the EU RM toolbox must be mapped to the organisation’s  environment to be properly assessed. Once a risk scenario has been chosen for  assessment, it can utilise the threat taxonomy provided by the toolbox and the assets  related to the risk scenario to map it to the corresponding internal RM method. This  allows organisations to easily assess their risk levels and the security posture of their  organisation for risk scenarios and proceed to the normalisation of the calculated  results.  • Map calculated risk values to a common risk scale. Having calculated the risk  values using the chosen internal RM method, the organisation has to normalise the  results based on a risk level mapping process, specifically designed for each RM  method, and a set of pre-defined risk levels adopted by the toolbox. The mapping  process utilises the risk scale of the chosen internal method and maps them to the  toolbox risk scale, thus giving stakeholders the means to use a common reference  scale to evaluate their risks. The toolbox is expected, in its future updated versions, to  provide an extended set of mappings for various methods.  Note that the terminology, assets classification, threats taxonomy, risk scale and, more  importantly, the corresponding mappings of various RM methods to them, which will  have the form of toolbox libraries, are envisioned as components that will be dynamically  enriched to cover needs that stem from various applicable domains, but also from RM  methods and tools as detailed in Section 4.  Moreover, subsequent versions of the toolbox can also seek the development of a common set  of measures that will also be mapped to the various methods, to facilitate the proper and unified  treatment of risks.  2.3. Toolbox components  The EU RM toolbox comprises several components that contribute either as functional  components towards the alignment of RM activities, or as the knowledge base for risk  assessment processes. The functional components bridge the gaps between the various risk  assessment methods by aligning the respective RM functions to the EU RM toolbox. The  knowledge base provides all the necessary information to the functional components to  perform the mapping of risk scenarios to the RM methods and report risk levels.  2.3.1. Knowledge base  The EU RM toolbox knowledge base, also referred to as definitions, has all the information  required to align RM efforts with the main functions that comprise such a process. The  knowledge base comprises:  • terminology  • assets classification  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  11  • threats taxonomy  • impact/risk scale.  Although this initial version of the EU RM toolbox provides foundational information towards  interoperable risk assessment activities, it is expected that this knowledge base will be enriched  with additional information that will further facilitate interoperability. Such information includes  new categories of assets that fall outside this initial categorisation, emerging threats or threats  that are related to specific environments (e.g. in industrial environments), and lists of security  measures, as also explained in Section 4.  Complementary to the definitions adopted by the toolbox are the mappings of those definitions  to the respective components of the various RM methods. For a given RM methodology X, such  mappings are anticipated to exist between the toolbox’s terminology and X’s terms, and  between the toolbox’s asset classification and X’s assets categories. Similar mappings are  expected for the threats taxonomy and the risk levels. These mappings are materialised in the  form of libraries, and like the knowledge base will be enriched, through the functional  components, and will be used by interested parties to provide interoperable RM results. More  information about the toolbox’s functional components is provided in Section 2.3.2.  2.3.1.1. Terminology  The main objective of the toolbox terminology component is to achieve a common  understanding of the terms related to RM and to facilitate the interoperability among  methodologies that use different terms for similar issues.  Annex I lists the basic set of terms commonly used by various risk analysis  frameworks/methodologies. The meaning of each term is also documented in the form of a  glossary. The set of terms, together with their meanings, form the toolbox terminology or, in  other words, the way each term is interpreted by the toolbox.  To decide which terms will be adopted by the toolbox, the terms, and definitions of  ISO/IEC 27005:2018 and ITSRM2 were extensively studied in order to cover, consolidate and  link all the terms mentioned by these standards.  2.3.1.2. Assets classification  The identification of the assets that need protection in an information system and the estimation  of their value (in terms of the impact that the organisation will suffer in the event of an incident)  are of crucial importance during a risk analysis. To this respect, the toolbox proposes specific  asset categories (Annex II), explaining at the same time the assets included in each category,  as follows.  Primary assets  • All core business processes and functions together with services provided to external  parties.  • Information/data serving a specific business process or activity of the organisation.  Supporting assets  • Hardware, devices, and equipment, including computing devices, network devices,  media, internet of things (IoT) devices, operational technology (OT) devices,  telecommunication devices, peripherals and storage devices.  • Software and applications, such as system software and operating systems, firmware,  middleware, package software and business / end user applications. Personnel,  referring to roles involved in business processes and functions, user support, software  development and maintenance, hardware support, delivery of services and  information/data management.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  12  • Location and utilities, including all relevant premises, such as buildings, rooms, offices,  and containers, together with essential services and utilities provided by external  operators/providers, power and water supply.  • Organisational infrastructure, including policies, procedures and supporting information  and communications technology (ICT) services (e.g. telecommunications, network,  cloud, hosting).  Achieving consensus on such an asset classification supports easier identification of threats per  asset category, and thus on each member of that asset category. In addition, in terms of  interoperability, it allows interested parties to easily map the assets of their organisation to the  asset categories proposed by the toolbox.  Similarly to the toolbox terminology, the choice of each asset category and its members was  based on the categories adopted by ISO/IEC 27005:2018 and ITSRM2, although adapted to the  needs of the toolbox. For instance, there is not a distinct category in the toolbox terminology for  network components since they have been included as members of the ‘Hardware’ category.  Also, IoT and OT devices have been classified as hardware components.  It is worth mentioning that the ‘Organisational infrastructure (including ICT services)’ category  accommodates organisational roles, policies and procedures, along with ICT services such as  telecommunications, network, cloud and hosting.  Another important differentiation of the assets is that of primary assets and supporting assets.  The primary assets are the business processes, functions and services, as well as any form of  data. All the rest are considered as supporting assets. As such, they are considered as the  asset that can be used to process and manage the primary assets, and are therefore the means  by which a primary asset can be reached.  2.3.1.3. Threats taxonomy  The toolbox also proposes a threat taxonomy (Annex III) that also draws on the directions  provided in ISO/IEC 27005:2018 and ITSRM2.  Similarly to the approach followed for building the asset classification, the main threat  categories that were identified are:  • natural threats;  • industrial threats;  • errors and unintentional failures;  • wilful attacks;  • service-related threats (cloud services, services provided by third parties).  Following the identification of threat categories, each individual threat has been included in a  specific category. Furthermore, each threat is associated with the asset categories that it can  affect (for instance, a threat may affect a hardware device but not a software application) and  with the consequences that it may cause in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability.  Finally, the origin of the threat (deliberate, accidental, environmental) is accounted for.  2.3.1.4. Impact/risk scales  The information security risk level is an indicator of the degree to which an organisation is  affected by a potential cybersecurity event, and it is determined by the likelihood of the  threat occurring and its impact on the organisation’s assets. There are typically three types  of information security risk assessment methodologies: quantitative, qualitative, and semi- quantitative. A qualitative risk assessment makes use of knowledge and experience to  establish risk likelihood, while a quantitative risk assessment makes use of objective,  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  13  quantifiable facts to give insights into the RM process. A semi-quantitative risk assessment  method typically utilises descriptive or numerical ratings.  The risk calculation method of the EU RM toolbox adopts widely accepted approaches and  considers impact and probability levels to calculate the information security risk according to the  following equation.  𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑘𝑘 =  (𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 𝑝𝑝 𝑝𝑝ℎ𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝) ×  (𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑝 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 𝑝𝑝 𝑝𝑝ℎ𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝)  The probability of occurrence of a threat represents the assessment of the likelihood that a  particular threat may exploit a specific vulnerability or collection of vulnerabilities. The probability  of occurrence is used as one of the main factors in risk calculation, by the majority of the  existing methods. However, it is not a standard value; it depends on the utilised method. For  example, ITSRM2 adopts the following levels for the probability of occurrence for non-intentional  threats: (i) every day; (ii) every month; (iii) once in a year; (iv) once in 10 years; and (v) once in  a century. On the other hand, the risk management method Magerit1 adopts a four-level scale  for the estimation of the likelihood of occurrence of a threat: (i) Daily; (ii) Monthly; (iii) Annually;  and (iv) Every few years.  The EU RM toolbox defines five discrete levels for the probability of occurrence of a threat. The  probability levels are the following.  • Very high: a threat event is almost highly likely to occur.  o A threat event is highly likely to materialise because there are associated  vulnerabilities that can be exploited and no adequate security measures to  defend them are in place.  • High: a threat event is likely to occur.  o A threat event is likely to materialise because there are associated  vulnerabilities that can be exploited, and ineffective or obsolete security  measures to defend them are in place.  • Moderate: a threat event could potentially occur.  o A threat event could potentially materialise since there are vulnerabilities that  can be exploited, and despite having been covered with security measures,  better security measures could have been implemented.  • Low: a threat event is unlikely to occur.  o A threat event is not likely to materialise since all associated vulnerabilities have  been covered with appropriate security measures.  • Very low: a threat event is highly unlikely to occur.  o A threat event is highly unlikely to materialise since all associated vulnerabilities  have been covered with effective security measures.  The impact level is the second parameter that influences the result of the information security  risk. In general, impact is the level of damage that may be assessed as a result of various  actions including, but not limited to, the repercussions of illegal information disclosure, unlawful  information modification, unauthorised information destruction, or loss of information or  information system availability. The impact is used by the majority of the existing methods that  aim to calculate the information security risk. However, as with the probability of occurrence,  impact is also not a standard value; it depends on the utilised method. For instance, the impact  scale in ITSRM2 has 10 distinct levels. In addition, the value depends on 10 discrete  parameters, such as the financial loss due to an event. On the other hand, the risk management  method Monarc2 scores the impact from 0 to 4, and its value depends on the impact of various  1 https://administracionelectronica.gob.es/pae_Home/pae_Documentacion/pae_Metodolog/pae_Magerit.html?idioma=en  2 https://www.monarc.lu/  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  14  parameters (such as confidentiality, integrity, availability, reputation, operational, legal, financial  and personal) that may be affected after the event of a cybersecurity incident.  The EU RM toolbox defines the following five impact levels, which are further detailed in terms of  operational, legal, financial and other implications in Annex IV.  • Very high: severe – the impact for the organisation is considered severe as it is expected  to have extreme consequences and implications.  • High: significant – the impact for the organisation is considered critical as it is expected  to have major consequences and implications.  • Moderate: moderate – the impact for the organisation is considered moderate, as it is  expected to have moderate consequences and implications.  • Low: minor – the impact for the organisation is considered minor, as it is expected to  have marginal consequences and implications.  • Very low: negligible – the impact for the organisation is considered negligible, as it is  expected to have insignificant consequences and implications.  Note that, depending on the RM methodology, the impact levels might be considered during  the early stages of the risk assessment method, where the valuation of the assets for the  organisation is being calculated.  Having considered the impact level for the organisation’s assets and the probability of  occurrence of a threat event, the calculation of the risk levels follows, in a non-standardised  manner. The various RM methods follow different approaches. For instance, ITSRM2  calculates the risk that fluctuates from 1 to 50 separating it in five discrete ranges. On the  other hand, Monarc assesses the risk from 0 to 16 within three ranges.  Although many methods do not classify or map risk values to levels, for the common  understanding of the corresponding risk values and the levels of risks the organisation  experiences for specific threats, the toolbox defines a scale that comprises five such risk  levels that would facilitate the interoperable evaluation of the risk values reported by the  organisations. These levels are heavily affected by the various levels of impact and  probability, as demonstrated by the risk matrix shown in Figure 2. The details of the risk  levels – very low (VL), low (L), moderate (M), high (H) and very high (VH) – are analysed in  Annex V. We can observe that the five discrete cybersecurity risk levels come from specific  scenarios that combine various levels of impact and probability.  Figure 2: EU RM toolbox risk matrix  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  15  2.3.2. Functional components  The functional components of the EU RM toolbox provide the mappings between the toolbox’s  knowledge base (terminology, assets, threats, risk scale) and the respective components  adopted by the various RM methodologies. More specifically, the anticipated contribution of the  EU RM toolbox functional components is to support the comparison of the results produced by  different RM methodologies and to facilitate the common understanding of the various terms  adopted by them.  The functional components of the EU RM toolbox are the following:  • terminology mapping  • assets mapping  • threats mapping  • risk levels mapping.  As already presented, through the knowledge base, the toolbox proposes specific RM terms,  asset categories, threat categories and risk levels. The functionality provided by the  aforementioned components enables the mapping of the toolbox’s terms/meanings/categories  with the respective ones used by other RM methodologies. This mapping has already been  performed between the toolbox’s proposals and the ISO/IEC 27005:2018 and ITSRM2.  However, it is expected that the toolbox’s knowledge base will be continuously enhanced. This  is anticipated to be accomplished by the community during the assessment of risk scenarios  using, for instance, methodologies that have not been considered so far, and therefore not  included in the toolbox’s knowledge base. In this case, the involved parties have to undertake  the effort to conduct this interoperability mapping between the respective components, and the  result can feed the toolbox’s libraries and knowledge base, to be used by subsequent activities.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  16  3. Method of use  This section outlines the way in which the EU RM toolbox will be used by stakeholders, which  include, but are not limited to, the following groups.  • Computer security incident response teams, and national or other competent  authorities, such as a Member State’s network and information systems (NIS)  competent authority, at a Member State, EU or international level, who have a  (legitimate) interest to assess organisations’ risk levels or readiness against specific  threats. These entities might operate in a specific domain or geographical area.  • Collaborating organisations in a specific domain or geographical area, with similar  concerns and interests.  • Single organisations who might utilise different risk assessment tools over time.  The EU RM toolbox can help the above entities establish common grounds on the way they  assess risks in their environment and have a common understanding on their respective risk  levels and comparable results.  Once the competent authority or organisation decides upon deploying the EU RM toolbox to  address RM interoperability concerns, it has to incorporate the EU RM toolbox methodology into  their RM strategy. This integration is not anticipated to affect its existing risk assessment  practices, as the toolbox and its respective components only encapsulate existing RM  processes to provide interoperable findings.  The role of each of the toolbox components in this process is affected by the usage scenario.  There are two main usage scenarios anticipated for the toolbox.  1. The evaluation of organisations’ readiness against a specific threat. In this case, the  EU RM toolbox will be used for a specific set of risk scenarios.  2. The evaluation of organisations’, either overall or for a specific service, security  posture. In this case, the organisations will run the risk assessment process, develop  various risk scenarios and assess risks for each one of these, and focus only on the  toolbox’s risk levels component to report the outcomes.  In the following section we provide details about the first scenario, which involves the use of all  the toolbox’s components.  3.1. Basic concepts and terms  The EU RM toolbox (also referred to in this document as the ‘toolbox’) provides the means to  assess risk levels associated with adverse events adapted to the organisations’ environments  and the distinctive features of the respective RM approaches adopted by organisations. Prior to  providing details about the EU RM toolbox, it is useful to provide a description of the basic  concepts and terms that are used throughout this document.  The terms risk scenario and attack scenario are used interchangeably to denote the  description of a possible adverse event that can affect the organisation’s strategy and  objectives. The attack scenario describes the assets that are at risk or involved in the risk  scenario, the actual threat, and the assets’ security dimension that this threat can affect.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  17  The EU RM toolbox has been designed to consider risk scenarios, or a set of them, that are  associated with a specific attack step and are part of a use case scenario. This approach is  mostly appropriate when malicious activities associated with a campaign, bound to comprise a  set of attack scenarios, need to be considered by interested parties. This does not, however,  preclude the use of the toolbox for the assessment of single attack scenarios that are related to  granular attack techniques and specific assets.  Each attack scenario is typically part of the attack step, as shown in Figure 3. Likewise, the use  case scenario might comprise several attack steps that the organisations should assess.  Figure 3: Use case scenarios, attack steps and attack scenarios  3.2. Risk evaluation against a specific threat  Let’s assume that a NIS competent authority, the NIS Cooperation Group or another competent  authority wants to identify risk levels across the EU against an emerged threat. The details of  this threat and the types of systems that it targets form the so-called incident scenario that the  competent authority wants to assess. The competent authority is keen to identify risk levels for a  specific group of organisations that belong to the target group of the threat actors.  To be able to compare the reported results, the organisations have to provide comparable  results to the competent authority using a common reference framework, as opposed to the  respective results provided by their corresponding RM tools. At the same time, in order to have  a common understanding of the scenarios they have to consider, the organisations have to be  able to unambiguously adapt the scenario described by the competent authority to their own  tools and environment, so that all the related attack/risk scenarios that are part of the overall  incident scenario are examined.  Considering that the incident scenario entails many attack/risk scenarios (see Section 3.1)  that map to the attack path, the competent authority wants to know risk levels associated with  each step of this path. This typically implies that each attack scenario should be represented  as a set of triplets, each comprising of <asset(s), threat(s), impact> that will be used as the  basis to calculate the corresponding risk levels. While the impact reflects to the well-established  security dimensions (confidentiality (C), integrity (I) and availability (A)), the assets and threats  do not enjoy commonly accepted taxonomies and lists. The toolbox corresponding components  will be used to define the risk scenarios, which then need to be adapted to each RM method  with the help of the toolbox mappings. Having said that, the use of the EU RM toolbox requires  the following steps.  1. The competent authority establishes a set of attack/risk scenarios that either map to  the attack path of the emerged threat, or the competent authority considers essential to  evaluate. The attack scenarios should use the toolbox terms, list of assets and list of  threats.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  18  2. The participating organisations have to map the defined attack/risk scenarios to their  environment to allow them to assess the corresponding risks using their own  respective methodology. This process requires the use of the toolbox libraries, which  might already have mappings about the organisation’s chosen RM methodology. If  such mappings are not available, they have to be enriched accordingly. In each of  these steps the organisation has to consult the toolbox terms to unambiguously  interpret each of the attack/risk scenarios.  a. More specifically, the organisation establishes the context for the examined  incident scenario. That is, it has to identify the assets that are involved in the  attack/risk scenarios and map them to their environment and the types of  assets that their methodology defines. As noted above, the toolbox libraries  might already provide the mapping of the toolbox assets to the organisation’s  methodology types of assets. If not, the participating experts have to propose  their mapping and enrich the toolbox libraries.  b. Following the context establishment and the identified assets, the  organisation has to unambiguously identify the threats addressed by the  attack/risk scenarios of the incident scenario. The list of threats that the  incident scenario addresses are from the toolbox’s threats taxonomy, which  do not necessarily directly map to the organisation’s methodology threats  taxonomy. To bridge this gap, a threats mapping library for the corresponding  risk methodology must be developed, if none already exist. This threats  mapping library will be gradually enriched. Note that during this process, new  threats or threat categories can also be introduced to the toolbox threat  taxonomy. So, as with the list of assets, there are two cases.  i. A mapping between the toolbox-adopted list of threats and the  organisation’s chosen methodology list of threats is already available  in the toolbox’s library. In this case, the organisation has to choose  the corresponding threats for the attack/risk scenarios.  ii. There is no available mapping, and therefore the organisation has to  run this task internally and, as a result, enrich the toolbox libraries.  c. Having identified and mapped the list of assets and threats, the organisation  has to assess risks for each of the requested attack/risk scenarios. If the  method considers vulnerabilities in the risk assessment process, these have  to be properly identified for the involved assets and used in the risk  calculation process.  3. The calculated risk values for the corresponding risk scenarios provide valuable  information to the organisation that has been using the specific methodologies. This  information, however, is not meaningful to the competent authority that does not want  or have to know the peculiarities of each RM method. The last step in the toolbox  usage process is to normalise risk assessment results to the toolbox risk scales. This  can be done using the toolbox libraries if such a mapping between the toolbox risk  scales and the organisation’s RM methodology’s scales exist. If not, the organisation  has to undertake the mapping process and enrich the toolbox libraries.  4. The competent authority collects the outcomes of the above process conducted in the  organisation’s environment and based on the reported results, it either has the  information it needs to evaluate the organisations’ security posture or has to conduct  the last step itself.  Note that in this process, not all of the initially defined attack/risk scenarios are necessarily  applicable to all environments. Depending on the system modelling of the organisation and the  dependencies between a threat and primary assets and how a threat can affect a primary asset  through other additional supporting assets, the organisation will decide the applicability of each  of the attack/risk scenarios.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  19  Figure 1: EU RM toolbox processes diagram  3.3. Use case development process  The toolbox can be used by a competent authority to assess organisations’ risk levels against  an incident scenario. An incident scenario, as previously defined, is used by a competent  authority to describe a set of threats against which the participating organisations will assess  their posture. It aims to guide the organisations in considering specific threats and narrow down  the scope of the attack path and the number of attack/risk scenarios that the participating  organisations have to consider. Therefore, an incident scenario is anticipated to include the  following information.  1. Description of the scenario. This outlines the incident scenario that the competent  authority addresses in the scenario.  2. Indicative assets in scope. The scenario has to provide a list of assets, primary or  supporting, that are affected or used by the threat actors during their campaign.  3. Attack path. This outlines the steps that are typically followed by the threat actors to  give the participating entities a better understanding about the incident scenario and  the set of threats that are being examined.  4. Attack scenarios. They form a list of triplets about the involved or affected assets, the  considered threat and the corresponding impact (i.e. the security dimension that is  affected by this threat) for the corresponding steps outlined in the attack path.  A use case example can be found in Annex VIII.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  20  4. Toolbox evolvement  The EU RM toolbox is envisioned as a reference tool that will be enriched with additional  information to achieve its objectives. This is anticipated to occur at various levels that  correspond to the toolbox’s knowledge base, which comprises the set of toolbox definitions (i.e.  terminology, assets classification, threats taxonomy and impact/risk scale), but also the  mappings to other methodologies’ components, as shown in Figure 5.  The toolbox’s definitions are expected to be reviewed and enriched by the community so that  the needs of all the domains that will adopt the EU RM toolbox will be addressed. Examples of  these enhancements include impact justifications for the various levels that are adapted to  specific domains, such as the energy domain, or set of threats that are more meaningful to the  specific domain.  Another important component of the EU RM toolbox is the set of interoperability libraries, which  will provide the mappings of the toolbox definitions to other RM methodologies. These libraries  can be the result of the use of the toolbox by the community, where the involved parties will  undergo the process of conducting this mapping between the toolbox and their own RM  methodology components, if these are not already available, and provide their feedback to  enrich the toolbox libraries. This will help subsequent efforts or users and will result in an  integrated tool that will help organisations compare their risk levels.  Similarly to the definitions and the interoperability libraries, a third set of valuable information  that will complement the toolbox is the use cases descriptions, which can act either as  templates for subsequent risk assessment processes, or as specific scenarios that can be  applied on domains or organisations.

Conclusions  This deliverable has presented the main components of the EU RM toolbox, which serves as a  reference framework for aligning different RM efforts and thus achieving a common  understanding about risks and associated risk levels, regardless of the RM approach adopted  and the tool(s) used by organisations.  Through the proposed EU RM toolbox, different stakeholders will be able to compare their RM  results, for specific risk scenarios, with other organisations that may use different RM  methods/tools. Furthermore, regulatory and supervisory bodies will be supported with regard to  the overall view of the risk levels and the security posture of organisations in a specific sector or  across various sectors.  The main RM functions supported by the EU RM toolbox are:  • the establishment of a common understanding on the activities undertaken during the  RM process;  • a definition of the scope of the environment in which the risk assessment process will  be applied;  • the identification of risk scenarios related to a specific threat or threats that are being  investigated;  • mapping of the calculated risk levels to those defined by a common risk scale.  It is vital to stress that the knowledge base provided by the toolbox (sets of terms, classification  of assets and threats) will be dynamically enriched to cover additional methods and tools, along  with other domains.  Moreover, subsequent versions of the toolbox can seek the development of a common set of  measures that will also be mapped to the various methods, to facilitate the proper and unified  risk treatment.

For the identification of assets,  it should be borne in mind that an information system  consists of more than hardware and software.  -  Asset owner An asset owner should be identified for each asset to  provide responsibility and accountability for the asset. The  asset owner perhaps does not have property rights to the  asset, but has responsibility for its production, development,  maintenance, use and security as appropriate. The asset  owner is often the most suitable person to determine the  asset’s value to the organisation.  System owner  Asset value Value of the asset assessed in terms of the maximum impact  (business or data protection) in the event of loss of security  dimensions (confidentiality, integrity, availability); this is also  known as the security need.

Event  Incident scenario An incident scenario is the description of a threat exploiting a  certain vulnerability or set of vulnerabilities in an information  security incident. The impact of the incident scenarios is to  be determined considering impact criteria defined during the  context establishment activity. It can affect one or more  assets or part of an asset. Thus, assets can have assigned  values both for their financial cost and because of the  business consequences if they are damaged or  compromised. Consequences can be of a temporary nature  or permanent as in the case of the destruction of an asset.  -  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  26  Frameworks and  methodologies /  terminology  Toolbox glossary Related terms  Indicator Measure that provides an estimate or evaluation. -  Inherent risk The risk without taking any security measure into account.

Service-related threats (cloud  services, services provided by  third parties)  Risk from changes of  jurisdiction  When data is stored or processed in a data centre located in a country other than the customer  country, there are numerous ways in which the change in jurisdiction could affect the security of the  information.  Service-related threats (cloud  services, services provided by  third parties)  Data protection risks  Data protection law is based on the premise that it is always clear where personal data is located,  who processes it and who is responsible for data processing. Distributed environments appear to  conflict with this evidence.  Service-related threats (cloud  services, services provided by  third parties)  User privacy and secondary  usage of data  Customers need to be informed about what data might be used by the providers for secondary  purposes. This includes data that can be mined directly from user data by providers or indirectly  based on user behaviour (clicks, etc.).  Service-related threats (cloud  services, services provided by  third parties)  Incidence analysis and forensic  support  In the event of a security incident, applications and services hosted at a provider are difficult to  investigate, as logging may be distributed across multiple hosts and data centres, in various  countries.

Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  41  D Annex IV – Toolbox impact  scale  The EU RM toolbox impact scale comprises five levels, which are: (i) very high; (ii) high; (iii)  moderate; (iv) low; and (v) very low. The impact that corresponds to each of these levels is  detailed below to help stakeholders to identify corresponding levels that best fit to their  environment.  • Very high: disastrous.  o A threat event leads to disastrous business impacts.  o A threat event leads to financial loss that is bigger than 5 % of the  organisation’s annual turnover/budget.  o Information leaks might threaten the organisation’s survival.  o A threat event leads to corruption that is irrecoverable or causes permanent  downtime.  o Unavailability that takes extreme efforts to regain, or that is permanent.  o Negative impact on the reputation of the organisation or its employees with  global media coverage.  o A threat event leads to discontinuation of all organisational services.  o The organisation might receive a harsh penalty, which might bring some lethal  costs close to being insurmountable.  o Significant repercussions that are almost irreversible and cannot be  surpassed (e.g. death, working impossibility).  • High: critical.  o A threat event leads to critical business impacts.  o A threat event leads to financial loss that ranges from 2 % to 5 % of the  organisation’s annual turnover/budget.  o Information leaks severely undermine the interests of an organisation.  o A threat event leads to corruption that imposes a substantial burden on the  stakeholders.  o Intense unavailability that causes significant inconvenience for stakeholders.  o Significant decline in the organisation’s reputation with repeated media  criticism.  o A threat event leads to complete departmental disruption. Indictment against  the business.  o A threat event costs the organisation a considerable amount of money in fees.  o Significant outcomes that might be surpassed, but with considerable  challenges (e.g. bank ban).  • Moderate: average.  o A threat event leads to average business impacts.  o A threat event leads to financial loss that ranges from 0.05 % to 2 % of the  organisation’s annual turnover/budget.  o Information leaks undermine the interests of the organisation.  o A threat event leads to corruption that causes difficulty for the affected parties,  nevertheless, the recovery is simple.  o Limited availability causes difficulty for the concerned stakeholders.  o A threat event leads to temporary damage to the reputation of the  organisation with occasional media criticism.  o A threat event leads to isolated events with minimal consumer/citizen effect.  o A threat event leads to possible penalties for the organisation and might  introduce non-marginal charges.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  42  o Significant difficulty that might be compounded by a few complications (e.g.  denial of access to commercial delivery).  • Low: marginal.  o A threat event leads to marginal business impacts.  o A threat event leads to financial loss that ranges from 0.01 % to 0.05 % of the  organisation’s annual turnover/budget.  o Leaks of information are detrimental to the overall interests of the  organisation.  o Eradicating the corruption would not have any negative repercussions.  o Lack of availability that causes inconvenience but does not seriously  compromise the interests of the stakeholders.  o A threat event leads to infrequent media criticism.  o A threat event leads to minor occurrences that had no effect on their service  users.  o A threat event introduces some supplemental charges. A very low chance of  any sentences, or perhaps a very minor possibility of one.  o A little setback that can be easily overcome (e.g. time waste).  • Very low: negligible.  o A threat event leads to negligible business impacts.  o A threat event leads to financial loss that is less than or equal to 0.01 % of the  organisation’s annual turnover/budget.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  43  E Annex V – Toolbox risk  scale  The EU RM toolbox risk scale comprises five levels, which are: (i) very high; (ii) high; (iii)  moderate; (iv) low; and (v) very low. These levels are affected by the levels of impact and  probability, as demonstrated by the risk matrix shown in Figure 2 and detailed below.  • Very high.  o A threat event leading to disastrous (very high impact) business impacts is  predicted as almost certain (very high probability) to materialise.  o A threat event leading to disastrous (very high impact) business impacts is  predicted as very likely (high probability) to materialise.  o A threat event leading to critical (high impact) business impacts is predicted  as almost certain (very high probability) to materialise.  • High.  o A threat event leading to disastrous (very high impact) business impacts is  predicted as unlikely (low probability) to materialise.  o A threat event leading to disastrous (very high impact) business impacts is  predicted to potentially (moderate probability) materialise.  o A threat event leading to critical (high impact) business impacts is predicted  as almost certain (very high probability) to materialise.  o A threat event leading to critical (high impact) business impacts is predicted  as very likely (very high probability) to materialise.  o A threat event leading to average (moderate impact) business impacts is  predicted as very likely (high probability) to materialise.  o A threat event leading to average (moderate impact) business impacts is  predicted as almost certain (very high probability) to materialise.  o A threat event leading to marginal (low impact) business impacts is predicted  as almost certain (very high probability) to materialise.  • Moderate.  o A threat event leading to disastrous (very high impact) business impacts is  predicted as very unlikely (very low probability) to materialise.  o A threat event leading to critical (high impact) business impacts is predicted  as unlikely (low probability) to materialise.  o A threat event leading to average (moderate impact) business impacts is  predicted as unlikely (low probability) to materialise.  o A threat event leading to average (moderate impact) business impacts is  predicted to potentially (moderate probability) materialise.  o A threat event leading to marginal (low impact) business impacts is predicted  to potentially (moderate probability) materialise.  o A threat event leading to marginal (low impact) business impacts is predicted  as very likely (high probability) to materialise.  o A threat event leading to negligible (very low impact) business impacts is  predicted as almost certain (very high probability) to materialise.  • Low.  o A threat event leading to critical (high impact) business impacts is predicted  as very unlikely (very low probability) to materialise.  o A threat event leading to average (moderate impact) business impact is  predicted as very unlikely (very low probability) to materialise.  o A threat event leading to marginal (low impact) business impact is predicted  as unlikely (low probability) to materialise.

Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  45  F ANNEX VI – Risk calculation  interoperability samples  This annex presents two experiments that prove the interoperability among various  methodologies and the proposed toolbox. We have to note that the toolbox seamlessly works  with ITSRM2, Monarc, EBIOS (expression of needs and identification of security objectives) and  Magerit. The toolbox is equipped with dropdown lists that contain, in a numerical approach, the  impact and probability level of the aforementioned methodologies. ITSRM2 has been  harmonised in 5 levels instead of 10 based on the approach that is proposed in the  corresponding guideline. EBIOS and Magerit are methodologies that support the five  cybersecurity risk scaling. While Monarc supports a three cybersecurity risk scaling (high,  medium and low). To prove the aforementioned feature of interoperability, we performed two  experiments with Monarc and Magerit.  Experiment 1.  We assume that the final user is an organisation that works within the energy sector and  performs risk per threat following the Monarc method. At this point, we will calculate the risk of  this organisation against the threat of the denial of service. On the one hand, the impact coming  from Monarc depends on parameters including the impact of threat in confidentiality, integrity,  availability, reputation, operational, legal, financial and personal. The overall impact scores 4  out of 4. On the other hand, the probability of a threat depending on existing system  vulnerabilities and likelihood of occurrence of the corresponding threat scores 4 out of 4. The  overall risk due to the Monarc approach is considered as high. However, based on the toolbox  approach, the risk of the corresponding organisation is considered as very high.  Experiment 2.  We assume that the final user is an organisation that works within the healthcare sector and  performs risk per threat following the Magerit method. At this point, we will calculate the risk of  this organisation against the threat of the denial of service. On the one hand, the impact coming  from Magerit depends on parameters that are directly related to economical loss. The overall  impact scores 4 out of 5 (less than 1 000 000 000.00 monetary units). On the other hand, the  frequency of occurrence of a threat scores 3 out of 5 (less than a year). The overall risk due to  the Monarc approach is considered as high. Following this experiment, the toolbox agrees with  the initial result that entitled it as high risk.

Scenario description  A NIS competent authority wants to identify risk exposures at the national level against an  emerged threat that is related to the spread of a ransomware that targets mainly distribution  system operators (DSOs) in the energy sector. More specifically, the attack aims to encrypt the  databases of distributed energy resources management systems, thus disabling load and  production forecasting and the grid network operations at distribution level (see Figure 6). The  attackers initially infect a DSO’s network with malicious loaders through updates of several  backup server suites deployed in DSOs’ networks.  Figure 3: Logical architecture of the targeted DSO network  Indicative assets in scope  This section lists indicative assets that are involved in the incident scenario. The typical  relationship of the involved tangible assets is depicted in Figure 7, although the DSOs’  architectures are expected to vary. In parentheses is the type of assets according to the  toolbox’s asset classification: data, function, software, hardware, IT services, personnel,  location.  Use case’s indicative involved assets:  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  48  Distribution management system (DMS) data (data) / DMS backup data (data) / load forecast  (function) / production forecast (function) / backup server (software) / backup server  (hardware) / networking devices (IT services) / DMS server (software/hardware).  Figure 4: Assets involved in the incident scenario mapped to the smart grid architecture model  Attack path  The attack path for the ransomware incident scenario comprises the following steps.  1. Attack path step 1. An initial malware (loader) enters the network through the  software update channel of the backup software (located at the organisation’s  operation network).  2. Attack path step 2. The loader executes a PowerShell script to create a scheduled  task at the backup server and gain persistence to the target network.  3. Attack path step 3. The scheduled task is executed daily and creates a command- and-control channel between the adversary-controlled remote server and the victim’s  system.  4. Attack path step 4. The malware gains access to an admin’s valid local accounts to  use the admin’s privileges in lateral movement.  5. Attack path step 5. The malware conducts remote system discovery for lateral  movement.  6. Attack path step 6. Ransomware is uploaded through the command-and-control  channel to DMS.  7. Attack path step 7. The attacker obtains access to a backup server / destroys  backups.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  49  8. Attack path step 8. The ransomware encrypts the database of the distribution system.  The above steps are depicted in Figure 8.  Figure 5: Attack path steps  Attack scenarios  In this section, we describe the attack scenarios per attack step, each comprising of <assets,  threats, impact>. The list of involved assets includes targeted assets, such as the DMS data,  and assets that are part of the attack surface or the attack vector. Moreover, the list of threats is  indicative, and additional threats can also be examined.

BIBLIOGRAPHY/REFERENCES 52  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  5  Executive summary  The benefits of the European digital economy and society can only be fully attained under the  premise of cybersecurity. All layers of society can be affected and the EU needs to be ready to  respond to massive (large-scale and cross-border) cyberattacks and cyber crises. Cross-border  interdependencies have highlighted the need for effective cooperation between EU Member  States and EU institutions for a faster response and proper coordination of efforts at all levels  (strategic, operational, technical and communications). Under this perspective, it is important  not only to define interoperable terms in EU risk management (RM) and regulatory frameworks,  but also to develop common/comparative risk scales, which will allow for the interpretation of the  risk analysis outputs that result from different RM methods, so that the risk levels are  comparable.  This document presents the EU RM toolbox, a solution proposed by ENISA to address  interoperability concerns related to the use of information security RM methods. The toolbox  aims to facilitate the smooth integration of various RM methods in an organisation’s  environment or across organisations and bridge the gaps associated with the methods’  disparate respective approaches. With the help of the toolbox, shareholders will be able to have  a common understanding of risks and report interoperable risk assessment results to the  community and competent authorities.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  6  1. Introduction  1.1. Purpose and scope  This report is part of ENISA’s project ‘Building interoperable EU risk management frameworks  vol. 02’, which extends and builds on prior work carried out in 2021 and produced the following  reports:  1. Interoperable EU Risk Management Framework  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/interoperable-eu-risk-management- framework);  2. Compendium of Risk Management Frameworks with Potential Interoperability  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/compendium-of-risk-management- frameworks).  The interoperable EU RM toolbox (also referred to in this document as the ‘toolbox’) aims to  provide a reference framework that supports the interpretation, comparison and aggregation of  the results produced by different risk assessment methods. The EU RM toolbox will allow  different stakeholders to work on common threats and risk scenarios and compare their risk  levels, even if they are assessed through different or proprietary tools and methods. Such  comparative results on the security posture of the organisations will allow different  organisations, along with policymakers and regulators, to develop an integrated view on the  cybersecurity posture of organisations against specific and/or emerging threats in specific  sectors, and across different sectors and countries.  To this end, the EU RM toolbox will provide directions and facilitate the comparison and  interpretation of the cybersecurity readiness of different information systems infrastructures  against a specific threat scenario or a set of threat scenarios (e.g. physical threats).  The objective of this document is to define a scheme and the required set of components  (common terminology, assets classification, threat taxonomy and impact/risk scales) that will  allow for the interpretation of the risk analysis outputs that result from different RM frameworks.  1.2. Report structure  This report includes four sections: Section 1 (Introduction) defines the toolbox’s purpose and  scope; Section 2 (Interoperable EU RM toolbox) presents the concept, the scheme and the  components of the toolbox; Section 3 (Method of use) outlines the way in which the EU RM  toolbox will be used by stakeholders; and Section 4 (Toolbox evolvement) proposes ways in  which the toolbox can be further enriched with additional information to achieve its long-term  objectives. Section 5 (Conclusions) summarises our conclusions.  This report also includes the following annexes:  • Annex I – Terminology  • Annex II – Assets  • Annex III – Threats  • Annex IV – Impact levels  • Annex V – Risk levels  • Annex VI – Risk calculation interoperability samples  • Annex VII – Toolbox libraries  • Annex VIII – Use case example.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/interoperable-eu-risk-management-framework https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/interoperable-eu-risk-management-framework https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/compendium-of-risk-management-frameworks https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/compendium-of-risk-management-frameworks  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  7  1.3.

Interoperable EU RM toolbox  2.1. Method of work  The EU RM toolbox has been designed and developed by building on the directions provided in  the 2022 ENISA report Interoperable EU Risk Management Framework, so as to facilitate the  uptake of a coordinated and interoperable RM framework that would provide a consistent  methodology and risk assessment practices among Member States.  To design the EU RM toolbox, the results of assessing the potential interoperability of several  prominent RM frameworks and methodologies, as included in the previous report, were  considered. The toolbox is comprised of the main elements that were identified and assessed  as important for the interoperability of RM methods, including the identification and  categorisation of assets, the identification of threats, the description of attack scenarios, the  assessment and comparison of risk levels, along with a common vocabulary that facilitates the  understanding of the outcomes of different RM methods.  Finally, also drawing from the outcome of the 2022 ENISA report Interoperable EU Risk  Management Framework, the method used to apply the toolbox follows the basic RM processes  included in ISO/IEC 27005:2018 and the information technology security risk management  methodology (ITSRM2) method, as these were shown by the report to have provided extended  opportunities for supporting interoperability.  2.2. EU RM toolbox description  The EU RM toolbox aims to provide stakeholders with a reference framework to align their RM  efforts so that they have a common understanding about risks and associated risk levels,  regardless of the RM approach they adopt and the tool(s) they use. Having said that, the EU  RM toolbox respects the peculiarities of the corresponding RM methods and does not modify  the way that organisations have been working towards the management of their information  security risks. With the EU RM toolbox, stakeholders will be able to use interoperable  components to compare results with other organisations for specific risk scenarios, even when  using different RM methods and tools.  With the use of the EU RM toolbox, regulatory and supervisory bodies can have a horizontal  view of the risk levels and the security posture of the organisations in a specific sector or in their  domain of authority or jurisdiction, with regard to specific threats and risk scenarios (possible  adverse events that can affect the organisation’s strategy and objectives), and can therefore  appropriately guide them. The alignment of the stakeholders’ respective RM efforts and the  normalisation of the corresponding results, using a reference framework and common metrics  for risk levels, will help these entities better compare the outcomes and produce tangible results  that will easily guide them in their follow-up activities.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  9  Figure 1: The role of the EU RM toolbox and its positioning in the RM process  Figure 1 demonstrates the positioning of the EU RM toolbox with respect to the use case  scenarios and the corresponding tools that the organisations utilise in their environment. The  EU RM toolbox acts as an intermediate and abstract layer between the use case scenarios (i.e.  the set of risk scenarios against which the organisation or a competent authority wants to  assess risk levels) and the organisation-adopted RM methodology that is used for this  assessment. To this end, the toolbox does not aim to alter the way that organisations manage  risks internally. Instead, it provides stakeholders with the means to have a common  understanding on risk scenarios and unambiguously interpret involved assets and threats prior  to using the RM tools of their choice to assess risks, but also the means to interpret their  calculated risk levels towards interoperable results.  Having said that, the toolbox interprets risk scenarios developed using the toolbox’s  terminology, assets classifications and threats taxonomies to the respective risk assessment  methodologies, and normalises the risk assessment results to a common risk matrix that  provides comparable results.  Using the ITSRM2 as a reference framework for the RM activities, the EU RM toolbox facilitates  the alignment of RM activities in four RM functions (Figure 1).  • Establish a common understanding on the activities that will be undertaken  during the RM process. The EU RM toolbox provides a set of interoperable terms  based on RM and regulatory frameworks as well as international standards that are  used to establish the context of RM. This allows for an unambiguous description and  understanding of the RM activities, regardless of the RM methodology used. If  necessary, mappings between the EU RM toolbox and respective RM methodologies  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  10  terminology will complement the toolbox in the future, so that no ambiguous activities  will emerge.  • Define the scope of the environment in which the risk assessment process will  be applied. The EU RM toolbox contributes to this function by providing a  classification of assets to categorise those involved in a risk scenario, and the  organisation’s additional assets found in the scoped environment. This classification  facilitates the development of unambiguous risk scenarios and the proper interpretation  for the respective assets that will be considered in the risk assessment process.  Having identified and classified their assets using the provided categories, the  organisations will be able to identify whether and how a risk or attack scenario applies  to their environment (i.e. check whether assets found in the organisation’s environment  are used or are affected by a specific risk scenario).  • Identify risk scenarios related to a specific threat or group of threats. The high- level risk scenarios related to a specific threat or group of threats that are being  investigated with the use of the EU RM toolbox must be mapped to the organisation’s  environment to be properly assessed. Once a risk scenario has been chosen for  assessment, it can utilise the threat taxonomy provided by the toolbox and the assets  related to the risk scenario to map it to the corresponding internal RM method. This  allows organisations to easily assess their risk levels and the security posture of their  organisation for risk scenarios and proceed to the normalisation of the calculated  results.  • Map calculated risk values to a common risk scale. Having calculated the risk  values using the chosen internal RM method, the organisation has to normalise the  results based on a risk level mapping process, specifically designed for each RM  method, and a set of pre-defined risk levels adopted by the toolbox. The mapping  process utilises the risk scale of the chosen internal method and maps them to the  toolbox risk scale, thus giving stakeholders the means to use a common reference  scale to evaluate their risks. The toolbox is expected, in its future updated versions, to  provide an extended set of mappings for various methods.  Note that the terminology, assets classification, threats taxonomy, risk scale and, more  importantly, the corresponding mappings of various RM methods to them, which will  have the form of toolbox libraries, are envisioned as components that will be dynamically  enriched to cover needs that stem from various applicable domains, but also from RM  methods and tools as detailed in Section 4.  Moreover, subsequent versions of the toolbox can also seek the development of a common set  of measures that will also be mapped to the various methods, to facilitate the proper and unified  treatment of risks.  2.3. Toolbox components  The EU RM toolbox comprises several components that contribute either as functional  components towards the alignment of RM activities, or as the knowledge base for risk  assessment processes. The functional components bridge the gaps between the various risk  assessment methods by aligning the respective RM functions to the EU RM toolbox. The  knowledge base provides all the necessary information to the functional components to  perform the mapping of risk scenarios to the RM methods and report risk levels.  2.3.1. Knowledge base  The EU RM toolbox knowledge base, also referred to as definitions, has all the information  required to align RM efforts with the main functions that comprise such a process. The  knowledge base comprises:  • terminology  • assets classification  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  11  • threats taxonomy  • impact/risk scale.  Although this initial version of the EU RM toolbox provides foundational information towards  interoperable risk assessment activities, it is expected that this knowledge base will be enriched  with additional information that will further facilitate interoperability. Such information includes  new categories of assets that fall outside this initial categorisation, emerging threats or threats  that are related to specific environments (e.g. in industrial environments), and lists of security  measures, as also explained in Section 4.  Complementary to the definitions adopted by the toolbox are the mappings of those definitions  to the respective components of the various RM methods. For a given RM methodology X, such  mappings are anticipated to exist between the toolbox’s terminology and X’s terms, and  between the toolbox’s asset classification and X’s assets categories. Similar mappings are  expected for the threats taxonomy and the risk levels. These mappings are materialised in the  form of libraries, and like the knowledge base will be enriched, through the functional  components, and will be used by interested parties to provide interoperable RM results. More  information about the toolbox’s functional components is provided in Section 2.3.2.  2.3.1.1. Terminology  The main objective of the toolbox terminology component is to achieve a common  understanding of the terms related to RM and to facilitate the interoperability among  methodologies that use different terms for similar issues.  Annex I lists the basic set of terms commonly used by various risk analysis  frameworks/methodologies. The meaning of each term is also documented in the form of a  glossary. The set of terms, together with their meanings, form the toolbox terminology or, in  other words, the way each term is interpreted by the toolbox.  To decide which terms will be adopted by the toolbox, the terms, and definitions of  ISO/IEC 27005:2018 and ITSRM2 were extensively studied in order to cover, consolidate and  link all the terms mentioned by these standards.  2.3.1.2. Assets classification  The identification of the assets that need protection in an information system and the estimation  of their value (in terms of the impact that the organisation will suffer in the event of an incident)  are of crucial importance during a risk analysis. To this respect, the toolbox proposes specific  asset categories (Annex II), explaining at the same time the assets included in each category,  as follows.  Primary assets  • All core business processes and functions together with services provided to external  parties.  • Information/data serving a specific business process or activity of the organisation.  Supporting assets  • Hardware, devices, and equipment, including computing devices, network devices,  media, internet of things (IoT) devices, operational technology (OT) devices,  telecommunication devices, peripherals and storage devices.  • Software and applications, such as system software and operating systems, firmware,  middleware, package software and business / end user applications. Personnel,  referring to roles involved in business processes and functions, user support, software  development and maintenance, hardware support, delivery of services and  information/data management.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  12  • Location and utilities, including all relevant premises, such as buildings, rooms, offices,  and containers, together with essential services and utilities provided by external  operators/providers, power and water supply.  • Organisational infrastructure, including policies, procedures and supporting information  and communications technology (ICT) services (e.g. telecommunications, network,  cloud, hosting).  Achieving consensus on such an asset classification supports easier identification of threats per  asset category, and thus on each member of that asset category. In addition, in terms of  interoperability, it allows interested parties to easily map the assets of their organisation to the  asset categories proposed by the toolbox.  Similarly to the toolbox terminology, the choice of each asset category and its members was  based on the categories adopted by ISO/IEC 27005:2018 and ITSRM2, although adapted to the  needs of the toolbox. For instance, there is not a distinct category in the toolbox terminology for  network components since they have been included as members of the ‘Hardware’ category.  Also, IoT and OT devices have been classified as hardware components.  It is worth mentioning that the ‘Organisational infrastructure (including ICT services)’ category  accommodates organisational roles, policies and procedures, along with ICT services such as  telecommunications, network, cloud and hosting.  Another important differentiation of the assets is that of primary assets and supporting assets.  The primary assets are the business processes, functions and services, as well as any form of  data. All the rest are considered as supporting assets. As such, they are considered as the  asset that can be used to process and manage the primary assets, and are therefore the means  by which a primary asset can be reached.  2.3.1.3. Threats taxonomy  The toolbox also proposes a threat taxonomy (Annex III) that also draws on the directions  provided in ISO/IEC 27005:2018 and ITSRM2.  Similarly to the approach followed for building the asset classification, the main threat  categories that were identified are:  • natural threats;  • industrial threats;  • errors and unintentional failures;  • wilful attacks;  • service-related threats (cloud services, services provided by third parties).  Following the identification of threat categories, each individual threat has been included in a  specific category. Furthermore, each threat is associated with the asset categories that it can  affect (for instance, a threat may affect a hardware device but not a software application) and  with the consequences that it may cause in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability.  Finally, the origin of the threat (deliberate, accidental, environmental) is accounted for.  2.3.1.4. Impact/risk scales  The information security risk level is an indicator of the degree to which an organisation is  affected by a potential cybersecurity event, and it is determined by the likelihood of the  threat occurring and its impact on the organisation’s assets. There are typically three types  of information security risk assessment methodologies: quantitative, qualitative, and semi- quantitative. A qualitative risk assessment makes use of knowledge and experience to  establish risk likelihood, while a quantitative risk assessment makes use of objective,  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  13  quantifiable facts to give insights into the RM process. A semi-quantitative risk assessment  method typically utilises descriptive or numerical ratings.  The risk calculation method of the EU RM toolbox adopts widely accepted approaches and  considers impact and probability levels to calculate the information security risk according to the  following equation.  𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑘𝑘 =  (𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 𝑝𝑝 𝑝𝑝ℎ𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝) ×  (𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑝 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 𝑝𝑝 𝑝𝑝ℎ𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝)  The probability of occurrence of a threat represents the assessment of the likelihood that a  particular threat may exploit a specific vulnerability or collection of vulnerabilities. The probability  of occurrence is used as one of the main factors in risk calculation, by the majority of the  existing methods. However, it is not a standard value; it depends on the utilised method. For  example, ITSRM2 adopts the following levels for the probability of occurrence for non-intentional  threats: (i) every day; (ii) every month; (iii) once in a year; (iv) once in 10 years; and (v) once in  a century. On the other hand, the risk management method Magerit1 adopts a four-level scale  for the estimation of the likelihood of occurrence of a threat: (i) Daily; (ii) Monthly; (iii) Annually;  and (iv) Every few years.  The EU RM toolbox defines five discrete levels for the probability of occurrence of a threat. The  probability levels are the following.  • Very high: a threat event is almost highly likely to occur.  o A threat event is highly likely to materialise because there are associated  vulnerabilities that can be exploited and no adequate security measures to  defend them are in place.  • High: a threat event is likely to occur.  o A threat event is likely to materialise because there are associated  vulnerabilities that can be exploited, and ineffective or obsolete security  measures to defend them are in place.  • Moderate: a threat event could potentially occur.  o A threat event could potentially materialise since there are vulnerabilities that  can be exploited, and despite having been covered with security measures,  better security measures could have been implemented.  • Low: a threat event is unlikely to occur.  o A threat event is not likely to materialise since all associated vulnerabilities have  been covered with appropriate security measures.  • Very low: a threat event is highly unlikely to occur.  o A threat event is highly unlikely to materialise since all associated vulnerabilities  have been covered with effective security measures.  The impact level is the second parameter that influences the result of the information security  risk. In general, impact is the level of damage that may be assessed as a result of various  actions including, but not limited to, the repercussions of illegal information disclosure, unlawful  information modification, unauthorised information destruction, or loss of information or  information system availability. The impact is used by the majority of the existing methods that  aim to calculate the information security risk. However, as with the probability of occurrence,  impact is also not a standard value; it depends on the utilised method. For instance, the impact  scale in ITSRM2 has 10 distinct levels. In addition, the value depends on 10 discrete  parameters, such as the financial loss due to an event. On the other hand, the risk management  method Monarc2 scores the impact from 0 to 4, and its value depends on the impact of various  1 https://administracionelectronica.gob.es/pae_Home/pae_Documentacion/pae_Metodolog/pae_Magerit.html?idioma=en  2 https://www.monarc.lu/  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  14  parameters (such as confidentiality, integrity, availability, reputation, operational, legal, financial  and personal) that may be affected after the event of a cybersecurity incident.  The EU RM toolbox defines the following five impact levels, which are further detailed in terms of  operational, legal, financial and other implications in Annex IV.  • Very high: severe – the impact for the organisation is considered severe as it is expected  to have extreme consequences and implications.  • High: significant – the impact for the organisation is considered critical as it is expected  to have major consequences and implications.  • Moderate: moderate – the impact for the organisation is considered moderate, as it is  expected to have moderate consequences and implications.  • Low: minor – the impact for the organisation is considered minor, as it is expected to  have marginal consequences and implications.  • Very low: negligible – the impact for the organisation is considered negligible, as it is  expected to have insignificant consequences and implications.  Note that, depending on the RM methodology, the impact levels might be considered during  the early stages of the risk assessment method, where the valuation of the assets for the  organisation is being calculated.  Having considered the impact level for the organisation’s assets and the probability of  occurrence of a threat event, the calculation of the risk levels follows, in a non-standardised  manner. The various RM methods follow different approaches. For instance, ITSRM2  calculates the risk that fluctuates from 1 to 50 separating it in five discrete ranges. On the  other hand, Monarc assesses the risk from 0 to 16 within three ranges.  Although many methods do not classify or map risk values to levels, for the common  understanding of the corresponding risk values and the levels of risks the organisation  experiences for specific threats, the toolbox defines a scale that comprises five such risk  levels that would facilitate the interoperable evaluation of the risk values reported by the  organisations. These levels are heavily affected by the various levels of impact and  probability, as demonstrated by the risk matrix shown in Figure 2. The details of the risk  levels – very low (VL), low (L), moderate (M), high (H) and very high (VH) – are analysed in  Annex V. We can observe that the five discrete cybersecurity risk levels come from specific  scenarios that combine various levels of impact and probability.

Functional components  The functional components of the EU RM toolbox provide the mappings between the toolbox’s  knowledge base (terminology, assets, threats, risk scale) and the respective components  adopted by the various RM methodologies. More specifically, the anticipated contribution of the  EU RM toolbox functional components is to support the comparison of the results produced by  different RM methodologies and to facilitate the common understanding of the various terms  adopted by them.  The functional components of the EU RM toolbox are the following:  • terminology mapping  • assets mapping  • threats mapping  • risk levels mapping.  As already presented, through the knowledge base, the toolbox proposes specific RM terms,  asset categories, threat categories and risk levels. The functionality provided by the  aforementioned components enables the mapping of the toolbox’s terms/meanings/categories  with the respective ones used by other RM methodologies. This mapping has already been  performed between the toolbox’s proposals and the ISO/IEC 27005:2018 and ITSRM2.  However, it is expected that the toolbox’s knowledge base will be continuously enhanced. This  is anticipated to be accomplished by the community during the assessment of risk scenarios  using, for instance, methodologies that have not been considered so far, and therefore not  included in the toolbox’s knowledge base. In this case, the involved parties have to undertake  the effort to conduct this interoperability mapping between the respective components, and the  result can feed the toolbox’s libraries and knowledge base, to be used by subsequent activities.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  16  3. Method of use  This section outlines the way in which the EU RM toolbox will be used by stakeholders, which  include, but are not limited to, the following groups.  • Computer security incident response teams, and national or other competent  authorities, such as a Member State’s network and information systems (NIS)  competent authority, at a Member State, EU or international level, who have a  (legitimate) interest to assess organisations’ risk levels or readiness against specific  threats. These entities might operate in a specific domain or geographical area.  • Collaborating organisations in a specific domain or geographical area, with similar  concerns and interests.  • Single organisations who might utilise different risk assessment tools over time.  The EU RM toolbox can help the above entities establish common grounds on the way they  assess risks in their environment and have a common understanding on their respective risk  levels and comparable results.  Once the competent authority or organisation decides upon deploying the EU RM toolbox to  address RM interoperability concerns, it has to incorporate the EU RM toolbox methodology into  their RM strategy. This integration is not anticipated to affect its existing risk assessment  practices, as the toolbox and its respective components only encapsulate existing RM  processes to provide interoperable findings.  The role of each of the toolbox components in this process is affected by the usage scenario.  There are two main usage scenarios anticipated for the toolbox.  1. The evaluation of organisations’ readiness against a specific threat. In this case, the  EU RM toolbox will be used for a specific set of risk scenarios.  2. The evaluation of organisations’, either overall or for a specific service, security  posture. In this case, the organisations will run the risk assessment process, develop  various risk scenarios and assess risks for each one of these, and focus only on the  toolbox’s risk levels component to report the outcomes.  In the following section we provide details about the first scenario, which involves the use of all  the toolbox’s components.  3.1. Basic concepts and terms  The EU RM toolbox (also referred to in this document as the ‘toolbox’) provides the means to  assess risk levels associated with adverse events adapted to the organisations’ environments  and the distinctive features of the respective RM approaches adopted by organisations. Prior to  providing details about the EU RM toolbox, it is useful to provide a description of the basic  concepts and terms that are used throughout this document.  The terms risk scenario and attack scenario are used interchangeably to denote the  description of a possible adverse event that can affect the organisation’s strategy and  objectives. The attack scenario describes the assets that are at risk or involved in the risk  scenario, the actual threat, and the assets’ security dimension that this threat can affect.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  17  The EU RM toolbox has been designed to consider risk scenarios, or a set of them, that are  associated with a specific attack step and are part of a use case scenario. This approach is  mostly appropriate when malicious activities associated with a campaign, bound to comprise a  set of attack scenarios, need to be considered by interested parties. This does not, however,  preclude the use of the toolbox for the assessment of single attack scenarios that are related to  granular attack techniques and specific assets.  Each attack scenario is typically part of the attack step, as shown in Figure 3. Likewise, the use  case scenario might comprise several attack steps that the organisations should assess.  Figure 3: Use case scenarios, attack steps and attack scenarios  3.2. Risk evaluation against a specific threat  Let’s assume that a NIS competent authority, the NIS Cooperation Group or another competent  authority wants to identify risk levels across the EU against an emerged threat. The details of  this threat and the types of systems that it targets form the so-called incident scenario that the  competent authority wants to assess. The competent authority is keen to identify risk levels for a  specific group of organisations that belong to the target group of the threat actors.  To be able to compare the reported results, the organisations have to provide comparable  results to the competent authority using a common reference framework, as opposed to the  respective results provided by their corresponding RM tools. At the same time, in order to have  a common understanding of the scenarios they have to consider, the organisations have to be  able to unambiguously adapt the scenario described by the competent authority to their own  tools and environment, so that all the related attack/risk scenarios that are part of the overall  incident scenario are examined.  Considering that the incident scenario entails many attack/risk scenarios (see Section 3.1)  that map to the attack path, the competent authority wants to know risk levels associated with  each step of this path. This typically implies that each attack scenario should be represented  as a set of triplets, each comprising of <asset(s), threat(s), impact> that will be used as the  basis to calculate the corresponding risk levels. While the impact reflects to the well-established  security dimensions (confidentiality (C), integrity (I) and availability (A)), the assets and threats  do not enjoy commonly accepted taxonomies and lists. The toolbox corresponding components  will be used to define the risk scenarios, which then need to be adapted to each RM method  with the help of the toolbox mappings. Having said that, the use of the EU RM toolbox requires  the following steps.  1. The competent authority establishes a set of attack/risk scenarios that either map to  the attack path of the emerged threat, or the competent authority considers essential to  evaluate. The attack scenarios should use the toolbox terms, list of assets and list of  threats.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  18  2. The participating organisations have to map the defined attack/risk scenarios to their  environment to allow them to assess the corresponding risks using their own  respective methodology. This process requires the use of the toolbox libraries, which  might already have mappings about the organisation’s chosen RM methodology. If  such mappings are not available, they have to be enriched accordingly. In each of  these steps the organisation has to consult the toolbox terms to unambiguously  interpret each of the attack/risk scenarios.  a. More specifically, the organisation establishes the context for the examined  incident scenario. That is, it has to identify the assets that are involved in the  attack/risk scenarios and map them to their environment and the types of  assets that their methodology defines. As noted above, the toolbox libraries  might already provide the mapping of the toolbox assets to the organisation’s  methodology types of assets. If not, the participating experts have to propose  their mapping and enrich the toolbox libraries.  b. Following the context establishment and the identified assets, the  organisation has to unambiguously identify the threats addressed by the  attack/risk scenarios of the incident scenario. The list of threats that the  incident scenario addresses are from the toolbox’s threats taxonomy, which  do not necessarily directly map to the organisation’s methodology threats  taxonomy. To bridge this gap, a threats mapping library for the corresponding  risk methodology must be developed, if none already exist. This threats  mapping library will be gradually enriched. Note that during this process, new  threats or threat categories can also be introduced to the toolbox threat  taxonomy. So, as with the list of assets, there are two cases.  i. A mapping between the toolbox-adopted list of threats and the  organisation’s chosen methodology list of threats is already available  in the toolbox’s library. In this case, the organisation has to choose  the corresponding threats for the attack/risk scenarios.  ii. There is no available mapping, and therefore the organisation has to  run this task internally and, as a result, enrich the toolbox libraries.  c. Having identified and mapped the list of assets and threats, the organisation  has to assess risks for each of the requested attack/risk scenarios. If the  method considers vulnerabilities in the risk assessment process, these have  to be properly identified for the involved assets and used in the risk  calculation process.  3. The calculated risk values for the corresponding risk scenarios provide valuable  information to the organisation that has been using the specific methodologies. This  information, however, is not meaningful to the competent authority that does not want  or have to know the peculiarities of each RM method. The last step in the toolbox  usage process is to normalise risk assessment results to the toolbox risk scales. This  can be done using the toolbox libraries if such a mapping between the toolbox risk  scales and the organisation’s RM methodology’s scales exist. If not, the organisation  has to undertake the mapping process and enrich the toolbox libraries.  4. The competent authority collects the outcomes of the above process conducted in the  organisation’s environment and based on the reported results, it either has the  information it needs to evaluate the organisations’ security posture or has to conduct  the last step itself.  Note that in this process, not all of the initially defined attack/risk scenarios are necessarily  applicable to all environments. Depending on the system modelling of the organisation and the  dependencies between a threat and primary assets and how a threat can affect a primary asset  through other additional supporting assets, the organisation will decide the applicability of each  of the attack/risk scenarios.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  19  Figure 1: EU RM toolbox processes diagram  3.3. Use case development process  The toolbox can be used by a competent authority to assess organisations’ risk levels against  an incident scenario. An incident scenario, as previously defined, is used by a competent  authority to describe a set of threats against which the participating organisations will assess  their posture. It aims to guide the organisations in considering specific threats and narrow down  the scope of the attack path and the number of attack/risk scenarios that the participating  organisations have to consider. Therefore, an incident scenario is anticipated to include the  following information.  1. Description of the scenario. This outlines the incident scenario that the competent  authority addresses in the scenario.  2. Indicative assets in scope. The scenario has to provide a list of assets, primary or  supporting, that are affected or used by the threat actors during their campaign.  3. Attack path. This outlines the steps that are typically followed by the threat actors to  give the participating entities a better understanding about the incident scenario and  the set of threats that are being examined.  4. Attack scenarios. They form a list of triplets about the involved or affected assets, the  considered threat and the corresponding impact (i.e. the security dimension that is  affected by this threat) for the corresponding steps outlined in the attack path.  A use case example can be found in Annex VIII.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  20  4. Toolbox evolvement  The EU RM toolbox is envisioned as a reference tool that will be enriched with additional  information to achieve its objectives. This is anticipated to occur at various levels that  correspond to the toolbox’s knowledge base, which comprises the set of toolbox definitions (i.e.  terminology, assets classification, threats taxonomy and impact/risk scale), but also the  mappings to other methodologies’ components, as shown in Figure 5.  The toolbox’s definitions are expected to be reviewed and enriched by the community so that  the needs of all the domains that will adopt the EU RM toolbox will be addressed. Examples of  these enhancements include impact justifications for the various levels that are adapted to  specific domains, such as the energy domain, or set of threats that are more meaningful to the  specific domain.  Another important component of the EU RM toolbox is the set of interoperability libraries, which  will provide the mappings of the toolbox definitions to other RM methodologies. These libraries  can be the result of the use of the toolbox by the community, where the involved parties will  undergo the process of conducting this mapping between the toolbox and their own RM  methodology components, if these are not already available, and provide their feedback to  enrich the toolbox libraries. This will help subsequent efforts or users and will result in an  integrated tool that will help organisations compare their risk levels.  Similarly to the definitions and the interoperability libraries, a third set of valuable information  that will complement the toolbox is the use cases descriptions, which can act either as  templates for subsequent risk assessment processes, or as specific scenarios that can be  applied on domains or organisations.

Conclusions  This deliverable has presented the main components of the EU RM toolbox, which serves as a  reference framework for aligning different RM efforts and thus achieving a common  understanding about risks and associated risk levels, regardless of the RM approach adopted  and the tool(s) used by organisations.  Through the proposed EU RM toolbox, different stakeholders will be able to compare their RM  results, for specific risk scenarios, with other organisations that may use different RM  methods/tools. Furthermore, regulatory and supervisory bodies will be supported with regard to  the overall view of the risk levels and the security posture of organisations in a specific sector or  across various sectors.  The main RM functions supported by the EU RM toolbox are:  • the establishment of a common understanding on the activities undertaken during the  RM process;  • a definition of the scope of the environment in which the risk assessment process will  be applied;  • the identification of risk scenarios related to a specific threat or threats that are being  investigated;  • mapping of the calculated risk levels to those defined by a common risk scale.  It is vital to stress that the knowledge base provided by the toolbox (sets of terms, classification  of assets and threats) will be dynamically enriched to cover additional methods and tools, along  with other domains.  Moreover, subsequent versions of the toolbox can seek the development of a common set of  measures that will also be mapped to the various methods, to facilitate the proper and unified  risk treatment.

The impact that corresponds to each of these levels is  detailed below to help stakeholders to identify corresponding levels that best fit to their  environment.  • Very high: disastrous.  o A threat event leads to disastrous business impacts.  o A threat event leads to financial loss that is bigger than 5 % of the  organisation’s annual turnover/budget.  o Information leaks might threaten the organisation’s survival.  o A threat event leads to corruption that is irrecoverable or causes permanent  downtime.  o Unavailability that takes extreme efforts to regain, or that is permanent.  o Negative impact on the reputation of the organisation or its employees with  global media coverage.  o A threat event leads to discontinuation of all organisational services.  o The organisation might receive a harsh penalty, which might bring some lethal  costs close to being insurmountable.  o Significant repercussions that are almost irreversible and cannot be  surpassed (e.g. death, working impossibility).  • High: critical.  o A threat event leads to critical business impacts.  o A threat event leads to financial loss that ranges from 2 % to 5 % of the  organisation’s annual turnover/budget.  o Information leaks severely undermine the interests of an organisation.  o A threat event leads to corruption that imposes a substantial burden on the  stakeholders.  o Intense unavailability that causes significant inconvenience for stakeholders.  o Significant decline in the organisation’s reputation with repeated media  criticism.  o A threat event leads to complete departmental disruption. Indictment against  the business.  o A threat event costs the organisation a considerable amount of money in fees.  o Significant outcomes that might be surpassed, but with considerable  challenges (e.g. bank ban).  • Moderate: average.  o A threat event leads to average business impacts.  o A threat event leads to financial loss that ranges from 0.05 % to 2 % of the  organisation’s annual turnover/budget.  o Information leaks undermine the interests of the organisation.  o A threat event leads to corruption that causes difficulty for the affected parties,  nevertheless, the recovery is simple.  o Limited availability causes difficulty for the concerned stakeholders.  o A threat event leads to temporary damage to the reputation of the  organisation with occasional media criticism.  o A threat event leads to isolated events with minimal consumer/citizen effect.  o A threat event leads to possible penalties for the organisation and might  introduce non-marginal charges.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  42  o Significant difficulty that might be compounded by a few complications (e.g.  denial of access to commercial delivery).  • Low: marginal.  o A threat event leads to marginal business impacts.  o A threat event leads to financial loss that ranges from 0.01 % to 0.05 % of the  organisation’s annual turnover/budget.  o Leaks of information are detrimental to the overall interests of the  organisation.  o Eradicating the corruption would not have any negative repercussions.  o Lack of availability that causes inconvenience but does not seriously  compromise the interests of the stakeholders.  o A threat event leads to infrequent media criticism.  o A threat event leads to minor occurrences that had no effect on their service  users.  o A threat event introduces some supplemental charges. A very low chance of  any sentences, or perhaps a very minor possibility of one.  o A little setback that can be easily overcome (e.g. time waste).  • Very low: negligible.  o A threat event leads to negligible business impacts.  o A threat event leads to financial loss that is less than or equal to 0.01 % of the  organisation’s annual turnover/budget.

Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  45  F ANNEX VI – Risk calculation  interoperability samples  This annex presents two experiments that prove the interoperability among various  methodologies and the proposed toolbox. We have to note that the toolbox seamlessly works  with ITSRM2, Monarc, EBIOS (expression of needs and identification of security objectives) and  Magerit. The toolbox is equipped with dropdown lists that contain, in a numerical approach, the  impact and probability level of the aforementioned methodologies. ITSRM2 has been  harmonised in 5 levels instead of 10 based on the approach that is proposed in the  corresponding guideline. EBIOS and Magerit are methodologies that support the five  cybersecurity risk scaling. While Monarc supports a three cybersecurity risk scaling (high,  medium and low). To prove the aforementioned feature of interoperability, we performed two  experiments with Monarc and Magerit.  Experiment 1.  We assume that the final user is an organisation that works within the energy sector and  performs risk per threat following the Monarc method. At this point, we will calculate the risk of  this organisation against the threat of the denial of service. On the one hand, the impact coming  from Monarc depends on parameters including the impact of threat in confidentiality, integrity,  availability, reputation, operational, legal, financial and personal. The overall impact scores 4  out of 4. On the other hand, the probability of a threat depending on existing system  vulnerabilities and likelihood of occurrence of the corresponding threat scores 4 out of 4. The  overall risk due to the Monarc approach is considered as high. However, based on the toolbox  approach, the risk of the corresponding organisation is considered as very high.  Experiment 2.  We assume that the final user is an organisation that works within the healthcare sector and  performs risk per threat following the Magerit method. At this point, we will calculate the risk of  this organisation against the threat of the denial of service. On the one hand, the impact coming  from Magerit depends on parameters that are directly related to economical loss. The overall  impact scores 4 out of 5 (less than 1 000 000 000.00 monetary units). On the other hand, the  frequency of occurrence of a threat scores 3 out of 5 (less than a year). The overall risk due to  the Monarc approach is considered as high. Following this experiment, the toolbox agrees with  the initial result that entitled it as high risk.

Scenario description  A NIS competent authority wants to identify risk exposures at the national level against an  emerged threat that is related to the spread of a ransomware that targets mainly distribution  system operators (DSOs) in the energy sector. More specifically, the attack aims to encrypt the  databases of distributed energy resources management systems, thus disabling load and  production forecasting and the grid network operations at distribution level (see Figure 6). The  attackers initially infect a DSO’s network with malicious loaders through updates of several  backup server suites deployed in DSOs’ networks.  Figure 3: Logical architecture of the targeted DSO network  Indicative assets in scope  This section lists indicative assets that are involved in the incident scenario. The typical  relationship of the involved tangible assets is depicted in Figure 7, although the DSOs’  architectures are expected to vary. In parentheses is the type of assets according to the  toolbox’s asset classification: data, function, software, hardware, IT services, personnel,  location.  Use case’s indicative involved assets:  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  48  Distribution management system (DMS) data (data) / DMS backup data (data) / load forecast  (function) / production forecast (function) / backup server (software) / backup server  (hardware) / networking devices (IT services) / DMS server (software/hardware).  Figure 4: Assets involved in the incident scenario mapped to the smart grid architecture model  Attack path  The attack path for the ransomware incident scenario comprises the following steps.  1. Attack path step 1. An initial malware (loader) enters the network through the  software update channel of the backup software (located at the organisation’s  operation network).  2. Attack path step 2. The loader executes a PowerShell script to create a scheduled  task at the backup server and gain persistence to the target network.  3. Attack path step 3. The scheduled task is executed daily and creates a command- and-control channel between the adversary-controlled remote server and the victim’s  system.  4. Attack path step 4. The malware gains access to an admin’s valid local accounts to  use the admin’s privileges in lateral movement.  5. Attack path step 5. The malware conducts remote system discovery for lateral  movement.  6. Attack path step 6. Ransomware is uploaded through the command-and-control  channel to DMS.  7. Attack path step 7. The attacker obtains access to a backup server / destroys  backups.  Interoperable EU Risk Management Toolbox  | FEBRUARY 2023  49  8. Attack path step 8. The ransomware encrypts the database of the distribution system.  The above steps are depicted in Figure 8.  Figure 5: Attack path steps  Attack scenarios  In this section, we describe the attack scenarios per attack step, each comprising of <assets,  threats, impact>. The list of involved assets includes targeted assets, such as the DMS data,  and assets that are part of the attack surface or the attack vector. Moreover, the list of threats is  indicative, and additional threats can also be examined.

    "abstract": "This document presents the EU RM toolbox, a solution proposed by ENISA to address interoperability concerns related to the use of information security RM methods. The toolbox aims to facilitate the smooth integration of various RM methods in an organisation’s environment or across organisations and bridge the gaps associated with the methods’ disparate respective approaches. With the help of the toolbox, shareholders will be able to have a common understanding of risks and report interoperable risk assessment results to the community and competent authorities."

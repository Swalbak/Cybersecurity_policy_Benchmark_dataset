    "document(english)": "1  Introduction  The compromise of several Managed Service Providers (MSPs) was reported in 2017. In response, the Australian Cyber  Security Centre (ACSC) provided organisations with the information they needed to protect themselves and others from  this threat.  In 2018, adversaries continued to target and compromise MSPs and, through them, their customers. The ACSC  reiterates the need for organisations to scrutinise the cyber security measures implemented in contracted ICT solutions  to combat the threat.  Mitigation strategies  This publication shows organisations the actions they can take to manage the security risks posed by engaging and  authorising network access to MSPs. Many of the following recommendations apply to any outsourced ICT service  provider, not just MSPs.  The number and type of controls used with an MSP will vary depending on the sensitivity of your systems. The ACSC  recommends the following strategies to reduce the risk of compromise via MSPs.  Make sure your own network is secure  Implement cyber security guidance, such as the ACSC’s Essential Eight. These eight mitigation strategies are effective in  defending against malicious activity such as preventing the execution of malware and reducing the attack surface of an  organisation.  Get security in the contract  Security may not be a primary consideration when outsourcing the management of a system; however, the cost of  remediation after a compromise far exceeds the cost of upfront implementation.  Clearly state cyber security expectations upfront. Ask candidate MSPs to provide evidence of their ability to meet your  security requirements while administering your network. During negotiations you may ask a candidate MSP to walk  through how they administer a customer’s network.  During negotiations, ask the MSP for contact information for other clients. You should be able to have an open  conversation about another customer’s experience of the MSP’s ability to protect customer systems.  Ensure your contract requires your MSP to maintain a good internal security culture, and to implement cyber security  guidance such as the ACSC’s Essential Eight.  How to Manage Your Security  When Engaging a Managed  Service Provider  First published: December 2018  Last updated: October 2021  2  Include cyber security incident notification clauses in your contract with your MSP. The MSP must be obligated to notify  the customer in the event of any cyber security incident that may endanger the customer network. This may include  cases in which MSP systems related to the administration, management or storage of information on the customer  network have been compromised or accessed by an unauthorised and/or unknown party.  Define the security clearances expected of MSP staff working on your systems and ensure that this is provided to you  for validation. There is additional risk from insider threats if the MSP engages staff outside your normal security  clearance and background checking procedures.  Control MSP access to your network  To perform their contracted duties, a MSP must administer either a system on your network or your entire network.  Without proper controls, this high level of privileged access, combined with the unknown security posture of a network  that you do not control, can leave your network vulnerable to intrusion.  Know where the boundaries are between you and your MSP. Ensure that your organisation clearly identifies which  systems each MSP can access and how, and keep the record up to date. These accesses should be treated as untrusted  for anything outside the scope of the MSP’s responsibility. For example, a connection from an MSP into a specific  customer system should be treated as an untrusted access with regards to other systems on your network.  Segment your network from the MSP’s. This will limit an adversary’s ability to move laterally from a compromised MSP  network into the customer network. The ACSC has observed adversaries using compromised MSP workstations to move  laterally to customer domain controllers located in foreign countries, increasing access to the victim’s network.  Examples of segmentation include:   Where an MSP administers an entire network, the customer may stipulate that the MSP network not be used to  administer a customer’s systems. Instead, MSP staff administer the customer’s network from a system within the  customer’s network.   Consider segmenting your network into trust zones.  Utilise a secure jump host for MSPs to perform administrative tasks. If a MSP must access your network from theirs, or  remotely, specify a dedicated workstation on which MSP administrative staff should perform sensitive administration  duties, with restricted access to critical servers. Combine this with multi-factor authentication to limit an adversary’s  ability to compromise critical assets.  Mitigate the impact of stolen or abused credentials  Credential management is part of controlling and restricting MSP access to your network. As a key exploitation vector,  credentials require special protection. Typically, when an adversary has full access to your MSP they will have access to  all the credentials on their network. This not only includes corporate credentials of the MSP but also credentials for  their client’s devices and systems managed by the MSP, if they are stored on the MSP system.  Implement least-privilege administration to decrease the impact of adversaries gaining MSP-level access to customer  networks. Provide the MSP with the least privileged account(s) required to do their job.  Strongly control enterprise and domain administrator accounts. Enterprise and domain administrator accounts should  have no members by default. Utilise just-in-time principles for privileged accounts like the domain administrator. Use a  manual process or privileged access management software to add named accounts to the domain administration role,  for a limited duration.  Provide attributable accounts. Accounts should be attributable to the MSP to enable easy identification of MSP activity  in privilege allocation and logs. The ACSC has observed adversaries using legitimate support accounts provisioned by  MSPs to deploy malware to customer networks; rapid attribution of such activity would assist the customer to work  with their MSP to remediate compromises of their network.  3  Enable multi-factor authentication on remotely accessible services used by your MSP to access your network and  systems. This will ensure that, even if an adversary has compromised credentials of MSP accounts, they remain  incapable of logging on without a second factor such as a token. Adversaries have used Remote Desktop Protocol  directly from a MSP network to deploy malware to servers anywhere in an administered network; multi-factor  authentication can prevent an adversary from obtaining unauthorised access. Also consider blocking MSP access by  default and allowing remote access at an agreed time. Correlate this access with a specific job ticket.  Ensure visibility of MSP actions on your network  Capture relevant logging to improve visibility of potentially malicious activity. Logs should be stored in a centralised  location. A security administrator or independent party without access rights/accounts should regularly review logs for  suspicious activity in the reviewed systems. Also consider including a contract requirement for your MSP to perform  logging of hosts and networks used to remotely connect to the customer environment. Relevant logging includes:   host-based event logs to provide visibility of malicious activity on workstations and servers   firewall and proxy logs to provide visibility of network connections associated with adversaries   remote access logs to help identify unusual network access from accounts used by MSPs.  MSPs should be responsible for reviewing their logs to ensure their access to the customer network aligns with an  actual business requirement and/or job ticket. Further, the MSP should be obligated to provide detailed logs if the  customer has security concerns they wish to investigate further.  The recommended event log retention time is at least 18 months; however, some organisations may have a regulatory  requirement to retain event logs for a longer period.  Maintaining default sizes of event logs may cause older logs that contained key data to be overwritten prior to  commencing an investigation; it is therefore advised that organisations increase the default sizes or forward logs to a  central location for storage.  Plan for a cyber security incident  Have a practical incident response plan  If you detect a cyber security incident, or have been notified by your MSP of a possible cyber security incident, ensure  you get as much detail as possible. Look for indications of what level of access enabled the cyber security incident to  occur. A web-facing scan of services is very different to an external system logon, or internal lateral movement.  Information to request includes:   What sort of cyber security incident is it?   What specific data and systems are known to be affected?   What was the indication that there was a cyber security incident?   Date and time of the cyber security incident?   Is the cyber security incident ongoing?   What actions is the MSP taking to investigate and remediate?   Has this cyber security incident been reported anywhere?  4  Have a communications strategy  Communicate securely. If the compromise involved your corporate network, you may no longer be able to trust  corporate communications. Ensure you have alternate secure communication channels internally and with your MSP.  Keep records of any engagement with the MSP for future reference.  Report to the relevant authorities. Firstly, ensure that the appropriate person(s) within your organisation have been  notified. If personal information has been lost or compromised, you may be legally required to report the cyber security  incident to the Office of the Information Commissioner. You should also report the cyber security incident to the ACSC  for advice and assistance on how to remediate your network.  Further Information  The Information Security Manual is a cyber security framework that organisations can apply to protect their systems  and data from cyber threats. The advice in the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents, along with its Essential  Eight, complements this framework.  Further information for customers on questions they can ask MSPs prior to engaging their services is available in the  Questions to Ask Managed Service Providers  publication.  Further information on outsourcing services to cloud service providers is available from the ACSC.

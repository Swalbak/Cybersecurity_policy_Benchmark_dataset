Introduction  The European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) is an EU advocacy campaign that promotes cyber security  among citizens and advocates for change in the perception of cyber-threats by promoting, education,  sharing of good practices and competitions in data and information security. The European Union Agency  for Network and Information Security (ENISA), the European Commission DG Connect and Partners1 have  been deploying the ECSM each October for the last 4 years.  The objective of this report  ECSM 2015 focused on Member States of the EU and EU partners. The project life cycle included  coordinators calls, face-to-face meetings, periodic news updates, European Kick-off event, trainings and  education seminars, website resources and weekly publication of materials. This report will:  1. Present the preparatory work, materials published and results achieved;  2. Carry out an objective evaluation;  3. Draw conclusions that can be used in future editions of the ECSM.  Target audience  ECSM is an annual advocacy campaign that includes both the general public , acting as  ‘EU digital citizens’  and specific groups focused on Member States stakeholders from public and private organisations e.g. IT  experts, NIS authorities, Education organisations, etc.  The engagement model that ENISA uses is depicted  in the graphic below. It represents the stakeholders that are involved in the ECSM and the way the Agency  implements the brokerage role. The main contact in member states is through the National Liaison  Officers- NLO network2, partners from public and private organisations, and networks of multipliers.  Structure of the report  This document will present to the reader the organisational aspects of the ECSM 2015 putting things into  perspective. It will refer to the motivation and concept behind the advocacy campaign, participation, and  evaluation including analytics. The evaluation report of 20143 and associated recommendations were  taken into account.  1 For names and logos please see Annex C  2 More on the NLO network and contacts https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/national- liaison-office  3 May be consulted here https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european- cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2014  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/national-liaison-office https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/national-liaison-office https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2014  The European Cyber Security Month 2015  Status Published  | Version v2  | Public  | December 2015  07  2. Implementation  Planning  The European Cyber Security Month 2015 benefited from planning that took into consideration  recommendations from the roadmap released in the previous year. In 2015 the work programme  mentions the ECSM will be further developed following its basic principles, namely:  • Support the multi-stakeholder governance approach.  • Encourage common public-private activities.  • Assess the impact of activities, optimising and adapting to new challenges.  Furthermore, in practice the planning phase consisted of an extensive consultation with stakeholders like  the Commission, NLO network, and international partners in order to come up with a consolidated version  that anyone could easily follow. The campaign partners followed the planning depicted in the graph below  which it was updated periodically and communicated to the community. Regarding the management of  the communication process, all feedback, issues and ideas were tackled in a tailored manner to fit the  needs and purposes of organisations involved.  The European Cyber Security Month 2015  Status Published  | Version v2  | Public  | December 2015  08  Participation  The European Cyber Security Month fully fledged version was implemented for the 3rd consecutive year  after a pilot and feasibility study4. With the occasion of the launch, the following statements were made.  Action! Happening during October  ECSM run for the entire month of October, with each week focusing on a different topic. Each week, ENISA  published new material. Partners organized activities with focus on training, strategy summits, general  presentations to users, online quizzes, etc.  1st week – October 1-4: Cyber security training for employees  2nd week – October 5-11: Creating a Culture of Cybersecurity at Work  3rd week – October 12-18: Code Week for all  4th week – October 19-25: Understanding Cloud solutions for all  5th week – October 26-31: Digital Single Market for all  4 To consult the graph with more details of each phase please see Annex D  Vice-President Ansip, in charge of the Digital Single Market, has been quoted to say:  \"Security against cyber-attacks has become central to consumer confidence and the online  economy. But we cannot get the best out of the opportunities offered by digital tools and  online networks if we do not trust them. Raising awareness of the risks and threats, and  the fact that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, is vital so that when they are online,  people can make better informed choices and guard against risks\".  Commissioner Oettinger, in charge of the Digital Economy and Society, suggested: \"To  make the digital world a secure place for everyone, we all have to contribute: policy  makers, research, industry, citizens. But for Europeans to fully enjoy the benefits of a safe  Internet, they also need to be aware of the risks they face online and to know how they  can to play an active role for their own security in their daily lives. The European  Cybersecurity Month is a great opportunity to spread good practices and increase the  overall level of awareness and thus of cybersecurity in the EU\".  ENISA’s Executive Director, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, has noted: “As our societies are  continuously being digitised and we are moving in the era of IoT and smart cities, e-skills  and online security are essential resources that need to be developed and continuously  enhanced. The Agency is developing an entire Network and Information Security (NIS)  community around the Cyber Security Month initiative.\"  The European Cyber Security Month 2015  Status Published  | Version v2  | Public  | December 2015  09  ECSM 20155 ran in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia ,Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland,  France, Germany,  Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland,  Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, Sweden, Spain, Romania, the United Kingdom; and Iceland, Moldova, Norway,  Serbia, also for the first time in Turkey.

Evaluation  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this work are the EU citizens, targeted by different categories, as  well as end user organisations from public and private sectors (in particular in the area of EU NIS  education). These stakeholders were expected to reap the following benefits:  • Develop knowledge and corresponding ICT skills by being part of a best practice sharing  community.  • Improve and enhance contacts with stakeholders of similar interests and profiles.  • Increase citizens’ awareness and governance on privacy when using online tools.  The metrics analysed in comparison between 20146 vs 2015 shown a consolidation of the campaign in  terms of outreach and content.  Comparison in numbers 2014 vs 2015 as following:   Countries involved 2014: 30; 2015: 32   Twitter followers 2014: 2223; 2015: 3605   Materials published 2014: 5 general and 2 tools; 2015: updated 27 tools& published 5 general;   Activities taken place: 2014: more than 184;  2015: 242  The survey  The survey was an important tool to measure the impact in the 2014 edition and it was used again in the  2015 edition. The survey was sent only to the ECSM community consisting of contact points- coordinators  and focused on the similar questions as in 2014. The charts below present their replies. We would like to  add that the 2015 survey8 had 24 replies.  6 For details on 2014 please consult the evaluation report from 2014  7 The NIS Education Map registered an increase of courses registered, currently with 417 courses in 22 countries  8 The survey was closed and focused on the coordinators involved in the campaign. By comparison in 2014 there were  29 participants in total.

Advance planning starting maybe the previous year ( By the time of the  publication of this report, the advance planning for 2016 already took place by means of face-to- face meeting – 5.11 seminar in Vienna and call on 1.12 concluding with an agreement on a  common calendar); 3. Provide printed materials if possible; 4. Introduce new activities e.g.  exhibitions;   Messages were also pointing to the need of such a campaign:  In conclusion, 87.5% in 2015 rated the campaign as being positive; 87.5% estimated that ECSM supports  their outreach and promotion work; 66.67% consulted ENISA material; 91.64% intend to participate in a  future edition. Also the twitter interactions increased to 70.83% in 2015. In terms of solutions offered for  “Overall the campaign is very well organized and the demand for it is deeply  needed.”  “Please continue this great initiative!”  “Keep up the good work!”  The European Cyber Security Month 2015  Status Published  | Version v2  | Public  | December 2015  15  issues 62.5% answered positively, however here we note also a 37.5% negative rate caused by website  automation flows which are the main point to improve in 2016.  The replies reflect the consolidation of the campaign and at the same time they report similarities with the  results obtained in the 2014 survey published in the respective report. Some points to be taken into  account:  - The European Cyber Security Month brings added value to stakeholders involved and there is a  clear statement of continuation for their part;  - The coordination team responded to the needs of the coordinators;  -  ENISA publications are used as content for the activities happening in countries;  -  Communication registered an uptake in terms of social media channels.  The web analytics  We present below some other graphs regarding the use of the  website www.cybersecuritymonth.eu , twitter reach and map  with geographical spread of the activities. The outreach on social  media was of 718,967 accounts. Number of visitors for  www.cybersecuritymonth.eu picked in October with 52,574  page views, with 71% corresponding to new visitors from all  around Europe.  • Country statistics: users from the countries below  visited the most the website:  http://www.cybersecuritymonth.eu/  The European Cyber Security Month 2015  Status Published  | Version v2  | Public  | December 2015  16   Website sessions during the period 24.09- 3.11.2015; it is important to be mentioned that 71%  were new visits showing a better outreach and increase compared with last year (web sessions in  2014 12.000 vs 15.000 in 2015);   Twitter performance 709,193 accounts reached/ 821,982 impressions in 2014 vs 718,967 accounts  reached/ 906,060 impressions in 2015  The European Cyber Security Month 2015  Status Published  | Version v2  | Public  | December 2015  17   Media reach as following, approximate 40,000,000 online reach by media in 2014 vs close to  60,000,000 online reach in 2015:  The European Cyber Security Month 2015  Status Published  | Version v2  | Public  | December 2015  18  The European Cyber Security Month 2015  Status Published  | Version v2  | Public  | December 2015  19  4. Conclusions  ENISA is committed to continue supporting the  European Cyber Security Month and will  encourage the active involvement of Member  States organisations in the coordination and  deployment.  From the deployment of the 2015 edition, the  following should be emphasized regarding  outcomes:  1. Member States and EU partner  countries are interested in working in  partnership on cyber security  education. The number of countries  involved reached a stable dimension  with a tendency for steady growth.  With this edition the maturity level  was successfully attained, furthermore  there is work to be followed to  increase the content distribution and  content co-ownership between MS’  organisations with the support of ENISA.  2. The European Commission, other EU bodies such as EESC, Agencies continued to get involved  and maintain their participation at high level. The campaign created a good environment for  European but also international cooperation for cyber security PPPs.  3. The community building process around the campaign is an important win. The EC, MSs and  ENISA may choose to further develop this aspect and extend its use to content distribution on  cyber security education and more.  The European Cyber Security Month had developed a model of engagement that makes possible a multi- stakeholder governance approach, main benefits being reaching to a large number of European citizens  through numerous activities organised by stakeholders. ECSM will be further developed following its basic  principles, namely:  • Support the multi-stakeholder governance approach.  • Encourage common public-private activities.  • Assess the impact of activities, optimising and adapting to new challenges.

Introduction  The European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) is an EU advocacy campaign that promotes cyber security  among citizens and advocates for change in the perception of cyber-threats by promoting, education,  sharing of good practices and competitions in data and information security. The European Union Agency  for Network and Information Security (ENISA), the European Commission DG Connect and Partners1 have  been deploying the ECSM each October for the last 4 years.  The objective of this report  ECSM 2015 focused on Member States of the EU and EU partners. The project life cycle included  coordinators calls, face-to-face meetings, periodic news updates, European Kick-off event, trainings and  education seminars, website resources and weekly publication of materials. This report will:  1. Present the preparatory work, materials published and results achieved;  2. Carry out an objective evaluation;  3. Draw conclusions that can be used in future editions of the ECSM.  Target audience  ECSM is an annual advocacy campaign that includes both the general public , acting as  ‘EU digital citizens’  and specific groups focused on Member States stakeholders from public and private organisations e.g. IT  experts, NIS authorities, Education organisations, etc.  The engagement model that ENISA uses is depicted  in the graphic below. It represents the stakeholders that are involved in the ECSM and the way the Agency  implements the brokerage role. The main contact in member states is through the National Liaison  Officers- NLO network2, partners from public and private organisations, and networks of multipliers.  Structure of the report  This document will present to the reader the organisational aspects of the ECSM 2015 putting things into  perspective. It will refer to the motivation and concept behind the advocacy campaign, participation, and  evaluation including analytics. The evaluation report of 20143 and associated recommendations were  taken into account.  1 For names and logos please see Annex C  2 More on the NLO network and contacts https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/national- liaison-office  3 May be consulted here https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european- cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2014  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/national-liaison-office https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/national-liaison-office https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2014  The European Cyber Security Month 2015  Status Published  | Version v2  | Public  | December 2015  07  2. Implementation  Planning  The European Cyber Security Month 2015 benefited from planning that took into consideration  recommendations from the roadmap released in the previous year. In 2015 the work programme  mentions the ECSM will be further developed following its basic principles, namely:  • Support the multi-stakeholder governance approach.  • Encourage common public-private activities.  • Assess the impact of activities, optimising and adapting to new challenges.  Furthermore, in practice the planning phase consisted of an extensive consultation with stakeholders like  the Commission, NLO network, and international partners in order to come up with a consolidated version  that anyone could easily follow. The campaign partners followed the planning depicted in the graph below  which it was updated periodically and communicated to the community. Regarding the management of  the communication process, all feedback, issues and ideas were tackled in a tailored manner to fit the  needs and purposes of organisations involved.  The European Cyber Security Month 2015  Status Published  | Version v2  | Public  | December 2015  08  Participation  The European Cyber Security Month fully fledged version was implemented for the 3rd consecutive year  after a pilot and feasibility study4. With the occasion of the launch, the following statements were made.  Action! Happening during October  ECSM run for the entire month of October, with each week focusing on a different topic. Each week, ENISA  published new material. Partners organized activities with focus on training, strategy summits, general  presentations to users, online quizzes, etc.  1st week – October 1-4: Cyber security training for employees  2nd week – October 5-11: Creating a Culture of Cybersecurity at Work  3rd week – October 12-18: Code Week for all  4th week – October 19-25: Understanding Cloud solutions for all  5th week – October 26-31: Digital Single Market for all  4 To consult the graph with more details of each phase please see Annex D  Vice-President Ansip, in charge of the Digital Single Market, has been quoted to say:  \"Security against cyber-attacks has become central to consumer confidence and the online  economy. But we cannot get the best out of the opportunities offered by digital tools and  online networks if we do not trust them. Raising awareness of the risks and threats, and  the fact that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, is vital so that when they are online,  people can make better informed choices and guard against risks\".  Commissioner Oettinger, in charge of the Digital Economy and Society, suggested: \"To  make the digital world a secure place for everyone, we all have to contribute: policy  makers, research, industry, citizens. But for Europeans to fully enjoy the benefits of a safe  Internet, they also need to be aware of the risks they face online and to know how they  can to play an active role for their own security in their daily lives. The European  Cybersecurity Month is a great opportunity to spread good practices and increase the  overall level of awareness and thus of cybersecurity in the EU\".  ENISA’s Executive Director, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, has noted: “As our societies are  continuously being digitised and we are moving in the era of IoT and smart cities, e-skills  and online security are essential resources that need to be developed and continuously  enhanced. The Agency is developing an entire Network and Information Security (NIS)  community around the Cyber Security Month initiative.\"  The European Cyber Security Month 2015  Status Published  | Version v2  | Public  | December 2015  09  ECSM 20155 ran in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia ,Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland,  France, Germany,  Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland,  Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, Sweden, Spain, Romania, the United Kingdom; and Iceland, Moldova, Norway,  Serbia, also for the first time in Turkey.

Evaluation  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this work are the EU citizens, targeted by different categories, as  well as end user organisations from public and private sectors (in particular in the area of EU NIS  education). These stakeholders were expected to reap the following benefits:  • Develop knowledge and corresponding ICT skills by being part of a best practice sharing  community.  • Improve and enhance contacts with stakeholders of similar interests and profiles.  • Increase citizens’ awareness and governance on privacy when using online tools.  The metrics analysed in comparison between 20146 vs 2015 shown a consolidation of the campaign in  terms of outreach and content.  Comparison in numbers 2014 vs 2015 as following:   Countries involved 2014: 30; 2015: 32   Twitter followers 2014: 2223; 2015: 3605   Materials published 2014: 5 general and 2 tools; 2015: updated 27 tools& published 5 general;   Activities taken place: 2014: more than 184;  2015: 242  The survey  The survey was an important tool to measure the impact in the 2014 edition and it was used again in the  2015 edition. The survey was sent only to the ECSM community consisting of contact points- coordinators  and focused on the similar questions as in 2014. The charts below present their replies. We would like to  add that the 2015 survey8 had 24 replies.  6 For details on 2014 please consult the evaluation report from 2014  7 The NIS Education Map registered an increase of courses registered, currently with 417 courses in 22 countries  8 The survey was closed and focused on the coordinators involved in the campaign. By comparison in 2014 there were  29 participants in total.

Advance planning starting maybe the previous year ( By the time of the  publication of this report, the advance planning for 2016 already took place by means of face-to- face meeting – 5.11 seminar in Vienna and call on 1.12 concluding with an agreement on a  common calendar); 3. Provide printed materials if possible; 4. Introduce new activities e.g.  exhibitions;   Messages were also pointing to the need of such a campaign:  In conclusion, 87.5% in 2015 rated the campaign as being positive; 87.5% estimated that ECSM supports  their outreach and promotion work; 66.67% consulted ENISA material; 91.64% intend to participate in a  future edition. Also the twitter interactions increased to 70.83% in 2015. In terms of solutions offered for  “Overall the campaign is very well organized and the demand for it is deeply  needed.”  “Please continue this great initiative!”  “Keep up the good work!”  The European Cyber Security Month 2015  Status Published  | Version v2  | Public  | December 2015  15  issues 62.5% answered positively, however here we note also a 37.5% negative rate caused by website  automation flows which are the main point to improve in 2016.  The replies reflect the consolidation of the campaign and at the same time they report similarities with the  results obtained in the 2014 survey published in the respective report. Some points to be taken into  account:  - The European Cyber Security Month brings added value to stakeholders involved and there is a  clear statement of continuation for their part;  - The coordination team responded to the needs of the coordinators;  -  ENISA publications are used as content for the activities happening in countries;  -  Communication registered an uptake in terms of social media channels.

Conclusions  ENISA is committed to continue supporting the  European Cyber Security Month and will  encourage the active involvement of Member  States organisations in the coordination and  deployment.  From the deployment of the 2015 edition, the  following should be emphasized regarding  outcomes:  1. Member States and EU partner  countries are interested in working in  partnership on cyber security  education. The number of countries  involved reached a stable dimension  with a tendency for steady growth.  With this edition the maturity level  was successfully attained, furthermore  there is work to be followed to  increase the content distribution and  content co-ownership between MS’  organisations with the support of ENISA.  2. The European Commission, other EU bodies such as EESC, Agencies continued to get involved  and maintain their participation at high level. The campaign created a good environment for  European but also international cooperation for cyber security PPPs.  3. The community building process around the campaign is an important win. The EC, MSs and  ENISA may choose to further develop this aspect and extend its use to content distribution on  cyber security education and more.  The European Cyber Security Month had developed a model of engagement that makes possible a multi- stakeholder governance approach, main benefits being reaching to a large number of European citizens  through numerous activities organised by stakeholders. ECSM will be further developed following its basic  principles, namely:  • Support the multi-stakeholder governance approach.  • Encourage common public-private activities.  • Assess the impact of activities, optimising and adapting to new challenges.

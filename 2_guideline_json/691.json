Background  As a direct result of current economic necessities, ongoing technological developments and changes to EU  policy, the IT industry is undergoing a number of fundamental shifts. Growth has slowed for many IT industry  vendors that aren’t delivering the innovative solutions that consumers expect, this is a sign that the nature of  the industry is changing. Legacy vendors are feeling the pressure from new dominant vendors and are  therefore consolidating or divesting1 (HP split2 & Dell buying EMC3).  Technological developments such as Internet of Things, Big Data and Smart Devices have the potential to  significantly change the EU way of life, but are hampered by issues related to security and privacy.  Nevertheless, these technologies are becoming the driving force behind many IT companies in the  foreseeable future.  Where EU policy is concerned, the adoption of the NIS Directive will impose new network and information  security requirements on operators of essential services and digital service providers and will require them to  report certain security incidents to competent authorities or Computer Security Incident Response Teams. At  the same time, the European General Data Protection Regulation, which outlines security requirements and  requires privacy breach reporting, subject to penalties and fines, will require companies in the EU to change  their operating model to comply to more stringent requirements. Last but not least, the Digital Single Market  initiative is expected to boost the competitiveness of industry through a number of mechanisms. However,  none of these policy changes will be successful without the strong support of industry.  In this short paper, ENISA puts forward 10 messages to industry. The ultimate goals behind these messages  are (a) to encourage the establishment of a high level of cybersecurity across all industry segments and (b) to  ensure that cybersecurity is an enabler and not an inhibitor of a more efficient market.  2. Key messages to Industry  ENISA’s key messages to EU industry are as follows:  1. Consider new business models that capitalise on security as a differentiator of products and services.  The EU has a strong background in information security coupled with extensive experience in  implementing trust models. EU industry is therefore well-positioned to offer cybersecurity products and  services to a broad consumer base. In order to do this however, it will be necessary to conceive new  business models, which are not simply replicating successful approaches pioneered outside the EU.  2. Establish sectorial requirements for information security in order to move the cybersecurity market.  The EU cybersecurity market is currently a ‘supply push’ market. Even large industry players may not have  enough purchasing power to move the cybersecurity market to reflect their needs. By creating common  1 http://www.cio.com/article/3006976/it-industry/5-it-industry-predictions-for-2016-from-forrester-and-idc.html  2 http://recode.net/2015/11/02/hewlett-packard-splits-in-two-today-now-what/  3 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-12/dell-to-acquire-emc-for-67-billion-to-add-data-storage- devices  ENISA Recommendations to IT Industry  January 2016  05  requirements representative of entire industry sectors, industry can influence supply and move the  market to reflect their needs.  3. Invest more in awareness and education on security at all levels.  Work together with the public sector, academia and professional organisations that specialise in training  to ensure that education schemes are closely aligned with industry expectations. The ultimate objective is  to ensure that such training results in knowledgeable and qualified personnel for all important security- related industry functions (and is not restricted to the CISO).  Invest in people as well as technology. The various data breaches in 2015 show that the “insider threat” is  still underestimated.  Empower “informed customers” in order for them to be able to ask the right questions to the providers  and understand where their responsibilities lie.  4. Reduce Operational Expenditure by Improving Risk Management  Industry must comply with legal obligations and regulatory requirements, but outside this framework  companies are free to select an approach that optimises opportunity for a given set of risks. By investing  in proven risk management techniques, companies can reduce their overall expenditure whilst still  achieving an appropriate level of security.  5. Secure the whole lifecycle of products by using security and privacy by design.  Industry can offer a high level of security whilst significantly reducing costs by deploying methods that  build security and privacy into their products and services starting from the design phase. In addition,  where ICT devices and services rely on third-party components, it is important to validate the security of  the supply chain and to ensure the secure integration of all components together.  Security design should be based on a solid understanding of the threats that are likely to affect products  and services and such threat assessments should be carried out at regular intervals in order to keep up  with threat evolution.  Where deployed products are concerned, vendors must provide security updates in a timely manner.  6. Improve cooperation within and across industry segments and national borders to improve threat  intelligence and promote the application of good practices.  Industry actors should increase cooperation on all areas of cybersecurity to the extent that it does not  affect their competitiveness (suppliers of cybersecurity products and services being a special category  here). Improving threat intelligence and spreading best practice benefits all industry players and reduces  unnecessary costs due to ‘reinventing the wheel’.  Opportunities exist for closer collaboration with EU policy makers, which could improve the  competitiveness of EU industry in the global market. Notable examples of such opportunities are the  Digital Single Market initiative as well as the General Data Protection Regulation that was recently agreed  between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council.  ENISA Recommendations to IT Industry  January 2016  06  7. Proactively drive standardisation through strong industry representation.  ENISA believes that standards should be industry driven and should be a mechanism for improving market  efficiency by providing for high levels of security whilst stimulating competition and ensuring  interoperability of products.  Industry should proactively contribute to the standards development process by clarifying the  requirements for new or evolving standards and ensuring that they help promote best of breed solutions.  8. Support cybersecurity and privacy certification schemes to improve customer confidence  Security concerns are still seen as a major barrier to deploying the latest technologies in the EU market –  often rightly so. By agreeing on suitable certification schemes for security and privacy, industry can play a  role in increasing consumer confidence thereby increasing the uptake of new technologies.  9. Collaborate with academia to ensure that quality research results in concrete products and services.  ENISA notes that there is still a large gap between innovative resource ideas that come out of EU funded  research projects and commercial products and services that turn these ideas into pragmatic solutions for  consumers.  Industry should work together with academia to improve the mechanism for ensuring that good ideas  result in good products. In particular, there should be a framework for introducing research ideas to EU  companies and for ensuring adequate support by those who developed the ideas throughout the product  or service lifecycle.  10. Make the resolution of societal issues a concern for engineers as well as public affairs specialists.  Engineers and operational staff tend to be greatly under-represented in EU collaboration efforts on  cybersecurity. Industry should allocate more operational experience to initiatives that seek to resolve key  societal issues. By doing so, they will help remove barriers that prevent EU industry from realising its true  potential.  3. Concluding remarks:  The role of ENISA is to guide experts towards security solutions that are adapted to the needs of the  internal market. By encouraging strong cooperation across national borders and across communities, the  Agency promotes the development of approaches to security that are not hampered by national  restrictions or the ideas of particular communities. This results in solutions that are interoperable across  the EU, thereby decreasing costs and enabling EU industry to benefit from a wider market.

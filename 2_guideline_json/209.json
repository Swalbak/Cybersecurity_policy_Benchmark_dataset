To this end, ENISA, with the support of the Ad-Hoc Working Group on  Artificial Intelligence Cybersecurity, has published two reports in the last two years:  Cybersecurity Challenges of Artificial Intelligence1 and Securing Machine Learning  Algorithms2.  ENISA continues its momentum with a new report on cybersecurity and privacy in forecasting  demand on electricity grids. An in-depth study of the scenario has been conducted by identifying  first the assets, the actors and their roles, relevant processes, the AI algorithms used, as well as  the requirements in terms of cybersecurity and privacy needed for it. Building upon previous  ENISA work such as the “Securing Machine Learning Algorithms” report cited above, in addition  to legislation such as GDPR and literature searches, this report has identified cybersecurity and  privacy threats and vulnerabilities that can be exploited in the examined scenario. While focus is  on ML-related threats and vulnerabilities, broader AI considerations were also taken into  account. Lastly, corresponding cybersecurity and privacy controls that consider the context of  the scenario and the impact of the associated threats/vulnerabilities were defined. The  specificities within the implementation of these controls are described, including possible trade- offs between cybersecurity, privacy, and performance. Each control is classified as a  cybersecurity control, a privacy control, or a mixture of both, depending on the threats it  mitigates and their associated impacts (cybersecurity impacts, privacy impacts, or both).  This report allows better assessment of the reality that artificial intelligence brings its own set of  threats, which consequently insists on the search for new security measures to counter them.  Finally, it should be noted that this guide strongly emphasises privacy issues in the same way  as cybersecurity issues, privacy being one of the most important challenges facing society  today. Security and privacy are intimately related, but both equally important, and a balance  must be made specific to each use. As a result, as seen in this report, efforts to optimise  security and privacy can often come at the expense of system performance.  1 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-challenges  2 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/securing-machine-learning-algorithms  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  6  1. INTRODUCTION  Abuse of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which has developed significantly in recent years, has been  identified by ENISA as one of the top emerging threats3. By providing new opportunities to solve  decision-making problems intelligently and automatically, AI is being applied to more and more  business cases in a growing number of sectors. The associated benefits are significant.  However, the development of AI is also accompanied by new threats which project teams will  have to face.  In many projects, it is apparent that these new threats are related to aspects of cybersecurity in  addition to privacy, particularly when AI is used for innovative projects whereby processing  personal data takes place. In this spirit, on 21 April 2021, the Commission published the AI Act  proposal4, which sets out requirements (including cybersecurity and privacy) for AI systems  deemed to be high-risk (e.g., used in biometric identification or critical infrastructure  management and operation) in order to mitigate threats to health, safety, and fundamental  rights.  To go further into these high-risk AI systems, ENISA proposes this new report: \"Cybersecurity  and Privacy in AI - Forecasting Demand on Electricity Grids\", which builds directly on the work  already initiated by ENISA since 2020 on the identification of risks associated with AI. This new  report analyses cybersecurity and privacy requirements and measures in use of AI in  forecasting demand on electricity grids. The report describes the scenario fundamental  principles (assets, actors processes etc.), identifies the security and privacy risks it  poses, and finally cybersecurity and privacy controls, which counteract the identified  risks.  1.1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  Findings from the ENISA’s report on securing machine learning algorithms5 indicate that there is  no uniform strategy in applying a specific set of security controls to protect machine learning  algorithms and in some cases, deployed security controls may result in trade-offs in security and  performance. ENISA therefore recommends that organisations which use AI systems should  perform detailed analysis of their own AI systems, and conduct targeted risk assessments to  find the appropriate balance between cybersecurity, privacy and performance.  The objectives of this publication are as follows:  • Provide a detailed description of a Forecasting Demand on Electricity Grids  scenario.  • Identify AI cybersecurity and privacy measures taking into account requirements,  threats and vulnerabilities defined for this scenario and practical guidance on how to  implement them.  • Provide recommendations on how to balance the trade-offs between cybersecurity,  privacy, and performance in this scenario.  The following section outlines the methodology followed in producing this report.  3 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/cybersecurity-threats-fast-forward-2030  4 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0206  5 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/securing-machine-learning-algorithms  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  7  1.2 METHODOLOGY  Production of this publication, was undertaken in three stages:  • Identify and describe in detail the forecasting demand on electricity grids scenario.  • Identify cybersecurity and privacy threats associated with the scenario.  • Identify relevant cybersecurity and privacy controls.  1.2.1 Description of the scenario  The scenario description is aligned with ENISA’s previous work on AI6,7 and provides the  following information:  • The purpose and the context  • A high-level description of the scenario, highlighting the data encountered  • The involved actors and their associated roles  • A detailed description of the data  • Machine learning algorithms  • Other assets (besides data) associated with the described scenario  • The overall process of the scenario  • Security and privacy requirements  1.2.2 Identification of cybersecurity and privacy threats and  vulnerabilities  This section of the report focusses on the threats and vulnerabilities related to use of AI in  forecasting demand on electricity grids scenario. Based on previously mentioned ENISA work,  legislation such as GDPR, and desk research, this report identified the cybersecurity and  privacy threats and vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Given the prevalence of machine  learning (ML) and ENISA’s past work on the topic, there is more emphasis placed on threats  and vulnerabilities related to ML. Nonetheless, wider considerations of AI have been taking into  account when identifying security threats and vulnerabilities as well as dedicated to privacy, for  which GDPR data protection principles8 were used as a starting point of our analysis.  1.2.3 Identification of cybersecurity and privacy controls  Following the analysis of forecasting electricity on electricity grids scenario, the identification of  threats (and their impact), and associated vulnerabilities, this section of the report presents the  corresponding cybersecurity and privacy controls that:  •  Take into account the context of the scenario  •  Take into account the security and privacy impact of the threat/vulnerabilities (as described in  this report)  The specificities of implementation of such controls are described including the possible trade- offs between cybersecurity, privacy and performance. Each control can be either a  cybersecurity control, a privacy control, or a mixture of both, depending on the threats it  mitigates and their associated impacts (cybersecurity impacts, privacy impacts, or both). Many  of the controls are of technical nature, but when appropriate (e.g., per GDPR requirements),  organizational controls have also been identified.  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  The target audience of this report can be divided into the following categories:  6 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/securing-machine-learning-algorithms  7 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-challenges  8 See Article 5 of GDPR  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  8  • All actors (private or public): to help them in their risk analysis, in the  identification of cybersecurity and privacy threats and in the identification of the  appropriate security and privacy controls to mitigate the threats related to this  scenario  • AI technical community, AI cybersecurity and privacy experts and AI  experts (designers, developers, ML experts, data scientists, etc.) with an interest  in developing secure solutions and in integrating security and privacy by design in  their solutions.  • Cybersecurity and privacy community: to help in identifying cybersecurity and  privacy threats related to forecasting demand on electricity grids scenario and in  identifying the appropriate security and privacy controls to mitigate the threats.  1.4 USING THIS DOCUMENT  Although we based the scenario close to reality, some assumptions have been to made for the  purposes of its analysis. These assumptions should be reassessed by the reader when doing  their own analysis. Please note this list is non-exhaustive:  • The algorithms chosen for the scenario are based on desk research, and there may be  other algorithms that are better suited for it.  • Regarding the privacy aspects, we put ourselves in the shoes of the data controller, but  only based on the hypothesis that we have made. It is left to the attention of the  audience that the privacy requirements as well as the control measures must always  be adapted to a context and a situation.  • After identifying potential threats, this report identifies security and privacy controls that  could be applied to the scenario. However, as is the case for any application of ML,  one must also consider traditional security standards (e.g., ISO 27001/2, NIST)  because ML applications are also subject to more global threats.  It should also be kept in mind that the elements of this report are valid as of the date of  publication, and could evolve over time.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  9  2. SCENARIO DESCRIPTION  The following figure presents an overview of the topics that will be addressed in this chapter.  Figure 1: Scenario overview  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  10  2.1 PURPOSE AND CONTEXT  Consumption and production balance is the core challenge of any smart electricity grid. This is  particularly the case since the rise of intermittent renewable energies that help to rebalance the  energy mix and reduce reliance on energy production from fossil fuels. However, the inherent  intermittence of renewable energies requires distributors to take into account precise predictions  to ensure that production is able to meet consumption, even during peak hours. Moreover, to  this day there is no way to store energy on a large scale that could allow the temporary  separation of production to meet current consumption.  For this reason, a national electricity system electricity supplier9 has defined the following  purposes:  • reduce the production of electricity from non-renewable energies (conventional power  plants, etc.),  • prioritise the consumption of electricity produced from renewable energies  (photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, etc.),  • Ensure all technical conditions for the supply of electricity, including the need to  maintain supply with fluctuating demand.  To reach these objectives, the national electricity system electricity supplier seeks to make daily  predictions on the amount of non-renewable energy production required to supplement the  amount of energy produced by renewable sources so that the total energy produced matches  the estimated consumer demand. This is done on a daily basis in three steps:  • Predict the production of renewable sources using meteorological data (history and  forecast), data from the materials (mechanical / electronical characteristics of the solar  panels and the windmills) and historical data concerning the previous power production  from power farms.  • Forecast consumption of the consumers with demographic data, calendar data  (events, holidays), and energy consumption.  • Compare predicted renewable production against consumption forecast. This provides  an important key performance indicator (KPI) for the national electricity system  electricity supplier teams to make a decision as to whether additional power plants may  be required to supplement the renewable energy, or if the energy produced by  renewable sources may be stored.  2.2 HIGH-LEVEL DESCRIPTION  The technical core of the scenario is therefore prediction, with the use of artificial intelligence  algorithms. To be more precise, machine learning is used along with the supervised learning  paradigm (e.g., multivariate regression or neural networks).  To achieve these objectives, a dataset is used, amongst which, material characteristics of solar  panels and wind turbines, weather data, energy consumption of consumers, calendar data and  demographics (regional information about the average age of the population, employment,  number of inhabitants etc.). Most of these data are obtained through public application  programming interfaces (APIs), with the remaining data already in possession of the electricity  provider. Once collected in a data lake via data engineers and network administrators, the  data must be explored and prepared. This is aimed at better understanding the data, evaluating  the quality and quantity at disposal and adopt a modelling strategy. The data scientist and  engineering teams are responsible for these steps. The electricity supplier’s teams, especially  9 In this analysis, we have assigned to one actor the roles of several actors. In many countries, there are different actors such  as: the distributed system operator, market operator, energy producers  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  11  business experts, may be required to give insights about the data collected and help decide  which strategy to choose.  Selected data are then used to create two machine learning models. A data scientist team  is responsible for this step. One model is built to determine the next day's electricity production  from renewable electricity production facilities, while the other is built to determine the next  day's electricity consumption. The two models are described in detail in 1.9. These two models  produce the following outputs:  • a daily prediction of the renewable energy production  • a daily energy consumption of facilities (inhabitants, industrials etc.)  At the end of the prediction processes, predictions are fed back into a dashboard tool used by  the electricity provider teams to adjust their power procurement decisions.  The following sections aim to detail such scenario by describing actors and their roles, data  processed, the assets that allow the project to exist, the explanation of the scenario lifecycle,  and the privacy and cybersecurity requirements applied to it.  Figure 2: High-level description  2.3 ACTORS AND ROLES  The following actors are involved in the forecasting demand on electricity grids scenario.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  12  Figure 3: Actors, roles, and their description  Actor Role Description  Electricity supplier’s  teams  End Users and Data  Owner (Data  Controller)  Electricity System Electricity supplier’s teams oversee controlling the electricity  supply so that it is optimal at all times, knowing that energy not consumed is  energy wasted. In this scenario, the team interprets the model’s results,  provides requirements to data scientists, and has control over the solar and  wind infrastructure that provides data inputs into the model.10  Electricity consumers Data Provider  Electricity consumers are indirect participants. Their electricity consumption,  whether individual or not, is reported through the network of electricity meters,  energy suppliers, etc.  Open-data providers Data Provider  Open data providers are an external entity providing open-data, including  demographics, and weather forecasts of solar irradiance, cloud cover and wind  speed, amongst other metrics.  Data scientists Data scientist  Data scientists are the spearhead of the algorithms. They oversee cleaning  and preparing of the data, building the models and ensuring the relevance of  the results. They work with the Electricity Distribution Electricity supplier’s  teams to build a relevant model.  Developers and Data  Engineers  Developers and  Data Engineers  Developers and Data Engineers are responsible for routing data,  transformation, production environments and other technical operations as  required.  System and  communication  network administrators  Network  administrators  System and communication network’s administrator are responsible for the  installation and the maintenance of digital systems supporting the machine  learning application, including network (flows etc.) and hosting of on-premises  servers that make the application work.  2.4 PROCESSED DATA  As previously mentioned, there are two models, and each uses separate data. It should also be  noted that the output data of one model (predicted data) becomes the input data of the same  model the next day.  Figure 4: Data needed to build the model and input data that the model will use for the  electricity production from renewable energies  10 Usually, these renewable sources are dispatched by the system operator.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  13  Data Data type Source / data provider Data Procurement  Model ‘s input data  Material characteristics  of renewable electricity  production means (e.g.,  photovoltaic panels,  wind turbines)  Structured  data  Owners of the renewable  electricity production means, i.e.,  the electricity system  electricity supplier  These data can be obtained from the results  of the regular maintenance of the electricity  supplier’s equipment.

For instance, the  INSEE12 provide the number of  inhabitants and their repartition for  several geographical scales in France.  The difficulty is to determine which data  are impactful to avoid the model  becoming over-parameterised.  Calendar (calendar of  events, holydays... to  help predict times of  the year when  consumption is high  or lower than  average)  Structured  data Open-data provider  These data are public and can be found  in open data platforms. The difficulty is to  determine which data are impactful to  avoid the model becoming over- parameterised. This information can be  found and must be expressed in a way  that the system can understand13.  Current daily energy  consumption Time series  Consumers’ (including  industrials, municipalities, and  individuals) smart meters  belonging to the electricity  system electricity suppliers.  These smart meters provide  surname, first name, address,  meter number, telephone  number, and electricity  consumption.14  The electricity supplier can collect the  energy data from smart meters installed  at the consumers’ site. Smart meter data  is sent to a concentrator, located at a  secondary substation (medium voltage -  low voltage) where all data from all the  individuals are gathered15.

Smart  meter data is sent to a concentrator,  located at a secondary substation  (medium voltage - low voltage) where all  data from all the individuals are  gathered17.  2.5 MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS  The following algorithms are used in our scenario. The first algorithm (RNN) is used to forecast  the daily production of electricity from renewable energies. The second algorithm (SARIMAX) is  used to forecast the daily consumer demand.  Figure 6: Machine learning algorithms used  Learning paradigm Subtype Algorithm Type of data ingested Description  Supervised Learning Regression RNN Time series  A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a  class of artificial neural networks where  connections between nodes form a  directed graph along a temporal  sequence. This allows it to exhibit  temporal dynamic behaviour18 19 20.  Supervised Learning Regression SARIMAX  Time series  Structured Data  Given a time series, the ARIMA model is  a tool to understand and predict the  future values of this series. The model is  composed of two parts: an  autoregressive part (AR) and a moving  average part (MA). A SARIMAX  algorithm has additional seasonality  modelling (S) and exogenous variables  (X) in the model18 19 20.  2.6 ASSETS  In addition to the previously described data, the scenario is supported by the following additional  assets.  16 As we will see, the output training data comes from personal data sources. However, once the model is in production, it  only predicts the overall energy consumption.  17 See https://api.meteo-concept.com/documentation_openapi  18 Neda Tavakoli; Sima Siami-Namini; Akbar Siami Namin.

To carry out this scenario, electricity supplier’s teams, data scientists, data engineers and the  system administrator work together to understand the final objectives and define the needs.  In the following paragraphs, the scenario is described by incorporating it into the different stages  of the machine learning lifecycle:  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  16  Data collection  The first step is to determine how to obtain the needed data and how to incorporate it in the  model. Data engineers/developers and network administrators route the data used in the  models. The former to format it, to know where to retrieve it, to validate its quality and the latter  to build the necessary flows as these data are routed through various channels (public APIs,  individual consumer meters provided by the electric company). Of course, even once in  production, the data must be routed to the models to make their predictions. Data are routed to  an existing on-premises (belonging to the electricity supplier) data lake, which is a set of servers  and resources specifically designed to store and orchestrate the data, and to define a set of  data tables.  Most of these data (material characteristics, and production history) are owned by the  electricity supplier. The electricity supplier can collect this data since it knows the amount of  equipment at its disposal, the state of these facilities, and its production history. To carry out its  project, the electricity supplier collects the data it needs from the results of the regular  maintenance of its equipment and from its production history. As mentioned earlier, weather  data has an important part to play in this scenario. It greatly influences the amount of electricity  produced by renewable energies. The prediction of these data is the expertise of the  meteorological services. The latter make these data accessible through APIs that they  provide and maintain. This data is considered as open-data and is therefore non- proprietary and free to use. The electricity supplier collects this data using the APIs made  available.  An important source of data collected is the electricity consumption of the inhabitants. The  consumption data is considered personal data because it includes personal information such as  name, surname, address, smart meter number and phone number of account holder in addition  to the consumption. The electricity supplier collects their electricity consumption from  smart meters installed locally at the consumers' place21. By default, only the daily  consumption data (global consumption of the household over a day) is collected to allow the  consumers to consult the history of his consumption free of charge. However, smart meters can  collect more detailed consumption information. This detailed consumption information is the  hourly or half-hourly consumption data. The collection of this detailed consumption data is not  automatic. The electricity supplier does not collect detailed consumption data for all households  by default, however these may be collected with the user's consent.  This data then passes through the Electricity supplier’s electrical grid - PLC to a concentrator  located at a secondary sub-station (medium voltage - low voltage). Once this information arrives  at the concentrator, a first processing is done by data engineers. To protect this personal data,  in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the data engineer must  filter the data so that it cannot be used to directly identify individual consumers.  This includes:  • the name of the person  • the address of the person  • the meter number of the person  • the phone number of the person  It is also worth noting that smart meters have geolocation, and such information could be used  to track the location of consumers living in low density areas. To circumvent this risk, the  electricity supplier collects data in areas with a large number of households22.  The default or detailed consumption values (if the consumer has agreed to share this  information for the purpose of the processing) are kept and then aggregated (i.e.,  summed with all other consumption data) in a large consumption database maintained by  21 See https://www.cnil.fr/fr/linky-gazpar-quelles-donnees-sont-collectees-et-transmises-par-les-compteurs-communicants  22 See https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/5935825/KS-GQ-13-003-EN.PDF/baa96509-3f4b-4c7a-94dd-  feb1a31c7291  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  17  the electricity supplier. This aggregated data does not allow for the retrieval of consumer  data. It is therefore anonymised data.  In addition, open data are also used in this prediction stage. This includes statistical data related  to the size of the population present in the area (demographics), and the calendar of events  and holidays, specific to the residents to help to predict times of the year when consumption is  high or below average. Demographics can be provided by several APIs and calendars are  public, allowing them to be manually located.  Data cleaning and data pre-processing  From there, data scientists use various tools ranging from on-premises servers (to perform  calculations) to programming interfaces on their workstations which call upon data science  libraries. These tools allow the data scientists to work with the data and build models. The  collected data is cleaned (i.e., ensuring that the data collected is of high quality and  exploitable by the model) by data scientists for pre-processing23.  The pre-processing phase consists first of filling the not available (NA) values (interpolation,  average, median, etc.) before encoding the categorical variables into numerical values. Finally,  it is ensured that time scales are appropriate for the problem at hand (if it is desired for  predictions to be made for every hour of the day, data must be scaled to the hour). Moreover,  for both models’ needs, structured data are converted into time series where possible, keeping  in mind the static nature of some variables, such as material characteristics, which are constant  over time.  Model design and implementation  Once the data pre-processing done, the types of models to be built must be selected. The  models selected are the following:  • A Recurrent Neuronal Network (RNN): to forecast the daily production of electricity  from renewable energies.  o This model was selected because of the known efficiency of these recurrent  networks to make predictions for sequential data such as text, sound, or time  series. Several papers18 19 20 24 25 mention different experiments in which  RNN, and in particular Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are efficient in  forecasting electricity production.  • A Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous  variables (SARIMAX): to forecast consumers’ demand.  o Auto-regressive models are very efficient for modelling a temporal  phenomenon. Publications26 27 expose the benefits of using SARIMAX  models to forecast electricity consumption. This approach was chosen  because consumer consumption prediction is less complex than  meteorological forecasting or production forecasting, and seasonality and  impacts of contrasting events such as weekends vs weekdays can be  anticipated. This model does not necessarily need a neural network, which  can be harder to build and heavier to put in production.  23 Brownlee, Jason.

Forecasting Electricity Consumption Using SARIMA Method in IBM SPSS Software. 2019.  https://www.hrpub.org/journals/article_info.php?aid=8614  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  18  For the prediction of consumer demand, the model's parameters are determined by statistical  tests and analysis of the time series for the SARIMAX algorithm.  The characteristics of the RNN input layer (e.g., batch size, time step, number of  sequences/features) are defined. The output of the RNN consists of a real value corresponding  to the consumer’s consumption for the next day.  Model training, model testing and optimisation  During the training method phase, model training is realised on-premises. The data is  prepared to the same scale at which predictions are to be made. For our scenario, predictions  will be made at the hourly level. During the training phase, data scientists collaborate with data  engineers and the electricity supplier to improve their understanding of the data. The data is  then divided in different categories for the needs of machine learning, 70% is used for training,  15% for validation and 15% for testing28.  Once the data is prepared, the data scientists choose and elaborate the models which will learn  from the inputted data. In our case, two models are elaborated: the first to predict renewable  energy production of the next day, the other to predict electricity consumption of the next day.  The prediction of energy production from renewable energies is highly dependent on the  weather and the environment in general. To be prepared for any eventuality, the electricity  supplier must also train the model for extreme weather conditions.  Model Evaluation  To evaluate the model, metrics including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error  (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are considered.  Model Deployment  Finally, the model deployment is done on-premises and the model can be used to predict the  future values using new data.  Once the model is ready, the data scientists, data engineers and network teams work together  to industrialise the model. It is not only the model that is put to production, but all the pipeline  work, from pre-processing the data to model evaluation.  Deploying the environments necessary for its proper functioning: a pre-production environment  for the model testing phases in real conditions and a production environment for later.  Technically, this consists in creating flows:  • between the data lake and the servers where the model is hosted with the data  displayed earlier,  • between the model servers and the existing dashboarding tool with only the prediction  results.  When the pre-production environment is stable, the model is put into production and it can be  used through the dashboarding tool. From there, operation teams can now use the dashboard  tool to adjust their power procurement decisions. The dashboard allows for a comparison of the  results of the two predictions from the separate models and provides key performance  indicators (KPIs) that help operation teams decide for the next day whether certain power plants  should be turned on or whether energy generated from renewable sources can be stored.

CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  19  When monitoring, performance is measured every time that new data is acquired, comparing  predictions to real data. Data engineers / scientists oversee monitoring of the models in addition  to the distribution of the acquired data to infer any potential drift. As the scenario here has an  impact on critical infrastructure, there cannot afford to be any underperforming results, even for  a short period of time. Considering this, as predictions are made daily, it is reasonable to action  weekly re-training of the models. Scheduling of model training processes on a weekly basis is  done using a job scheduler. All processing pipeline and model training is automated. Through  these automated tests and model evaluation, the model is continuously integrated into the  production environment.

The following table summarises the cybersecurity  requirements.  Figure 9: Cybersecurity requirements  Level Explanation  Availability Low  Predictions made by the model are made every day. An unavailability  during half a week would be tolerable as old processes could be  reused until the application is back in service. Longer unavailability  would be too time consuming for the Electricity supplier.  Integrity Critical  Data, whether used for training or made by the model, must be  accurate with a high level of quality at all steps of the lifecycle. The  alteration of the manipulated data can cause a very large imbalance  between the different means of energy production (non-renewable and  renewable). Moreover, a poorly trained model could cause an  underproduction or an overproduction of energies with very non- negligible consequences.  Confidentiality Critical  Not all data is confidential, as some exists in the public domain.  However, consumption information of individuals used in the context of  our scenario include personal data (upstream of the concentrator).  This data is confidential and could highlight the behaviour of individuals  whose information is retrieved.  Traceability High  Actions linked to the process must be logged (traced and dated) to  enable full traceability of changes made to the algorithm. As personal  data is used in the process, actions linked must be imputable. i.e. all  actions must be traced (even consultation actions) and attributable  without possibility of repudiation.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  21  Privacy requirements  The energy consumption of individuals, which contains personal data (name, address, phone  number, etc.) is collected through smart meters. This data is processed in a concentrator so that  only aggregated daily consumption values are routed to the data lake. This means there is no  longer any personal data in the data lake because the sum of the data consumption of a  concentrator does not permit individual consumption to be recognised. In this step it is crucial  that this transformation from personal data to anonymised data is performed recognising the  goals identified of the WP29 guidelines on anonymisation techniques (i.e., avoiding singling out,  likability and inference)29.  It is important to note that the billing functions are not considered in our case, this topic  being out of scope.  Because our scenario handles personal data in the data collection phase, it is subject to  the GDPR. The following data protection requirements and recommendations should be  satisfied.  Figure 10: Data protection principles  Requirements Explanation  Lawfulness,  fairness, and  transparency30  Personal data collected (both in training and in production) in the purpose of the scenario must be processed  lawfully.  That is, the data processing must be based on one of the legal bases provided by Article 6 of GDPR. In addition,  individuals' personal data must be processed only in the way they reasonably expect, and any unexpected but  justified processing must be clearly explained. Data processing must also comply with the transparency  requirements.  Lawfulness: for the specificities of this scenario, and as explained in its description, if the electricity supplier  wants to extract the detailed consumption data of the users (consumption per hour or half hour), the electricity  supplier must obtain the consent of the consumers31. If the user does not consent to the retrieval of this hourly  or half-hourly consumption data, the electricity supplier may retrieve his daily consumption data for legitimate  interest. The electricity supplier has a legitimate interest in at least retrieving consumers' daily consumption  data. Without this data, the prediction of the users' energy demand is impossible.  Fairness: even if the electricity supplier demonstrates that the data processing has a legal basis, it must only  process personal data in line with consumers reasonable expectations, i.e., for the prediction of energy  demand, and not use it in a way that has an unjustified negative effect on them.  Transparency: the electricity supplier must also be transparent with consumers and clearly inform how and  why their personal data are used throughout the machine learning lifecycle (for instance as part of the  consumer agreement).  Purpose  limitation  Personal data collected (both in training and in production) needs to be processed for specific, explicit, and  legitimate purposes and is not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. This  means that the energy consumption collected and processed should only be used to predict the energy  demand.  Data  minimisation  Personal data collected (both in training and in production) needs to be adequate, relevant, and limited to what  is necessary in relation to the purpose of predicting energy consumption demand by using Machine Learning.  The electricity supplier should justify the data to be used and should indicate the procedures in place to ensure  that only essential data such as electricity consumption is processed for this purpose.  29 See https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp216_en.pdf  30 The choice of a legal basis is final, and a treatment cannot involve two legal bases. However, in our case, as explained in  the body of the report, two treatments are made: a treatment based on the fact that the data is extracted daily and a  treatment based on the fact that the data is extracted every hour or half hour. Depending on which of the two treatments  is accepted by the consumers, a corresponding legal basis will be chosen.  31 See https://www.cnil.fr/fr/linky-gazpar-quelles-donnees-sont-collectees-et-transmises-par-les-compteurs-communicants  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  22  Accuracy  Personal data collected (both in training and in production) must be accurate and kept up to date. The electricity  supplier, from the collection phase to the production phase, should put in place all appropriate measures to  promote data accuracy such as keeping the data up to date and ensuring that they remain correct. For  example, putting in place a clear and straightforward process for consumers to update their addresses so that  consumption data are always associated with the right locations.  Storage  limitation  Personal data collected (both in training and in production) must be kept in a form which permits identification  of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.  Specifically, in our case, the personal data collected is anonymised before exiting the concentrator.  Security of  personal data  (Integrity and  Confidentiality)  Personal data collected (both in training and in production) must be processed in a manner that ensures  appropriate security, in particular integrity and confidentiality of the data. In our case, the risks from data  corruption are minimal for consumers (as a reminder, billing data is not in scope of our scenario), and we  consider that the data extracted by the smart meter has no other purpose than the prediction of the energy  demand). On the other hand, the electricity supplier must put in place adequate security measures to ensure  the confidentiality of the data, as the leakage of the latter can indicate the user's habits.  As a complement to the GDPR data protection principles listed above, other key privacy topics  related to AI systems need to be addressed (some of which are specifically mentioned by  national data protection supervisory authorities)32:  Figure 11: Data protection supervisory authorities’ recommendations for AI systems  Recommendations Explanation  Database creation  During the collection phase, the data passing through the electricity supplier network to the concentrator  are personal data. A process aiming at deleting direct identifier and aggregate the consumption between  all the consumer is made at the level of the concentrator. However, before this processing, data are stored  in the database of the concentrator. The electricity supplier must ensure that only duly authorised persons  have access to this data and prevent data loss. The electricity supplier must also ensure that only the  right data (energy consumption) are injected into the concentrator.  Compliance of the  training model  (i.e., before  production)  The electricity supplier must justify that the data it collects, the tools it uses and the training model it has  chosen to achieve its objectives is relevant and free from bias. The electricity supplier must ensure that  before the system is put into production, appropriate steps are taken to prevent discrimination and that a  human electricity supplier can verify the quality of the algorithm's outputs.  Finally, the project requires a data protection impact assessment33 as it completes at least one  criterion in the following table34:  Figure 12: Is a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) necessary?  Criteria Does it match the criteria? Justification  Evaluation or scoring  Automated decision making with legal or  similar significant effect  Systematic monitoring X  The processing is not intended to do this.  Nevertheless, the data collected may  allow to determine whether a person is  present at home during certain time  periods.  32 See https://www.cnil.fr/fr/intelligence-artificielle/la-cnil-publie-ressources-grand-public-professionnels  33 See https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-  gdpr/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact- assessments/#:~:text=DPIAs%20are%20a%20legal%20requirement,trust%20and%20engagement%20with%20indivi duals  34  The condition for a DPIA to occur is that at least two conditions are satisfied.

Matching or combining datasets  Data concerning vulnerable data subjects  Innovative use or applying new  technological or organizational solutions X  The use of artificial intelligence in this  scenario: predicting energy production  capacity and demand is innovative.  Preventing data subjects from exercising  a right or using a service or contract  To assess the risks in terms of privacy, personal data processing must consider the following  requirements:  Figure 13: Privacy requirements regarding data  Level Explanation  Availability Low The data, for the user, does not necessarily have to be available. An  unavailability of several days is acceptable.  Integrity Low  The output data of the concentrator is not considered as personal data.  Indeed, at the concentrator output, it is the sum of the consumption data  (from pseudonymised individual consumption data) that is transmitted  to the data scientists. The alteration of this data has no influence on the  users, such as a more expensive billing.  Confidentiality Critical  The personal data processed, in particular the detailed (hourly), is  confidential. The leakage of such data (possible upstream of the  concentrator) would be detrimental to the consumer since it would leak  his address for instance. Moreover, in case of data leakage from smart  meters, it is possible to know the life habits of consumers and when they  are present (high consumption) and when they are absent (low  consumption) from home.  Traceability High  At a minimum, the actions related to the process must be recorded  (traced and dated) to be able to follow the actors involved during the  stages of use of personal data (upstream of the concentrator).  Particularly in the case of court cases, it is necessary to be able to  attribute actions to an individual and to be able to impute them  criminally.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  24  3. SECURITY AND PRIVACY  THREATS AND  VULNERABILITIES  3.1 THREAT CONTEXTUALISATION  This section highlights the threats applicable in the forecasting demand on electricity grids  scenario. Examples in the context of this scenario are also provided. Also outlined are the  impacts that each threat can have in terms of security and privacy as well as their severity in the  table.  There are two major feared events to consider for our scenario which are the loss of integrity of  the data, and the loss of confidentiality of the detailed electricity consumption of inhabitant data.  The loss of integrity of the data could lead to an electrical production disruption. Indeed, the  impact would be maximum if too little energy was produced, and there was insufficient energy  supplied to meet demand. It should be noted, however, that the impact is lessened because the  model only assists and does not make decisions directly. Decision-makers have other indicators  with them to make decisions (minimum value of energy to be produced etc.).  For the company, the loss of confidentiality of the detailed consumption of inhabitant data could  lead to reputation degradation, which can result in loss of trust of the consumer.  For the consumers, the loss of confidentiality of the detailed consumption could have 2 impacts.  First, stolen personal data (home address, for example) could be used to perform phishing  attempts or targeted advertising. Also, if detailed consumption of an inhabitant (either hourly  or half hourly) were to leak, people would be able to identify whether the inhabitant is at home or  not, and it could lead, depending on the case, to unwanted consequences such as robbery (a  burglar might determine the hours at which a person is not a home using his energy  consumption data), separation/divorce (much like phone bills or credit card details might  contain data that the person would consider private, even from his or her spouse), or job loss  (in the case where an employer uses energy consumption data ).  Moreover, non-compliance with certain privacy requirements by the electricity supplier can lead  to impacts on the user such as the significant feeling of invasion of privacy, feeling out of  control of their personal data, or change in energy consumption billing if the data is  processed for other purposes, besides the directly related with this case.  Considering these feared events and associated impacts, the following threats are associated  with our scenario.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  25  Before going into the details of the threats and vulnerabilities to which this scenario is subject,  the following figure summarises all the threats that will be explained subsequently:  Figure 14: Summary of threats and vulnerabilities  3.1.1 Compromise of ML application components  An external attacker can directly compromise smart meters, the concentrator, or the API to  retrieve weather or demographic data if they are exposed. If one of these components is  compromised, the manipulated data can be modified, leading to an electrical production  disruption.  Data scientists, developers and the various stakeholders involved could have their workstations  compromised by an external attacker (directly by using insecure code libraries, for example)  which could compromise the ML components. The attacker would then be able either to modify  the manipulated data, leading to an electrical production disruption, or steal confidential data  (detailed consumption of inhabitant), leading to reputation degradation for the company,  significant feeling of invasion of privacy, phishing attempts, or targeted advertising or  even robbery, separation/divorce, or job loss for the consumers.  3.1.2 Poisoning  During the data collection phase, an external attacker or a malicious user could compromise  one or more smart meters (via a worm for instance) to create outliers which would then  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  26  constitute historical consumption data. Once the model used to predict the next day  consumption has been trained with such data, it could overestimate electricity consumption,  leading to an electrical production disruption.  In this idea of data modification and after having collected the data, any attacker with sufficient  rights and access to the data lake could modify the training data to make the model operate with  undesired characteristics, and could even render the model dysfunctional. This could lead to an  electrical production disruption.  3.1.3 Human error  A data engineer could route the consumption data from the concentrator to the data lake without  aggregating and anonymising it. Such a threat could lead to a potential data disclosure which  could entail reputation degradation for the company, a significant feeling of invasion of  privacy, phishing attempts, or targeted advertising or even robbery, separation/divorce,  or job loss for the consumers.  3.1.4 Data disclosure  Throughout the scenario lifecycle, an attacker can try to compromise the concentrator to collect  stored personal data relating to energy consumption, even where there is no data retention after  sending the aggregated data to the data lake. This can be done by physical tampering with the  concentrator, or by exploiting vulnerabilities through access to the electricity supplier's electrical  network via its smart meters. Resultingly, an attacker with multiple smart meters connected to  the electricity supplier’s electrical grid could directly attack other smart meters on the same  network to collect consumption data.  For the company, these data leaks can lead to reputation degradation. For the electricity  consumers, they can lead to significant feeling of invasion of privacy, phishing attempts,  targeted advertising, or even robbery, separation, or divorce and/or job loss.  3.1.5 Unlawful Processing  There are two cases where two different legal bases should be applied. First, when the  electricity supplier wishes to extract the energy consumption of the inhabitants on an hourly or  half-hourly basis, it should ask for the users' consent, and proceed to process only when this  consent has been given freely, clearly, specifically and knowingly by the user. Second, in the  case of daily extraction, the electricity supplier extracts the consumption data based on  legitimate interest.  In the case where the electricity supplier was to collect data on an hourly or half-hourly basis  without having obtained the user’s prior consent beforehand (or otherwise offering opportunity  to withdraw consent), the impact on consumers would be a significant sense of invasion of  privacy. Their data extracted without their consent would lead to a total lack of trust in the  electricity supplier. In addition, the legitimate interest in the day-to-day processing of consumer  data may not be adequately justified by the electricity supplier or worse, no justification may be  provided. In this scenario, users may question the purpose of the use of their personal data and  feel a significant feeling of invasion of privacy.  3.1.6 Unfair processing  Even if the electricity supplier demonstrates that the data processing has a lawful basis  (depending on the level of data extraction: daily or hourly), it might not process the personal  data in the way consumers expect it to be i.e. for energy demand forecasting only. They could  use it in a way that has an unjustified negative effect on them, such as unknowingly changing  their billing based on consumption forecasts made by the algorithm.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  27  3.1.7 Lack of transparency  The electricity supplier may also not be transparent with users about how their personal data is  used and the goal of the use of their data. The terms governing these aspects may not be  included or may be deliberately omitted by the electricity supplier in, for example, the contract  with its customers. The impact this could have on consumers could result in a feeling of being  not in control of personal data.  3.1.8 Diversion of purpose  The user data extracted in our case is intended to predict consumer energy demand. However,  the electricity supplier may not respect this principle and use the consumer data for ambiguous  and non-explicit purposes unrelated to the prediction of energy demand, such as using their  data to offer other services or to resell them. For instance, users might be profiled based on  their energy consumption and could receive targeted advertisements. Using this data to learn  about users' routines and habits could be considered a serious invasion of users' privacy. In the  wrong hands, this data could even be used against the physical security of consumers.  An even more extreme diversion from the purpose of this information collection could facilitate  the surveillance of users; the person in possession of the model and the data could examine the  habits of the users to work out whether or not the consumer is at home. The impact this could  have on consumers could lead to robbery, or separation/divorce, or job loss.  3.1.9 No respect of data minimisation  This could materialise in the form of collecting more data than necessary at the smart meter  level or by using more data than necessary at the hub level. For instance, smart meters could  collect much more accurate data such as real-time consumption that can be used to track the  consumer. The impact this could have on consumers could lead to a significant feeling of  invasion of privacy, separation/divorce, job loss in case of data leakage or to potential  phishing attempts, targeted advertising, or even robbery.  3.1.10 No respect of storage limitation  Data extracted from smart meters of individual households are routed to the concentrator level  and amalgamated. This means that no household specific data should be stored after  amalgamation. Without clear rules for storing and removing personal data at the concentrator  level, the electricity supplier could decide to store user data in the concentrator database for  several months when it is not operationally justified. If this data were to be stolen or leaked, the  impact to the user could be separation/divorce, job loss, potential phishing attempts,  targeted advertising, or even robbery.  3.1.11 Synthesis of possible impacts and associated threats  The following table sums up the severity of each impact and the associated threats.

However, this is not necessarily  the case. We therefore draw the reader's attention to this point.

CYBERSECURITY AND  PRIVACY CONTROLS  Before expanding on the details of the cybersecurity and privacy controls applied to the  scenario, the following figure summarizes all the controls that will be described:  Figure 17: Summary of cybersecurity and privacy controls  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  34  4.1 IMPLEMENT A SECURITY BY DESIGN PROCESS  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity Lack of Security by Design  • Compromise of ML application  components  • Poisoning  • Human error  • Data disclosure  By default, Security by Design is a methodology to strengthen the cybersecurity of the  organisation by automating its data security controls and developing a robust IT infrastructure.  This approach focuses on implementing the security protocols from the basic building blocks of  the entire IT infrastructure design. The goal of this control is to ensure that risks are identified as  early as possible, mitigated before systems go live, and appropriate security controls are  implemented.  The lack of Security by Design increases the likelihood of all threats related to our case.  Therefore, the electricity supplier must ensure, from the development phase, to put in place  adequate controls to limit the cybersecurity risk. This starts with a global risk analysis in which  all risks associated with all assets are identified. In our case, the electricity supplier will try to  reduce the attack surface (for example by updating the smart meters' operating system  continuously), to apply the principle of least privilege (by implementing access rights  management), to take care of the confidentiality and integrity of the collected data (by  encrypting the users' consumption data for example).  Conceiving a project following a Security by Design methodology requires less effort than  adding security on top of an existing project. However, there could be an impact on the  functionality of the use if the outcome of the Security by Design methodology would lead to  some functionality not being implemented due to the security risk it generates (e.g., installation  of unsecure smart meters).  4.2 DOCUMENT THE ELECTRICAL FORECAST SYSTEM  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity  & Privacy  Lack of Electrical forecast system documentation  • Human error  • Unlawful processing  • Unfair processing  • Lack of transparency  • Diversion of purpose  • No respect of data minimisation  • No respect of storage limitation  Project and system documentation must be produced to preserve knowledge on decisions  made during the project phase, application architecture, configuration, maintenance, ability to  maintain effectiveness over time, and assumptions made about the model’s use.  The system is complex with multiple assets (Open-Data provider, smart meters, concentrator,  etc.) which enhance the fact that an exhaustive documentation is mandatory for all assets. This  documentation should also include the changes that will be applied, including to the  documentation throughout the system life cycle.  Therefore, it is necessary that the Open-Data Provider, Data Scientists, Developers, Data  Engineers, and System and communication network administrators work together to create and  sustain the documentation.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  35  This control does not impact system performance, cybersecurity, or privacy.  4.3 CHECK THE VULNERABILITIES OF THE ML COMPONENTS AND  IMPLEMENT PROCESSES TO MAINTAIN THEIR SECURITY LEVELS  OVER TIME  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity  & Privacy  • Use of vulnerable components  • Lack of security process to maintain a  good security level of the components of  the Electrical forecast system  • Compromise of ML application  components  • Data disclosure  For smart meters and the concentrator, it is necessary for the company to ensure that regular  security audits are carried out to ensure there are no vulnerabilities. Regular vulnerability scans  and automatic patch management processes should also be implemented to maintain a good  security level. Preparation of a remediation plan that can be implemented quickly must be  committed to, with the capacity to review this plan over time.  One differentiating factor for smart meters is that they can be considered as IoT devices, for  which audits need specific expertise. Although these devices are connected to the network as  regular devices, they also have an interface with the physical world. In our case, smart meters  interface with the consumer’s electrical system, which could be a source of vulnerability.  For Open-Data provider APIs, it is necessary to define a process to ensure that the level of  Open-Data provider security is sufficient over time to avoid data recovery. This could mean an  annual audit of the APIs and the completion of an annual security questionnaire.  This control would have an impact on the availability of the system, and thus its performance, as  it may be audited or updated. This could lead to periodic unavailability of the system for several  hours at a time. However, as the availability need of the system is low, the impact of this control  is only moderate.  Moreover, updates could cause the system to malfunction, leading to errors in the prediction  systems that could have a major impact.  4.4 CHOOSE AND DEFINE A MORE RESILIENT MODEL DESIGN  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity Model easy to poison Poisoning  Poisoning of the model could cause electrical production disruption, which would have a high  impact for the company. For this reason, the company needs to ensure that the model is fully  resilient against this type of attack.  For the electrical forecast system, a methodology to harden the system against poisoning  threats could be use of the “Bagging” (bootstrap aggregating) technique37. This is a machine  learning ensemble meta-algorithm designed to improve the stability and accuracy of machine  learning algorithms, which combines several versions of the model (e.g., models trained with  37 https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.695.4667&rep=rep1&type=pdf  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  36  different datasets) to limit the impacts related to the poisoning of one of the models. In this case,  the company could generate multiple models from different data sets (weather data and  consumption of each different years for example) and use a Bagging algorithm with these  models to predict the consumption of electricity. If an attacker were to succeed in poisoning one  of the models, the effect on the outputs of the system would be greatly reduced, or even  mitigated completely, due to the prediction also relying on the other healthy models.  This could have an impact on performance of the model as the most representative data is from  the most recent year, and using data from previous years would make the prediction less  accurate.  4.5 INTEGRATE POISONING CONTROL IN THE TRAINING DATASET  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity  • No detection of  poisoned samples in  the training dataset  • Lack of control for  poisoning  Poisoning  In addition to the previous control, and to reduce to a minimum the probability of the models  being poisoned, the training dataset should be checked for poisoning.  The RNN algorithm used in our scenario can be checked for poisoning using the STRIP  technique. This principle relies on disturbing the inputs and observing the randomness of the  predictions. For example, the company could change 1 week of weather data, replacing  summer data with winter data, and observe the variance in predictions versus unperturbed.  Without high variance, the model could be considered as poisoned. These tests should be  performed before the production phase, during the training phase, ensuring that the models  used in production are healthy.  This control doesn't have impact on system performance, cybersecurity, or privacy.  4.6 ENLARGE THE TRAINING DATASET  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity Lack of data for increasing robustness to  poisoning  Poisoning  Large timeframes (multiple years) of weather data can be collected and used to train the  algorithm to prevent it being susceptible to poisoning attacks. Modifying small amount of  weather data would then have a low impact of the overall prediction.  Using large timeframes (multiple years) of inhabitant consumption data could also reduce the  probability that poising attacks on this data could impact the prediction. This could still have an  impact on the model accuracy, considering that weather systems can shift over long timeframes  too, but considering the high impact of disruption to electrical production, this control should still  be implemented. Long timeframes of consumption data would not impact consumer privacy as  any stored data would be the anonymised after the concentrator.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  37  4.7 SECURE THE TRANSIT OF THE COLLECTED DATA  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity Poor data management Poisoning  Considering the possible impacts of Poisoning, the transit of the collected data should be fully  protected against a loss of integrity. Within the collection phase of weather data or inhabitant  consumption data, the electrical company should ensure that protocols used for the transfer of  data are encrypted and otherwise state of the art (without any known vulnerabilities), such as  TLS 1.3. As such, an attacker would not be able to modify the data during transit, and would not  be able to poison the model through that route.  Generally, Open-Data suppliers comply with this level of requirement. This control would not  impact on privacy or performance of the system.  4.8 CONTROL ALL DATA USED BY THE ML MODEL  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity Use of uncontrolled data Poisoning  Considering the high impacts of Poisoning attacks, several means to control the data must be  applied, some specific to data science and others more to business- common-practice. These  techniques can be applied at the concentrator level and then in the data lake. At the  concentrator level, the incoming data is not yet aggregated, so an initial check can be carried  out to avoid inconsistent data.  There are two common cases of inconsistent data – inconsistency of data type (e.g.,  alphanumeric vs number) and inconsistency of data value. To prevent this, checks should be  performed for the two different cases. An example of an inconsistent value would be to  determine whether a consumption figure is abnormally high in relation to previous data, contract  data, data from other consumers. Once abnormal data is detected, it can be readjusted before  following the data aggregation procedure to the data lake.  At the data lake level, more controls can be carried out:  • Non-technical checks such as checking the overall consistency of the data (for  example checking variability of the weather data)  • Technical checks specific to data science and the data sanitisation process to detect  possible anomalies (otherwise known as outlier detection).  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  38  This control could add latency to the system in case of many reported anomalies on the data.  But our scenario does not have a strong need for availability, and the control is important to  reduce the probability of model poisoning.  The checks that are applied at the concentrator level could have an impact on privacy, because  they would manipulate personal data from consumers. To remediate, the systems (software,  scripts, excel sheets, etc.) used to perform these checks should be regularly audited,  documented, secured by design, and follow access control rules (authentication to use the  system, proper access management, etc.).  4.9 ENSURE RELIABLE SOURCES ARE USED  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity  Use of unsafe data or models (e.g., with transfer  learning)  Poisoning  Considering the possible disruption of electrical production due to poisoning attacks, it is  mandatory for the company to ensure the reliability of the sources used to collect the data. For  weather and demographic data, which is collected from an Open-Data Provider, this should be  of a reliable standard, ideally audited once a year to ensure that it doesn’t have any vulnerability  that could lead to a loss of integrity of the data.  Moreover, and considering the criticality of the  poisoning threat, the data can be crossed between several sources to reduce the impact when  one of the sources is compromised.  However, crossing data from multiple sources could introduce errors within the data set which  could alter the model and its performance. Our scenario does not have a strong need for  availability.  4.10 IMPLEMENT ACCESS RIGHT MANAGEMENT PROCESS  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity  & Privacy  Poor access rights management  • Compromise of ML application  components  • Poisoning  • Data disclosure  • Human error  Threats related to poor access rights management, such as data disclosure, can have a high  impact on the company (electrical production disruption) or on the consumers (robbery,  separation/divorce or job loss). This security measure defines and assigns roles to users,  respecting the principle of least privilege, and limits the access scenarios for processes and  assets only to those for which the users have a justified reason.  For all the classical systems of our scenario, such as Concentrator, Data lake, Model server,  Dashboard tools, and Integrated Development Environment, it is essential to create roles for  each user group with associated access rules. These work alongside a process for providing  access only to the actors that need it, and to prevent access to unauthorised persons. Each role  must respect the principle of least privilege, in particular the roles that can connect to the  concentrator as they allow access to all the consumption data and associated personal data. By  default, only administrators and data engineers would have this access. It is also very important  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  39  to have a process for modifying or revoking user access in timely manner, as long processes for  access management generally result in neglect by an organisation.  Considering the high volume of smart meter devices, the administration account would likely  need to be generic, with the account password stored within an administration Bastion. Then,  only mandated electricity supplier’s teams would have the ability to have access this Bastion  and connect to the smart meters.  In case of an incident or failure, the complexity of the management of these accesses,  particularly for the smart meters, could prevent teams from accessing the system to correct  potential problems, which could impact the availability of the system, thus its performance.  4.11 ENSURE ALL SYSTEMS AND DEVICES COMPLY WITH  AUTHENTICATION, AND ACCESS CONTROL POLICIES  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity  & Privacy  • Weak access protection mechanisms for  machine learning model components  • Weak access protection mechanisms of  the personal data (encryption, access  control mechanism…)  • Compromise of ML application  components  • Poisoning  • Data disclosure  • Human error  In this control there must be a distinction made between user access and device access. For  user access, the Electrical Company must ensure that proper user authentication and access  controls regulate access to Smart meters, the Concentrator, the data lake, the Model server, the  Dashboard tools, and the Integrated Development Environment. Such access authentication  and access control should be managed centrally, with a dedicated solution (e.g., Active  Directory) linked to all these assets, except in the case of smart meters, where authentication  should remain local due to the high volume of devices. Moreover, for sensitive assets  manipulating personal data, such as the concentrator, the electrical company should implement  multi-factor authentication for the data engineers and administrators that are granted access.  The multi-factor authentication solution must be linked to the central authentication system.  For device access, the electrical company should ensure that all device-to-device requests are  properly authenticated. To deal with threats, it is important to use good market practices. For  example, use of the OAuth 2.0 protocol for all exposed APIs with control via an API gateway. In  addition, the certificates for the authorisation server keys should be managed through the  company's own Public Key Infrastructure in order to avoid any identity theft scenario. It is also  necessary to respect an authentication policy (based on the current recommendations of bodies  such as ENISA38 or NIST39) for the authentication of devices on the authorisation server. To  protect the secrets in the smart meters, it is necessary to secure them by ensuring that their OS  version is up-to-date, and that non-essential ports are closed, amongst other factors. To protect  access to the company electric network via smart meters, it is necessary to carry out Network  access control with good practices40. However, in case of an incident or a failure, the complexity  of the authentication, especially for the smart meters, could slow down the remediation of the  problem (for example if administrators had trouble authenticating on the system due to the  reinforced authentication) and have an impact on the of availability of the system, thus its  performance.  Additionally, personally authenticating the employees on the system can have an impact on  privacy, because personal data (identifiers, mail addresses, etc) would be recorded in these  38 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/tips-for-secure-user-authentication  39 See https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63-3.pdf  40 See https://cipherwire.net/wp- content/uploads/2013/06/802.1X_and_NAC___Best_Practices_for_Effective_Network_Access_Control.pdf  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  40  authentication systems. These authentication systems must respect the principles of Article 5 of  the GDPR (data minimisation etc).  4.12 REDUCE THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE MODEL  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity  & Privacy Too much information available on the model Compromise of ML application components  This control lowers the likelihood of Compromise of ML application components by limiting the  knowledge of a malicious user about his target and consequently making it more difficult to  launch a cyberattack. It is important to understand that this security control alone is not enough,  as security by obscurity does not provide sufficient protection.  Therefore, all documentation concerning the model itself should be protected. They should be  encrypted and protected by a Data Right Management mechanism, allowing only the Data  Scientists to access them from their computers. Specifically, the documentation can be stored in  a dedicated file server directory to which access rights are regularly reviewed and linked to the  access rights management mechanisms described in 4.10 and 4.11. This server must be  encrypted by default and located in a network zone dedicated to the company's sensitive  resources. In addition, user workstations accessing this file server must be sufficiently  protected. In addition to the rights management mechanisms, it is necessary to provide, at least,  encryption of the workstations, a confidentiality filters fitted to the screens of workstations in  nomadic situations, and securing (OS version up-to-date, closure of non-essential ports etc) of  the workstation to prevent the opening of certain ports and the insertion of USB keys. In  addition, to avoid the propagation of documents relating to the model, it is recommended that a  data loss protection solution be deployed.  This control could have an impact on privacy aspect because it may be considered as a  contradiction to the principle of transparency required by the GDPR. Therefore, it is important to  define documentation that can be communicated to external users (i.e., customers), explaining  that their data is not directly used by the model. Moreover, this control could impact the  performance of the system, because in case of an incident or a failure, the complexity of the  access management could prevent data scientists to have access to the documentation to  correct the problem and have an impact of availability of the system, thus its performance.  4.13 IDENTIFY A DATA CONTROLLER FOR THE ENERGY  CONSUMPTION ANTICIPATION DATA PROCESSING  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Privacy Absence of an identified data controller  • Unlawful processing  • Unfair processing  • Lack of transparency  Identifying a data controller is essential to prevent various high impacts for the company and its  employees due to unlawful processing, unfair processing, or lack of transparency. Self- identifying as the data controller means performing accountability actions (documentation,  assessments, etc.) and making sure that the energy consumption anticipation data processing  is compliant with personal data protection GDPR obligations and does not infringe on privacy  rights of data subjects. Self-identifying as the data controller means also taking responsibility in  case of non-compliance or adverse privacy effects on data subjects.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  41  Such a measure does not have a negative impact in our case. On the contrary, it improves the  privacy of users without impacting the performance of the system or its security.  4.14 PROPERLY COLLECT AND MAINTAIN USER CONSENT WHEN  NEEDED FOR DETAILED ENERGY CONSUMPTION USAGE  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Privacy  • Absence of mechanisms to ensure that the  processing of consumer electricity affected by  consent cannot be carried out without consent  • Lack of legal basis related to user’s consent  when their detailed consumption data (per  hour or half hour) are processed or that the  legitimate interest related to the daily  processing of the data is not properly justified  or that no justification is provided at all  • Lack of practical means and justification for  obtaining the consent of the electricity  consumers concerned  Unlawful processing  When the electricity supplier wants to extract the energy consumption of the inhabitants on an  hourly or half-hourly basis, it should ask first for the users' consent and go on with the  processing of the granular data only when this consent has been given. This means that there  must be an opt-in function in the user interface (e.g., a checkbox) provided by the energy  electricity supplier that the consumers must actively check (opt-in) to agree to provide their  detailed energy consumption. Then, the consent of each user would be stored within a  dedicated database belonging to the company and used accordingly for the collection (or not) of  detailed consumption data. It is as important to ensure that when a subject revokes their  consent, their detailed consumption data is no longer processed.  However, when this control is properly implemented, it is easier for data subjects to withhold  consent for use of their personal data. Therefore, the data collected could be less rich with  proper consent management and could be limited to daily energy consumption for a larger  number of data subjects. In addition, there is a (relatively small) additional cost to implementing  proper consent management. This measure impacts on security, because the company must  protect not only the energy consumption data that the user gives with his consent but also the  storage of the consent over time in a dedicated and secure space. The collection and storage  must have a level of security adapted to the principles of non-repudiation (encryption of the  data, traceability of access to the equipment, signatures via daily private keys in the database of  the dedicated space, etc.).  4.15 ANONYMIZE DATA COMING FROM THE CONCENTRATOR  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Privacy Lack of anonymization No respect of data minimization  The data that could identify consumers are anonymised at the concentrator level.  Anonymisation requires an analysis to correctly identify a subset of fields that irreversibly  prevents re-identification of data subjects and should be performed as early in the processing as  possible. After this identification, a dedicated solution can be used to anonymise the data. It  should also be remembered that the collected data are deleted in the concentrator after the  aggregation of all data from different households.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  42  In this case the data that need to be anonymised at the concentrator level is the Energy  consumption of inhabitants containing these fields [surname, first name, address, meter  number, telephone number, electricity consumption]. After anonymisation, the remaining fields  should be [city, electricity consumption], with the city field being derived from the address of the  concentrator and the electricity consumption being the sum of consumption by all customers  associated with the concentrator. This is the data that is sent to the data lake.  In this case, in the event of a security breach, it may be more difficult to perform a cybersecurity  forensic analysis on anonymised data than on personally identifiable data. This has the impact  of significantly slowing down the work of those employed to determine the cause of a security  issue. Ultimately, finding security measures for these kinds of vulnerabilities would also create  other security challenges.  4.16 GENERATE LOGS AND PERFORM INTERNAL AUDIT  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity  & Privacy  • Lack of auditability of processing  • Lack of traceability of actions and/or  modifications made to the assets  • Unlawful processing  • Unfair processing  • Lack of transparency  • Diversion of purpose  • No respect of data minimization  • Compromise of Machine Learning  application  • No respect of storage limitation  Generating logs and performing internal audit allows for improvements in supervision of all  assets of the model, creating a better understanding of the decisions made in real time by the  algorithm. This also helps in understanding individual incidents, whilst auditing internal  processes and questioning the processing carried out in the frame of the project reduces the  likelihood of many threats in this scenario.  Therefore, the process must be auditable in the sense that certain questions must always be  answered clearly: Who accessed the data (especially at the concentrator level)? Why did the  algorithm make a particular decision? How exactly was the data processed? To this end, the  technical and organisational parts of the process must generate traces (computer logs, activity  reports, etc.) so that they can be audited. These logs should be stored in a dedicated tool, such  as a log management solution.  The logs provided by the equipment must be signed (using their  own private key) and their signature stored by the server that centralises the logs to ensure a  principle of non-repudiation. In addition, at each (usually daily) backup of the log server, these  backups must also be signed by the log sink to ensure once again the principle of non- repudiation. Moreover, these logs should be analysed by a SOC and rules should be defined to  detect such anomalies as many calls from a smart meter to the concentrator or an abnormal  response. In addition, all processes must be regularly audited by the company's internal control  teams to ensure compliance with the requirements. As far as privacy is concerned, these audits  should at least ensure the lawfulness of the processing, its transparency, its application, the  data minimisation, the respect of the storage limitation and the fairness aspect. These checks  should be based in part on the logs collected.  This control could have an impact on privacy because the generated logs can contain personal  data. This log management system should be included in the privacy impact assessment scope  of the system. Moreover, the logging system should be carefully implemented to avoid  unnecessary overhead due to the extra operations it executes.  4.17 PERFORM A PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  43  Privacy  • Lack of controls to ensure that data is used  only for the purposes defined  • Lack of controls to ensure the adequacy of the  purpose and its current use  • Lack of detail on the purposes and justification  for their legitimacy  • Diversion of purpose  • Unlawful processing  • Unfair processing  • Lack of transparency  This privacy measure allows for an in-depth analysis of the impact of the processing on the  privacy of users, compliance with the GDPR and to identify whether the associated risks are  well addressed by the proposed privacy and security measures.  The privacy impact assessments and general accountability actions described above (in the  internal audit process control) help ensure that the purpose of the processing is well defined  (the prediction of residents' consumption) and that the actual use of the data remains within the  scope of this case. To do so, the electricity supplier should use the requirements described  below, and asses the vulnerabilities of the implemented system, to illustrate privacy threats and  counter measures.  Such analysis may possibly impact the performance of the scenario if it results in one of the  functionalities not allowing to minimise the data protection risks to the rights and freedoms of  natural persons.  4.18 DEFINE AND IMPLEMENT A DATA RETENTION POLICY  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Privacy  • Lack of data deletion mechanisms  • Lack of data retention policy  No respect of storage limitation  This privacy control requires a storage duration value to be defined for each personal data  involved in the processing, including individual detailed consumption data, individual daily  consumption data etc. When this storage duration value is implemented, the privacy control acts  to minimise the risk of keeping the data longer than it is strictly necessary. One way to  implement it is by having a script that automatically deletes the data based on predefined  criteria.  However, once all that data is deleted, it cannot be used later for forensic analysis, as may be  required when a company faces a security breach.  4.19 STUDY ON DATA FIELDS NECESSITY AND JUSTIFICATION IN  THE PRIVACY POLICY  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Privacy  • Lack of justification for the collection of  individual personal data collected  • Lack of transparency on the purpose of the  processing, the exact consumption data that  are extracted, and how they are processed.  • Unlawful processing  • Lack of transparency  • No respect of data minimization  A lack of justification on how data are collected, correlated with a lack of transparency on the  purpose of the processing or on the accuracy of the data collected could result in unlawful  processing which would have moderate impact for the consumer (significant sense of invasion  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  44  of privacy). Therefore, the electricity supplier must study the necessity of different data fields  and justify this in the privacy policy.  The personal data used is the consumption data (daily or hourly) of the inhabitants. The  electricity supplier must therefore implement a privacy control in which they could explain why it  is necessary to use this data specifically in the context of this scenario. The supplier must also  formalise the explanation and make it freely available to consumers.  Nevertheless, this practice may have some impact on the relevance of the data collected.  Taking time to justify the need for data may lead to the abandonment of the collection of some  data for which justification is difficult, which in turn, may reduce the quality of the data at hand.  4.20 FORMALISE A LIA (LEGITIMATE INTEREST ASSESSMENT)  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Privacy Lack of legal basis related to legitimate interest Unlawful processing  The Legitimate Interest Impact Assessment (LIA)41 is used to determine if an organisation can  process data using the legitimate interest lawful basis. In our case, the legal basis for the  extraction of daily consumption data is legitimate interest. If the electricity supplier does not  justify this legal basis, it faces unlawful processing. To justify the legal basis, the electricity  supplier must put in place a LIA. In this LIA, the electricity supplier must formalise a reflection on  how the data processing is necessary, and how it balances with the rights and freedoms of  consumers.  The impact this could have on the electricity supplier would be a loss of time and energy spent  formalising the LIA.  4.21 MINIMISE DATA AT EACH STEP OF THE PROCESSING; COLLECT  ONLY WHAT IS NEEDED WHEN NEEDED  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Privacy  • Lack of necessary data selection  • Lack of verification that the data is  adequate, relevant, and not excessive for  the purpose of estimating electricity  consumption  No respect of data minimisation  Minimisation requires an analysis to correctly identify the subset of fields which are required,  and should be performed as early as possible during processing. Non-minimisation of data is  the lack of selection of necessary, adequate, and relevant data.  For example, in our case, the electricity supplier only requires the consumption data of  individuals. The electricity supplier extracts two types of consumption data: the daily  consumption and the consumption at the half-hour scale. A study on the necessity of collecting  data at the hourly scale must be done and a proof of its necessity made public. Then, the  41 See https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation- gdpr/legitimate-interests/how-do-we-apply-legitimate-interests-in- practice/#:~:text=There's%20no%20defined%20process%2C%20but,(consider%20the%20individual's%20interests).  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  45  extracted individual data should be anonymised at the hub level and aggregated with other data  from other households before being sent to the model.  However, data minimisation also involves data anonymisation. In this case, in the event of a  security breach, it may be more difficult to perform a cybersecurity forensic analysis on  anonymised data than on personally identifiable data. This has the impact of significantly  slowing down the work of those employed to determine the cause of a security issue.  4.22 IMPLEMENT A PRIVACY BY DESIGN PROCESS  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Privacy Lack of Privacy by Design  • Unlawful processing  • Unfair processing  • Lack of transparency  • Diversion of purpose  • No respect of data minimization  The electricity supplier must ensure that a compliance study and privacy risk assessment is  formalised in a Privacy Impact Analysis document, and that the identified action plan is  implemented before the scenario is put into operation.  Conceiving a project following a Privacy be Design methodology requires less effort than adding  privacy on top of an existing project. However, there could be an impact on the functionality of  the scenario if the outcome of the Privacy by Design methodology leads to functionality not  being implemented due to the privacy risk it generates (bear in mind that in our case, personal  data is anonymised and then aggregated and deleted at the concentrator). Another impact of  note is related to security, as it may not be possible to collect data useful for forensic analysis  following a cyber-attack due to privacy limitations.  4.23 RAISE AWARENESS OF SECURITY AND PRIVACY ISSUES  AMONG ALL STAKEHOLDERS  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity  & privacy  Lack of consideration of attacks to which the  energy forecasting system could be exposed  • Poisoning  • Data disclosure  • Unlawful processing  • Unfair processing  • Lack of transparency  • Diversion of purpose  • No respect of data minimization  There are many threats with high impact in this scenario, and the company must ensure that  such threats are comprehended by the teams. For instance, the company must ensure that all  its teams (including Data Scientists) are trained in the specificities of machine learning and the  new associated cyber and privacy risks.  This can take the form of regular training sessions or local cyber and privacy risks reporting.  This raises awareness of issues to teams, and in some cases can present solutions tailored to  the specificities of forecasting demand on electricity grids scenario.  This control does not directly impact performance of the system.

CONCLUSION  In this report, analysis of forecasting demand on electricity grids supported by Artificial  Intelligence (AI) is presented. AI is often used as an umbrella term that encompasses the  technology behind many smart solutions and devices. It is a constantly evolving field where new  innovations appear regularly in different areas of activity.  Even though AI can be very beneficial for the industries areas it applies to, it can also have  quite a significant impact for security and privacy, especially when these systems have sensitive  functionalities, as for the scenario that is described in this report. Indeed, AI comes with a wide  range of privacy and security vulnerabilities causing threats with heavy impacts for  organisations.  Regardless how AI is being used in support of business functionality, it should not be a surprise  that the many identified threats are similar. However, we must be aware of the fact that  depending on the context of the scenario, the same threats apply differently and have different  levels of impact. Regarding the impact of each threat, it must be also noted that even in the  same scenario every instance is unique, and a proper study must be carried out by each  company using AI to maintain a proper security and privacy level.  This guide helps in the identification and evaluation of threats in a specific business scenario  which uses AI, but it is important to remember that while the analyzed scenario is based on real  life examples, it includes assumptions which may not match the business context in which other  organizations would like to implement in. Therefore, the entire cybersecurity and privacy context  (requirements, threats, vulnerabilities, and controls) must be adapted to the context and reality  of the individual business. In addition, the controls proposed in this document are not sufficient  on their own, and must be complemented by the standard security measures that already exist.  While security and privacy are not necessarily the same, they are intimately related, and equally  important. In their management, a balance must be found between the two in the sense that  one must always make sure that the regulations and recommendations concerning the two  aspects are always respected. Unfortunately, these two parameters are regularly at the  expense of performance. It is therefore an equation with three variables, two of which respond  to the need for regulation and risk, which need to be correctly balanced to achieve the desired  effect.

The figure below summarises such requirements.  Requirements Article  Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency Art. 5.a  Purpose limitation  Art. 5.b  Data minimisation Art. 5.c  Accuracy Art. 5.d  Storage limitation Art. 5.e  Security of personal data (integrity and confidentiality) Art. 5.f  Moreover, as a complement to the GDPR requirements listed above, some key privacy topics  related to AI systems need to be addressed (some of them are specifically mentioned by  national data protection supervisory authorities44). These additional privacy requirements are  listed below:  Recommendations Details  Database creation  Projects must ensure the compliance of the data collected and injected  into the database for training and in production. Moreover, they must  ensure that only legitimate persons have access to the data in the  database, prevent data loss and hide personal data.  Compliance of the training model  (i.e., before production)  The data collected and the training model must be processed in  accordance with the state of the art of Machine Learning development to  guarantee control of all processes carried out.  This consists, for instance, of good justifications for the chosen learning  method, the reliability of the third-party tools used, paying attention to  open-source data, conducting a meticulous training protocol based on the  state of the art, and finally verifying the quality of the system once in the  experimentation phase.45  44 Such as the CNIL.

To this end, ENISA, with the support of the Ad-Hoc Working Group on  Artificial Intelligence Cybersecurity, has published two reports in the last two years:  Cybersecurity Challenges of Artificial Intelligence1 and Securing Machine Learning  Algorithms2.  ENISA continues its momentum with a new report on cybersecurity and privacy in forecasting  demand on electricity grids. An in-depth study of the scenario has been conducted by identifying  first the assets, the actors and their roles, relevant processes, the AI algorithms used, as well as  the requirements in terms of cybersecurity and privacy needed for it. Building upon previous  ENISA work such as the “Securing Machine Learning Algorithms” report cited above, in addition  to legislation such as GDPR and literature searches, this report has identified cybersecurity and  privacy threats and vulnerabilities that can be exploited in the examined scenario. While focus is  on ML-related threats and vulnerabilities, broader AI considerations were also taken into  account. Lastly, corresponding cybersecurity and privacy controls that consider the context of  the scenario and the impact of the associated threats/vulnerabilities were defined. The  specificities within the implementation of these controls are described, including possible trade- offs between cybersecurity, privacy, and performance. Each control is classified as a  cybersecurity control, a privacy control, or a mixture of both, depending on the threats it  mitigates and their associated impacts (cybersecurity impacts, privacy impacts, or both).  This report allows better assessment of the reality that artificial intelligence brings its own set of  threats, which consequently insists on the search for new security measures to counter them.  Finally, it should be noted that this guide strongly emphasises privacy issues in the same way  as cybersecurity issues, privacy being one of the most important challenges facing society  today. Security and privacy are intimately related, but both equally important, and a balance  must be made specific to each use. As a result, as seen in this report, efforts to optimise  security and privacy can often come at the expense of system performance.  1 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-challenges  2 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/securing-machine-learning-algorithms  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  6  1. INTRODUCTION  Abuse of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which has developed significantly in recent years, has been  identified by ENISA as one of the top emerging threats3. By providing new opportunities to solve  decision-making problems intelligently and automatically, AI is being applied to more and more  business cases in a growing number of sectors. The associated benefits are significant.  However, the development of AI is also accompanied by new threats which project teams will  have to face.  In many projects, it is apparent that these new threats are related to aspects of cybersecurity in  addition to privacy, particularly when AI is used for innovative projects whereby processing  personal data takes place. In this spirit, on 21 April 2021, the Commission published the AI Act  proposal4, which sets out requirements (including cybersecurity and privacy) for AI systems  deemed to be high-risk (e.g., used in biometric identification or critical infrastructure  management and operation) in order to mitigate threats to health, safety, and fundamental  rights.  To go further into these high-risk AI systems, ENISA proposes this new report: \"Cybersecurity  and Privacy in AI - Forecasting Demand on Electricity Grids\", which builds directly on the work  already initiated by ENISA since 2020 on the identification of risks associated with AI. This new  report analyses cybersecurity and privacy requirements and measures in use of AI in  forecasting demand on electricity grids. The report describes the scenario fundamental  principles (assets, actors processes etc.), identifies the security and privacy risks it  poses, and finally cybersecurity and privacy controls, which counteract the identified  risks.  1.1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  Findings from the ENISA’s report on securing machine learning algorithms5 indicate that there is  no uniform strategy in applying a specific set of security controls to protect machine learning  algorithms and in some cases, deployed security controls may result in trade-offs in security and  performance. ENISA therefore recommends that organisations which use AI systems should  perform detailed analysis of their own AI systems, and conduct targeted risk assessments to  find the appropriate balance between cybersecurity, privacy and performance.  The objectives of this publication are as follows:  • Provide a detailed description of a Forecasting Demand on Electricity Grids  scenario.  • Identify AI cybersecurity and privacy measures taking into account requirements,  threats and vulnerabilities defined for this scenario and practical guidance on how to  implement them.  • Provide recommendations on how to balance the trade-offs between cybersecurity,  privacy, and performance in this scenario.  The following section outlines the methodology followed in producing this report.  3 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/cybersecurity-threats-fast-forward-2030  4 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0206  5 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/securing-machine-learning-algorithms  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  7  1.2 METHODOLOGY  Production of this publication, was undertaken in three stages:  • Identify and describe in detail the forecasting demand on electricity grids scenario.  • Identify cybersecurity and privacy threats associated with the scenario.  • Identify relevant cybersecurity and privacy controls.  1.2.1 Description of the scenario  The scenario description is aligned with ENISA’s previous work on AI6,7 and provides the  following information:  • The purpose and the context  • A high-level description of the scenario, highlighting the data encountered  • The involved actors and their associated roles  • A detailed description of the data  • Machine learning algorithms  • Other assets (besides data) associated with the described scenario  • The overall process of the scenario  • Security and privacy requirements  1.2.2 Identification of cybersecurity and privacy threats and  vulnerabilities  This section of the report focusses on the threats and vulnerabilities related to use of AI in  forecasting demand on electricity grids scenario. Based on previously mentioned ENISA work,  legislation such as GDPR, and desk research, this report identified the cybersecurity and  privacy threats and vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Given the prevalence of machine  learning (ML) and ENISA’s past work on the topic, there is more emphasis placed on threats  and vulnerabilities related to ML. Nonetheless, wider considerations of AI have been taking into  account when identifying security threats and vulnerabilities as well as dedicated to privacy, for  which GDPR data protection principles8 were used as a starting point of our analysis.  1.2.3 Identification of cybersecurity and privacy controls  Following the analysis of forecasting electricity on electricity grids scenario, the identification of  threats (and their impact), and associated vulnerabilities, this section of the report presents the  corresponding cybersecurity and privacy controls that:  •  Take into account the context of the scenario  •  Take into account the security and privacy impact of the threat/vulnerabilities (as described in  this report)  The specificities of implementation of such controls are described including the possible trade- offs between cybersecurity, privacy and performance. Each control can be either a  cybersecurity control, a privacy control, or a mixture of both, depending on the threats it  mitigates and their associated impacts (cybersecurity impacts, privacy impacts, or both). Many  of the controls are of technical nature, but when appropriate (e.g., per GDPR requirements),  organizational controls have also been identified.  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  The target audience of this report can be divided into the following categories:  6 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/securing-machine-learning-algorithms  7 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-challenges  8 See Article 5 of GDPR  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  8  • All actors (private or public): to help them in their risk analysis, in the  identification of cybersecurity and privacy threats and in the identification of the  appropriate security and privacy controls to mitigate the threats related to this  scenario  • AI technical community, AI cybersecurity and privacy experts and AI  experts (designers, developers, ML experts, data scientists, etc.) with an interest  in developing secure solutions and in integrating security and privacy by design in  their solutions.  • Cybersecurity and privacy community: to help in identifying cybersecurity and  privacy threats related to forecasting demand on electricity grids scenario and in  identifying the appropriate security and privacy controls to mitigate the threats.  1.4 USING THIS DOCUMENT  Although we based the scenario close to reality, some assumptions have been to made for the  purposes of its analysis. These assumptions should be reassessed by the reader when doing  their own analysis. Please note this list is non-exhaustive:  • The algorithms chosen for the scenario are based on desk research, and there may be  other algorithms that are better suited for it.  • Regarding the privacy aspects, we put ourselves in the shoes of the data controller, but  only based on the hypothesis that we have made. It is left to the attention of the  audience that the privacy requirements as well as the control measures must always  be adapted to a context and a situation.  • After identifying potential threats, this report identifies security and privacy controls that  could be applied to the scenario. However, as is the case for any application of ML,  one must also consider traditional security standards (e.g., ISO 27001/2, NIST)  because ML applications are also subject to more global threats.  It should also be kept in mind that the elements of this report are valid as of the date of  publication, and could evolve over time.

SCENARIO DESCRIPTION  The following figure presents an overview of the topics that will be addressed in this chapter.  Figure 1: Scenario overview  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  10  2.1 PURPOSE AND CONTEXT  Consumption and production balance is the core challenge of any smart electricity grid. This is  particularly the case since the rise of intermittent renewable energies that help to rebalance the  energy mix and reduce reliance on energy production from fossil fuels. However, the inherent  intermittence of renewable energies requires distributors to take into account precise predictions  to ensure that production is able to meet consumption, even during peak hours. Moreover, to  this day there is no way to store energy on a large scale that could allow the temporary  separation of production to meet current consumption.  For this reason, a national electricity system electricity supplier9 has defined the following  purposes:  • reduce the production of electricity from non-renewable energies (conventional power  plants, etc.),  • prioritise the consumption of electricity produced from renewable energies  (photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, etc.),  • Ensure all technical conditions for the supply of electricity, including the need to  maintain supply with fluctuating demand.  To reach these objectives, the national electricity system electricity supplier seeks to make daily  predictions on the amount of non-renewable energy production required to supplement the  amount of energy produced by renewable sources so that the total energy produced matches  the estimated consumer demand. This is done on a daily basis in three steps:  • Predict the production of renewable sources using meteorological data (history and  forecast), data from the materials (mechanical / electronical characteristics of the solar  panels and the windmills) and historical data concerning the previous power production  from power farms.  • Forecast consumption of the consumers with demographic data, calendar data  (events, holidays), and energy consumption.  • Compare predicted renewable production against consumption forecast. This provides  an important key performance indicator (KPI) for the national electricity system  electricity supplier teams to make a decision as to whether additional power plants may  be required to supplement the renewable energy, or if the energy produced by  renewable sources may be stored.  2.2 HIGH-LEVEL DESCRIPTION  The technical core of the scenario is therefore prediction, with the use of artificial intelligence  algorithms. To be more precise, machine learning is used along with the supervised learning  paradigm (e.g., multivariate regression or neural networks).  To achieve these objectives, a dataset is used, amongst which, material characteristics of solar  panels and wind turbines, weather data, energy consumption of consumers, calendar data and  demographics (regional information about the average age of the population, employment,  number of inhabitants etc.). Most of these data are obtained through public application  programming interfaces (APIs), with the remaining data already in possession of the electricity  provider. Once collected in a data lake via data engineers and network administrators, the  data must be explored and prepared. This is aimed at better understanding the data, evaluating  the quality and quantity at disposal and adopt a modelling strategy. The data scientist and  engineering teams are responsible for these steps. The electricity supplier’s teams, especially  9 In this analysis, we have assigned to one actor the roles of several actors. In many countries, there are different actors such  as: the distributed system operator, market operator, energy producers  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  11  business experts, may be required to give insights about the data collected and help decide  which strategy to choose.  Selected data are then used to create two machine learning models. A data scientist team  is responsible for this step. One model is built to determine the next day's electricity production  from renewable electricity production facilities, while the other is built to determine the next  day's electricity consumption. The two models are described in detail in 1.9. These two models  produce the following outputs:  • a daily prediction of the renewable energy production  • a daily energy consumption of facilities (inhabitants, industrials etc.)  At the end of the prediction processes, predictions are fed back into a dashboard tool used by  the electricity provider teams to adjust their power procurement decisions.  The following sections aim to detail such scenario by describing actors and their roles, data  processed, the assets that allow the project to exist, the explanation of the scenario lifecycle,  and the privacy and cybersecurity requirements applied to it.  Figure 2: High-level description  2.3 ACTORS AND ROLES  The following actors are involved in the forecasting demand on electricity grids scenario.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  12  Figure 3: Actors, roles, and their description  Actor Role Description  Electricity supplier’s  teams  End Users and Data  Owner (Data  Controller)  Electricity System Electricity supplier’s teams oversee controlling the electricity  supply so that it is optimal at all times, knowing that energy not consumed is  energy wasted. In this scenario, the team interprets the model’s results,  provides requirements to data scientists, and has control over the solar and  wind infrastructure that provides data inputs into the model.10  Electricity consumers Data Provider  Electricity consumers are indirect participants. Their electricity consumption,  whether individual or not, is reported through the network of electricity meters,  energy suppliers, etc.  Open-data providers Data Provider  Open data providers are an external entity providing open-data, including  demographics, and weather forecasts of solar irradiance, cloud cover and wind  speed, amongst other metrics.  Data scientists Data scientist  Data scientists are the spearhead of the algorithms. They oversee cleaning  and preparing of the data, building the models and ensuring the relevance of  the results. They work with the Electricity Distribution Electricity supplier’s  teams to build a relevant model.  Developers and Data  Engineers  Developers and  Data Engineers  Developers and Data Engineers are responsible for routing data,  transformation, production environments and other technical operations as  required.  System and  communication  network administrators  Network  administrators  System and communication network’s administrator are responsible for the  installation and the maintenance of digital systems supporting the machine  learning application, including network (flows etc.) and hosting of on-premises  servers that make the application work.  2.4 PROCESSED DATA  As previously mentioned, there are two models, and each uses separate data. It should also be  noted that the output data of one model (predicted data) becomes the input data of the same  model the next day.  Figure 4: Data needed to build the model and input data that the model will use for the  electricity production from renewable energies  10 Usually, these renewable sources are dispatched by the system operator.

The difficulty is to determine which data  are impactful to avoid the model  becoming over-parameterised.  Calendar (calendar of  events, holydays... to  help predict times of  the year when  consumption is high  or lower than  average)  Structured  data Open-data provider  These data are public and can be found  in open data platforms. The difficulty is to  determine which data are impactful to  avoid the model becoming over- parameterised. This information can be  found and must be expressed in a way  that the system can understand13.  Current daily energy  consumption Time series  Consumers’ (including  industrials, municipalities, and  individuals) smart meters  belonging to the electricity  system electricity suppliers.  These smart meters provide  surname, first name, address,  meter number, telephone  number, and electricity  consumption.14  The electricity supplier can collect the  energy data from smart meters installed  at the consumers’ site.

Smart  meter data is sent to a concentrator,  located at a secondary substation  (medium voltage - low voltage) where all  data from all the individuals are  gathered17.  2.5 MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS  The following algorithms are used in our scenario. The first algorithm (RNN) is used to forecast  the daily production of electricity from renewable energies. The second algorithm (SARIMAX) is  used to forecast the daily consumer demand.  Figure 6: Machine learning algorithms used  Learning paradigm Subtype Algorithm Type of data ingested Description  Supervised Learning Regression RNN Time series  A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a  class of artificial neural networks where  connections between nodes form a  directed graph along a temporal  sequence.

The model is  composed of two parts: an  autoregressive part (AR) and a moving  average part (MA). A SARIMAX  algorithm has additional seasonality  modelling (S) and exogenous variables  (X) in the model18 19 20.  2.6 ASSETS  In addition to the previously described data, the scenario is supported by the following additional  assets.  16 As we will see, the output training data comes from personal data sources. However, once the model is in production, it  only predicts the overall energy consumption.  17 See https://api.meteo-concept.com/documentation_openapi  18 Neda Tavakoli; Sima Siami-Namini; Akbar Siami Namin.

To carry out this scenario, electricity supplier’s teams, data scientists, data engineers and the  system administrator work together to understand the final objectives and define the needs.  In the following paragraphs, the scenario is described by incorporating it into the different stages  of the machine learning lifecycle:  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  16  Data collection  The first step is to determine how to obtain the needed data and how to incorporate it in the  model. Data engineers/developers and network administrators route the data used in the  models. The former to format it, to know where to retrieve it, to validate its quality and the latter  to build the necessary flows as these data are routed through various channels (public APIs,  individual consumer meters provided by the electric company). Of course, even once in  production, the data must be routed to the models to make their predictions. Data are routed to  an existing on-premises (belonging to the electricity supplier) data lake, which is a set of servers  and resources specifically designed to store and orchestrate the data, and to define a set of  data tables.  Most of these data (material characteristics, and production history) are owned by the  electricity supplier. The electricity supplier can collect this data since it knows the amount of  equipment at its disposal, the state of these facilities, and its production history. To carry out its  project, the electricity supplier collects the data it needs from the results of the regular  maintenance of its equipment and from its production history. As mentioned earlier, weather  data has an important part to play in this scenario. It greatly influences the amount of electricity  produced by renewable energies. The prediction of these data is the expertise of the  meteorological services. The latter make these data accessible through APIs that they  provide and maintain. This data is considered as open-data and is therefore non- proprietary and free to use. The electricity supplier collects this data using the APIs made  available.  An important source of data collected is the electricity consumption of the inhabitants. The  consumption data is considered personal data because it includes personal information such as  name, surname, address, smart meter number and phone number of account holder in addition  to the consumption. The electricity supplier collects their electricity consumption from  smart meters installed locally at the consumers' place21. By default, only the daily  consumption data (global consumption of the household over a day) is collected to allow the  consumers to consult the history of his consumption free of charge. However, smart meters can  collect more detailed consumption information. This detailed consumption information is the  hourly or half-hourly consumption data. The collection of this detailed consumption data is not  automatic. The electricity supplier does not collect detailed consumption data for all households  by default, however these may be collected with the user's consent.  This data then passes through the Electricity supplier’s electrical grid - PLC to a concentrator  located at a secondary sub-station (medium voltage - low voltage). Once this information arrives  at the concentrator, a first processing is done by data engineers. To protect this personal data,  in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the data engineer must  filter the data so that it cannot be used to directly identify individual consumers.  This includes:  • the name of the person  • the address of the person  • the meter number of the person  • the phone number of the person  It is also worth noting that smart meters have geolocation, and such information could be used  to track the location of consumers living in low density areas. To circumvent this risk, the  electricity supplier collects data in areas with a large number of households22.  The default or detailed consumption values (if the consumer has agreed to share this  information for the purpose of the processing) are kept and then aggregated (i.e.,  summed with all other consumption data) in a large consumption database maintained by  21 See https://www.cnil.fr/fr/linky-gazpar-quelles-donnees-sont-collectees-et-transmises-par-les-compteurs-communicants  22 See https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/5935825/KS-GQ-13-003-EN.PDF/baa96509-3f4b-4c7a-94dd-  feb1a31c7291  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  17  the electricity supplier. This aggregated data does not allow for the retrieval of consumer  data. It is therefore anonymised data.  In addition, open data are also used in this prediction stage. This includes statistical data related  to the size of the population present in the area (demographics), and the calendar of events  and holidays, specific to the residents to help to predict times of the year when consumption is  high or below average. Demographics can be provided by several APIs and calendars are  public, allowing them to be manually located.  Data cleaning and data pre-processing  From there, data scientists use various tools ranging from on-premises servers (to perform  calculations) to programming interfaces on their workstations which call upon data science  libraries. These tools allow the data scientists to work with the data and build models. The  collected data is cleaned (i.e., ensuring that the data collected is of high quality and  exploitable by the model) by data scientists for pre-processing23.  The pre-processing phase consists first of filling the not available (NA) values (interpolation,  average, median, etc.) before encoding the categorical variables into numerical values. Finally,  it is ensured that time scales are appropriate for the problem at hand (if it is desired for  predictions to be made for every hour of the day, data must be scaled to the hour). Moreover,  for both models’ needs, structured data are converted into time series where possible, keeping  in mind the static nature of some variables, such as material characteristics, which are constant  over time.  Model design and implementation  Once the data pre-processing done, the types of models to be built must be selected. The  models selected are the following:  • A Recurrent Neuronal Network (RNN): to forecast the daily production of electricity  from renewable energies.  o This model was selected because of the known efficiency of these recurrent  networks to make predictions for sequential data such as text, sound, or time  series. Several papers18 19 20 24 25 mention different experiments in which  RNN, and in particular Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are efficient in  forecasting electricity production.  • A Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous  variables (SARIMAX): to forecast consumers’ demand.  o Auto-regressive models are very efficient for modelling a temporal  phenomenon. Publications26 27 expose the benefits of using SARIMAX  models to forecast electricity consumption. This approach was chosen  because consumer consumption prediction is less complex than  meteorological forecasting or production forecasting, and seasonality and  impacts of contrasting events such as weekends vs weekdays can be  anticipated. This model does not necessarily need a neural network, which  can be harder to build and heavier to put in production.  23 Brownlee, Jason.

Forecasting Electricity Consumption Using SARIMA Method in IBM SPSS Software. 2019.  https://www.hrpub.org/journals/article_info.php?aid=8614  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  18  For the prediction of consumer demand, the model's parameters are determined by statistical  tests and analysis of the time series for the SARIMAX algorithm.  The characteristics of the RNN input layer (e.g., batch size, time step, number of  sequences/features) are defined. The output of the RNN consists of a real value corresponding  to the consumer’s consumption for the next day.  Model training, model testing and optimisation  During the training method phase, model training is realised on-premises. The data is  prepared to the same scale at which predictions are to be made. For our scenario, predictions  will be made at the hourly level. During the training phase, data scientists collaborate with data  engineers and the electricity supplier to improve their understanding of the data. The data is  then divided in different categories for the needs of machine learning, 70% is used for training,  15% for validation and 15% for testing28.  Once the data is prepared, the data scientists choose and elaborate the models which will learn  from the inputted data. In our case, two models are elaborated: the first to predict renewable  energy production of the next day, the other to predict electricity consumption of the next day.  The prediction of energy production from renewable energies is highly dependent on the  weather and the environment in general. To be prepared for any eventuality, the electricity  supplier must also train the model for extreme weather conditions.  Model Evaluation  To evaluate the model, metrics including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error  (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are considered.  Model Deployment  Finally, the model deployment is done on-premises and the model can be used to predict the  future values using new data.  Once the model is ready, the data scientists, data engineers and network teams work together  to industrialise the model. It is not only the model that is put to production, but all the pipeline  work, from pre-processing the data to model evaluation.  Deploying the environments necessary for its proper functioning: a pre-production environment  for the model testing phases in real conditions and a production environment for later.  Technically, this consists in creating flows:  • between the data lake and the servers where the model is hosted with the data  displayed earlier,  • between the model servers and the existing dashboarding tool with only the prediction  results.  When the pre-production environment is stable, the model is put into production and it can be  used through the dashboarding tool. From there, operation teams can now use the dashboard  tool to adjust their power procurement decisions. The dashboard allows for a comparison of the  results of the two predictions from the separate models and provides key performance  indicators (KPIs) that help operation teams decide for the next day whether certain power plants  should be turned on or whether energy generated from renewable sources can be stored.

CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  19  When monitoring, performance is measured every time that new data is acquired, comparing  predictions to real data. Data engineers / scientists oversee monitoring of the models in addition  to the distribution of the acquired data to infer any potential drift. As the scenario here has an  impact on critical infrastructure, there cannot afford to be any underperforming results, even for  a short period of time. Considering this, as predictions are made daily, it is reasonable to action  weekly re-training of the models. Scheduling of model training processes on a weekly basis is  done using a job scheduler. All processing pipeline and model training is automated. Through  these automated tests and model evaluation, the model is continuously integrated into the  production environment.

The following table summarises the cybersecurity  requirements.  Figure 9: Cybersecurity requirements  Level Explanation  Availability Low  Predictions made by the model are made every day. An unavailability  during half a week would be tolerable as old processes could be  reused until the application is back in service. Longer unavailability  would be too time consuming for the Electricity supplier.  Integrity Critical  Data, whether used for training or made by the model, must be  accurate with a high level of quality at all steps of the lifecycle. The  alteration of the manipulated data can cause a very large imbalance  between the different means of energy production (non-renewable and  renewable). Moreover, a poorly trained model could cause an  underproduction or an overproduction of energies with very non- negligible consequences.  Confidentiality Critical  Not all data is confidential, as some exists in the public domain.  However, consumption information of individuals used in the context of  our scenario include personal data (upstream of the concentrator).  This data is confidential and could highlight the behaviour of individuals  whose information is retrieved.  Traceability High  Actions linked to the process must be logged (traced and dated) to  enable full traceability of changes made to the algorithm. As personal  data is used in the process, actions linked must be imputable. i.e. all  actions must be traced (even consultation actions) and attributable  without possibility of repudiation.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  21  Privacy requirements  The energy consumption of individuals, which contains personal data (name, address, phone  number, etc.) is collected through smart meters. This data is processed in a concentrator so that  only aggregated daily consumption values are routed to the data lake. This means there is no  longer any personal data in the data lake because the sum of the data consumption of a  concentrator does not permit individual consumption to be recognised. In this step it is crucial  that this transformation from personal data to anonymised data is performed recognising the  goals identified of the WP29 guidelines on anonymisation techniques (i.e., avoiding singling out,  likability and inference)29.  It is important to note that the billing functions are not considered in our case, this topic  being out of scope.  Because our scenario handles personal data in the data collection phase, it is subject to  the GDPR. The following data protection requirements and recommendations should be  satisfied.  Figure 10: Data protection principles  Requirements Explanation  Lawfulness,  fairness, and  transparency30  Personal data collected (both in training and in production) in the purpose of the scenario must be processed  lawfully.  That is, the data processing must be based on one of the legal bases provided by Article 6 of GDPR. In addition,  individuals' personal data must be processed only in the way they reasonably expect, and any unexpected but  justified processing must be clearly explained. Data processing must also comply with the transparency  requirements.  Lawfulness: for the specificities of this scenario, and as explained in its description, if the electricity supplier  wants to extract the detailed consumption data of the users (consumption per hour or half hour), the electricity  supplier must obtain the consent of the consumers31. If the user does not consent to the retrieval of this hourly  or half-hourly consumption data, the electricity supplier may retrieve his daily consumption data for legitimate  interest. The electricity supplier has a legitimate interest in at least retrieving consumers' daily consumption  data. Without this data, the prediction of the users' energy demand is impossible.  Fairness: even if the electricity supplier demonstrates that the data processing has a legal basis, it must only  process personal data in line with consumers reasonable expectations, i.e., for the prediction of energy  demand, and not use it in a way that has an unjustified negative effect on them.  Transparency: the electricity supplier must also be transparent with consumers and clearly inform how and  why their personal data are used throughout the machine learning lifecycle (for instance as part of the  consumer agreement).  Purpose  limitation  Personal data collected (both in training and in production) needs to be processed for specific, explicit, and  legitimate purposes and is not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. This  means that the energy consumption collected and processed should only be used to predict the energy  demand.  Data  minimisation  Personal data collected (both in training and in production) needs to be adequate, relevant, and limited to what  is necessary in relation to the purpose of predicting energy consumption demand by using Machine Learning.  The electricity supplier should justify the data to be used and should indicate the procedures in place to ensure  that only essential data such as electricity consumption is processed for this purpose.  29 See https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp216_en.pdf  30 The choice of a legal basis is final, and a treatment cannot involve two legal bases. However, in our case, as explained in  the body of the report, two treatments are made: a treatment based on the fact that the data is extracted daily and a  treatment based on the fact that the data is extracted every hour or half hour. Depending on which of the two treatments  is accepted by the consumers, a corresponding legal basis will be chosen.  31 See https://www.cnil.fr/fr/linky-gazpar-quelles-donnees-sont-collectees-et-transmises-par-les-compteurs-communicants  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  22  Accuracy  Personal data collected (both in training and in production) must be accurate and kept up to date. The electricity  supplier, from the collection phase to the production phase, should put in place all appropriate measures to  promote data accuracy such as keeping the data up to date and ensuring that they remain correct. For  example, putting in place a clear and straightforward process for consumers to update their addresses so that  consumption data are always associated with the right locations.  Storage  limitation  Personal data collected (both in training and in production) must be kept in a form which permits identification  of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.  Specifically, in our case, the personal data collected is anonymised before exiting the concentrator.  Security of  personal data  (Integrity and  Confidentiality)  Personal data collected (both in training and in production) must be processed in a manner that ensures  appropriate security, in particular integrity and confidentiality of the data. In our case, the risks from data  corruption are minimal for consumers (as a reminder, billing data is not in scope of our scenario), and we  consider that the data extracted by the smart meter has no other purpose than the prediction of the energy  demand). On the other hand, the electricity supplier must put in place adequate security measures to ensure  the confidentiality of the data, as the leakage of the latter can indicate the user's habits.  As a complement to the GDPR data protection principles listed above, other key privacy topics  related to AI systems need to be addressed (some of which are specifically mentioned by  national data protection supervisory authorities)32:  Figure 11: Data protection supervisory authorities’ recommendations for AI systems  Recommendations Explanation  Database creation  During the collection phase, the data passing through the electricity supplier network to the concentrator  are personal data. A process aiming at deleting direct identifier and aggregate the consumption between  all the consumer is made at the level of the concentrator. However, before this processing, data are stored  in the database of the concentrator. The electricity supplier must ensure that only duly authorised persons  have access to this data and prevent data loss. The electricity supplier must also ensure that only the  right data (energy consumption) are injected into the concentrator.  Compliance of the  training model  (i.e., before  production)  The electricity supplier must justify that the data it collects, the tools it uses and the training model it has  chosen to achieve its objectives is relevant and free from bias. The electricity supplier must ensure that  before the system is put into production, appropriate steps are taken to prevent discrimination and that a  human electricity supplier can verify the quality of the algorithm's outputs.  Finally, the project requires a data protection impact assessment33 as it completes at least one  criterion in the following table34:  Figure 12: Is a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) necessary?  Criteria Does it match the criteria? Justification  Evaluation or scoring  Automated decision making with legal or  similar significant effect  Systematic monitoring X  The processing is not intended to do this.  Nevertheless, the data collected may  allow to determine whether a person is  present at home during certain time  periods.  32 See https://www.cnil.fr/fr/intelligence-artificielle/la-cnil-publie-ressources-grand-public-professionnels  33 See https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-  gdpr/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact- assessments/#:~:text=DPIAs%20are%20a%20legal%20requirement,trust%20and%20engagement%20with%20indivi duals  34  The condition for a DPIA to occur is that at least two conditions are satisfied.

Matching or combining datasets  Data concerning vulnerable data subjects  Innovative use or applying new  technological or organizational solutions X  The use of artificial intelligence in this  scenario: predicting energy production  capacity and demand is innovative.  Preventing data subjects from exercising  a right or using a service or contract  To assess the risks in terms of privacy, personal data processing must consider the following  requirements:  Figure 13: Privacy requirements regarding data  Level Explanation  Availability Low The data, for the user, does not necessarily have to be available. An  unavailability of several days is acceptable.  Integrity Low  The output data of the concentrator is not considered as personal data.  Indeed, at the concentrator output, it is the sum of the consumption data  (from pseudonymised individual consumption data) that is transmitted  to the data scientists. The alteration of this data has no influence on the  users, such as a more expensive billing.  Confidentiality Critical  The personal data processed, in particular the detailed (hourly), is  confidential. The leakage of such data (possible upstream of the  concentrator) would be detrimental to the consumer since it would leak  his address for instance. Moreover, in case of data leakage from smart  meters, it is possible to know the life habits of consumers and when they  are present (high consumption) and when they are absent (low  consumption) from home.  Traceability High  At a minimum, the actions related to the process must be recorded  (traced and dated) to be able to follow the actors involved during the  stages of use of personal data (upstream of the concentrator).  Particularly in the case of court cases, it is necessary to be able to  attribute actions to an individual and to be able to impute them  criminally.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  24  3. SECURITY AND PRIVACY  THREATS AND  VULNERABILITIES  3.1 THREAT CONTEXTUALISATION  This section highlights the threats applicable in the forecasting demand on electricity grids  scenario. Examples in the context of this scenario are also provided. Also outlined are the  impacts that each threat can have in terms of security and privacy as well as their severity in the  table.  There are two major feared events to consider for our scenario which are the loss of integrity of  the data, and the loss of confidentiality of the detailed electricity consumption of inhabitant data.  The loss of integrity of the data could lead to an electrical production disruption. Indeed, the  impact would be maximum if too little energy was produced, and there was insufficient energy  supplied to meet demand. It should be noted, however, that the impact is lessened because the  model only assists and does not make decisions directly. Decision-makers have other indicators  with them to make decisions (minimum value of energy to be produced etc.).  For the company, the loss of confidentiality of the detailed consumption of inhabitant data could  lead to reputation degradation, which can result in loss of trust of the consumer.  For the consumers, the loss of confidentiality of the detailed consumption could have 2 impacts.  First, stolen personal data (home address, for example) could be used to perform phishing  attempts or targeted advertising. Also, if detailed consumption of an inhabitant (either hourly  or half hourly) were to leak, people would be able to identify whether the inhabitant is at home or  not, and it could lead, depending on the case, to unwanted consequences such as robbery (a  burglar might determine the hours at which a person is not a home using his energy  consumption data), separation/divorce (much like phone bills or credit card details might  contain data that the person would consider private, even from his or her spouse), or job loss  (in the case where an employer uses energy consumption data ).  Moreover, non-compliance with certain privacy requirements by the electricity supplier can lead  to impacts on the user such as the significant feeling of invasion of privacy, feeling out of  control of their personal data, or change in energy consumption billing if the data is  processed for other purposes, besides the directly related with this case.  Considering these feared events and associated impacts, the following threats are associated  with our scenario.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  25  Before going into the details of the threats and vulnerabilities to which this scenario is subject,  the following figure summarises all the threats that will be explained subsequently:  Figure 14: Summary of threats and vulnerabilities  3.1.1 Compromise of ML application components  An external attacker can directly compromise smart meters, the concentrator, or the API to  retrieve weather or demographic data if they are exposed. If one of these components is  compromised, the manipulated data can be modified, leading to an electrical production  disruption.  Data scientists, developers and the various stakeholders involved could have their workstations  compromised by an external attacker (directly by using insecure code libraries, for example)  which could compromise the ML components. The attacker would then be able either to modify  the manipulated data, leading to an electrical production disruption, or steal confidential data  (detailed consumption of inhabitant), leading to reputation degradation for the company,  significant feeling of invasion of privacy, phishing attempts, or targeted advertising or  even robbery, separation/divorce, or job loss for the consumers.  3.1.2 Poisoning  During the data collection phase, an external attacker or a malicious user could compromise  one or more smart meters (via a worm for instance) to create outliers which would then  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  26  constitute historical consumption data. Once the model used to predict the next day  consumption has been trained with such data, it could overestimate electricity consumption,  leading to an electrical production disruption.  In this idea of data modification and after having collected the data, any attacker with sufficient  rights and access to the data lake could modify the training data to make the model operate with  undesired characteristics, and could even render the model dysfunctional. This could lead to an  electrical production disruption.  3.1.3 Human error  A data engineer could route the consumption data from the concentrator to the data lake without  aggregating and anonymising it. Such a threat could lead to a potential data disclosure which  could entail reputation degradation for the company, a significant feeling of invasion of  privacy, phishing attempts, or targeted advertising or even robbery, separation/divorce,  or job loss for the consumers.  3.1.4 Data disclosure  Throughout the scenario lifecycle, an attacker can try to compromise the concentrator to collect  stored personal data relating to energy consumption, even where there is no data retention after  sending the aggregated data to the data lake. This can be done by physical tampering with the  concentrator, or by exploiting vulnerabilities through access to the electricity supplier's electrical  network via its smart meters. Resultingly, an attacker with multiple smart meters connected to  the electricity supplier’s electrical grid could directly attack other smart meters on the same  network to collect consumption data.  For the company, these data leaks can lead to reputation degradation. For the electricity  consumers, they can lead to significant feeling of invasion of privacy, phishing attempts,  targeted advertising, or even robbery, separation, or divorce and/or job loss.  3.1.5 Unlawful Processing  There are two cases where two different legal bases should be applied. First, when the  electricity supplier wishes to extract the energy consumption of the inhabitants on an hourly or  half-hourly basis, it should ask for the users' consent, and proceed to process only when this  consent has been given freely, clearly, specifically and knowingly by the user. Second, in the  case of daily extraction, the electricity supplier extracts the consumption data based on  legitimate interest.  In the case where the electricity supplier was to collect data on an hourly or half-hourly basis  without having obtained the user’s prior consent beforehand (or otherwise offering opportunity  to withdraw consent), the impact on consumers would be a significant sense of invasion of  privacy. Their data extracted without their consent would lead to a total lack of trust in the  electricity supplier. In addition, the legitimate interest in the day-to-day processing of consumer  data may not be adequately justified by the electricity supplier or worse, no justification may be  provided. In this scenario, users may question the purpose of the use of their personal data and  feel a significant feeling of invasion of privacy.  3.1.6 Unfair processing  Even if the electricity supplier demonstrates that the data processing has a lawful basis  (depending on the level of data extraction: daily or hourly), it might not process the personal  data in the way consumers expect it to be i.e. for energy demand forecasting only. They could  use it in a way that has an unjustified negative effect on them, such as unknowingly changing  their billing based on consumption forecasts made by the algorithm.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  27  3.1.7 Lack of transparency  The electricity supplier may also not be transparent with users about how their personal data is  used and the goal of the use of their data. The terms governing these aspects may not be  included or may be deliberately omitted by the electricity supplier in, for example, the contract  with its customers. The impact this could have on consumers could result in a feeling of being  not in control of personal data.  3.1.8 Diversion of purpose  The user data extracted in our case is intended to predict consumer energy demand. However,  the electricity supplier may not respect this principle and use the consumer data for ambiguous  and non-explicit purposes unrelated to the prediction of energy demand, such as using their  data to offer other services or to resell them. For instance, users might be profiled based on  their energy consumption and could receive targeted advertisements. Using this data to learn  about users' routines and habits could be considered a serious invasion of users' privacy. In the  wrong hands, this data could even be used against the physical security of consumers.  An even more extreme diversion from the purpose of this information collection could facilitate  the surveillance of users; the person in possession of the model and the data could examine the  habits of the users to work out whether or not the consumer is at home. The impact this could  have on consumers could lead to robbery, or separation/divorce, or job loss.  3.1.9 No respect of data minimisation  This could materialise in the form of collecting more data than necessary at the smart meter  level or by using more data than necessary at the hub level. For instance, smart meters could  collect much more accurate data such as real-time consumption that can be used to track the  consumer. The impact this could have on consumers could lead to a significant feeling of  invasion of privacy, separation/divorce, job loss in case of data leakage or to potential  phishing attempts, targeted advertising, or even robbery.  3.1.10 No respect of storage limitation  Data extracted from smart meters of individual households are routed to the concentrator level  and amalgamated. This means that no household specific data should be stored after  amalgamation. Without clear rules for storing and removing personal data at the concentrator  level, the electricity supplier could decide to store user data in the concentrator database for  several months when it is not operationally justified. If this data were to be stolen or leaked, the  impact to the user could be separation/divorce, job loss, potential phishing attempts,  targeted advertising, or even robbery.  3.1.11 Synthesis of possible impacts and associated threats  The following table sums up the severity of each impact and the associated threats.

However, this is not necessarily  the case. We therefore draw the reader's attention to this point.

CYBERSECURITY AND  PRIVACY CONTROLS  Before expanding on the details of the cybersecurity and privacy controls applied to the  scenario, the following figure summarizes all the controls that will be described:  Figure 17: Summary of cybersecurity and privacy controls  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  34  4.1 IMPLEMENT A SECURITY BY DESIGN PROCESS  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity Lack of Security by Design  • Compromise of ML application  components  • Poisoning  • Human error  • Data disclosure  By default, Security by Design is a methodology to strengthen the cybersecurity of the  organisation by automating its data security controls and developing a robust IT infrastructure.  This approach focuses on implementing the security protocols from the basic building blocks of  the entire IT infrastructure design. The goal of this control is to ensure that risks are identified as  early as possible, mitigated before systems go live, and appropriate security controls are  implemented.  The lack of Security by Design increases the likelihood of all threats related to our case.  Therefore, the electricity supplier must ensure, from the development phase, to put in place  adequate controls to limit the cybersecurity risk. This starts with a global risk analysis in which  all risks associated with all assets are identified. In our case, the electricity supplier will try to  reduce the attack surface (for example by updating the smart meters' operating system  continuously), to apply the principle of least privilege (by implementing access rights  management), to take care of the confidentiality and integrity of the collected data (by  encrypting the users' consumption data for example).  Conceiving a project following a Security by Design methodology requires less effort than  adding security on top of an existing project. However, there could be an impact on the  functionality of the use if the outcome of the Security by Design methodology would lead to  some functionality not being implemented due to the security risk it generates (e.g., installation  of unsecure smart meters).  4.2 DOCUMENT THE ELECTRICAL FORECAST SYSTEM  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity  & Privacy  Lack of Electrical forecast system documentation  • Human error  • Unlawful processing  • Unfair processing  • Lack of transparency  • Diversion of purpose  • No respect of data minimisation  • No respect of storage limitation  Project and system documentation must be produced to preserve knowledge on decisions  made during the project phase, application architecture, configuration, maintenance, ability to  maintain effectiveness over time, and assumptions made about the model’s use.  The system is complex with multiple assets (Open-Data provider, smart meters, concentrator,  etc.) which enhance the fact that an exhaustive documentation is mandatory for all assets. This  documentation should also include the changes that will be applied, including to the  documentation throughout the system life cycle.  Therefore, it is necessary that the Open-Data Provider, Data Scientists, Developers, Data  Engineers, and System and communication network administrators work together to create and  sustain the documentation.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  35  This control does not impact system performance, cybersecurity, or privacy.  4.3 CHECK THE VULNERABILITIES OF THE ML COMPONENTS AND  IMPLEMENT PROCESSES TO MAINTAIN THEIR SECURITY LEVELS  OVER TIME  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity  & Privacy  • Use of vulnerable components  • Lack of security process to maintain a  good security level of the components of  the Electrical forecast system  • Compromise of ML application  components  • Data disclosure  For smart meters and the concentrator, it is necessary for the company to ensure that regular  security audits are carried out to ensure there are no vulnerabilities. Regular vulnerability scans  and automatic patch management processes should also be implemented to maintain a good  security level. Preparation of a remediation plan that can be implemented quickly must be  committed to, with the capacity to review this plan over time.  One differentiating factor for smart meters is that they can be considered as IoT devices, for  which audits need specific expertise. Although these devices are connected to the network as  regular devices, they also have an interface with the physical world. In our case, smart meters  interface with the consumer’s electrical system, which could be a source of vulnerability.  For Open-Data provider APIs, it is necessary to define a process to ensure that the level of  Open-Data provider security is sufficient over time to avoid data recovery. This could mean an  annual audit of the APIs and the completion of an annual security questionnaire.  This control would have an impact on the availability of the system, and thus its performance, as  it may be audited or updated. This could lead to periodic unavailability of the system for several  hours at a time. However, as the availability need of the system is low, the impact of this control  is only moderate.  Moreover, updates could cause the system to malfunction, leading to errors in the prediction  systems that could have a major impact.  4.4 CHOOSE AND DEFINE A MORE RESILIENT MODEL DESIGN  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity Model easy to poison Poisoning  Poisoning of the model could cause electrical production disruption, which would have a high  impact for the company. For this reason, the company needs to ensure that the model is fully  resilient against this type of attack.  For the electrical forecast system, a methodology to harden the system against poisoning  threats could be use of the “Bagging” (bootstrap aggregating) technique37. This is a machine  learning ensemble meta-algorithm designed to improve the stability and accuracy of machine  learning algorithms, which combines several versions of the model (e.g., models trained with  37 https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.695.4667&rep=rep1&type=pdf  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  36  different datasets) to limit the impacts related to the poisoning of one of the models. In this case,  the company could generate multiple models from different data sets (weather data and  consumption of each different years for example) and use a Bagging algorithm with these  models to predict the consumption of electricity. If an attacker were to succeed in poisoning one  of the models, the effect on the outputs of the system would be greatly reduced, or even  mitigated completely, due to the prediction also relying on the other healthy models.  This could have an impact on performance of the model as the most representative data is from  the most recent year, and using data from previous years would make the prediction less  accurate.  4.5 INTEGRATE POISONING CONTROL IN THE TRAINING DATASET  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity  • No detection of  poisoned samples in  the training dataset  • Lack of control for  poisoning  Poisoning  In addition to the previous control, and to reduce to a minimum the probability of the models  being poisoned, the training dataset should be checked for poisoning.  The RNN algorithm used in our scenario can be checked for poisoning using the STRIP  technique. This principle relies on disturbing the inputs and observing the randomness of the  predictions. For example, the company could change 1 week of weather data, replacing  summer data with winter data, and observe the variance in predictions versus unperturbed.  Without high variance, the model could be considered as poisoned. These tests should be  performed before the production phase, during the training phase, ensuring that the models  used in production are healthy.  This control doesn't have impact on system performance, cybersecurity, or privacy.  4.6 ENLARGE THE TRAINING DATASET  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity Lack of data for increasing robustness to  poisoning  Poisoning  Large timeframes (multiple years) of weather data can be collected and used to train the  algorithm to prevent it being susceptible to poisoning attacks. Modifying small amount of  weather data would then have a low impact of the overall prediction.  Using large timeframes (multiple years) of inhabitant consumption data could also reduce the  probability that poising attacks on this data could impact the prediction. This could still have an  impact on the model accuracy, considering that weather systems can shift over long timeframes  too, but considering the high impact of disruption to electrical production, this control should still  be implemented. Long timeframes of consumption data would not impact consumer privacy as  any stored data would be the anonymised after the concentrator.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  37  4.7 SECURE THE TRANSIT OF THE COLLECTED DATA  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity Poor data management Poisoning  Considering the possible impacts of Poisoning, the transit of the collected data should be fully  protected against a loss of integrity. Within the collection phase of weather data or inhabitant  consumption data, the electrical company should ensure that protocols used for the transfer of  data are encrypted and otherwise state of the art (without any known vulnerabilities), such as  TLS 1.3. As such, an attacker would not be able to modify the data during transit, and would not  be able to poison the model through that route.  Generally, Open-Data suppliers comply with this level of requirement. This control would not  impact on privacy or performance of the system.  4.8 CONTROL ALL DATA USED BY THE ML MODEL  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity Use of uncontrolled data Poisoning  Considering the high impacts of Poisoning attacks, several means to control the data must be  applied, some specific to data science and others more to business- common-practice. These  techniques can be applied at the concentrator level and then in the data lake. At the  concentrator level, the incoming data is not yet aggregated, so an initial check can be carried  out to avoid inconsistent data.  There are two common cases of inconsistent data – inconsistency of data type (e.g.,  alphanumeric vs number) and inconsistency of data value. To prevent this, checks should be  performed for the two different cases. An example of an inconsistent value would be to  determine whether a consumption figure is abnormally high in relation to previous data, contract  data, data from other consumers. Once abnormal data is detected, it can be readjusted before  following the data aggregation procedure to the data lake.  At the data lake level, more controls can be carried out:  • Non-technical checks such as checking the overall consistency of the data (for  example checking variability of the weather data)  • Technical checks specific to data science and the data sanitisation process to detect  possible anomalies (otherwise known as outlier detection).  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  38  This control could add latency to the system in case of many reported anomalies on the data.  But our scenario does not have a strong need for availability, and the control is important to  reduce the probability of model poisoning.  The checks that are applied at the concentrator level could have an impact on privacy, because  they would manipulate personal data from consumers. To remediate, the systems (software,  scripts, excel sheets, etc.) used to perform these checks should be regularly audited,  documented, secured by design, and follow access control rules (authentication to use the  system, proper access management, etc.).  4.9 ENSURE RELIABLE SOURCES ARE USED  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity  Use of unsafe data or models (e.g., with transfer  learning)  Poisoning  Considering the possible disruption of electrical production due to poisoning attacks, it is  mandatory for the company to ensure the reliability of the sources used to collect the data. For  weather and demographic data, which is collected from an Open-Data Provider, this should be  of a reliable standard, ideally audited once a year to ensure that it doesn’t have any vulnerability  that could lead to a loss of integrity of the data.  Moreover, and considering the criticality of the  poisoning threat, the data can be crossed between several sources to reduce the impact when  one of the sources is compromised.  However, crossing data from multiple sources could introduce errors within the data set which  could alter the model and its performance. Our scenario does not have a strong need for  availability.  4.10 IMPLEMENT ACCESS RIGHT MANAGEMENT PROCESS  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity  & Privacy  Poor access rights management  • Compromise of ML application  components  • Poisoning  • Data disclosure  • Human error  Threats related to poor access rights management, such as data disclosure, can have a high  impact on the company (electrical production disruption) or on the consumers (robbery,  separation/divorce or job loss). This security measure defines and assigns roles to users,  respecting the principle of least privilege, and limits the access scenarios for processes and  assets only to those for which the users have a justified reason.  For all the classical systems of our scenario, such as Concentrator, Data lake, Model server,  Dashboard tools, and Integrated Development Environment, it is essential to create roles for  each user group with associated access rules. These work alongside a process for providing  access only to the actors that need it, and to prevent access to unauthorised persons. Each role  must respect the principle of least privilege, in particular the roles that can connect to the  concentrator as they allow access to all the consumption data and associated personal data. By  default, only administrators and data engineers would have this access. It is also very important  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  39  to have a process for modifying or revoking user access in timely manner, as long processes for  access management generally result in neglect by an organisation.  Considering the high volume of smart meter devices, the administration account would likely  need to be generic, with the account password stored within an administration Bastion. Then,  only mandated electricity supplier’s teams would have the ability to have access this Bastion  and connect to the smart meters.  In case of an incident or failure, the complexity of the management of these accesses,  particularly for the smart meters, could prevent teams from accessing the system to correct  potential problems, which could impact the availability of the system, thus its performance.  4.11 ENSURE ALL SYSTEMS AND DEVICES COMPLY WITH  AUTHENTICATION, AND ACCESS CONTROL POLICIES  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity  & Privacy  • Weak access protection mechanisms for  machine learning model components  • Weak access protection mechanisms of  the personal data (encryption, access  control mechanism…)  • Compromise of ML application  components  • Poisoning  • Data disclosure  • Human error  In this control there must be a distinction made between user access and device access. For  user access, the Electrical Company must ensure that proper user authentication and access  controls regulate access to Smart meters, the Concentrator, the data lake, the Model server, the  Dashboard tools, and the Integrated Development Environment. Such access authentication  and access control should be managed centrally, with a dedicated solution (e.g., Active  Directory) linked to all these assets, except in the case of smart meters, where authentication  should remain local due to the high volume of devices. Moreover, for sensitive assets  manipulating personal data, such as the concentrator, the electrical company should implement  multi-factor authentication for the data engineers and administrators that are granted access.  The multi-factor authentication solution must be linked to the central authentication system.  For device access, the electrical company should ensure that all device-to-device requests are  properly authenticated. To deal with threats, it is important to use good market practices. For  example, use of the OAuth 2.0 protocol for all exposed APIs with control via an API gateway. In  addition, the certificates for the authorisation server keys should be managed through the  company's own Public Key Infrastructure in order to avoid any identity theft scenario. It is also  necessary to respect an authentication policy (based on the current recommendations of bodies  such as ENISA38 or NIST39) for the authentication of devices on the authorisation server. To  protect the secrets in the smart meters, it is necessary to secure them by ensuring that their OS  version is up-to-date, and that non-essential ports are closed, amongst other factors. To protect  access to the company electric network via smart meters, it is necessary to carry out Network  access control with good practices40. However, in case of an incident or a failure, the complexity  of the authentication, especially for the smart meters, could slow down the remediation of the  problem (for example if administrators had trouble authenticating on the system due to the  reinforced authentication) and have an impact on the of availability of the system, thus its  performance.  Additionally, personally authenticating the employees on the system can have an impact on  privacy, because personal data (identifiers, mail addresses, etc) would be recorded in these  38 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/tips-for-secure-user-authentication  39 See https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63-3.pdf  40 See https://cipherwire.net/wp- content/uploads/2013/06/802.1X_and_NAC___Best_Practices_for_Effective_Network_Access_Control.pdf  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  40  authentication systems. These authentication systems must respect the principles of Article 5 of  the GDPR (data minimisation etc).  4.12 REDUCE THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE MODEL  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity  & Privacy Too much information available on the model Compromise of ML application components  This control lowers the likelihood of Compromise of ML application components by limiting the  knowledge of a malicious user about his target and consequently making it more difficult to  launch a cyberattack. It is important to understand that this security control alone is not enough,  as security by obscurity does not provide sufficient protection.  Therefore, all documentation concerning the model itself should be protected. They should be  encrypted and protected by a Data Right Management mechanism, allowing only the Data  Scientists to access them from their computers. Specifically, the documentation can be stored in  a dedicated file server directory to which access rights are regularly reviewed and linked to the  access rights management mechanisms described in 4.10 and 4.11. This server must be  encrypted by default and located in a network zone dedicated to the company's sensitive  resources. In addition, user workstations accessing this file server must be sufficiently  protected. In addition to the rights management mechanisms, it is necessary to provide, at least,  encryption of the workstations, a confidentiality filters fitted to the screens of workstations in  nomadic situations, and securing (OS version up-to-date, closure of non-essential ports etc) of  the workstation to prevent the opening of certain ports and the insertion of USB keys. In  addition, to avoid the propagation of documents relating to the model, it is recommended that a  data loss protection solution be deployed.  This control could have an impact on privacy aspect because it may be considered as a  contradiction to the principle of transparency required by the GDPR. Therefore, it is important to  define documentation that can be communicated to external users (i.e., customers), explaining  that their data is not directly used by the model. Moreover, this control could impact the  performance of the system, because in case of an incident or a failure, the complexity of the  access management could prevent data scientists to have access to the documentation to  correct the problem and have an impact of availability of the system, thus its performance.  4.13 IDENTIFY A DATA CONTROLLER FOR THE ENERGY  CONSUMPTION ANTICIPATION DATA PROCESSING  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Privacy Absence of an identified data controller  • Unlawful processing  • Unfair processing  • Lack of transparency  Identifying a data controller is essential to prevent various high impacts for the company and its  employees due to unlawful processing, unfair processing, or lack of transparency. Self- identifying as the data controller means performing accountability actions (documentation,  assessments, etc.) and making sure that the energy consumption anticipation data processing  is compliant with personal data protection GDPR obligations and does not infringe on privacy  rights of data subjects. Self-identifying as the data controller means also taking responsibility in  case of non-compliance or adverse privacy effects on data subjects.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  41  Such a measure does not have a negative impact in our case. On the contrary, it improves the  privacy of users without impacting the performance of the system or its security.  4.14 PROPERLY COLLECT AND MAINTAIN USER CONSENT WHEN  NEEDED FOR DETAILED ENERGY CONSUMPTION USAGE  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Privacy  • Absence of mechanisms to ensure that the  processing of consumer electricity affected by  consent cannot be carried out without consent  • Lack of legal basis related to user’s consent  when their detailed consumption data (per  hour or half hour) are processed or that the  legitimate interest related to the daily  processing of the data is not properly justified  or that no justification is provided at all  • Lack of practical means and justification for  obtaining the consent of the electricity  consumers concerned  Unlawful processing  When the electricity supplier wants to extract the energy consumption of the inhabitants on an  hourly or half-hourly basis, it should ask first for the users' consent and go on with the  processing of the granular data only when this consent has been given. This means that there  must be an opt-in function in the user interface (e.g., a checkbox) provided by the energy  electricity supplier that the consumers must actively check (opt-in) to agree to provide their  detailed energy consumption. Then, the consent of each user would be stored within a  dedicated database belonging to the company and used accordingly for the collection (or not) of  detailed consumption data. It is as important to ensure that when a subject revokes their  consent, their detailed consumption data is no longer processed.  However, when this control is properly implemented, it is easier for data subjects to withhold  consent for use of their personal data. Therefore, the data collected could be less rich with  proper consent management and could be limited to daily energy consumption for a larger  number of data subjects. In addition, there is a (relatively small) additional cost to implementing  proper consent management. This measure impacts on security, because the company must  protect not only the energy consumption data that the user gives with his consent but also the  storage of the consent over time in a dedicated and secure space. The collection and storage  must have a level of security adapted to the principles of non-repudiation (encryption of the  data, traceability of access to the equipment, signatures via daily private keys in the database of  the dedicated space, etc.).  4.15 ANONYMIZE DATA COMING FROM THE CONCENTRATOR  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Privacy Lack of anonymization No respect of data minimization  The data that could identify consumers are anonymised at the concentrator level.  Anonymisation requires an analysis to correctly identify a subset of fields that irreversibly  prevents re-identification of data subjects and should be performed as early in the processing as  possible. After this identification, a dedicated solution can be used to anonymise the data. It  should also be remembered that the collected data are deleted in the concentrator after the  aggregation of all data from different households.  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  42  In this case the data that need to be anonymised at the concentrator level is the Energy  consumption of inhabitants containing these fields [surname, first name, address, meter  number, telephone number, electricity consumption]. After anonymisation, the remaining fields  should be [city, electricity consumption], with the city field being derived from the address of the  concentrator and the electricity consumption being the sum of consumption by all customers  associated with the concentrator. This is the data that is sent to the data lake.  In this case, in the event of a security breach, it may be more difficult to perform a cybersecurity  forensic analysis on anonymised data than on personally identifiable data. This has the impact  of significantly slowing down the work of those employed to determine the cause of a security  issue. Ultimately, finding security measures for these kinds of vulnerabilities would also create  other security challenges.  4.16 GENERATE LOGS AND PERFORM INTERNAL AUDIT  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity  & Privacy  • Lack of auditability of processing  • Lack of traceability of actions and/or  modifications made to the assets  • Unlawful processing  • Unfair processing  • Lack of transparency  • Diversion of purpose  • No respect of data minimization  • Compromise of Machine Learning  application  • No respect of storage limitation  Generating logs and performing internal audit allows for improvements in supervision of all  assets of the model, creating a better understanding of the decisions made in real time by the  algorithm. This also helps in understanding individual incidents, whilst auditing internal  processes and questioning the processing carried out in the frame of the project reduces the  likelihood of many threats in this scenario.  Therefore, the process must be auditable in the sense that certain questions must always be  answered clearly: Who accessed the data (especially at the concentrator level)? Why did the  algorithm make a particular decision? How exactly was the data processed? To this end, the  technical and organisational parts of the process must generate traces (computer logs, activity  reports, etc.) so that they can be audited. These logs should be stored in a dedicated tool, such  as a log management solution.  The logs provided by the equipment must be signed (using their  own private key) and their signature stored by the server that centralises the logs to ensure a  principle of non-repudiation. In addition, at each (usually daily) backup of the log server, these  backups must also be signed by the log sink to ensure once again the principle of non- repudiation. Moreover, these logs should be analysed by a SOC and rules should be defined to  detect such anomalies as many calls from a smart meter to the concentrator or an abnormal  response. In addition, all processes must be regularly audited by the company's internal control  teams to ensure compliance with the requirements. As far as privacy is concerned, these audits  should at least ensure the lawfulness of the processing, its transparency, its application, the  data minimisation, the respect of the storage limitation and the fairness aspect. These checks  should be based in part on the logs collected.  This control could have an impact on privacy because the generated logs can contain personal  data. This log management system should be included in the privacy impact assessment scope  of the system. Moreover, the logging system should be carefully implemented to avoid  unnecessary overhead due to the extra operations it executes.  4.17 PERFORM A PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  43  Privacy  • Lack of controls to ensure that data is used  only for the purposes defined  • Lack of controls to ensure the adequacy of the  purpose and its current use  • Lack of detail on the purposes and justification  for their legitimacy  • Diversion of purpose  • Unlawful processing  • Unfair processing  • Lack of transparency  This privacy measure allows for an in-depth analysis of the impact of the processing on the  privacy of users, compliance with the GDPR and to identify whether the associated risks are  well addressed by the proposed privacy and security measures.  The privacy impact assessments and general accountability actions described above (in the  internal audit process control) help ensure that the purpose of the processing is well defined  (the prediction of residents' consumption) and that the actual use of the data remains within the  scope of this case. To do so, the electricity supplier should use the requirements described  below, and asses the vulnerabilities of the implemented system, to illustrate privacy threats and  counter measures.  Such analysis may possibly impact the performance of the scenario if it results in one of the  functionalities not allowing to minimise the data protection risks to the rights and freedoms of  natural persons.  4.18 DEFINE AND IMPLEMENT A DATA RETENTION POLICY  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Privacy  • Lack of data deletion mechanisms  • Lack of data retention policy  No respect of storage limitation  This privacy control requires a storage duration value to be defined for each personal data  involved in the processing, including individual detailed consumption data, individual daily  consumption data etc. When this storage duration value is implemented, the privacy control acts  to minimise the risk of keeping the data longer than it is strictly necessary. One way to  implement it is by having a script that automatically deletes the data based on predefined  criteria.  However, once all that data is deleted, it cannot be used later for forensic analysis, as may be  required when a company faces a security breach.  4.19 STUDY ON DATA FIELDS NECESSITY AND JUSTIFICATION IN  THE PRIVACY POLICY  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Privacy  • Lack of justification for the collection of  individual personal data collected  • Lack of transparency on the purpose of the  processing, the exact consumption data that  are extracted, and how they are processed.  • Unlawful processing  • Lack of transparency  • No respect of data minimization  A lack of justification on how data are collected, correlated with a lack of transparency on the  purpose of the processing or on the accuracy of the data collected could result in unlawful  processing which would have moderate impact for the consumer (significant sense of invasion  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  44  of privacy). Therefore, the electricity supplier must study the necessity of different data fields  and justify this in the privacy policy.  The personal data used is the consumption data (daily or hourly) of the inhabitants. The  electricity supplier must therefore implement a privacy control in which they could explain why it  is necessary to use this data specifically in the context of this scenario. The supplier must also  formalise the explanation and make it freely available to consumers.  Nevertheless, this practice may have some impact on the relevance of the data collected.  Taking time to justify the need for data may lead to the abandonment of the collection of some  data for which justification is difficult, which in turn, may reduce the quality of the data at hand.  4.20 FORMALISE A LIA (LEGITIMATE INTEREST ASSESSMENT)  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Privacy Lack of legal basis related to legitimate interest Unlawful processing  The Legitimate Interest Impact Assessment (LIA)41 is used to determine if an organisation can  process data using the legitimate interest lawful basis. In our case, the legal basis for the  extraction of daily consumption data is legitimate interest. If the electricity supplier does not  justify this legal basis, it faces unlawful processing. To justify the legal basis, the electricity  supplier must put in place a LIA. In this LIA, the electricity supplier must formalise a reflection on  how the data processing is necessary, and how it balances with the rights and freedoms of  consumers.  The impact this could have on the electricity supplier would be a loss of time and energy spent  formalising the LIA.  4.21 MINIMISE DATA AT EACH STEP OF THE PROCESSING; COLLECT  ONLY WHAT IS NEEDED WHEN NEEDED  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Privacy  • Lack of necessary data selection  • Lack of verification that the data is  adequate, relevant, and not excessive for  the purpose of estimating electricity  consumption  No respect of data minimisation  Minimisation requires an analysis to correctly identify the subset of fields which are required,  and should be performed as early as possible during processing. Non-minimisation of data is  the lack of selection of necessary, adequate, and relevant data.  For example, in our case, the electricity supplier only requires the consumption data of  individuals. The electricity supplier extracts two types of consumption data: the daily  consumption and the consumption at the half-hour scale. A study on the necessity of collecting  data at the hourly scale must be done and a proof of its necessity made public. Then, the  41 See https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation- gdpr/legitimate-interests/how-do-we-apply-legitimate-interests-in- practice/#:~:text=There's%20no%20defined%20process%2C%20but,(consider%20the%20individual's%20interests).  CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY IN AI – FORECASTING DEMAND ON ELECTRICITY  GRIDS  June 2023  45  extracted individual data should be anonymised at the hub level and aggregated with other data  from other households before being sent to the model.  However, data minimisation also involves data anonymisation. In this case, in the event of a  security breach, it may be more difficult to perform a cybersecurity forensic analysis on  anonymised data than on personally identifiable data. This has the impact of significantly  slowing down the work of those employed to determine the cause of a security issue.  4.22 IMPLEMENT A PRIVACY BY DESIGN PROCESS  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Privacy Lack of Privacy by Design  • Unlawful processing  • Unfair processing  • Lack of transparency  • Diversion of purpose  • No respect of data minimization  The electricity supplier must ensure that a compliance study and privacy risk assessment is  formalised in a Privacy Impact Analysis document, and that the identified action plan is  implemented before the scenario is put into operation.  Conceiving a project following a Privacy be Design methodology requires less effort than adding  privacy on top of an existing project. However, there could be an impact on the functionality of  the scenario if the outcome of the Privacy by Design methodology leads to functionality not  being implemented due to the privacy risk it generates (bear in mind that in our case, personal  data is anonymised and then aggregated and deleted at the concentrator). Another impact of  note is related to security, as it may not be possible to collect data useful for forensic analysis  following a cyber-attack due to privacy limitations.  4.23 RAISE AWARENESS OF SECURITY AND PRIVACY ISSUES  AMONG ALL STAKEHOLDERS  Type Associated Vulnerabilities Threats it mitigates  Cybersecurity  & privacy  Lack of consideration of attacks to which the  energy forecasting system could be exposed  • Poisoning  • Data disclosure  • Unlawful processing  • Unfair processing  • Lack of transparency  • Diversion of purpose  • No respect of data minimization  There are many threats with high impact in this scenario, and the company must ensure that  such threats are comprehended by the teams. For instance, the company must ensure that all  its teams (including Data Scientists) are trained in the specificities of machine learning and the  new associated cyber and privacy risks.  This can take the form of regular training sessions or local cyber and privacy risks reporting.  This raises awareness of issues to teams, and in some cases can present solutions tailored to  the specificities of forecasting demand on electricity grids scenario.  This control does not directly impact performance of the system.

CONCLUSION  In this report, analysis of forecasting demand on electricity grids supported by Artificial  Intelligence (AI) is presented. AI is often used as an umbrella term that encompasses the  technology behind many smart solutions and devices. It is a constantly evolving field where new  innovations appear regularly in different areas of activity.  Even though AI can be very beneficial for the industries areas it applies to, it can also have  quite a significant impact for security and privacy, especially when these systems have sensitive  functionalities, as for the scenario that is described in this report. Indeed, AI comes with a wide  range of privacy and security vulnerabilities causing threats with heavy impacts for  organisations.  Regardless how AI is being used in support of business functionality, it should not be a surprise  that the many identified threats are similar. However, we must be aware of the fact that  depending on the context of the scenario, the same threats apply differently and have different  levels of impact. Regarding the impact of each threat, it must be also noted that even in the  same scenario every instance is unique, and a proper study must be carried out by each  company using AI to maintain a proper security and privacy level.  This guide helps in the identification and evaluation of threats in a specific business scenario  which uses AI, but it is important to remember that while the analyzed scenario is based on real  life examples, it includes assumptions which may not match the business context in which other  organizations would like to implement in. Therefore, the entire cybersecurity and privacy context  (requirements, threats, vulnerabilities, and controls) must be adapted to the context and reality  of the individual business. In addition, the controls proposed in this document are not sufficient  on their own, and must be complemented by the standard security measures that already exist.  While security and privacy are not necessarily the same, they are intimately related, and equally  important. In their management, a balance must be found between the two in the sense that  one must always make sure that the regulations and recommendations concerning the two  aspects are always respected. Unfortunately, these two parameters are regularly at the  expense of performance. It is therefore an equation with three variables, two of which respond  to the need for regulation and risk, which need to be correctly balanced to achieve the desired  effect.

The figure below summarises such requirements.  Requirements Article  Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency Art. 5.a  Purpose limitation  Art. 5.b  Data minimisation Art. 5.c  Accuracy Art. 5.d  Storage limitation Art. 5.e  Security of personal data (integrity and confidentiality) Art. 5.f  Moreover, as a complement to the GDPR requirements listed above, some key privacy topics  related to AI systems need to be addressed (some of them are specifically mentioned by  national data protection supervisory authorities44). These additional privacy requirements are  listed below:  Recommendations Details  Database creation  Projects must ensure the compliance of the data collected and injected  into the database for training and in production. Moreover, they must  ensure that only legitimate persons have access to the data in the  database, prevent data loss and hide personal data.  Compliance of the training model  (i.e., before production)  The data collected and the training model must be processed in  accordance with the state of the art of Machine Learning development to  guarantee control of all processes carried out.  This consists, for instance, of good justifications for the chosen learning  method, the reliability of the third-party tools used, paying attention to  open-source data, conducting a meticulous training protocol based on the  state of the art, and finally verifying the quality of the system once in the  experimentation phase.45  44 Such as the CNIL.

    "abstract": "This report allows better assessment of the reality that artificial intelligence brings its own set of threats, which consequently insists on the search for new security measures to counter them. Finally, it should be noted that this guide strongly emphasises privacy issues in the same way as cybersecurity issues, privacy being one of the most important challenges facing society today. Security and privacy are intimately related, but both equally important, and a balance must be made specific to each use. As a result, as seen in this report, efforts to optimise security and privacy can often come at the expense of system performance."

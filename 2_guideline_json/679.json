If you typed the URL of some well- known US internet service providers into your browser there was no response1, and no online services  available. The reason - the Mirai botnet2 had hacked millions of Internet-Of-Things devices and collectively  performed a Denial-Of-Service attack on a Domain-Name-Service provider with the result that the IP- addresses of hundreds of company services could not be accessed anymore. It was like removing the  telephone number of these organisations in a way that customers could not contact them.  Estonia 20073, Georgia 20084, Iran (Stuxnet) 20105, the Snowden6 revelations of 2013, the scandal of  hacked emails7 in US election in 2016 are only a few examples of the new virtual Wild West in cyber space.  In the past, one needed a gun to rob a bank, today an equivalent amount of damage can be achieved from  the action of a fingertip on a keyboard. This exercise can be performed from any place in the world. Crime,  espionage, sabotage and even international conflicts move from the so-called real world into the virtual  cyber world. On top of this, the terrorists’ attacks in Brussels and Berlin last year resulted in a new debate  on the use of cryptography8 linked to criminal justice in cyber space9.  Are we prepared to address the real challenge arising from new threats and the new hybrid threat  landscape? Yes and No. This question does not have a straight answer.  In 2009, the European Commission published the Communication on Critical Information Infrastructure  Protection (CIIP) 10. In the following years, COM launched several strategies: the EU Cybersecurity strategy  in 201311, the European Agenda on Security in 201512, (where cyber issues are mentioned, including  fighting cyber crime however, ENISA is not mentioned) and the Digital Marketing Strategy13.  1 2016 cyberattack, available at: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack  2 Dyn Analysis Summary Of Friday October 21 Attack, October 26th, 2016, available at: http://dyn.com/blog/dyn-analysis- summary-of-friday-october-21-attack/  3 2007 cyberattacks on Estonia, available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_Estonia  4 Cyberattacks during the Russo-Georgian War, available at:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattacks_during_the_Russo-Georgian_War  5 Stuxnet, computer worm, discovered in June 2010, available at: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet  6 Edward Snowden, American whistleblower and former National Security Agency contractor, available at:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden  7 Hillary Clinton Email Archive on WikiLeaks, available at: https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/30373  8 Encryption: Challenges for criminal justice in relation to the use of encryption - future steps, November 2016, Presidency  progress report no. 14711/16, available at: http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14711-2016-INIT/en/pdf  9 Outcome of the 3508th Council meeting on Justice and Home Affairs, 15391/16, December 2016, page 7, available at:  http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/jha/2016/12/st15391_en16_pdf/  10 COM Communication on CIIP, COM(2009) 149 final, available at:  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF  11 Cybersecurity Strategy of the EU (2013), JOIN (2013) 1 final, – see Annex B.  12 The European Agenda on Security (2015), COM/2015/0185 final, – see Annex B.  13 Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe (DSM) (2015), COM/2015/0192 final, – see Annex B.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack http://dyn.com/blog/dyn-analysis-summary-of-friday-october-21-attack/ http://dyn.com/blog/dyn-analysis-summary-of-friday-october-21-attack/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_Estonia https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattacks_during_the_Russo-Georgian_War https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/30373 http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14711-2016-INIT/en/pdf http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/jha/2016/12/st15391_en16_pdf/ http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  03  Furthermore, in 2016, a Joint Framework on countering hybrid threats14 was published and the cPPP  initiative15 was launched.  The European Parliament and Council adopted in 2016 the General Data  Protection Regulation (GDPR)16, Law Enforcement Authorities (LEA) data protection Directive17, the  Passenger Name Records Directive18 and the NIS directive19. These initiatives demonstrate that political  awareness results in political action.  On the implementation side, ENISA was established in 2004 to support the security of network and  information systems across the EU, and its mandate was renewed in 2009 and 201320. Even with its limited  resources, of about €11 Million /year, ENISA has published and covered nearly every upcoming topic  relevant for cybersecurity and cyber space. Examples of published reports include ENISA Threat Landscape,  activities on exercises, reports on Smart Airports, Smart cities, eHealth, to name a few21.  However, this is not enough!  If someone looks into the evolution of information technology and computer science, the last decades  were governed by Moore’s law, i.e. more and more computer power, scalable availability everywhere (i.e.  cloud computing), and easy to use devices (i.e. smartphones). These technologies have challenged  traditional business models and have resulted in the concept of disruptive technologies. Nevertheless, with  the latest discussions that the US presidential elections were influenced by state actors22 and the fear that  the upcoming French, German and Dutch elections23 24 25 could be manipulated, cybersecurity is also now  seen as global political challenge.  EU bodies and institutions should work in a harmonized manner, to address the challenges and  opportunities of cybersecurity. While this topic is generally driven from an infrastructure perspective, it is  currently becoming a topic of foreign and security policy.  Existing institutions, like ENISA, should be strengthened and their role expanded to leverage their technical  expertise in NIS, their ability to cooperate with EU institutions and bodies and with MS national authorities  on NIS topics, as well as on data protection and cybercrime.  The geopolitical challenges should be considered when assessing the EU cybersecurity architecture, when  clarifying the roles and responsibilities in all the security lifecycle steps ranging from protection, prevention  to mitigation and response/defence in reaction to cyber incidents. In this regard, ENISA needs to support  14 Joint Communication on countering hybrid threats (2016), JOIN/2016/018 final, – see Annex B.  15 See COM communication 0410/2016 on cPPP (Cybersecurity Public-Private partnership) (2016) and COM decision C(2016)4400  on cPPP (2016) in Annex B.  16 General Data Protection Regulation (2016) (GDPR), Regulation (EU) 2016/679, – see Annex B.  17 LEA Data protection Directive (2016), Directive (2016) (EU) 2016/680, – see Annex B.  18 PNR (passenger name record) Directive (2016), Directive (EU) 2016/681, – see Annex B.  19 The NIS Directive, Directive (EU) 2016/1148, – see Annex B.  20 ENISA Regulation (2013), Regulation (EU) No 526/2013, – see Annex B.  21 ENISA publications available at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications  22 US intelligence report: Vladimir Putin 'ordered' operation to get Trump elected, The Guardian, available at:  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/06/vladimir-putin-us-election-interference-report-donald-trump  23 Russian cyber-attacks could influence German election, says Merkel, The Guardian, available at:  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/russian-cyber-attacks-could-influence-german-election-says-merkel  24 France’s Hollande seeks ‘specific measures’ against election hacking, Politico, 15/02/2017, available at:  http://www.politico.eu/article/frances-hollande-seeks-specific-measures-against-election-hacking-russia-putin/  25 Dutch will count all election ballots by hand to thwart hacking, The Guardian, available at:  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/02/dutch-will-count-all-election-ballots-by-hand-to-thwart-cyber-hacking  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/06/vladimir-putin-us-election-interference-report-donald-trump https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/russian-cyber-attacks-could-influence-german-election-says-merkel http://www.politico.eu/article/frances-hollande-seeks-specific-measures-against-election-hacking-russia-putin/ https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/02/dutch-will-count-all-election-ballots-by-hand-to-thwart-cyber-hacking  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  04  the EU foreign security and defence policy.  To face the technological, geopolitical and economic  challenges in the EU, two essential things need to be addressed:  1. The EU Commission, together with the MSs, to examine and adjust where necessary the current  European governance structure regarding ICT and cybersecurity,  2. Significantly strengthen the mandate of ENISA, especially to give ENISA a stronger position in  addressing the cybersecurity lifecycle challenges and improving the ability to address its own  initiative tasks list. It is acknowledged that this will require an increase in its budget.  The current evaluation of ENISA and the envisaged new ENISA mandate proposal of the Commission is a  unique opportunity to address the challenges mentioned above.  This document is intended to support and foster the discussions on ENISA’s mandate. It summarises the  current landscape and raises topics and ideas for the future and a stronger mandate for ENISA. The target  audience of this document are primarily the political decision makers in Brussels (the Commission, the EU  Parliament, and the Council) and the representatives of the member states. The target audience also  includes our stakeholders in industry and academia.  We welcome input and discussion from all. It is hoped  that the forthcoming discussions on the future of ENISA will well position the agency to meet the  challenges of the cyber space of the future.  The main areas in which ENISA believes its mandate should be expended are as follows:  1. Organic growth: continuing the evolution of the functions of the Agency to address the latest  cybersecurity challenges including reinforcing the role in securing CIIP.  2. Policy advice: provision of strategic policy advice to the EU institutions and MS in relation to  cybersecurity; ENISA should also be in a position to produce its own initiative policy advice. This  includes:  Aligning cybersecurity research with policy & commercialisation,  Addressing cybersecurity policy fragmentation,  Involvement in all key policy initiatives.  3. Information and capability building: ENISA as the EU Cybersecurity Information/coordination Hub  offering high quality cybersecurity analysis and training and strengthens ENISA’s role as a single point  of contact in the area of cyber crisis cooperation / technical support.  4. Cybersecurity lifecycle: getting more involved in the complete cybersecurity lifecycle, including  practical, “hands-on” support and an incident response (coordination) capacity,  5. Economics of cybersecurity: including better engagement with industry to leverage economic  opportunities in the EU from cybersecurity,  6. Standards and certification: ENISA developing and promoting cybersecurity standards process,  managing ICT security certifications.  7. Coverage of geopolitical and societal developments. This is a logical extension of the work that ENISA  is doing in the area of threat analysis and will provide stakeholders with a more complete picture of  the cybersecurity landscape. In addition, ENISA should be involved in increased international  cooperation.  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  05  I believe that Europe needs a strong cybersecurity agency that addresses the needs and challenges of  information and network security. ENISA is well placed and has the experience of collaborating with the  key stakeholders at Member State and at EU level in this area.  Our political leaders are committed to building the future wealth of the EU by leveraging the opportunities  of the Digital Society. The security of cyber space is particularly important where we use technology that  ignores the traditional boundaries of distance and borders. Cybersecurity is an integral part and extends  from the personal use of ICT to the most complex industrial control systems and critical infrastructures.  New technologies are quickly finding new applications that affect our everyday lives.  ENISA is already working in all these areas, is contributing to the advancing of European network and  information security, and will continue to do so if the necessary resources are put in place.  ENISA has contributed to the EU cybersecurity landscape since 2004. ENISA is addressing and will continue  to address the cybersecurity challenges, to support the political goal of harnessing the opportunities of the  Digital Society.  ENISA’s role needs to be further developed and strengthened to adequately contribute to  the EU cybersecurity world post 2020.  It is against this background I present our vision for a stronger European cybersecurity Agency that will meet  the cybersecurity challenges of the future.

Introduction  The mandate of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) expires on 18th  of June 2020. The renewal of the mandate will require the bringing forward of a proposal by COM26 27and  the agreement of the Council and the Parliament.  The continually changing cybersecurity threat landscape28 and the evolution of related European Union  (EU) policy necessitate a critical look at ENISA’s mandate and tasks.  Given the length of time to bring forward and have adopted EU legislation, discussions are already taking  place on the renewal of the mandate. The mandate of ENISA was renewed in 2009 and 2013. Given the  increasing recognition of the importance of cybersecurity the mandate has evolved and an increasing  amount of functions are being assigned to ENISA by way different pieces of legislation. The most recent and  important tasks for ENISA have emerged from the Adoption of the NIS Directive in 2016 where ENISA was  tasked with functions to support the CSIRT network and the Cooperation group.  In the pursuit of an open, safe and secure cyber space, ENISA supports the EU and the Member States in  enhancing and strengthening their capability and preparedness to prevent, detect and respond to network  and information security problems and incidents. ENISA also supports the development and implementation  of European Union policy and law on matters relating to network and information security (NIS). ENISA is  the European cybersecurity agency, which determines and addresses network and information security  issues, thereby contributing to the proper functioning of the internal market. It also aims to exploit the full  potential of the internal market from the widespread use of information and communications technologies  (ICT) in a safe and secure cyber space. While ICT technologies present business opportunities in cyber space  they also present opportunities for crime and misuse, which need to be considered and addressed.  This document presents a number of strategic themes to be considered in upcoming reflections on the  ENISA mandate and can serve as a basis for discussions as it presents the agency’s position in further  mandate negotiations.  In Section 2, the current context is described including some of the challenges in securing the cyber space.  In Section 3, the current legal basis of ENISA and its evolution as well as the agency’s strategy are introduced.  Besides these, an analysis is presented regarding the drivers for change and analysis of current tasks and  emerging topics. This section lists several strategic themes and additional considerations that are expected  to guide changes to the current mandate.  Section 4 contains ENISA’s vision for the future. It includes opinions on evolution of ENISA and ENISA’s role  in the EU cybersecurity governance. Furthermore, the section includes description of proposed new areas  to be covered by a renewed ENISA mandate, including a mapping of the proposed new tasks into current  ENISA strategy.  26 Article 32 of ENISA regulation (2013) specifies that by 20th of June 2018 the COM shall commission an evaluation. The evaluation  shall address the possible need to modify the mandate of the Agency and the financial implications.  27 COM Work Programme 2017, COM(2016) 710 final, Annex 2, available at https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/work- programme-commission-key-documents-2017_en  28 ENISA publications available at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management?tab=publications  https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/work-programme-commission-key-documents-2017_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/work-programme-commission-key-documents-2017_en https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management?tab=publications  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  08  2. Background  During the past decade new institutions and organisations have been set up across the EU and Member  States to address cybersecurity challenges. This area is developing and the roles and responsibilities of the  institutions involved are still being determined or clarified.  The Global Strategy for the European Union (EUGS)29, which is the strategy for the EU’s foreign and  security policy, and provides priorities for a stronger Europe was adopted by the European Foreign Affairs  Council on October 201630. The EUGS acknowledges the need for a shared vison to cover priorities such as  Security of the Union as well as State and societal resilience.  Enhanced “efforts on defence, cyber, counterterrorism, energy and strategic communication” have also  been identified as a Security of the Union priority. The need for stakeholders to work closely with their  partners, including NATO, has also been highlighted.  In the EUGS it is also mentioned that: “The EU will increase its focus on cybersecurity, equipping the EU and  assisting Member States in protecting themselves against cyber threats while maintaining an open, free  and safe cyber space. This entails strengthening the technological capabilities aimed at mitigating threats  and the resilience of critical infrastructure, networks and services, and reducing cybercrime. It means  fostering innovative information and communication technology (ICT) systems which guarantee the  availability and integrity of data, while ensuring security within the European digital space through  appropriate policies on the location of data storage and the certification of digital products and services. It  requires weaving cyber issues across all policy areas, reinforcing the cyber elements in CSDP missions and  operations, and further developing platforms for cooperation. The EU will support political, operational and  technical cyber cooperation between Member States, notably on analysis and consequence management,  and foster shared assessments between EU structures and the relevant institutions in Member States. It will  enhance its cybersecurity cooperation with core partners such as the US and NATO. The EU’s response will  also be embedded in strong public-private partnerships. Cooperation and information-sharing between  Member States, institutions, the private sector and civil society can foster a common cybersecurity culture,  and raise preparedness for possible cyber disruptions and attacks.”  In the State and societal resilience section of the same EUGS document, it is acknowledged the need for  resilience, which is defined therein as “the ability of states and societies to reform, thus withstanding and  recovering from internal and external crises“, to ensure sustainable security. Resilience is considered in a  wider aspect, encompassing all individuals and the whole of society. “A resilient society is considered to be  a society that features democracy, trust in institutions, and where sustainable development lies at the heart  of a resilient state.”  The EUGS also acknowledges in the last principle – global governance for the 21st Century – that “Without  global norms and the means to enforce them, peace and security, prosperity and democracy – our vital  interests – are at risk.”  29 Shared Vision, Common Action: A Stronger Europe A Global Strategy for the European Union’s Foreign And Security Policy, June  2016, available at: http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/top_stories/pdf/eugs_review_web.pdf  30 EU Foreign Ministers adopted common conclusions on implementing the EU Global Strategy, October 2016, available at:  https://europa.eu/globalstrategy/en/eu-foreign-ministers-adopted-common-conclusions-implementing-eu-global-strategy  http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/top_stories/pdf/eugs_review_web.pdf https://europa.eu/globalstrategy/en/eu-foreign-ministers-adopted-common-conclusions-implementing-eu-global-strategy  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  09  Other COM communications and strategies documents recognise the role of cybersecurity in securing EU’s  future with specified actions i.e. in fighting cybercrime. For instance, The European Agenda on Security  (2015)31, mentions ENISA as contributor to cybersecurity, “to the EU’s response to cybersecurity issues by  working towards a high level of network and information security” when covering priorities such as  ‘fighting cybercrime’. The document entitled “The Joint Framework on countering hybrid threats a  European Union response” (2016)32 also acknowledges the experience of ENISA, in collaboration with MSs,  in setting up security requirements and modalities to notify security incidents and to support convergence  of risk management approaches. Furthermore, in the context of ensuring sound financial systems, the  COM, in collaboration with ENISA, “will promote and facilitate threat information-sharing platforms and  networks and address factors that hinder the exchange of such information.” The COM Communication  entitled Delivering on European Agenda on Security to fight against terrorism (2016)33 has the protection  of citizens and critical infrastructures as an objective. Despite ENISA not being mentioned in this COM  communication, ENISA is adding value in: Standards, Certification, NISD implementation and Information  exchange, etc.  From this short summary, it can be concluded that ENISA is acknowledged as an important stakeholder in  the EU cybersecurity governance arena. In addition, it can be noted that not all documents refer to ENISA.  This could be due to the complex mapping of roles and responsibilities in the cyber space governance of  the EU.  ENISA’s role in a renewed EU cybersecurity governance. Since inception of ENISA in 2004, ENISA’s  mandate has evolved. In 2004, the challenge was seen as a technical challenge addressing information and  network security.  In 2013, the mandate was widened to include references to cybercrime. In 2017, the  natural evolution of the mandate should extend to, inter alia, supporting the European foreign security  and defence policy.  The cybersecurity ecosystem is changing, and this requires an assessment and adaptation of roles and  responsibilities in the different EU institutions and bodies are engaged in cybersecurity.  In the traditional world, roles and responsibilities have been clearly identified and put in place with the  passage of time. However, in cyber space these roles and responsibilities are not so clearly defined. This  situation arises from the fact that cyber challenges do not respect traditional geographic and physical  boundaries. In addition, the speed at which cybercrime, cyber espionage, cyber sabotage and cyber  warfare can take place without any physical presence raises difficulties that could not have been envisaged  in the traditional world.  Attribution in virtual world is vastly more complex than it was in the traditional world. Criminals and state  actors can easily hide behind many networks in different jurisdictions to a level that prosecuting the  criminal to a standard of beyond all reasonable doubt is very rare. Successful attribution may require  multi-disciplinary skill sets, cross border cooperation and the support of the diplomatic community to  ensure the necessary level of cooperation to meet the challenges of modern crime.  31 The European Agenda on Security, COM(2015)185 final (2015), – see Annex B.  32 Framework on countering hybrid threats a European Union response (2016), JOIN/2016/018 final, – see Annex B.  33 COM Communication delivering on the European Agenda on Security to fight against terrorism and pave the way towards an  effective and genuine Security Union (2016), COM(2016) 230 final, April 2016  , – see Annex B.  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  10  In 2013, the Cybersecurity Strategy of the EU (2013) included a comprehensive view of different players  across three key pillars: network and information security (NIS), law enforcement, and defence. It is  obvious that these roles and responsibilities requires an update due to changes in the technical and legal  operation of modern cyber space.  On European level, institutions like EUROPOL (EC3), Cert-EU, EDA, EASA, etc. deal with cybersecurity  related topics. Each of these institutions and bodies across the EU and in the MS have specific  competencies and knowledge bases. This paper does not question their role individually. However, it  proposes an approach for building an EU governance map, which would rely on maximizing inter- institutional cooperation, collaboration and teamwork for most of activities linked to awareness building,  prevention and preparation and information sharing. Thus, cyber coordination at EU level needs to be  enhanced.  Input to EU cybersecurity review process. On May 201734, the European Commission announced that the  EU Cybersecurity Strategy would be reviewed by September 2017. ENISA prepared an input paper35,  covering the priorities and opportunities identified as relevant for this discussion. The input paper includes  also ENISA’s vision on the governance model for EU cybersecurity cooperation, providing details on the  ENISA possible roles and responsibilities. Some of the ideas presented in the input paper are also shortly  covered in the last section of this document.  Defining cybersecurity and clarifying areas of interest. Adding to the complexity of the institutional cyber  landscape, as mentioned already, cyber does not yet have clear, unambiguous definitions. To understand  the scope and challenges in the cybersecurity domain, one must consider how terminology e.g. cyber  space, is defined as well. For this paper, we use the  definitions for cyber space and cybersecurity  provided/proposed in the Terminology Annex A.  Furthermore, from an operational/preventive perspective, it becomes increasingly difficult to separate  cybersecurity from cyber defence and to clarify the meaning of cybercrime, cyber espionage, cyber  warfare, cyber sabotage, and cyber terrorism. The classification of a cyber incident may often be decided  by subjective criteria such as the perception of the attackers, which may be classified as malicious intent,  criminal intent, state actor involvement etc.  As already pointed out before, the attribution of cyber attacks is difficult. Collaboration at global level in all  stages from prevention, preparedness, detection, investigation and prosecution of cyber incidents is still to  be achieved.  There are still questions to be addressed, arising from the lack of clear/final definitions and the cyber  challenges:   How can the line be drawn between civil and military challenges when the origin and scope of an  attack is not easy to identify, for instance while an action cannot yet be defined as i.e. cyberwarfare?   Where does cyber defence becomes cyber offensive/active defence?   How to separate cybersecurity from cyber defence for instance during the first stages of prevention,  analysis, mitigation etc.?   How to separate network and information security (NIS) from cybersecurity when aiming to reduce  vulnerabilities of networks and systems or when developing prevention measures?  34 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/cybersecurity  35 Principles and opportunities for a renewed EU cyber security strategy, ENISA contribution to the Strategy review, 2017,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisa-input-to-the-css-review-b  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisa-input-to-the-css-review-b  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  11   How to handle cross border aspects/global challenges outside of the legal boundaries of states?   Who would be mandated to take active measures to remove ‘small’ vulnerabilities which when used in  context of, for example, Mirai attack where thousands of inoffensive IoT devices were aggregated to  launch significant cyber-attacks?   Who should cover the costs of analysis and damage arising of cyber incidents?  Need for cross EU cooperation and collaboration. In case of cross border cyber incidents, cyber  investigation would require a mix of skills and participation of different institutions/bodies and  collaboration guidelines are required. Inspiration could be aviation investigations processes and  procedures. The collaboration mechanisms, parties, roles and responsibilities have to be defined.  Instead of a fragmented view, cross-domain collaboration is needed in all stages: from prevention,  preparedness and detection, through investigation, to prosecution of cyber incidents.  At EU level the solutions require a need:  (i) to develop strong institutions specialised in NIS able to collaborate and support national  authorities and  (ii) to clarify their roles and interactions in all stages: prevention, preparedness, detection,  investigation and prosecution of incidents, as well as having an active defence capability.  Collaboration and cooperation are key, next to existence of an information hub to improve prevention  and lessons learned. There is a need for a Neutral independent stakeholder. To improve the level of  preparedness it is considered essential to provide this neutral independent stakeholder, with access to  data/information, capacity of analysis, capacity to gather skills and expertise from other institutions i.e. for  the purpose of and cyber investigation.  The objectives of the neutral independent stakeholder would to  (a) identify causes (using the access to all information),  (b) develop lessons learnt and  (c) provide mitigation measures, the follow up tasks – such as updates of security requirements/  measures/ procedures in an open manner for the benefit of EU, MS, business and citizens.  A strong geopolitical NIS related understanding and approach is required. This approach should consider a  security life-cycle vision and a cooperation hub for EU cyber space. The neutral independent stakeholder  should be able to work as a hub: with access to information while also having access to skillsets of other  sectorial institutions. The neutral independent stakeholder should also be the proxy for worldwide  collaboration as the context and impact of the cyber incidents are not contained by physical barriers  anymore. In this case, collaboration with civil, military and LEA authorities is needed.  Lessons learned from other sectors. The above approaches do not differ from the approach taken in the  Aviation industry where international cooperation complements national structures to secure the safety of  the industry in a global context. Cybersecurity presents very similar challenges and similar solutions could  be adopted in EU.  ENISA can play such a role, as a trusted third party, neutral independent stakeholder.

The evolution of ENISA mandate and current opportunities  Evolution of ENISA mandate  ENISA was set up by Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10  March 2004 establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency36 with an initial mandate  valid for five years.  In 2008, Regulation (EU) no 1007/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September  2008 amending Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 establishing the European Network and Information Security  Agency as regards its duration37 extended the validity of ENISA’s up to March 2012.  By virtue of Regulation (EU) no 580/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2011  amending Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 establishing the European Network and Information Security  Agency38, the agency mandate was extended once more up to September 2013.  Finally, Regulation (EU) no 526/201339 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013  concerning the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) and repealing  Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 sets the latest mandate duration (expiring in June 2020).  While previous mandate renewals did not result in substantial changes in mandate, Regulation 526/2013  already streamlines and changes ENISA’s duties in all domains. The table below compares Article 3 “Tasks”  in Regulation 526/2013 with Article 3 “Tasks” in the repealed Regulation 460/2004; the evolution from  original to current mandate sets the scene for the next mandate renewal.  Evolution of mandate  Original 2004 mandate Current 2013 mandate  Policy advice  Collect […] information […] and provide the  results of the analysis […]   Provide […] advice, and when called upon, […]  assistance within its objectives   Providing preparatory work, advice and  analyses relating to […] policy and law   Assisting and advising on all matters relating to  […] policy and law  Specific reference to policy and law – clearer role for ENISA in the legislative process  No reference to “when called upon” – possibility for ENISA to be more proactive  Capability-building  Enhance cooperation […] by organising […]  consultation with industry, universities, as  well as other sectors concerned and by  establishing networks of contacts  (key words):  support, knowledge, cooperation, raising level of  capbility, exercises, collect/analyse/disseminate data,  training  36 Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 establishing the European  Network and Information Security Agency, Official Journal L 077 , 13/03/2004 P. 0001 – 0011, available at: http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0460:EN:HTML.  37 REGULATION (EC) No 1007/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September 2008 amending Regulation  (EC)No460/2004 establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency as regards its duration, available at:  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:293:0001:0002:EN:PDF.  38 Regulation (EU) no 580/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2011 amending Regulation (EC) No  460/2004 establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency as regards its duration, available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/extension-of-enisa2019s-mandate-published-1 .  39 ENISA regulation (2013), Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of 21 May 2013, in References section.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0460:EN:HTML http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0460:EN:HTML http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:293:0001:0002:EN:PDF https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/extension-of-enisa2019s-mandate-published-1  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  13  Evolution of mandate  Original 2004 mandate Current 2013 mandate   Facilitate cooperation […] in the development  of common methodologies  Broad meaning of capability-building  – more “hands on” support and assistnace  Fostering cooperation  and raising awareness   Contribute to awareness raising and the  availability of […] information […] by, inter  alia, promoting exchanges of current best  practices […]   Promote risk assessment activities […]  solutions and studies   Promoting best practices   Supporting […] in organising awareness raising  […] and other outreach activities […]  Broader scope of awareness activities – possibility for ENISA to support awareness-raising activities of other  bodies, and to do other types of outreach  R&D, and  standardisation   Assist […] dialogue with industry to address  security-related problems   Track the development of standards for  [security] products and services   Advise […] on research   Facilitating the establishment and take-up of  […] standards for risk management and […]  security   Advising […] on research needs  More than just “tracking” standards – possibility for ENISA to offer new services  Cooperation with EU  bodies and institutions  N/A  Cooperate with Union institutions, bodies,  offices and agencies, including those dealing  with cybercrime and the protection of privacy  and personal data, with a view to addressing  issues of common concern [by]:  o Exchanging know-how and best  practices  o Providing advice on relevant network  and information security aspects in  order to develop synergies  Specific task related to cooperation with other bodies – clearer role for ENISA  Third party outreach  Contribute to […] efforts to cooperate with  third countries and, where appropriate, with  international organisations   Contribute to […] efforts to cooperate with  third countries and international organisations  […] by:  o […] observer and in the organisation  of international exercises […]  o Facilitating exchange of best practices  o Providing […] expertise  More specific tasks identified in the area of outreach – clearer role for ENISA in international cooperation  processes  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  14  Legal basis for ENISA activities  Articles 1-3 of Regulation (EU) no 526/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013  concerning the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) and repealing  Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 establishes the scope, objectives and tasks of ENISA.

In addition, there are other instruments, with the same status as the founding regulation, that can be  considered indirect extensions of the mandate as they give ENISA specific mandatory tasks. They include:  Tasks given to ENISA in other legislative instruments  NIS Directive (2016)  ENISA should assist the Cooperation Group in the execution of its tasks, in line with the objective of  ENISA set out in Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council (7), […].  ENISA should also be involved in the development of guidelines for sector-specific criteria for  determining the significance of the impact of an incident   In particular, ENISA should provide assistance [to the Cooperation Group] in those areas that  correspond to its own tasks, as set out in Regulation (EU) No 526/2013, namely analysing network and  information system security strategies, supporting the organisation and running of Union exercises  relating to the security of network and information systems, and exchanging information and best  practice on awareness-raising and training   ENISA should, in accordance with its mandate, support the organisation and running of Union-wide  exercises by providing its expertise and advice to the Cooperation Group and the CSIRTs network   ENISA shall provide the secretariat and shall actively support the cooperation among the CSIRTs   When adopting implementing acts on the security requirements for digital service providers, the  Commission should take the utmost account of the opinion of ENISA and should consult interested  stakeholders   ENISA, in collaboration with Member States, shall draw up advice and guidelines regarding the  technical areas to be considered in relation to already existing network and information security  standards, including Member States' national standards regaring security requirements and incident  notification  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  16  Tasks given to ENISA in other legislative instruments  Payment services  directive (2015)   EBA shall promote cooperation, including the sharing of information, in the area of operational and  security risks associated with payment services among the competent authorities, and between the  competent authorities and the ECB and, where relevant, the European Union Agency for Network and  Information Security   EBA shall take into account standards and/or specifications developed and published by the European  Union Agency for Network and Information Security for sectors pursuing activities other than payment  service provision  eIDAS Regulation  (2013)   ENISA is nominated as recipient of notifications regarding breaches of security or loss of integrity in 2  situations:  o When multiple states are affected the notified SB (Supervisory body) should inform also ENISA   ENISA shall receive once a year a summary of notifications of breach of security and loss of integrity  received from trust service providers (Summary report on breaches shall be submitted by 31/03 each  year)  Directive on attacks  against information  systems (2013)   The directive aims at establishing minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and the  relevant sanctions and to improve cooperation between competent authorities, including the police  and other specialised law enforcement services of the Member States, as well as the competent  specialised Union agencies and bodies, such as Eurojust, Europol and its European Cyber Crime Centre,  and the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA)   Relevant data should be made available to the competent specialised Union agencies and bodies,  such as Europol and ENISA, in line with their tasks and information needs, in order to gain a more  complete picture of the problem of cybercrime and network and information security at Union level. For  that purpose, the Commission should take into account the available analyses and reports produced by  relevant actors and, in particular, Europol and ENISA  COM Regulation  611/2013 on the  measures applicable  to the notification of  personal data  breaches (2013)   The Commission may, after having consulted the competent national authorities via the Article 29  Working Party, the European Network and Information Security Agency and the European Data  Protection Supervisor, publish an indicative list of appropriate technological protection measures […]  according to current practices  Other agencies’  regulations, EU LISA  regulation (2011)   Mandatory for agencies, e.g. eu-LISA to consult and follow up the recommendations of the European  Network and Information Security Agency regarding network security, where appropriate  Framework  Directive  2002/21/EC as  amended (2002)  (Telecoms package  Article 13a  guidelines for NRAs)   Where appropriate, the national regulatory authority concerned shall inform the national regulatory  authorities in other Member States and the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA)  [of a breach of security or loss of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation of  networks or services].

One horizontal objective complements the above and is described here.  #Enabling Reinforce ENISA’s impact, by improving the management of its resources and engaging more  efficiently with its stakeholders, including Member States and Union Institutions, as well as at international  level.  40 ENISA strategy document, available at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-strategy  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-strategy  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  18  Analysis of strengths and opportunities  3.4.1 Drivers for change  The change drivers identified are presented in four clusters: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and  Threats (SWOT), as follows:  Internal  Strengths Weaknesses   Landscape view – unique position to analyse how all MS  are doing and communicate back   Independence – ENISA seen as an independent agency  with no commercial or political bias   A facilitator – ENISA focuses on collaboration and  community-building   Needs-driven – ENISA remains agile and able to respond  to changing stakeholder needs   Cybersecurity excellence – at several levels, covering the  complete security lifecycle   Growth – pace of growth of budget and resources does not  match pace of demand for ENISA involvement in new areas   Influence – ENISA has limited influence over industry   Impact – as with other EU institutions, ENISA needs a better  methodology for tracking and understanding impact and  addressing market needs  External  Opportunities Threats   SPOC – opportunity for ENISA to be the  primary/coordinating EU cybersecurity body   Cybersecurity marketplace – a role for ENISA in  developing and supporting European cybersecurity  products and services   Public-private partnerships – ENISA could be supporting  and developing PPPs, e.g. leveraging the results of  research and exploiting opportunities for EU products and  services in the cybersecurity market   Technology development – opportunity for ENISA to be  the reference organisation on cybersecurity implications  from IoT, smart, mobile, AI   Privacy and data protection –ENISA could be given a role  in assisting MS and EU in addressing the technical  challenges of implementing data protection   Fragmentation – the EU cybersecurity policy space has no  coherent governance structure that includes all EU players  in a complementary manner   Strategic outlook – difficulties in executing a long-term  vision due to regulatory constraints and overlapping  mandates (other agencies/bodies claiming to have expertise  and ownership of cybersecurity)  3.4.2 Analysis of current tasks. Main findings  Overall, all current agency tasks are relevant and should be maintained.  Rather the scope of the agency could be increased to ensure a more coherent approach to the entire  cybersecurity life cycle: Prevent – Detect – Respond.  A number of current tasks need to be reinforced, namely supporting the organisation and running of Union  network and information security exercises, and, at their request, advising Member States on national  exercises in the capability-building domain and express independently its own conclusions, guidance and  advice on matters within the scope and objectives of its Regulation.  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  19  The following have been put forward for consideration regarding ENISA’s mandate, governance, role and  responsibilities:   ENISA’s current tasks and product portfolio shall be retained.   A number of existing tasks and service offerings need to be reinforced, and several new tasks and  orientations should to be considered. The complete security life cycle shall be addressed in this  approach.   ENISA shall have the power to act on its own initiative and to engage in the complete security life  cycle.   The future mandate should be scoped more broadly to allow for a coherent approach to EU  cybersecurity and give greater consideration to the economic and societal aspects of cybersecurity  where ENISA could also play a role.   Coordinating network information security and cybersecurity activities and response at EU level  (ENISA as the EU Single Point Of Contact (SPOC) for cybersecurity incident response);   Supporting the development of EU minimum standards on cybersecurity;   Working with the EU Commission, having a better-defined role in research, including:   setting priorities for research in cybersecurity (policy and industry needs);   helping to transition cybersecurity research into the market place;   Providing the EU Cybersecurity Information Hub;   Establishing with industry a Cybersecurity Training Centre.   Assessing awareness needs across EU-28, advise on “gaps”, providing awareness material,  coordinating awareness campaigns across the EU;   Serving as the EU interface to bodies that are part of global cybersecurity response;   In scoping ENISA’s role and tasks, it would be important to define clearly the scope of different  other actors in the EU cybersecurity space.   A new governance structure along the lines being considered by other agencies could be suggested  to improve the decision-making process.   Analysing the economic and societal aspects and implications of cybersecurity (e.g. economic  analysis).   Formalising ENISA’s role in supporting the implementation of GDPR.   In conjunction with the EEAS, having specific powers to assist third countries with tasks falling  within the ENISA mandate.   Alternative funding mechanisms:   ENISA providing specific consultancy services for public bodies on a cost recovery basis;   ENISA being able to apply for/benefit from research funding.  ENISA’s tasks list in Article 3 of ENISA regulation (2013) are not sufficiently strong in supporting NIS  matters. The cybersecurity threat landscape now requires a more proactive, “hands on” approach.  Regarding themes and role/responsibilities for ENISA, the following emerge as key elements of a future  permanent mandate for ENISA:  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  20   Policy advice: provision of strategic policy advice to the EU institutions and MS in relation to  cybersecurity.   Information and capability-building: ENISA as the EU Cybersecurity Information Hub offering high  quality cybersecurity analysis and training.   Cybersecurity lifecycle: getting more involved in the complete cybersecurity lifecycle, including  practical, “hands-on” support and an incident response (coordination) capacity.   Trends: ENISA using its unique cybersecurity knowledge to identify trends and forecasting threats  and potential solutions.   Collaboration: providing and maintaining an expert infrastructure platform connecting all players  EU-wide and beyond.   Research: contributing to the EU cybersecurity research agenda and supporting the development of  research results in a commercial environment.   Industry: strengthen the engagement the private sector, for instance by involving the industry in the  governance of ENISA.   Standards and certification: ENISA developing and promoting cybersecurity standards, managing  certifications.   Alternative business models: exploring the possibility of creating revenue, including providing  remuneration services e.g. by way of SLAs with EU institutions and agencies, and industry.  It is suggested that this approach allows the agency to maximise on its current capabilities. It is considered  that the approach above demonstrates a pragmatic, incremental approach, which focuses on making the  most of what ENISA already is doing and on a seamless evolution.  Several additional, more ambitious building blocks have been proposed in the next section. These are  evidence of greater ambition for what ENISA could be doing in the long term and, depending on the course  of future internal discussions and external negotiations, will also be pursued as future mandate building  blocks.  3.4.3 Emerging strategic themes for ENISA’s future mandate  On the basis of: (i) the mandate evolution and analysis in sections 3.1 and 3.2 and (ii) taking into account  the SWOT analysis in section 3.4.1, a number of common strategic themes emerge.  These are the main  new building blocks of ENISA’s future mandate. Items in the current mandate are not explicitly mentioned  here.  A comprehensive mandate allowing for a coherent approach to EU cybersecurity   Agility in delivering added value in a constantly changing landscape   Supporting the development and implementation of EU cyber policy and strategies   Mandate should address issues and opportunities for both business and technology at EU and  possibly international level   ENISA should be able to act on its own initiative   ENISA to support the development and implementation of foreign security and defence policies,  working closely with the EEAS  Need for a permanent mandate   ENISA must have a permanent mandate, not simply another extension for a limited number of  years   Adequate resources so that ENISA is not forced to prioritise important cyber activities  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  21  Need for a clear definition of the scope and coordination roles of different actors in cybersecurity   Many different stakeholders (law enforcement, defence, intelligence, privacy, technological, etc.)  should work together in a pre-defined structured way   The challenge of a multitude of EU and international agencies and complex regulatory landscape  needs to be addressed   ENISA’s central role as the internal market agency for cybersecurity needs to be more explicit  ENISA as the EU Cybersecurity Information Hub   Enhancing ENISA’s information position by using information available from all stakeholders   ENISA’s added value is high quality analysis and not processing raw data   Performing strategic analysis and analysis of incidents   Having an education/training component (Cybersecurity Training Centre)  Involvement at all stages of the cybersecurity life cycle (Prevent – Detect – Respond)   Following up on recommendations and good practices to achieve tangible impact   Moving from “hands off” design role to a more “hands on” implementation role   Learning from this, using it to enrich the agency’s experience and feeding it back into ENISA’s way  of working to improve the quality of service   Making a “hands on” rather than theoretical contribution to the EU cybersecurity debate   Developing a response capacity to cybersecurity incidents, coupled with crisis management to  complement at EU level the MS effort in this area (see next theme)  ENISA as a contributor to the coordination of cybersecurity incident response in the EU   Coordinating network information security and cybersecurity incident response at EU level  (ENISA as the EU SPOC (Single Point of Contact) for cybersecurity incident response)   Physical presence (on-the-spot), supporting a SPOC, disseminating remediation or threat insights,  in response to large-scale or critical infrastructure incidents  Using ENISA’s enhanced cybersecurity information positon to identify trends, threats and responses   Anticipating challenges and risks, emerging threats, technology developments   Early warning services and strategic analysis   Offering insight into the “next big thing”, e.g. black swans  Supporting the development of and promoting cybersecurity standards   Identifying standardisation gaps, working with all actors to identify strategic roadmaps and  oversee standardisation activities   Using ENISA good practices as standards precursors   Ensuring different stakeholders’ perspectives (including industry/private sector) are taken into  consideration throughout the standardisation process   Involvement in setting EU minimum standards on cybersecurity on the basis of trends and needs  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  22  Maintaining and managing cybersecurity certifications   Supporting the writing of certifications and reflecting changes based on technology or threat  evolution  ENISA supporting standardisation and certification   Support accreditation/standardisation activities   Being active in accreditation   A role for ENISA in cybersecurity certification – complementing national certifications with an EU  one  ENISA supporting privacy and data protection in the cyberspace   - Address the technical challenges of implementing privacy and data protection   - Support the security of personal data  Providing and maintaining an expert infrastructure platform e.g. Connected European Facilities SMART  connecting all players EU-wide and beyond   Mobilising expert networks, serving as a driver/champion   Operating the associated infrastructure   Consider offering new means/ways to collaborate   Continued focus on common effort, support, connecting the dots   Serving as an interface to institutions that are part of global cybersecurity response   Having specific powers to assist third countries with tasks falling within the ENISA mandate  Better engaging industry/the private sector   Involving the private sector in the governance of ENISA (e.g. stronger role of Permanent  Stakeholders’ Group and a different composition of the Management Board to include  representatives of industry)   ENISA’s position as an independent advisor to be maintained  Bridging the gap between cybersecurity research results and the market   Better use of research results   No institution tasked with the responsibility to support the development of research results in a  commercial environment   ENISA to nurture cybersecurity research and help with commercialisation   In addition, there could be a role for ENISA in channelling/promoting and disseminating  cybersecurity research results across Member States and industry  Contributing to the EU cybersecurity research agenda   ENISA could contribute to cybersecurity research priority-setting (e.g. “EU Commission to take  utmost account of ENISA recommendations on cybersecurity” on this)  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  23  Pragmatic involvement in policy advice   ENISA to provide: (i) analysis on trends and threats, (ii) opinions, (iii) recommendations and to (iv)  address future challenges not yet identified  Greater consideration of the economic and societal aspects of cybersecurity   Looking into the societal and economic dimension of cybersecurity which is currently not being  adequately addressed by ENISA   Given that ENISA is a single market agency, it could consider developing a level of economic  analysis in relation to cybersecurity in the EU   This would help ensure that cybersecurity is an economic enabler and not a barrier to the delivery  of the digital economy  Exploring the possibilities of providing remunerated services and other alternative business models by  way of SLAs with EU institutions and agencies and industry   Regarding governance arrangements:  o retain Permanent Stakeholders’ Group (PSG)  o consider, in line with other EU agencies, an alternative governance structure for the  agency, in order to improve efficiency of the decision-making process (NLO, PSG, Executive  Board, Management Board (MB)).  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  24  4. Vision for the future  The associated picture  illustrates the tasks that  are proposed by ENISA  for the new mandate.  The following sections  provide description for  each of the proposed  new areas for the ENISA  mandate, organised  according to the ENISA  strategic objectives41.  Cyber coordination at  EU level needs to be  enhanced. There is a  need to revise the  current EU governance  on cybersecurity, especially due to existing fragmentation of governance structure. There should be one  entity that takes the lead on coordinating cybersecurity issues at a European level (see also section  ‘Cybersecurity coordination hub’ below). ENISA proposes that this be explicitly mentioned in its new  mandate. In the following picture, compared with 2013 EU cybersecurity strategy, cyber diplomacy aspect  was added.  41 ENISA strategy available at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-strategy  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-strategy  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  25  Expertise: best practice & recommendations  Economics of cybersecurity (DSM)  The proposal is for ENISA to carry out studies of the economics of cybersecurity (i.e. the EU cybersecurity  market and related economic issues) in order to provide quantitative data that could support decision  making in this area. The overall goal would be to ensure that cybersecurity policy is aligned with EU  industrial policy and that cybersecurity is used as an economic lever as opposed to a barrier.  Align cybersecurity research with policy & commercialisation  There are two ways in which ENISA can support to align cybersecurity research with policy and  commercialisation. Firstly, to involve ENISA in high level panels that decide on research priorities for  H2020 whenever cybersecurity is likely to be a key topic. Secondly, the Agency could work together with  H2020 projects and its existing stakeholder networks to establish a framework to support the  commercialisation of research results.  Coverage of geopolitical and societal developments  The existing work carried out by ENISA on the Threat Landscape should be broadened from the existing  technical approach to cover geopolitical, societal and economic developments.  Policy: supporting policy development and implementation  Addressing cybersecurity policy fragmentation  The Commission should recognise the central role of ENISA in EU cybersecurity and use ENISA to minimise  fragmentation and duplication of resources thereby addressing cybersecurity policy fragmentation.  ICT security certification  Current policy initiatives in this area are leading towards the creation of an EU framework for ICT security  certification. As a neutral third party, ENISA would be an ideal candidate for supporting such a framework.  Involvement in all key policy initiatives  ENISA should be systematically alerted when new EU policy initiatives arise, which could have an impact on  cybersecurity and privacy in the cyberspace ensuring involvement in all key policy initiatives. Such an alert  should trigger a short analysis by ENISA identifying potential issues and suggesting whether or not the  Agency should contribute. In addition, the Agency should be invited to contribute to policy development  wherever it identifies a need to do so. The agency should provide strategic policy advice to the  Commission, Parliament and the MS. This strategic level role can be added to the existing ones that are of  tactical and support nature.  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  26  Capacity: hands on by ENISA experts  Cybersecurity full lifecycle  By combining preparation and response capabilities under a single EU body to provide a cybersecurity full  lifecycle approach, the probability of incoherencies and misunderstandings would be greatly reduced.  This  could also reduce fragmentation at the EU level, eventually resulting in less independent organisations and  enabling more powerful synergies and economies of scale. This would also increase the accountability of  the Agency, as it would be implementing its own recommendations. In a system that splits these two  aspects (‘design’ and ‘implementation’) there is scope for a misalignment at several different levels and  the accountability model is not at all clear.  Reinforce role in securing CIIP  One of the main challenges of the NISD Cooperation Group (CG) is that the majority of the member states  lack in depth knowledge on critical sector specific cybersecurity issues. At the same time, there is a lack of  established and functioning at EU level bodies, which provide sector specific knowledge to the CG, which  covers all different stakeholders and all different subsectors. To fill these gaps, the new mandate can  reinforce ENISA’s role in securing CIIs by taking advantage of the knowledge gained and the relationships  established with the sector specific stakeholders by the Agency during all these years.  Supporting standards process  ENISA could play a stronger role in supporting the cybersecurity standards process by providing policy and  technical guidance to Standards Development Organisations (SDO). In addition, the Agency could assist the  Commission in defining future policy in this area by acting as an advisor to the standardisation roadmap.  Community: community building/coordination  Cyber crisis cooperation / technical support  An EU focal point for EU cyber crisis cooperation would support the exchange of information and foster  situation awareness on cyber incidents and related crises. Member States and EU Institutions, in particular  the CSIRTs Network, should form the foundation of this pool, which would need to be supported by a core  capability at EU-Level.  ENISA would be a legitimate candidate to host such core capability.  Cybersecurity coordination hub  There are many EU institutions and bodies involved in cybersecurity, each with its own specific mandate  and responsibilities (examples include Commission DGs, CERT EU, EC3, EDA, EU LISA). This situation has the  advantage of being able to offer cybersecurity services that are targeted to particular communities but  could result in separate pools of incomplete information and incoherent methods across communities  (including incompatible standards and methodologies). ENISA, acting as a cybersecurity coordination hub,  shall support these different bodies by offering a number of ‘cross-community support services’ such as  threat analysis, cross-community trends analysis, trusted information exchange, advice on standards and  certification practices, standard risk analysis techniques and taxonomies. This will help to avoid  fragmentation and duplication of resources.  Increased international cooperation  The proposal is that ENISA plays a more active role in international cooperation.  Concretely, (a) ENISA  shall be called upon to play a more proactive role in collaborating with international organisations having a  role in cybersecurity (such as the OECD, ICANN, IETF, …) and (b) ENISA shall be tasked with supporting  cyber dialogues led notably by the EEAS when cybersecurity is an issue.  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  27  Annex A: Terminology  While in this document, we do not aim to provide new definitions to cybersecurity and to cyber space, we  work with the following understanding of the terminology:   Cyber space is the time-dependent42 set of connected tangible assets43 (relying or depending on  networks and internet like communication), infrastructures, systems and networks; Information; Users  and all activities and interactions/communication including virtual ones.   Cybersecurity covers all aspects of prevention, forecasting; tolerance; detection; mitigation, removal,  analysis and investigation of cyber incidents. Considering the different types of components of the  cyber space, cybersecurity should cover the following attributes: Availability, Reliability, Safety,  Confidentiality, Integrity, Maintainability (for tangible systems, information and networks)  Robustness, Survivability, Resilience (to support the dynamicity of the cyber space), Accountability,  Authenticity and Non-repudiation (to support information security).   Cyber ethics. Ethics are principles or standards of human conduct. Cyber ethics is a code of behaviour  on the Internet44. Cyber ethics is the philosophic study of ethics pertaining to computers,  encompassing user behaviour and what computers are programmed to do, and how this affects  individuals and society45.   Cyber hygiene covers several practices46 that should be implemented and carrying out regularly to  protect users and businesses online.   Any occurrence that has impact on any of the components of the cyber space or on the functioning of  the cyber space, independent if it’s natural or human made; malicious or non-malicious intent;  deliberate, accidental or due to incompetence; due to development or due to operational interactions  is called cyber incident.  Also we call cyber incident any incident generated by any of cyber space  components even if the damage/disruption, dysfunctionality is caused outside the cyber space.   To support a ‘grading’ of cyber incidents, we define cyber accidents as any occurrence associated with  cyber space causing significant damage to cyber space or any other asset (has performance impact,  requires repairs, replacement) or causing personal injury.   Cyber investigation. A process conducted for the purpose of cyber accident and incident prevention  which includes the gathering and analysis of information, the drawing of conclusions, including the  determination of causes and, when appropriate, the making of safety and security recommendations.   Cyber-attacks cover all cyber incident triggered by malicious intent where damages, disruptions or  dysfunctionalities are caused.   Cybercrime refers to any crime/criminal activity facilitated by or using cyber space.  42 Time dependency aspect presented in: Cyberspace: Definition and Implications, Rain Ottis, Peeter Lorents (2010), abstract,  available at: https://ccdcoe.org/multimedia/cyberspace-definition-and-implications.html  43 A survey identifying the components of cyberspace as presented in cyber space definitions is presented in: “Cyberspace – What  is it?”, Damir Rajnovic - July 26, 2012, available at: http://blogs.cisco.com/security/cyberspace-what-is-it  44 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/safety/online-privacy/cyberethics-practice.aspx  45 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberethics  46 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-hygiene  https://ccdcoe.org/multimedia/cyberspace-definition-and-implications.html http://blogs.cisco.com/security/cyberspace-what-is-it https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/safety/online-privacy/cyberethics-practice.aspx https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberethics https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-hygiene  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  28   Cyber sabotage refers to any sabotage activity facilitated by or using cyber space.   By cyber espionage we understand 2 types of espionage vectors: (a) state espionage (intelligence,  when state actors are involved) or (b) industrial espionage (when commercial actors are involved).   Cyber-defense47 refers to a variety of defensive mechanisms that could be used to mitigate or respond  to cyber-attacks.   Cyberwarfare refers to any action by a state, group or criminal organisation facilitated by or using  cyber space targeting another state.  47 Kolini, Farzan and Janczewski, Lech, \"Cyber Defense Capability Model: A Foundation Taxonomy\" (2015), International  Conference on Information Resources Management (CONF-IRM) 2015, Proceedings, Paper 32, available at:  http://aisel.aisnet.org/confirm2015/32  http://aisel.aisnet.org/confirm2015/32  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  29  Annex B: References  Year Reference Policy/legislation reference.

    "original document": "ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  02  Foreword from the Executive Director  Let us step back in time to Friday October 21, 2016, after 11:10 UTC. If you typed the URL of some well- known US internet service providers into your browser there was no response1, and no online services  available. The reason - the Mirai botnet2 had hacked millions of Internet-Of-Things devices and collectively  performed a Denial-Of-Service attack on a Domain-Name-Service provider with the result that the IP- addresses of hundreds of company services could not be accessed anymore. It was like removing the  telephone number of these organisations in a way that customers could not contact them.  Estonia 20073, Georgia 20084, Iran (Stuxnet) 20105, the Snowden6 revelations of 2013, the scandal of  hacked emails7 in US election in 2016 are only a few examples of the new virtual Wild West in cyber space.  In the past, one needed a gun to rob a bank, today an equivalent amount of damage can be achieved from  the action of a fingertip on a keyboard. This exercise can be performed from any place in the world. Crime,  espionage, sabotage and even international conflicts move from the so-called real world into the virtual  cyber world. On top of this, the terrorists’ attacks in Brussels and Berlin last year resulted in a new debate  on the use of cryptography8 linked to criminal justice in cyber space9.  Are we prepared to address the real challenge arising from new threats and the new hybrid threat  landscape? Yes and No. This question does not have a straight answer.  In 2009, the European Commission published the Communication on Critical Information Infrastructure  Protection (CIIP) 10. In the following years, COM launched several strategies: the EU Cybersecurity strategy  in 201311, the European Agenda on Security in 201512, (where cyber issues are mentioned, including  fighting cyber crime however, ENISA is not mentioned) and the Digital Marketing Strategy13.  1 2016 cyberattack, available at: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack  2 Dyn Analysis Summary Of Friday October 21 Attack, October 26th, 2016, available at: http://dyn.com/blog/dyn-analysis- summary-of-friday-october-21-attack/  3 2007 cyberattacks on Estonia, available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_Estonia  4 Cyberattacks during the Russo-Georgian War, available at:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattacks_during_the_Russo-Georgian_War  5 Stuxnet, computer worm, discovered in June 2010, available at: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet  6 Edward Snowden, American whistleblower and former National Security Agency contractor, available at:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden  7 Hillary Clinton Email Archive on WikiLeaks, available at: https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/30373  8 Encryption: Challenges for criminal justice in relation to the use of encryption - future steps, November 2016, Presidency  progress report no. 14711/16, available at: http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14711-2016-INIT/en/pdf  9 Outcome of the 3508th Council meeting on Justice and Home Affairs, 15391/16, December 2016, page 7, available at:  http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/jha/2016/12/st15391_en16_pdf/  10 COM Communication on CIIP, COM(2009) 149 final, available at:  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF  11 Cybersecurity Strategy of the EU (2013), JOIN (2013) 1 final, – see Annex B.  12 The European Agenda on Security (2015), COM/2015/0185 final, – see Annex B.  13 Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe (DSM) (2015), COM/2015/0192 final, – see Annex B.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack http://dyn.com/blog/dyn-analysis-summary-of-friday-october-21-attack/ http://dyn.com/blog/dyn-analysis-summary-of-friday-october-21-attack/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_Estonia https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattacks_during_the_Russo-Georgian_War https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/30373 http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14711-2016-INIT/en/pdf http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/jha/2016/12/st15391_en16_pdf/ http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  03  Furthermore, in 2016, a Joint Framework on countering hybrid threats14 was published and the cPPP  initiative15 was launched.  The European Parliament and Council adopted in 2016 the General Data  Protection Regulation (GDPR)16, Law Enforcement Authorities (LEA) data protection Directive17, the  Passenger Name Records Directive18 and the NIS directive19. These initiatives demonstrate that political  awareness results in political action.  On the implementation side, ENISA was established in 2004 to support the security of network and  information systems across the EU, and its mandate was renewed in 2009 and 201320. Even with its limited  resources, of about €11 Million /year, ENISA has published and covered nearly every upcoming topic  relevant for cybersecurity and cyber space. Examples of published reports include ENISA Threat Landscape,  activities on exercises, reports on Smart Airports, Smart cities, eHealth, to name a few21.  However, this is not enough!  If someone looks into the evolution of information technology and computer science, the last decades  were governed by Moore’s law, i.e. more and more computer power, scalable availability everywhere (i.e.  cloud computing), and easy to use devices (i.e. smartphones). These technologies have challenged  traditional business models and have resulted in the concept of disruptive technologies. Nevertheless, with  the latest discussions that the US presidential elections were influenced by state actors22 and the fear that  the upcoming French, German and Dutch elections23 24 25 could be manipulated, cybersecurity is also now  seen as global political challenge.  EU bodies and institutions should work in a harmonized manner, to address the challenges and  opportunities of cybersecurity. While this topic is generally driven from an infrastructure perspective, it is  currently becoming a topic of foreign and security policy.  Existing institutions, like ENISA, should be strengthened and their role expanded to leverage their technical  expertise in NIS, their ability to cooperate with EU institutions and bodies and with MS national authorities  on NIS topics, as well as on data protection and cybercrime.  The geopolitical challenges should be considered when assessing the EU cybersecurity architecture, when  clarifying the roles and responsibilities in all the security lifecycle steps ranging from protection, prevention  to mitigation and response/defence in reaction to cyber incidents. In this regard, ENISA needs to support  14 Joint Communication on countering hybrid threats (2016), JOIN/2016/018 final, – see Annex B.  15 See COM communication 0410/2016 on cPPP (Cybersecurity Public-Private partnership) (2016) and COM decision C(2016)4400  on cPPP (2016) in Annex B.  16 General Data Protection Regulation (2016) (GDPR), Regulation (EU) 2016/679, – see Annex B.  17 LEA Data protection Directive (2016), Directive (2016) (EU) 2016/680, – see Annex B.  18 PNR (passenger name record) Directive (2016), Directive (EU) 2016/681, – see Annex B.  19 The NIS Directive, Directive (EU) 2016/1148, – see Annex B.  20 ENISA Regulation (2013), Regulation (EU) No 526/2013, – see Annex B.  21 ENISA publications available at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications  22 US intelligence report: Vladimir Putin 'ordered' operation to get Trump elected, The Guardian, available at:  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/06/vladimir-putin-us-election-interference-report-donald-trump  23 Russian cyber-attacks could influence German election, says Merkel, The Guardian, available at:  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/russian-cyber-attacks-could-influence-german-election-says-merkel  24 France’s Hollande seeks ‘specific measures’ against election hacking, Politico, 15/02/2017, available at:  http://www.politico.eu/article/frances-hollande-seeks-specific-measures-against-election-hacking-russia-putin/  25 Dutch will count all election ballots by hand to thwart hacking, The Guardian, available at:  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/02/dutch-will-count-all-election-ballots-by-hand-to-thwart-cyber-hacking  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/06/vladimir-putin-us-election-interference-report-donald-trump https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/russian-cyber-attacks-could-influence-german-election-says-merkel http://www.politico.eu/article/frances-hollande-seeks-specific-measures-against-election-hacking-russia-putin/ https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/02/dutch-will-count-all-election-ballots-by-hand-to-thwart-cyber-hacking  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  04  the EU foreign security and defence policy.  To face the technological, geopolitical and economic  challenges in the EU, two essential things need to be addressed:  1. The EU Commission, together with the MSs, to examine and adjust where necessary the current  European governance structure regarding ICT and cybersecurity,  2. Significantly strengthen the mandate of ENISA, especially to give ENISA a stronger position in  addressing the cybersecurity lifecycle challenges and improving the ability to address its own  initiative tasks list. It is acknowledged that this will require an increase in its budget.  The current evaluation of ENISA and the envisaged new ENISA mandate proposal of the Commission is a  unique opportunity to address the challenges mentioned above.  This document is intended to support and foster the discussions on ENISA’s mandate. It summarises the  current landscape and raises topics and ideas for the future and a stronger mandate for ENISA. The target  audience of this document are primarily the political decision makers in Brussels (the Commission, the EU  Parliament, and the Council) and the representatives of the member states. The target audience also  includes our stakeholders in industry and academia.  We welcome input and discussion from all. It is hoped  that the forthcoming discussions on the future of ENISA will well position the agency to meet the  challenges of the cyber space of the future.  The main areas in which ENISA believes its mandate should be expended are as follows:  1. Organic growth: continuing the evolution of the functions of the Agency to address the latest  cybersecurity challenges including reinforcing the role in securing CIIP.  2. Policy advice: provision of strategic policy advice to the EU institutions and MS in relation to  cybersecurity; ENISA should also be in a position to produce its own initiative policy advice. This  includes:  Aligning cybersecurity research with policy & commercialisation,  Addressing cybersecurity policy fragmentation,  Involvement in all key policy initiatives.  3. Information and capability building: ENISA as the EU Cybersecurity Information/coordination Hub  offering high quality cybersecurity analysis and training and strengthens ENISA’s role as a single point  of contact in the area of cyber crisis cooperation / technical support.  4. Cybersecurity lifecycle: getting more involved in the complete cybersecurity lifecycle, including  practical, “hands-on” support and an incident response (coordination) capacity,  5. Economics of cybersecurity: including better engagement with industry to leverage economic  opportunities in the EU from cybersecurity,  6. Standards and certification: ENISA developing and promoting cybersecurity standards process,  managing ICT security certifications.  7. Coverage of geopolitical and societal developments. This is a logical extension of the work that ENISA  is doing in the area of threat analysis and will provide stakeholders with a more complete picture of  the cybersecurity landscape. In addition, ENISA should be involved in increased international  cooperation.  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  05  I believe that Europe needs a strong cybersecurity agency that addresses the needs and challenges of  information and network security. ENISA is well placed and has the experience of collaborating with the  key stakeholders at Member State and at EU level in this area.  Our political leaders are committed to building the future wealth of the EU by leveraging the opportunities  of the Digital Society. The security of cyber space is particularly important where we use technology that  ignores the traditional boundaries of distance and borders. Cybersecurity is an integral part and extends  from the personal use of ICT to the most complex industrial control systems and critical infrastructures.  New technologies are quickly finding new applications that affect our everyday lives.  ENISA is already working in all these areas, is contributing to the advancing of European network and  information security, and will continue to do so if the necessary resources are put in place.  ENISA has contributed to the EU cybersecurity landscape since 2004. ENISA is addressing and will continue  to address the cybersecurity challenges, to support the political goal of harnessing the opportunities of the  Digital Society.  ENISA’s role needs to be further developed and strengthened to adequately contribute to  the EU cybersecurity world post 2020.  It is against this background I present our vision for a stronger European cybersecurity Agency that will meet  the cybersecurity challenges of the future.

Introduction  The mandate of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) expires on 18th  of June 2020. The renewal of the mandate will require the bringing forward of a proposal by COM26 27and  the agreement of the Council and the Parliament.  The continually changing cybersecurity threat landscape28 and the evolution of related European Union  (EU) policy necessitate a critical look at ENISA’s mandate and tasks.  Given the length of time to bring forward and have adopted EU legislation, discussions are already taking  place on the renewal of the mandate. The mandate of ENISA was renewed in 2009 and 2013. Given the  increasing recognition of the importance of cybersecurity the mandate has evolved and an increasing  amount of functions are being assigned to ENISA by way different pieces of legislation. The most recent and  important tasks for ENISA have emerged from the Adoption of the NIS Directive in 2016 where ENISA was  tasked with functions to support the CSIRT network and the Cooperation group.  In the pursuit of an open, safe and secure cyber space, ENISA supports the EU and the Member States in  enhancing and strengthening their capability and preparedness to prevent, detect and respond to network  and information security problems and incidents. ENISA also supports the development and implementation  of European Union policy and law on matters relating to network and information security (NIS). ENISA is  the European cybersecurity agency, which determines and addresses network and information security  issues, thereby contributing to the proper functioning of the internal market. It also aims to exploit the full  potential of the internal market from the widespread use of information and communications technologies  (ICT) in a safe and secure cyber space. While ICT technologies present business opportunities in cyber space  they also present opportunities for crime and misuse, which need to be considered and addressed.  This document presents a number of strategic themes to be considered in upcoming reflections on the  ENISA mandate and can serve as a basis for discussions as it presents the agency’s position in further  mandate negotiations.  In Section 2, the current context is described including some of the challenges in securing the cyber space.  In Section 3, the current legal basis of ENISA and its evolution as well as the agency’s strategy are introduced.  Besides these, an analysis is presented regarding the drivers for change and analysis of current tasks and  emerging topics. This section lists several strategic themes and additional considerations that are expected  to guide changes to the current mandate.  Section 4 contains ENISA’s vision for the future. It includes opinions on evolution of ENISA and ENISA’s role  in the EU cybersecurity governance. Furthermore, the section includes description of proposed new areas  to be covered by a renewed ENISA mandate, including a mapping of the proposed new tasks into current  ENISA strategy.  26 Article 32 of ENISA regulation (2013) specifies that by 20th of June 2018 the COM shall commission an evaluation. The evaluation  shall address the possible need to modify the mandate of the Agency and the financial implications.  27 COM Work Programme 2017, COM(2016) 710 final, Annex 2, available at https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/work- programme-commission-key-documents-2017_en  28 ENISA publications available at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management?tab=publications  https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/work-programme-commission-key-documents-2017_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/work-programme-commission-key-documents-2017_en https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management?tab=publications  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  08  2. Background  During the past decade new institutions and organisations have been set up across the EU and Member  States to address cybersecurity challenges. This area is developing and the roles and responsibilities of the  institutions involved are still being determined or clarified.  The Global Strategy for the European Union (EUGS)29, which is the strategy for the EU’s foreign and  security policy, and provides priorities for a stronger Europe was adopted by the European Foreign Affairs  Council on October 201630. The EUGS acknowledges the need for a shared vison to cover priorities such as  Security of the Union as well as State and societal resilience.  Enhanced “efforts on defence, cyber, counterterrorism, energy and strategic communication” have also  been identified as a Security of the Union priority. The need for stakeholders to work closely with their  partners, including NATO, has also been highlighted.  In the EUGS it is also mentioned that: “The EU will increase its focus on cybersecurity, equipping the EU and  assisting Member States in protecting themselves against cyber threats while maintaining an open, free  and safe cyber space. This entails strengthening the technological capabilities aimed at mitigating threats  and the resilience of critical infrastructure, networks and services, and reducing cybercrime. It means  fostering innovative information and communication technology (ICT) systems which guarantee the  availability and integrity of data, while ensuring security within the European digital space through  appropriate policies on the location of data storage and the certification of digital products and services. It  requires weaving cyber issues across all policy areas, reinforcing the cyber elements in CSDP missions and  operations, and further developing platforms for cooperation. The EU will support political, operational and  technical cyber cooperation between Member States, notably on analysis and consequence management,  and foster shared assessments between EU structures and the relevant institutions in Member States. It will  enhance its cybersecurity cooperation with core partners such as the US and NATO. The EU’s response will  also be embedded in strong public-private partnerships. Cooperation and information-sharing between  Member States, institutions, the private sector and civil society can foster a common cybersecurity culture,  and raise preparedness for possible cyber disruptions and attacks.”  In the State and societal resilience section of the same EUGS document, it is acknowledged the need for  resilience, which is defined therein as “the ability of states and societies to reform, thus withstanding and  recovering from internal and external crises“, to ensure sustainable security. Resilience is considered in a  wider aspect, encompassing all individuals and the whole of society. “A resilient society is considered to be  a society that features democracy, trust in institutions, and where sustainable development lies at the heart  of a resilient state.”  The EUGS also acknowledges in the last principle – global governance for the 21st Century – that “Without  global norms and the means to enforce them, peace and security, prosperity and democracy – our vital  interests – are at risk.”  29 Shared Vision, Common Action: A Stronger Europe A Global Strategy for the European Union’s Foreign And Security Policy, June  2016, available at: http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/top_stories/pdf/eugs_review_web.pdf  30 EU Foreign Ministers adopted common conclusions on implementing the EU Global Strategy, October 2016, available at:  https://europa.eu/globalstrategy/en/eu-foreign-ministers-adopted-common-conclusions-implementing-eu-global-strategy  http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/top_stories/pdf/eugs_review_web.pdf https://europa.eu/globalstrategy/en/eu-foreign-ministers-adopted-common-conclusions-implementing-eu-global-strategy  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  09  Other COM communications and strategies documents recognise the role of cybersecurity in securing EU’s  future with specified actions i.e. in fighting cybercrime. For instance, The European Agenda on Security  (2015)31, mentions ENISA as contributor to cybersecurity, “to the EU’s response to cybersecurity issues by  working towards a high level of network and information security” when covering priorities such as  ‘fighting cybercrime’. The document entitled “The Joint Framework on countering hybrid threats a  European Union response” (2016)32 also acknowledges the experience of ENISA, in collaboration with MSs,  in setting up security requirements and modalities to notify security incidents and to support convergence  of risk management approaches. Furthermore, in the context of ensuring sound financial systems, the  COM, in collaboration with ENISA, “will promote and facilitate threat information-sharing platforms and  networks and address factors that hinder the exchange of such information.” The COM Communication  entitled Delivering on European Agenda on Security to fight against terrorism (2016)33 has the protection  of citizens and critical infrastructures as an objective. Despite ENISA not being mentioned in this COM  communication, ENISA is adding value in: Standards, Certification, NISD implementation and Information  exchange, etc.  From this short summary, it can be concluded that ENISA is acknowledged as an important stakeholder in  the EU cybersecurity governance arena. In addition, it can be noted that not all documents refer to ENISA.  This could be due to the complex mapping of roles and responsibilities in the cyber space governance of  the EU.  ENISA’s role in a renewed EU cybersecurity governance. Since inception of ENISA in 2004, ENISA’s  mandate has evolved. In 2004, the challenge was seen as a technical challenge addressing information and  network security.  In 2013, the mandate was widened to include references to cybercrime. In 2017, the  natural evolution of the mandate should extend to, inter alia, supporting the European foreign security  and defence policy.  The cybersecurity ecosystem is changing, and this requires an assessment and adaptation of roles and  responsibilities in the different EU institutions and bodies are engaged in cybersecurity.  In the traditional world, roles and responsibilities have been clearly identified and put in place with the  passage of time. However, in cyber space these roles and responsibilities are not so clearly defined. This  situation arises from the fact that cyber challenges do not respect traditional geographic and physical  boundaries. In addition, the speed at which cybercrime, cyber espionage, cyber sabotage and cyber  warfare can take place without any physical presence raises difficulties that could not have been envisaged  in the traditional world.  Attribution in virtual world is vastly more complex than it was in the traditional world. Criminals and state  actors can easily hide behind many networks in different jurisdictions to a level that prosecuting the  criminal to a standard of beyond all reasonable doubt is very rare. Successful attribution may require  multi-disciplinary skill sets, cross border cooperation and the support of the diplomatic community to  ensure the necessary level of cooperation to meet the challenges of modern crime.  31 The European Agenda on Security, COM(2015)185 final (2015), – see Annex B.  32 Framework on countering hybrid threats a European Union response (2016), JOIN/2016/018 final, – see Annex B.  33 COM Communication delivering on the European Agenda on Security to fight against terrorism and pave the way towards an  effective and genuine Security Union (2016), COM(2016) 230 final, April 2016  , – see Annex B.  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  10  In 2013, the Cybersecurity Strategy of the EU (2013) included a comprehensive view of different players  across three key pillars: network and information security (NIS), law enforcement, and defence. It is  obvious that these roles and responsibilities requires an update due to changes in the technical and legal  operation of modern cyber space.  On European level, institutions like EUROPOL (EC3), Cert-EU, EDA, EASA, etc. deal with cybersecurity  related topics. Each of these institutions and bodies across the EU and in the MS have specific  competencies and knowledge bases. This paper does not question their role individually. However, it  proposes an approach for building an EU governance map, which would rely on maximizing inter- institutional cooperation, collaboration and teamwork for most of activities linked to awareness building,  prevention and preparation and information sharing. Thus, cyber coordination at EU level needs to be  enhanced.  Input to EU cybersecurity review process. On May 201734, the European Commission announced that the  EU Cybersecurity Strategy would be reviewed by September 2017. ENISA prepared an input paper35,  covering the priorities and opportunities identified as relevant for this discussion. The input paper includes  also ENISA’s vision on the governance model for EU cybersecurity cooperation, providing details on the  ENISA possible roles and responsibilities. Some of the ideas presented in the input paper are also shortly  covered in the last section of this document.  Defining cybersecurity and clarifying areas of interest. Adding to the complexity of the institutional cyber  landscape, as mentioned already, cyber does not yet have clear, unambiguous definitions. To understand  the scope and challenges in the cybersecurity domain, one must consider how terminology e.g. cyber  space, is defined as well. For this paper, we use the  definitions for cyber space and cybersecurity  provided/proposed in the Terminology Annex A.  Furthermore, from an operational/preventive perspective, it becomes increasingly difficult to separate  cybersecurity from cyber defence and to clarify the meaning of cybercrime, cyber espionage, cyber  warfare, cyber sabotage, and cyber terrorism. The classification of a cyber incident may often be decided  by subjective criteria such as the perception of the attackers, which may be classified as malicious intent,  criminal intent, state actor involvement etc.  As already pointed out before, the attribution of cyber attacks is difficult. Collaboration at global level in all  stages from prevention, preparedness, detection, investigation and prosecution of cyber incidents is still to  be achieved.  There are still questions to be addressed, arising from the lack of clear/final definitions and the cyber  challenges:   How can the line be drawn between civil and military challenges when the origin and scope of an  attack is not easy to identify, for instance while an action cannot yet be defined as i.e. cyberwarfare?   Where does cyber defence becomes cyber offensive/active defence?   How to separate cybersecurity from cyber defence for instance during the first stages of prevention,  analysis, mitigation etc.?   How to separate network and information security (NIS) from cybersecurity when aiming to reduce  vulnerabilities of networks and systems or when developing prevention measures?  34 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/cybersecurity  35 Principles and opportunities for a renewed EU cyber security strategy, ENISA contribution to the Strategy review, 2017,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisa-input-to-the-css-review-b  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisa-input-to-the-css-review-b  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  11   How to handle cross border aspects/global challenges outside of the legal boundaries of states?   Who would be mandated to take active measures to remove ‘small’ vulnerabilities which when used in  context of, for example, Mirai attack where thousands of inoffensive IoT devices were aggregated to  launch significant cyber-attacks?   Who should cover the costs of analysis and damage arising of cyber incidents?  Need for cross EU cooperation and collaboration. In case of cross border cyber incidents, cyber  investigation would require a mix of skills and participation of different institutions/bodies and  collaboration guidelines are required. Inspiration could be aviation investigations processes and  procedures. The collaboration mechanisms, parties, roles and responsibilities have to be defined.  Instead of a fragmented view, cross-domain collaboration is needed in all stages: from prevention,  preparedness and detection, through investigation, to prosecution of cyber incidents.  At EU level the solutions require a need:  (i) to develop strong institutions specialised in NIS able to collaborate and support national  authorities and  (ii) to clarify their roles and interactions in all stages: prevention, preparedness, detection,  investigation and prosecution of incidents, as well as having an active defence capability.  Collaboration and cooperation are key, next to existence of an information hub to improve prevention  and lessons learned. There is a need for a Neutral independent stakeholder. To improve the level of  preparedness it is considered essential to provide this neutral independent stakeholder, with access to  data/information, capacity of analysis, capacity to gather skills and expertise from other institutions i.e. for  the purpose of and cyber investigation.  The objectives of the neutral independent stakeholder would to  (a) identify causes (using the access to all information),  (b) develop lessons learnt and  (c) provide mitigation measures, the follow up tasks – such as updates of security requirements/  measures/ procedures in an open manner for the benefit of EU, MS, business and citizens.  A strong geopolitical NIS related understanding and approach is required. This approach should consider a  security life-cycle vision and a cooperation hub for EU cyber space. The neutral independent stakeholder  should be able to work as a hub: with access to information while also having access to skillsets of other  sectorial institutions. The neutral independent stakeholder should also be the proxy for worldwide  collaboration as the context and impact of the cyber incidents are not contained by physical barriers  anymore. In this case, collaboration with civil, military and LEA authorities is needed.  Lessons learned from other sectors. The above approaches do not differ from the approach taken in the  Aviation industry where international cooperation complements national structures to secure the safety of  the industry in a global context. Cybersecurity presents very similar challenges and similar solutions could  be adopted in EU.  ENISA can play such a role, as a trusted third party, neutral independent stakeholder.  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  12  3. The evolution of ENISA mandate and current opportunities  Evolution of ENISA mandate  ENISA was set up by Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10  March 2004 establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency36 with an initial mandate  valid for five years.  In 2008, Regulation (EU) no 1007/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September  2008 amending Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 establishing the European Network and Information Security  Agency as regards its duration37 extended the validity of ENISA’s up to March 2012.  By virtue of Regulation (EU) no 580/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2011  amending Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 establishing the European Network and Information Security  Agency38, the agency mandate was extended once more up to September 2013.  Finally, Regulation (EU) no 526/201339 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013  concerning the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) and repealing  Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 sets the latest mandate duration (expiring in June 2020).  While previous mandate renewals did not result in substantial changes in mandate, Regulation 526/2013  already streamlines and changes ENISA’s duties in all domains.

In addition, there are other instruments, with the same status as the founding regulation, that can be  considered indirect extensions of the mandate as they give ENISA specific mandatory tasks. They include:  Tasks given to ENISA in other legislative instruments  NIS Directive (2016)  ENISA should assist the Cooperation Group in the execution of its tasks, in line with the objective of  ENISA set out in Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council (7), […].  ENISA should also be involved in the development of guidelines for sector-specific criteria for  determining the significance of the impact of an incident   In particular, ENISA should provide assistance [to the Cooperation Group] in those areas that  correspond to its own tasks, as set out in Regulation (EU) No 526/2013, namely analysing network and  information system security strategies, supporting the organisation and running of Union exercises  relating to the security of network and information systems, and exchanging information and best  practice on awareness-raising and training   ENISA should, in accordance with its mandate, support the organisation and running of Union-wide  exercises by providing its expertise and advice to the Cooperation Group and the CSIRTs network   ENISA shall provide the secretariat and shall actively support the cooperation among the CSIRTs   When adopting implementing acts on the security requirements for digital service providers, the  Commission should take the utmost account of the opinion of ENISA and should consult interested  stakeholders   ENISA, in collaboration with Member States, shall draw up advice and guidelines regarding the  technical areas to be considered in relation to already existing network and information security  standards, including Member States' national standards regaring security requirements and incident  notification  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  16  Tasks given to ENISA in other legislative instruments  Payment services  directive (2015)   EBA shall promote cooperation, including the sharing of information, in the area of operational and  security risks associated with payment services among the competent authorities, and between the  competent authorities and the ECB and, where relevant, the European Union Agency for Network and  Information Security   EBA shall take into account standards and/or specifications developed and published by the European  Union Agency for Network and Information Security for sectors pursuing activities other than payment  service provision  eIDAS Regulation  (2013)   ENISA is nominated as recipient of notifications regarding breaches of security or loss of integrity in 2  situations:  o When multiple states are affected the notified SB (Supervisory body) should inform also ENISA   ENISA shall receive once a year a summary of notifications of breach of security and loss of integrity  received from trust service providers (Summary report on breaches shall be submitted by 31/03 each  year)  Directive on attacks  against information  systems (2013)   The directive aims at establishing minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and the  relevant sanctions and to improve cooperation between competent authorities, including the police  and other specialised law enforcement services of the Member States, as well as the competent  specialised Union agencies and bodies, such as Eurojust, Europol and its European Cyber Crime Centre,  and the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA)   Relevant data should be made available to the competent specialised Union agencies and bodies,  such as Europol and ENISA, in line with their tasks and information needs, in order to gain a more  complete picture of the problem of cybercrime and network and information security at Union level. For  that purpose, the Commission should take into account the available analyses and reports produced by  relevant actors and, in particular, Europol and ENISA  COM Regulation  611/2013 on the  measures applicable  to the notification of  personal data  breaches (2013)   The Commission may, after having consulted the competent national authorities via the Article 29  Working Party, the European Network and Information Security Agency and the European Data  Protection Supervisor, publish an indicative list of appropriate technological protection measures […]  according to current practices  Other agencies’  regulations, EU LISA  regulation (2011)   Mandatory for agencies, e.g. eu-LISA to consult and follow up the recommendations of the European  Network and Information Security Agency regarding network security, where appropriate  Framework  Directive  2002/21/EC as  amended (2002)  (Telecoms package  Article 13a  guidelines for NRAs)   Where appropriate, the national regulatory authority concerned shall inform the national regulatory  authorities in other Member States and the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA)  [of a breach of security or loss of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation of  networks or services].

One horizontal objective complements the above and is described here.  #Enabling Reinforce ENISA’s impact, by improving the management of its resources and engaging more  efficiently with its stakeholders, including Member States and Union Institutions, as well as at international  level.  40 ENISA strategy document, available at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-strategy  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-strategy  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  18  Analysis of strengths and opportunities  3.4.1 Drivers for change  The change drivers identified are presented in four clusters: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and  Threats (SWOT), as follows:  Internal  Strengths Weaknesses   Landscape view – unique position to analyse how all MS  are doing and communicate back   Independence – ENISA seen as an independent agency  with no commercial or political bias   A facilitator – ENISA focuses on collaboration and  community-building   Needs-driven – ENISA remains agile and able to respond  to changing stakeholder needs   Cybersecurity excellence – at several levels, covering the  complete security lifecycle   Growth – pace of growth of budget and resources does not  match pace of demand for ENISA involvement in new areas   Influence – ENISA has limited influence over industry   Impact – as with other EU institutions, ENISA needs a better  methodology for tracking and understanding impact and  addressing market needs  External  Opportunities Threats   SPOC – opportunity for ENISA to be the  primary/coordinating EU cybersecurity body   Cybersecurity marketplace – a role for ENISA in  developing and supporting European cybersecurity  products and services   Public-private partnerships – ENISA could be supporting  and developing PPPs, e.g. leveraging the results of  research and exploiting opportunities for EU products and  services in the cybersecurity market   Technology development – opportunity for ENISA to be  the reference organisation on cybersecurity implications  from IoT, smart, mobile, AI   Privacy and data protection –ENISA could be given a role  in assisting MS and EU in addressing the technical  challenges of implementing data protection   Fragmentation – the EU cybersecurity policy space has no  coherent governance structure that includes all EU players  in a complementary manner   Strategic outlook – difficulties in executing a long-term  vision due to regulatory constraints and overlapping  mandates (other agencies/bodies claiming to have expertise  and ownership of cybersecurity)  3.4.2 Analysis of current tasks. Main findings  Overall, all current agency tasks are relevant and should be maintained.  Rather the scope of the agency could be increased to ensure a more coherent approach to the entire  cybersecurity life cycle: Prevent – Detect – Respond.  A number of current tasks need to be reinforced, namely supporting the organisation and running of Union  network and information security exercises, and, at their request, advising Member States on national  exercises in the capability-building domain and express independently its own conclusions, guidance and  advice on matters within the scope and objectives of its Regulation.  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  19  The following have been put forward for consideration regarding ENISA’s mandate, governance, role and  responsibilities:   ENISA’s current tasks and product portfolio shall be retained.   A number of existing tasks and service offerings need to be reinforced, and several new tasks and  orientations should to be considered. The complete security life cycle shall be addressed in this  approach.   ENISA shall have the power to act on its own initiative and to engage in the complete security life  cycle.   The future mandate should be scoped more broadly to allow for a coherent approach to EU  cybersecurity and give greater consideration to the economic and societal aspects of cybersecurity  where ENISA could also play a role.   Coordinating network information security and cybersecurity activities and response at EU level  (ENISA as the EU Single Point Of Contact (SPOC) for cybersecurity incident response);   Supporting the development of EU minimum standards on cybersecurity;   Working with the EU Commission, having a better-defined role in research, including:   setting priorities for research in cybersecurity (policy and industry needs);   helping to transition cybersecurity research into the market place;   Providing the EU Cybersecurity Information Hub;   Establishing with industry a Cybersecurity Training Centre.   Assessing awareness needs across EU-28, advise on “gaps”, providing awareness material,  coordinating awareness campaigns across the EU;   Serving as the EU interface to bodies that are part of global cybersecurity response;   In scoping ENISA’s role and tasks, it would be important to define clearly the scope of different  other actors in the EU cybersecurity space.   A new governance structure along the lines being considered by other agencies could be suggested  to improve the decision-making process.   Analysing the economic and societal aspects and implications of cybersecurity (e.g. economic  analysis).   Formalising ENISA’s role in supporting the implementation of GDPR.   In conjunction with the EEAS, having specific powers to assist third countries with tasks falling  within the ENISA mandate.   Alternative funding mechanisms:   ENISA providing specific consultancy services for public bodies on a cost recovery basis;   ENISA being able to apply for/benefit from research funding.  ENISA’s tasks list in Article 3 of ENISA regulation (2013) are not sufficiently strong in supporting NIS  matters. The cybersecurity threat landscape now requires a more proactive, “hands on” approach.  Regarding themes and role/responsibilities for ENISA, the following emerge as key elements of a future  permanent mandate for ENISA:  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  20   Policy advice: provision of strategic policy advice to the EU institutions and MS in relation to  cybersecurity.   Information and capability-building: ENISA as the EU Cybersecurity Information Hub offering high  quality cybersecurity analysis and training.   Cybersecurity lifecycle: getting more involved in the complete cybersecurity lifecycle, including  practical, “hands-on” support and an incident response (coordination) capacity.   Trends: ENISA using its unique cybersecurity knowledge to identify trends and forecasting threats  and potential solutions.   Collaboration: providing and maintaining an expert infrastructure platform connecting all players  EU-wide and beyond.   Research: contributing to the EU cybersecurity research agenda and supporting the development of  research results in a commercial environment.   Industry: strengthen the engagement the private sector, for instance by involving the industry in the  governance of ENISA.   Standards and certification: ENISA developing and promoting cybersecurity standards, managing  certifications.   Alternative business models: exploring the possibility of creating revenue, including providing  remuneration services e.g. by way of SLAs with EU institutions and agencies, and industry.  It is suggested that this approach allows the agency to maximise on its current capabilities. It is considered  that the approach above demonstrates a pragmatic, incremental approach, which focuses on making the  most of what ENISA already is doing and on a seamless evolution.  Several additional, more ambitious building blocks have been proposed in the next section. These are  evidence of greater ambition for what ENISA could be doing in the long term and, depending on the course  of future internal discussions and external negotiations, will also be pursued as future mandate building  blocks.  3.4.3 Emerging strategic themes for ENISA’s future mandate  On the basis of: (i) the mandate evolution and analysis in sections 3.1 and 3.2 and (ii) taking into account  the SWOT analysis in section 3.4.1, a number of common strategic themes emerge.  These are the main  new building blocks of ENISA’s future mandate. Items in the current mandate are not explicitly mentioned  here.  A comprehensive mandate allowing for a coherent approach to EU cybersecurity   Agility in delivering added value in a constantly changing landscape   Supporting the development and implementation of EU cyber policy and strategies   Mandate should address issues and opportunities for both business and technology at EU and  possibly international level   ENISA should be able to act on its own initiative   ENISA to support the development and implementation of foreign security and defence policies,  working closely with the EEAS  Need for a permanent mandate   ENISA must have a permanent mandate, not simply another extension for a limited number of  years   Adequate resources so that ENISA is not forced to prioritise important cyber activities  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  21  Need for a clear definition of the scope and coordination roles of different actors in cybersecurity   Many different stakeholders (law enforcement, defence, intelligence, privacy, technological, etc.)  should work together in a pre-defined structured way   The challenge of a multitude of EU and international agencies and complex regulatory landscape  needs to be addressed   ENISA’s central role as the internal market agency for cybersecurity needs to be more explicit  ENISA as the EU Cybersecurity Information Hub   Enhancing ENISA’s information position by using information available from all stakeholders   ENISA’s added value is high quality analysis and not processing raw data   Performing strategic analysis and analysis of incidents   Having an education/training component (Cybersecurity Training Centre)  Involvement at all stages of the cybersecurity life cycle (Prevent – Detect – Respond)   Following up on recommendations and good practices to achieve tangible impact   Moving from “hands off” design role to a more “hands on” implementation role   Learning from this, using it to enrich the agency’s experience and feeding it back into ENISA’s way  of working to improve the quality of service   Making a “hands on” rather than theoretical contribution to the EU cybersecurity debate   Developing a response capacity to cybersecurity incidents, coupled with crisis management to  complement at EU level the MS effort in this area (see next theme)  ENISA as a contributor to the coordination of cybersecurity incident response in the EU   Coordinating network information security and cybersecurity incident response at EU level  (ENISA as the EU SPOC (Single Point of Contact) for cybersecurity incident response)   Physical presence (on-the-spot), supporting a SPOC, disseminating remediation or threat insights,  in response to large-scale or critical infrastructure incidents  Using ENISA’s enhanced cybersecurity information positon to identify trends, threats and responses   Anticipating challenges and risks, emerging threats, technology developments   Early warning services and strategic analysis   Offering insight into the “next big thing”, e.g. black swans  Supporting the development of and promoting cybersecurity standards   Identifying standardisation gaps, working with all actors to identify strategic roadmaps and  oversee standardisation activities   Using ENISA good practices as standards precursors   Ensuring different stakeholders’ perspectives (including industry/private sector) are taken into  consideration throughout the standardisation process   Involvement in setting EU minimum standards on cybersecurity on the basis of trends and needs  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  22  Maintaining and managing cybersecurity certifications   Supporting the writing of certifications and reflecting changes based on technology or threat  evolution  ENISA supporting standardisation and certification   Support accreditation/standardisation activities   Being active in accreditation   A role for ENISA in cybersecurity certification – complementing national certifications with an EU  one  ENISA supporting privacy and data protection in the cyberspace   - Address the technical challenges of implementing privacy and data protection   - Support the security of personal data  Providing and maintaining an expert infrastructure platform e.g. Connected European Facilities SMART  connecting all players EU-wide and beyond   Mobilising expert networks, serving as a driver/champion   Operating the associated infrastructure   Consider offering new means/ways to collaborate   Continued focus on common effort, support, connecting the dots   Serving as an interface to institutions that are part of global cybersecurity response   Having specific powers to assist third countries with tasks falling within the ENISA mandate  Better engaging industry/the private sector   Involving the private sector in the governance of ENISA (e.g. stronger role of Permanent  Stakeholders’ Group and a different composition of the Management Board to include  representatives of industry)   ENISA’s position as an independent advisor to be maintained  Bridging the gap between cybersecurity research results and the market   Better use of research results   No institution tasked with the responsibility to support the development of research results in a  commercial environment   ENISA to nurture cybersecurity research and help with commercialisation   In addition, there could be a role for ENISA in channelling/promoting and disseminating  cybersecurity research results across Member States and industry  Contributing to the EU cybersecurity research agenda   ENISA could contribute to cybersecurity research priority-setting (e.g. “EU Commission to take  utmost account of ENISA recommendations on cybersecurity” on this)  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  23  Pragmatic involvement in policy advice   ENISA to provide: (i) analysis on trends and threats, (ii) opinions, (iii) recommendations and to (iv)  address future challenges not yet identified  Greater consideration of the economic and societal aspects of cybersecurity   Looking into the societal and economic dimension of cybersecurity which is currently not being  adequately addressed by ENISA   Given that ENISA is a single market agency, it could consider developing a level of economic  analysis in relation to cybersecurity in the EU   This would help ensure that cybersecurity is an economic enabler and not a barrier to the delivery  of the digital economy  Exploring the possibilities of providing remunerated services and other alternative business models by  way of SLAs with EU institutions and agencies and industry   Regarding governance arrangements:  o retain Permanent Stakeholders’ Group (PSG)  o consider, in line with other EU agencies, an alternative governance structure for the  agency, in order to improve efficiency of the decision-making process (NLO, PSG, Executive  Board, Management Board (MB)).  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  24  4. Vision for the future  The associated picture  illustrates the tasks that  are proposed by ENISA  for the new mandate.  The following sections  provide description for  each of the proposed  new areas for the ENISA  mandate, organised  according to the ENISA  strategic objectives41.  Cyber coordination at  EU level needs to be  enhanced. There is a  need to revise the  current EU governance  on cybersecurity, especially due to existing fragmentation of governance structure. There should be one  entity that takes the lead on coordinating cybersecurity issues at a European level (see also section  ‘Cybersecurity coordination hub’ below). ENISA proposes that this be explicitly mentioned in its new  mandate. In the following picture, compared with 2013 EU cybersecurity strategy, cyber diplomacy aspect  was added.  41 ENISA strategy available at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-strategy  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-strategy  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  25  Expertise: best practice & recommendations  Economics of cybersecurity (DSM)  The proposal is for ENISA to carry out studies of the economics of cybersecurity (i.e. the EU cybersecurity  market and related economic issues) in order to provide quantitative data that could support decision  making in this area. The overall goal would be to ensure that cybersecurity policy is aligned with EU  industrial policy and that cybersecurity is used as an economic lever as opposed to a barrier.  Align cybersecurity research with policy & commercialisation  There are two ways in which ENISA can support to align cybersecurity research with policy and  commercialisation. Firstly, to involve ENISA in high level panels that decide on research priorities for  H2020 whenever cybersecurity is likely to be a key topic. Secondly, the Agency could work together with  H2020 projects and its existing stakeholder networks to establish a framework to support the  commercialisation of research results.  Coverage of geopolitical and societal developments  The existing work carried out by ENISA on the Threat Landscape should be broadened from the existing  technical approach to cover geopolitical, societal and economic developments.  Policy: supporting policy development and implementation  Addressing cybersecurity policy fragmentation  The Commission should recognise the central role of ENISA in EU cybersecurity and use ENISA to minimise  fragmentation and duplication of resources thereby addressing cybersecurity policy fragmentation.  ICT security certification  Current policy initiatives in this area are leading towards the creation of an EU framework for ICT security  certification. As a neutral third party, ENISA would be an ideal candidate for supporting such a framework.  Involvement in all key policy initiatives  ENISA should be systematically alerted when new EU policy initiatives arise, which could have an impact on  cybersecurity and privacy in the cyberspace ensuring involvement in all key policy initiatives. Such an alert  should trigger a short analysis by ENISA identifying potential issues and suggesting whether or not the  Agency should contribute. In addition, the Agency should be invited to contribute to policy development  wherever it identifies a need to do so. The agency should provide strategic policy advice to the  Commission, Parliament and the MS. This strategic level role can be added to the existing ones that are of  tactical and support nature.  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  26  Capacity: hands on by ENISA experts  Cybersecurity full lifecycle  By combining preparation and response capabilities under a single EU body to provide a cybersecurity full  lifecycle approach, the probability of incoherencies and misunderstandings would be greatly reduced.  This  could also reduce fragmentation at the EU level, eventually resulting in less independent organisations and  enabling more powerful synergies and economies of scale. This would also increase the accountability of  the Agency, as it would be implementing its own recommendations. In a system that splits these two  aspects (‘design’ and ‘implementation’) there is scope for a misalignment at several different levels and  the accountability model is not at all clear.  Reinforce role in securing CIIP  One of the main challenges of the NISD Cooperation Group (CG) is that the majority of the member states  lack in depth knowledge on critical sector specific cybersecurity issues. At the same time, there is a lack of  established and functioning at EU level bodies, which provide sector specific knowledge to the CG, which  covers all different stakeholders and all different subsectors. To fill these gaps, the new mandate can  reinforce ENISA’s role in securing CIIs by taking advantage of the knowledge gained and the relationships  established with the sector specific stakeholders by the Agency during all these years.  Supporting standards process  ENISA could play a stronger role in supporting the cybersecurity standards process by providing policy and  technical guidance to Standards Development Organisations (SDO). In addition, the Agency could assist the  Commission in defining future policy in this area by acting as an advisor to the standardisation roadmap.  Community: community building/coordination  Cyber crisis cooperation / technical support  An EU focal point for EU cyber crisis cooperation would support the exchange of information and foster  situation awareness on cyber incidents and related crises. Member States and EU Institutions, in particular  the CSIRTs Network, should form the foundation of this pool, which would need to be supported by a core  capability at EU-Level.  ENISA would be a legitimate candidate to host such core capability.  Cybersecurity coordination hub  There are many EU institutions and bodies involved in cybersecurity, each with its own specific mandate  and responsibilities (examples include Commission DGs, CERT EU, EC3, EDA, EU LISA). This situation has the  advantage of being able to offer cybersecurity services that are targeted to particular communities but  could result in separate pools of incomplete information and incoherent methods across communities  (including incompatible standards and methodologies). ENISA, acting as a cybersecurity coordination hub,  shall support these different bodies by offering a number of ‘cross-community support services’ such as  threat analysis, cross-community trends analysis, trusted information exchange, advice on standards and  certification practices, standard risk analysis techniques and taxonomies. This will help to avoid  fragmentation and duplication of resources.  Increased international cooperation  The proposal is that ENISA plays a more active role in international cooperation.  Concretely, (a) ENISA  shall be called upon to play a more proactive role in collaborating with international organisations having a  role in cybersecurity (such as the OECD, ICANN, IETF, …) and (b) ENISA shall be tasked with supporting  cyber dialogues led notably by the EEAS when cybersecurity is an issue.  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  27  Annex A: Terminology  While in this document, we do not aim to provide new definitions to cybersecurity and to cyber space, we  work with the following understanding of the terminology:   Cyber space is the time-dependent42 set of connected tangible assets43 (relying or depending on  networks and internet like communication), infrastructures, systems and networks; Information; Users  and all activities and interactions/communication including virtual ones.   Cybersecurity covers all aspects of prevention, forecasting; tolerance; detection; mitigation, removal,  analysis and investigation of cyber incidents. Considering the different types of components of the  cyber space, cybersecurity should cover the following attributes: Availability, Reliability, Safety,  Confidentiality, Integrity, Maintainability (for tangible systems, information and networks)  Robustness, Survivability, Resilience (to support the dynamicity of the cyber space), Accountability,  Authenticity and Non-repudiation (to support information security).   Cyber ethics. Ethics are principles or standards of human conduct. Cyber ethics is a code of behaviour  on the Internet44. Cyber ethics is the philosophic study of ethics pertaining to computers,  encompassing user behaviour and what computers are programmed to do, and how this affects  individuals and society45.   Cyber hygiene covers several practices46 that should be implemented and carrying out regularly to  protect users and businesses online.   Any occurrence that has impact on any of the components of the cyber space or on the functioning of  the cyber space, independent if it’s natural or human made; malicious or non-malicious intent;  deliberate, accidental or due to incompetence; due to development or due to operational interactions  is called cyber incident.  Also we call cyber incident any incident generated by any of cyber space  components even if the damage/disruption, dysfunctionality is caused outside the cyber space.   To support a ‘grading’ of cyber incidents, we define cyber accidents as any occurrence associated with  cyber space causing significant damage to cyber space or any other asset (has performance impact,  requires repairs, replacement) or causing personal injury.   Cyber investigation. A process conducted for the purpose of cyber accident and incident prevention  which includes the gathering and analysis of information, the drawing of conclusions, including the  determination of causes and, when appropriate, the making of safety and security recommendations.   Cyber-attacks cover all cyber incident triggered by malicious intent where damages, disruptions or  dysfunctionalities are caused.   Cybercrime refers to any crime/criminal activity facilitated by or using cyber space.  42 Time dependency aspect presented in: Cyberspace: Definition and Implications, Rain Ottis, Peeter Lorents (2010), abstract,  available at: https://ccdcoe.org/multimedia/cyberspace-definition-and-implications.html  43 A survey identifying the components of cyberspace as presented in cyber space definitions is presented in: “Cyberspace – What  is it?”, Damir Rajnovic - July 26, 2012, available at: http://blogs.cisco.com/security/cyberspace-what-is-it  44 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/safety/online-privacy/cyberethics-practice.aspx  45 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberethics  46 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-hygiene  https://ccdcoe.org/multimedia/cyberspace-definition-and-implications.html http://blogs.cisco.com/security/cyberspace-what-is-it https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/safety/online-privacy/cyberethics-practice.aspx https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberethics https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-hygiene  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  28   Cyber sabotage refers to any sabotage activity facilitated by or using cyber space.   By cyber espionage we understand 2 types of espionage vectors: (a) state espionage (intelligence,  when state actors are involved) or (b) industrial espionage (when commercial actors are involved).   Cyber-defense47 refers to a variety of defensive mechanisms that could be used to mitigate or respond  to cyber-attacks.   Cyberwarfare refers to any action by a state, group or criminal organisation facilitated by or using  cyber space targeting another state.  47 Kolini, Farzan and Janczewski, Lech, \"Cyber Defense Capability Model: A Foundation Taxonomy\" (2015), International  Conference on Information Resources Management (CONF-IRM) 2015, Proceedings, Paper 32, available at:  http://aisel.aisnet.org/confirm2015/32  http://aisel.aisnet.org/confirm2015/32  ENISA’s input to the mandate renewal discussion  Version B  |  13 July 2017  29  Annex B: References  Year Reference Policy/legislation reference.

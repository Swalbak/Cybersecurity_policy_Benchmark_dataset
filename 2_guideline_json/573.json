Security framework  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 1  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  iv  Executive summary  E-Government services have significant potential to make public services more efficient for the  benefit of citizens and businesses in terms of time and money. And while these benefits are  increasingly being felt nationally, e-Government services still face administrative and legal barriers  on a cross-border level, although pan-European projects like STORK2 have shown that technical  issues of interoperability of electronic identifications can be overcome. In order to remove existing  barriers for cross-border e-ID based services the Commission has proposed in June 2012 a draft  regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market [38], which will replace the existing Electronic Signature Directive 1999/93/EC [37]. The main  goals of this action are to:   ensure mutual recognition and acceptance of electronic identification across borders   give legal effect and mutual recognition to trust services   enhance current rules on e-signatures   provide a legal framework for electronic seals, time stamping, electronic document  acceptability, electronic delivery and website authentication.   ensure minimal security level of trust services providers systems   enforce obligation of notifications about security incidents at trust services providers  In Article 15 of the above mentioned draft regulation the Commission proposes that trust services  providers have to demonstrate due diligence, in relation to the identification of risks and adoption of  appropriate security practices, and notify competent bodies of any breach of security or loss of  integrity that has a significant impact on the trust service provided and on the personal data  maintained therein.  In this context, the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) developed  in 2013 the Guidelines for trust services providers, discussing the minimal security levels to be  maintained by the trust services providers. The study is split into three parts:  Security framework: describing the framework surrounding trust service providers (TPSs), focusing  on EU standards, but taking into account others where relevant.  Risk assessment: discussing the principles and concepts of managing the risks applicaple to TSPs by  defining and controlling threats and vulnerabilities.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents: recommending measures to mitigate the impact of  security incidents on trust service providers (TSP) by proposing suitable technical and organisational  means to handle the security risks posed to the TSP.  All three parts can also be used separately, as they address different issues and target different  audience, so the introductory sections overlap.  This document, Part 1: Security framework, describes the framework surrounding trust service  providers (TPSs) – the concepts and standards related to operations of a TSP. It focuses on EU  standards, but also takes into account others where relevant.  The document specifically outlines security requirements for qualified3 and non-qualified trust  service providers. It references the most important standards and standardization bodies involved in  technical specification, as well as certification, auditing and supervision schemes that can be used in  order to qualify as a notified trust service provider.  2  https://www.eid-stork.eu/  3 which meets the requirements laid down in Annex I of the Directive 1999/93/EC [37]  https://www.eid-stork.eu/  Security framework  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 1  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  v  The document also presents result of a survey4 conducted by ENISA amongst European trust service  providers related to the different aspects.

The  scope of such services includes, but is not limited to, electronic signatures and seals, electronic time  stamps, and electronic authentication. Usually, these services rely on electronic certificates issued by  certificate service providers (CSP) which is a type of TSP. For the sake of simplicity, we use the CSP as  a running example for a TSP within the document at hand. All recommendations apply analogously  to other types of TSP as well.  An electronic certificate (or certificate for short) is an electronic document that binds certain pieces  of data together and is signed by a trusted third party that vows for the binding. For example, an  attribute certificate binds an identity, such as a person, a service, or a device, to certain attributes,  such as profession or access rights. Another example is a public key certificate that binds an identity  to a public key. This certificate can then be used, amongst others, to verify the identity or signature  of the certificate holder. In order to keep things understandable, we use public key certificates as  running example throughout this document. All recommendations apply analogously to other types  of certificates as well.  Electronic certificates rely on public key cryptography. In public key cryptography, two separate  keys, mathematically linked, are provided to an entity. One of the keys is public and can be  disseminated, while the other key is private and needs to be under the sole custody of the key pair  owner. The private key cannot be derived by sole knowledge of the public key, but one key  completes the other in terms of cryptographic operations. For example, a cipher text created using  the public key can be decrypted using the private key; equally, the public key can be used to verify  signatures that were created by the private key. Because of this property of public key cryptography,  and by ensuring the secrecy of the private key and the authenticity of the public key, a relying party  can verify that an entity presenting a certificate is who it claims to be or that a signature is valid.  However, a third party is needed to ensure that the information contained in the certificate,  including the public key, is actually linked to the real identity of the entity. This is done by a TSP,  which uses its so-called certificate authority (CA) signing keys to sign the entities’ certificates. With  this operation the TSP attests that the certificate was issued to the entity whose information is  contained in it. Hence, we distinguish between two different types of certificates:   Subject certificates, also called end entity certificates, that are used for day to day tasks such  as authentication, signatures, or encryption. The holder of such a certificate is called the  subject.   CA signing certificates that are used to sign other certificates. Apart from signing subject  certificates, CA certificates are often also used to sign other CA certificates to establish a  trust relationship between CAs.  Electronic certificates can be used for a variety of purposes, some of the most common being to  support electronic signatures, electronic seals or website authentication. Electronic signatures or  seals are meant for natural persons (signatures) or legal entities (seals) to be able to produce digital  signatures on documents or messages in order to ensure:   The integrity of the document or message: attest that the document or message has not  been altered.   The authenticity and non-repudiation: attest that the document or message was produced  by the certificate owner.  Page  2  In the context of authentication, when an entity A presents itself to another entity B with its  electronic certificate, entity B can verify that the entity A is actually who it claims to be by checking  that entity A is in possession of the private key associated with the public key included in the  certificate.  In the case of encryption, electronic certificates can also be used to provide confidentiality. The use  of public key cryptography for the exchange of  session keys ensures the confidentiality of the  communication. Here, the session key is the entity that carries out the encryption of the messages.  The service of Certificate Service Providers can be broken down into the following component  services   Registration service: verifies the identity and, if applicable, any specific attributes of a  subject. The results of this service are passed to the certificate generation service.   Certificate generation service: creates and signs certificates based on the identity and other  attributes verified by the registration service.   Dissemination service: disseminates certificates to subjects, and if the subject consents,  makes them available to relying parties. This service also makes available the CA's terms and  conditions, and any published policy and practice information, to subscribers and relying  parties.   Revocation management service: processes requests and reports relating to revocation to  determine the necessary action to be taken. The results of this service are distributed  through the revocation status service.   Revocation status service: provides certificate revocation status information to relying  parties. This may be based upon certificate revocation lists or a real time service which  provides status information on an individual basis. The status information may be updated  on a regular basis and hence may not reflect the current status of the certificate.  and optionally:   Subject device provision service: prepares and provides a signature-creation device to  subjects.  Page  3  2 Trust service providers in the EU regulatory framework  2.1 The concept of certification services in the legal framework  The main legal text addressing the area of electronic certification services in the EU is the Directive  1999/93/EC on a Community framework for electronic signatures [37]. The objective of this Directive  is to facilitate the use of electronic signatures and to contribute to their legal recognition.  The Directive defines a ‘certification service provider’ as an entity or a legal or natural person who  issues certificates or provides other services related to electronic signatures, while ‘certificate’ is  defined as an electronic attestation which links signature-verification data to a person and confirms  the identity of that person. This definition stresses the fact that the scope of the current regulatory  framework is limited to certificates for electronic signatures. Providers of other types of certificates,  or complementary services related to electronic certificates but not oriented to electronic  signatures, are not regulated by the provisions set by the Directive.  This limitation in scope is about to change, as the current Directive is expected to be superseded by  a new Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the  internal market [38], which was presented as a proposal in July 2012. The proposal introduces some  important changes in the reach of the services covered. It extends the concept of certification  services further from electronic signatures to any type of electronic certificates.  In June and July 2013 ENISA conducted a survey among trust services providers, in which 46  participants took part. Its goal was to identify security practices in force at these organisations5. The  results show that a majority of the EU providers participating in the survey already issue these other  types of certificates. While 95% of the respondents report issuing certificates for individuals, making  it the most common type of service, 80% of participants also report issuing certificates for web site  authentication. Certificates for legal entities are also issued by 80% of the respondents.  Additionally, 33% of respondents reported issuing other types of certificates. Among the most cited  types were:   Code signing certificates, used to verify the integrity and authenticity of software programs;   Server certificates, used for automated signing operations by computer servers;   Device certificates, used for the authentication of devices;   Issuing CA certificates, used for generating intermediate CAs (CAs which issue certificates to  end users) from a root CA;  5  For the in-depth description of the study, please refer to the document “TSP services, standards and risk  analysis report”, ENISA 2013. The participants are mentioned in the acknowledgements at the beginning of  this document.  Page  4  Figure 1: Types of provided electronic certificates  2.2 The concept of trust services in the legal framework  In order to achieve a common nomenclature for all services related to electronic certificates  issuance and added services, the proposal introduces the new concept of trust services, which are  defined as any electronic service consisting in the creation, verification, validation, handling and  preservation of electronic signatures, electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic documents,  electronic delivery services, website authentication, and electronic certificates, including certificates  for electronic signature and for electronic seals.  In the new framework, certification services providers become a type of trust service providers.  ENISA’s survey on security practices of trust service providers shows that a majority of the EU  providers participating in the survey, 85%, already provide other services, such as time stamps or  long term signature preservation, in addition to pure certification services.  Trust service providers can be located both within the EU and outside of EU. How some of the EU  specific terms are to be interpreted for non EU located TSPs is not defined.  Figure 2: Types of trust services provided  Page  5  2.3 The qualification scheme  The Directive 1999/93/EC [37] introduced the concept of qualification of electronic signatures. The  main objective of the qualification scheme is to establish a certain set of requirements for an  electronic signature that, when conforming to it, would make the signature “satisfy the legal  requirements of a signature in relation to data in electronic form in the same manner as a  handwritten signature satisfies those requirements in relation to paper-based” and “admissible as  evidence in legal proceedings”.  It shall be noted, however, that the fact that an electronic signature isg non-qualified does not  invalidate the electronic signature. The difference lies in the fact that an electronic signature under  the qualification scheme will have a presumption of legal validity, while, for others, the univocal link  between the signatory and the signature, and the integrity of the signature, may have to be  demonstrated. The exact legal consequences however differ between member states because the  Directive had to be transposed to every member states national legislation.  The introduction of the qualification concept in the European legislation gave a legal foundation to  electronic signatures. This stimulated the European market of electronic certificates, where trust  service providers started to issue qualified certificates that could be used by EU citizens, especially in  their relationships with public administrations. As a result, many European providers issue qualified  certificates for electronic signatures nowadays, although there are large differences between  member states. ENISA’s survey on security practices of trust service providers shows that a majority  of the EU providers participating in the survey, 93%, issue qualified certificates.  However, the restriction of the scope of the qualification scheme to electronic signatures, combined  with the practice of most European providers of issuing several types of certificates, has prompted  as the most common practice to issue both qualified and non-qualified certificates, with 80% of the  respondents following this practice. Only 13% issue exclusively qualified certificates, while another  7% issue exclusively non-qualified certificates. These later group is mainly composed of providers  focused on web authentication certificates used for TLS/SSL connections in internet.  Figure 3: Provision of qualified certificates  Page  6  This double schema may have come as a burden for providers, which may be subject to government  supervision to issue qualified certificates, but that can apply this qualification only for electronic  signature certificates. They must follow a set of restrictive requirements for qualified certificates and  may not be able to leverage this supervision for other trust services they may provide in the same  conditions and subject to the same security requirements.  This issue has been addressed by the new proposal for a Regulation, which, in the same way it  extends the scope of the certification services, extends the possibility of qualification to other types  of certificates. Specifically three types are contemplated:   Qualified certificate for electronic signature.   Qualified certificate for electronic seal.   Qualified certificate for website authentication.  In the new framework, a qualified electronic signature, aimed at natural persons, “shall have the  legal effect of a handwritten signature”. This definition is very similar to that existing in the current  Directive. A qualified electronic seal, aimed at legal entities, “shall enjoy the legal presumption of  ensuring the origin and integrity of the data to which it is linked”. Qualified website authentication  certificates, aimed at web domains, are meant to “be an attestation which makes it possible to  authenticate a website and links the website to the entity to whom the certificate is issued”.  Aside from introducing new types of qualified certificates, the proposal also foresees the existence  of other qualified trust services, which are derived from the use of electronic certificates: electronic  time stamps, qualified electronic delivery services, qualified validation service for qualified electronic  signatures and qualified electronic signature preservation services. The ENISA study focuses in more  detail on the security aspects of these new types of trust services that are foreseen in the new  Proposal.  2.4 Security requirements for trust service providers  Directive 1999/93/EC didn’t introduce any general security requirements applicable to all providers,  regardless of the type of certificates they issue, requirements were only set for providers of qualified  certificates for electronic signatures. However, the maturity of the market has proved that electronic  certificates, whether they are used for binding signatures with legal presumption, or for securing  private electronic communications and transactions in the  Internet, need to be provided and  maintained within a secure environment to protect the sensitive operations they are employed for.  In this context, the new proposal for a Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for  electronic transactions in the internal market has introduced a specific provision addressing the  security of trust services, which are applicable to all providers. These provisions are compiled in  Article 15. Article 15 establishes that all providers must:   Take appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the  security of the trust services they provide.   Introduce measures to ensure that the level of security is appropriate to the degree of risk.   Take measures to prevent and minimise the impact of security incidents and inform  stakeholders of adverse effects of any incidents.  All providers are required in the new framework to conduct a risk assessment exercise on their  services, to implement the appropriate security measures to minimize the possibility of incidents  taking place, and to have in place the adequate measures to respond and manage possible incidents.  Page  7  As ENISA’s survey on security practices of trust service providers shows, a majority of the EU  providers participating in the survey already apply measures for these purposes. 96% of respondents  report having an approved information security policy. Conducting a formal risk assessment is not so  systematic yet, however 72% report having a business risk assessment document. Regarding the  management of incidents and continuity of operations, 83% declare having an incident response  plan and 80% a business continuity plan.  Figure 4: Security documents  Besides those security requirements, Article 15 also foresees that trust service providers must,  without undue delay and where feasible not later than 24 hours after having become aware of it,  notify the competent supervisory body, the competent national body for information security and  other relevant third parties such as data protection authorities of any breach of security or loss of  integrity that has a significant impact on the trust service provided and on the personal data  maintained therein.  The topic of breach notifications in trust service providers has been approached in more detail in the  ENISA report “Implementation of Art 15: Security breaches notifications in trust services”6.  2.5 Specific requirements for qualified certification services  Requirements for the different components of a qualified certification service were extensively  found in different sections of the Directive 1999/93/EC. These requirements concern both  technological measures to guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of the signature creation data,  as well as contractual and legal issues for the provider.  All the requirements for the components of a certification service derive from the requisite set for  an electronic signature to be considered qualified. A qualified electronic signature must be:   An advanced electronic signature   Created with a secure signature creation device  6  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/implementation-of-article-15  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/implementation-of-article-15  Page  8   Based on a qualified certificate issued by a trust service provider.  In the new Proposal, requirements for qualified electronic signatures or seals are analogous to the  ones present in the current Directive. For a web authentication certificate to be qualified it must be  issued by a qualified trust service provider and based on qualified certificates for website  authentication.  The following sections describe in detail what are the requirements set in the current and proposed  framework for a provider to be accredited as qualified, as well as for the certification components to  fulfill the provisions set for them.  2.5.1 Requirements on the trust service provider  Qualified certificates can only be provided by qualified certificate providers. Therefore the first stage  for a trust service provider to issue qualified certificates is to become a qualified trust service  provider. The requirements for qualified trust service providers are laid down in the Article 19 of the  new Proposal, and concern the following aspects:  Reliability in the service: Qualified trust service providers must demonstrate reliability for providing  the service. They must implement adequate policies and procedures which are in line with current  standards, and employ qualified and trained personnel with sufficient knowledge on the area of  electronic signatures and security procedures.  Proper establishment of contractual relationships: Qualified trust service providers must inform  individuals, before entering a contractual relationship with them, of the terms and conditions  applicable to the service. This information should include the use of the certificate, including any  limitations, the existence of a voluntary accreditation scheme and procedures for complaints and  dispute settlement.  Subject registration: Qualified trust service providers must verify, in accordance with national law,  the identity of the subject to whom the certificate is issued. Directive 1999/93/EC didn’t specify how  this verification of identity needs to be done, for example, if registration through electronic means is  possible. The new Proposal clarifies how the registration can be conducted:  1. By physical presence of the subject.  2. Remotely, using an identification means under a notified scheme that was issued through  physical presence.  The possibility of identifying the subject electronically, by means, for example, of the use of a  national electronic identity card is opened.  Use of trustworthy systems: Qualified trust service providers are required to use trustworthy  systems which are protected against modification and ensure the technical and cryptographic  security of the process supported by them. The Directive establishes that trustworthy systems that  store certificates must meet these requirements:   Only authorised persons can make entries and changes.   Information can be checked for authenticity.   Any technical changes compromising these security requirements are apparent to the  operator.   Certificates are publicly available for retrieval in only those cases for which the certificate  holder's consent has been obtained, and depending on member states' data protection laws.  The requirements for trustworthy systems set in Article 19 are similar to those established in the  Directive 1999/93/EC, with two variations. The first is that the new framework only foresees that  Page  9  trustworthy systems need to ensure the reliability, not the cryptographic security, of the processes  supported by them. This acknowledges the fact that the possible vulnerabilities that may appear in  algorithms considered secure until a certain moment are outside the control of the provider. The  second change is that in the new framework the requirements set for the systems storing  certificates are extended to all systems storing the information provided to the CSP.  Liability: Qualified trust service providers are required to maintain financial resources to operate  under the obligations laid down in the regulations and to be able to bear the risk of liability when  failure to comply results in damages for a certificate subject.  Accountability: Qualified trust service providers must keep records and logs of all relevant events  concerning the certificate life cycle, and record all relevant information concerning a qualified  certificate for an appropriate period of time, in particular for the purpose of providing evidence of  certification for the purposes of legal proceedings.  Confidentiality and integrity: Qualified trust service providers must take measures against forgery of  certificates to ensure their integrity. The current framework establishes that they must not store a  copy of the signatory signature creation data of the certificate subjects.  In the cases where the  provider generates the signature creation data for the subject, it must ensure the confidentiality of  this data when delivering them to the individual. The provider should not be in possession of the  subject’s private key, which must be under the sole custody of the certificate holder.  However this provision is not included in the new framework, as the possibility of providers to store  the signature creation data (for primary or back up purposes) on behalf of the certificate subject is  opened, as long it is done with the appropriate level of security.  Revocation status information: Qualified trust service providers must ensure the operation of a  secure and prompt security directory and an immediate revocation service, as well as the precision  and availability of the certificate issuing and revocation times.  ETSI [11] defines a time limit for providers issuing qualified certificates to process the revocation of  the certificate within 24 hours. ENISA’s survey on security practices of trust service providers shows  that, among EU trust service providers participating in the survey, 40% report that 5 minutes is the  maximum latency they guarantee for including the revocation of a certificate in the certificate  database after such revocation has taken effect, however 23% report one day latency, with the rest  providing intermediate latencies. The responses however do not differ between technically updating  the revocation database and the complete process of revocation, so answers may not be  comparable.  Termination: Providers need to have in place an up-to-date termination plan to ensure continuity of  service in accordance with arrangements issued by the supervisory body. ENISA’s survey on security  practices of trust service providers shows that, among trust service providers participating in the  survey shows that 75% of providers already have an approved CA Termination Plan.  2.5.2 Requirements for the components of the certification service  Qualified certificate profiles  A requirement set by the Directive 1999/93/EC [37] for an electronic signature to be considered  qualified is that such a signature be based on a qualified certificate. A qualified certificate is an  electronic certificate issued by a certificate provider that contains a minimum set of information  which is described in the Annex I of the Directive. These data include:   Indication that the certificate is issued as a Qualified Certificate   Identification of the provider and the state where it is established  Page  10   Name or pseudonym of the signatory, and if applicable, specific attributes used in the  certificate   Identity code and validity period of the certificate   Signature verification data   Advanced electronic signature of the trust service provider issuing the certificate   Limitations on the scope and value of transactions to be performed by the certificate, if  applicable  In the new Proposal, requirements for a qualified certificate are similar to those set in the Directive  1999/93/EC, with the introduction of some additional compulsory information, which are meant to  facilitate the verification of the status of the certificate and the provider:  1. Indication of the location where the advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic  seal of the issuing qualified trust service provider is available.  2. Indication of the location of the certificate validity status services that can be used to  enquire about the validity status of the qualified certificate.  3. If the electronic signature creation data are located in a qualified electronic signature  creation device, an indication of this.  Additionally, the new framework also defines qualified certificates requirements for electronic seals  in its Annex III, which are analogous to those for certificates for electronic signatures; with some  adaptions for electronic seal certificates being conceived for legal entities.  The requirements for certificates for website authentication are similar to those for qualified  certificates for electronic signatures and seals, with some differences, for example the certificate  must include the domain name operated by the legal entity to whom the certificate is issued. Also,  due to their nature, there is no provision for information regarding electronic signature validation  data or signature creation device.  Advanced electronic signature  The Directive 1999/93/EC determines that qualified electronic signatures are advanced electronic  signatures created with a secure signature creation device. Within the current Directive, an  advanced electronic signature is an electronic signature which fulfils these requirements:   Is uniquely linked to the signatory   Capable of identifying him/her   Created using means that the signatory can maintain under his/her sole control   Linked to the data to which it relates in such a manner that any subsequent change of the  data is detectable  The requirements set in the Proposal for an electronic signature to be considered advanced are  similar to those set in the previous the Directive 1999/93/EC. The only variation related to it is that  while in the current Directive the signature needs to be created using electronic signature creation  data that the signatory can maintain under his/her sole control, in the new Regulation the  requirement specifies can maintain under his/her sole control “with a high level of confidence”,  acknowledging the fact that there may some vulnerabilities that are outside the control of the  certificate subject or the provider.  Secure signature creation device  The other requirement set by Directive 1999/93/EC for an electronic signature to be considered  qualified is to be created in a secure signature creation device. Secure signature creation devices are  configured software or hardware that is used to implement the signature process with the signature  Page  11  data. They must ensure that the signature has been produced with the subject private key and  implement measures to guarantee its confidentiality.  The conditions for a signature creation device to be considered secure are set in the annex III of the  Directive 1999/93/EC:   Ensure that the signature-creation-data used for signature generation can practically occur  only once, and that their secrecy is reasonably assured.   Ensure that the signature-creation-data used for signature generation cannot, with  reasonable assurance, be derived and the signature is protected against forgery using  currently available technology.   Ensure that the signature-creation-data used for signature generation can be reliably  protected by the legitimate signatory against the use of others.   Not alter the data to be signed or prevent such data from being presented to the signatory  prior to the signature process.  In the new proposal, the requirements for signature creation devices to be qualified are similar to  those established in the Directive 1999/93/EC for secure signature creation devices, with some  variations which concern mainly the handling of the signature creation data, including the key pair,  by the provider in behalf of the certificate subject. This possibility, which was not foreseen by the  Directive, is opened both for the managing of the keys themselves, as for back up purposes:  1. Generation or managing of the signature creation data by the provider can be done by  qualified trust service providers.  2. The provider may keep a backup copy of the signature creation data on behalf of the  signatory, provided that the duplicated data sets are subject to the same level of security  and that they are the minimum necessary to ensure the continuity of the service.  As noted before there are no provisions for secure signature devices for website authentication  certificates.  Page  12  3 Standardisation in the area of trust services  Standards are specifications, adopted or created by a standardisation organization or user group, for  repeated or continuous application, with which compliance is not compulsory. The field of trust  services has produced several standards and technical specifications. One reason for the existence of  a large set of standards and technical specifications in the field of trust services is a high need for  interoperability and assurance, as trust services are meant to add security in the exchange of  information between different organizations and individuals.  Regulations in the area of trust services have also provided a high level of detail in terms of security  requirements of the services, especially due to the qualification scheme, and several of the  standards that have been created are oriented to offer guidance regarding compliance with the  regulations. But even for providers outside the compliance scope, standards have helped them to  obtain guidance in order to ensure the service is delivered with the appropriate level of assurance in  an international context.  Standards are always evolving, and the standards referenced in this chapter may be superseded by  updated standards from time to time.  The European Interoperability Framework (EIF) [51] is a set of recommendations which specify how  Administrations, Businesses and Citizens communicate with each other within the EU and across  member states borders. The goal is to provide a framework to enable interoperability and reuse  leading to improved public service delivery and lower cost.  The EIF recommends some basic principles regarding use of standards, such as that the use of ICT  should create equal opportunities for all citizens and businesses through inclusive services that are  publicly accessible without discrimination. Bearing this in mind it is important for TSPs operating  under the Directive, and the new proposal, to have a good understanding on standards relevant for  the field.  3.1 Organizations involved in the development of standards for certification  services  Several bodies have been involved in the creation of standards for certification services. One of the  first to develop the area of certification services was the International Telecommunication Union  (ITU) with the X.509 framework, which has been universally adopted as the standard for public key  infrastructures. Subsequently, several organizations, both at the international and European level,  have undertaken the task of developing standards in this area:   The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has produced several  standards to support the implementation of the European legislation in the area of trust  services, as well as to promote the adoption of international and industry standards in  Europe. Within ETSI, the ESI technical committee is in charge of producing technical  specifications in the area of trust services.   The European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has produced a series of technical  recommendations in the form of CEN Workshop Agreements (CWAs) in the area of products  for electronic signatures, some of which have become harmonized European standards.   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is an independent organization that produces  technical specifications, denominated Requests for Comments (RFCs), that have been widely  adopted as industry standards in several IT technology fields. In the area of certification  services IETF has produced several specifications that are widely employed and that have  been adapted by European standardization bodies to be used in European market.  Page  13  The ENISA survey on security practices of trust service providers shows that a majority of the EU  providers participating in the study are following standards from these three organizations. The  figure below shows that ETSI standards are, with 89% of responses, the most employed, probably  because they provide guidance for providers of qualified certificates, which most European trust  service providers issue. Nevertheless, IETF standards are also widely used, by 84% of the providers,  due to these standards being the most followed in the field internationally. Finally 80,4% of  respondents either employ a CEN standard, or more commonly, use products certified against a CEN  Workshop Agreement, as CEN standards are more focused on products.  Figure 5: Use of certification services related standards  3.2 Standards for certificate profiles  Certificate profiles define the formats and fields that certificates must contain in order to be  interoperable and readable by all participating parties. The basis for defining the complete  framework on public key infrastructures, including the formats for electronic certificates is the ITU-T  Recommendation X.509: Information technology - Open Systems Interconnection - The Directory:  Public-key and attribute certificate frameworks. This recommendation, adopted as an international  standard by ISO/IEC 9594-8:2008 [5], has been widely accepted as a standard for formats for public  key certificates, among others components of a public key infrastructure.  Based on the X.509 framework, the most widely employed standard for the definition of an  electronic certificate profile is the IETF technical specification RFC 5280 Internet X.509 Public Key  Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile [22]. RFC 5280 profiles the  X.509 v3 certificate and X.509 v2 certificate revocation list for use in the Internet.  For qualified certificates, the ETSI European Norm EN 319 412-5  Qualified Certificate profil  defines, based on the technical specifications of the IETF, the format of qualified certificates  complying with the Directive 1999/93/EC.  Another ETSI technical specification, TS 119 412-2 X.509 V.3 Certificate Profile for Certificates Issued  to Natural Persons defines a common profile dependant on the IETF standards for  Page  14  implementation of X.509 V.3 and the ETSI standard TS 101 862 (EN 319 412-5) , to allow  actual interoperability of certificates.  The CA and Browser Forum (CA/B Forum) is an organization of public Certificate Authorities and  browser vendors. The CA/B Forum establishes guidelines and requirements for web server  certificates on the Internet. If the CSP issues certificates for web servers the CA/B Forum  requirements7 define many properties for web server certificates.  3.3 Standards for Certification Practice Statements  In order to document and make available to its customers all the policies and procedures that a trust  service provider follows, two standardized document formats have been created: the Certificate  Policy and the Certification Practice Statement. These documents provide to users essential  information regarding aspects such as contractual issues and the security practices of the provider.  These two standards are widely used to obtain guidelines in the elaboration of these documents for  any trust service provider, issuing qualified or not qualified certificates:  At the international level, The IETF technical specification RFC 3647 Internet X.509 Public Key  Infrastructure Certificate Policy and Certification Practices Framework [23] provides a framework to  assist the writers and users of certificate policies or certification practice statements in drafting and  understanding these documents.  At a European level, the ETSI standard TS 102 042 Policy requirements for certification authorities  issuing public key certificate [16] defines policy requirements on the operation and management  practices of certification services providers such that users and relying parties may have confidence  in the applicability of the certificate in support of cryptographic mechanisms.  Regarding providers of qualified certificates, the most widely used standard is the ETSI standard TS  101 456 Policy requirements for certification authorities issuing qualified certificates [12]. TS 101 456  defines policy requirements on the operation and management practices of certification authorities  similar to those of TS 102 042 but meant to comply with the provisions set in the Directive  1999/93/EC. To support the implementation of TS 101 456, ETSI also produced the technical  specification TR 102 437 Guidance on TS 101 456 which provides guidelines on interpreting the TS  101 456 requirements.  All these standards are widely followed by European providers. ENISA’s survey on security practices  of trust service providers shows that among trust service providers participating in the survey, 84,8%  of respondents reported following RFC 3647, 80,4% ETSI 101 456 and 54,3% ETSI TS 102 042.  7  https://www.cabforum.org/  https://www.cabforum.org/  Page  15  Figure 6: Use of standards for certification policies and practices  When results are combined, results show that 98,8% followed at least one of the three standards  (RFC 3647, ETSI TS 101 456 or ETSI TS 102 042), with 45,7% of the survey participants reporting  following the three of them.  The ETSI Policy Requirement standards are currently in the process of being updated.  3.4 Standards for trustworthy systems  The Directive 1999/93/EC defined the concept of trustworthy systems. These systems are to be used  internally by the CSP in the operations for the certificate lifecycle management, especially regarding  the CA signing key usage.  To address the security requirements of trustworthy systems, CEN produced the workshop  agreement CWA 14167 Security requirements for trustworthy systems managing certificates for  electronic signatures. CWA 14167 is divided in four parts, the first one addressing systems security  requirements, and the other three parts addressing the security of the cryptographic module used  for CSP key generation services:  1. CWA 14167-1 Part 1: System Security Requirements  2. CWA 14167-2 Part 2: Cryptographic Module for CSP signing operations with backup -  Protection profile (CMCSOB-PP)  3. CWA 14167-3 Part 3: Cryptographic module for CSP key generation services - Protection  profile (CMCKG-PP)  4. CWA 14167-4 Part 4: Cryptographic module for CSP signing operations - Protection profile -  CMCSO PP  The CWA 14167-1 and the CWA 14167-2 have been adopted as harmonized standard Commission  Decision 2003/511/EC of 14 July 2003 on the publication of reference numbers of generally  recognised standards for electronic signature products in accordance with Directive 1999/93/EC.  These standards are in the process of being updated at the time of writing this document.  Page  16  3.5 Standards for secure signature creation devices  Secure signature creation devices are configured software or hardware that is used to implement  the signature process with the signature data. They manage the cryptographic operations performed  with the subject key pair, and as such they must have comprehensive security properties.  The main technical specification for the security aspects of the signature creation devices for  providers of qualified certificates is the CEN workshop agreement CWA 14169 Secure Signature- creation devices [27].  CWA 14169 has been adopted as a harmonized standard Commission Decision 2003/511/EC of 14  July 2003 on the publication of reference numbers of generally recognised standards for electronic  signature products in accordance with Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament.  Other standards have been created to support the CWA 14169. The CEN workshop agreement, CWA  14170 Security requirements for signature creation applications [29] specifies security requirements  and recommendations for signature creation applications that generate advanced electronic  signatures by means of a hardware signature creation device.  Additionally, to facilitate the implementation of secure signature creation devices in different  platforms, the CEN workshop agreement CWA 14355 Guidelines for the implementation of Secure  Signature-Creation Devices [28] gives guidance on the implementation of secure signature creation  devices Protection Profiles (SSCD PPs) for specific platforms (e.g. smart cards, personal data  assistants, mobile phones, or PCs), and the operation in specific environments (e.g. public terminals  or secured environments).  In the case the secure signature creation device platform is a smart card, the CWA 14890 Application  Interface for smart cards used as Secure Signature Creation Devices [30] (divided in two parts CWA  14890-1 and 14890-2) specifies the application interface to smart cards used as secure signature  creation devices.  In the case of software based signature creation devices, the CWA 14365-2 Guide on the Use of  Electronic Signatures - Part 2: Protection Profile for Software Signature Creation Devices provides a  Protection Profile (PP), based on the Common Criteria, for signature creation devices suitable for  general electronic signatures, which can be used for providers of non-qualified signatures.  These standards are in the process of being updated at the time of writing this document.  Page  17  4 Certification of electronic signature products  Proof of compliance with standards and technical specifications can be achieved by obtaining a  certificate of compliance. Certification is defined as the process by which a product or process is  awarded a conformity certificate after undergoing a conformity assessment process, usually  conformity against a regulation, a standard or a technical specification.  Providers or products often get certified in order to comply with regulations, although this is not the  sole driving force for certification. Within the European Union, the certification framework for  products follows a general certification scheme set in the Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the  European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation  and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products. Under this scheme, each member  state must designate an Accreditation Body, which itself accredits certification bodies which are  competent to conduct conformity assessments8. The use of accreditation varies among member  states.  In this European product certification framework, conformity assessment is conducted against  harmonised standards. A harmonized standard is a standard adopted on the basis of a request made  by the Commission for the application of Union harmonisation legislation. Products which are in  conformity with harmonised standards which have been published in the Official Journal of the  European Union are to be presumed to be in conformity with the requirements covered by those  standards set out in the corresponding regulations.  4.1 Standards in the area of electronic signatures  Regarding products to be employed in electronic certification services, the Commission issued the  Decision 2003/511/EC on the publication of reference numbers of generally recognised standards for  electronic signature products in accordance with Directive 1999/93/EC, which set the following  standards:  1. Recognised standards for trustworthy systems:  a. CWA 14167-1 (March 2003): security requirements for trustworthy systems  managing certificates for electronic signatures - Part 1: System Security  Requirements  b. CWA 14167-2 (March 2002): security requirements for trustworthy systems  managing certificates for electronic signatures - Part 2: cryptographic module for  CSP signing operations - Protection Profile (MCSO-PP)  2. Recognised standards for secure signature creation products:  a. CWA 14169 (March 2004, update foreseen in December 2013): Secure Signature-  creation devices [27]  Further, from the publication of recognized standards against which manufactures of electronic  signature products may become certified, an additional requirement was introduced for secure  signature creation devices. The Directive established that the conformity of these devices shall be  determined by appropriate public or private bodies designated by member states, and that the  criteria for member states to determine whether a body should be designated should be produced.  The criteria were set by the Commission Decision 2000/709/EC on the minimum criteria to be taken  into account by member states when designating bodies in accordance with Article 3(4) of Directive  1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on a Community framework for  8  This scheme currently does not apply to product certification within the scope of the draft regulation [38].  Another scheme under consideration is the informal SOG-IS MRA, http://www.sogisportal.eu/uk/mra_en.html.  http://www.sogisportal.eu/uk/mra_en.html  Page  18  electronic signatures. The names of these notified bodies able to assess conformity with the  requirements for secure signature creation devices need to be made available to all member states;  and the certifications they issue recognised by all member states.  Currently the Protection Profiles are not adapted to the latest version of Common Criteria. These  standards will be updated for the new proposal.  4.2 Existing certification schemes  Conformity assessment of products performing cryptographic operations has been foreseen by the  European legislation to be assessed within the Common Criteria framework for information  technology security evaluation. The Common Criteria is a multilateral agreement for mutual  recognition of ICT security products certifications, and has been adopted as an international  standard by the ISO/IEC 15408 Series: Information technology, Security techniques, Evaluation  criteria for IT security [9].  In the Common Criteria framework [42], certification candidates choose a Protection Profile for the  evaluation. Different protection profiles exist for different ICT products. The CWA 14167 [26] defines  profiles for cryptographic modules for CSP signing operations, while the CWA 14169 [27] does the  same for secure signature creation devices. Common Criteria evaluations can be conducted in  different levels of depth, denominated Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL), which rank from 1 to 7. In  the case of the CWA 14169, the specified Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL) is EAL 4+.  Aside from the European certification framework, the American certification scheme, the Federal  Information Processing Standards (FIPS) by the National Information Standardization Institute (NIST)  are relatively widely used by European providers. In the case of products for electronic signatures,  the Federal Information Processing Standard NIST FIPS 140-2 [36] on requirements for cryptographic  modules is used to accredit cryptographic modules. Similarly to the EAL level in Common Criteria,  NIST FIPS 140-2 establishes four security levels regarding the deep of security testing that a product  must undergo.  The main reason for the use of FIPS certified products among European trust service providers is the  higher availability of FIPS certified products versus Common Criteria products for some components.  Some European countries accept FIPS certifications for electronic signature products as equivalent to  Common Criteria certified. The ENISA survey shows that 89% of respondents report using at least  some product with a NIST FIPS certification, while 80% of use at least one Common Criteria certified  product.  Page  19  Figure 7: Use of certified signature generation products  4.3 Certification of cryptographic modules for TSP signing operations  Cryptographic modules for TSP signing operations are hardware devices that manage the  cryptographic operations performed with the keys of a Certification Authority. Trust service  providers must ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the key pairs that their CAs use to sign the  certificates they issue. This is a critical component in the chain of trust that a CSP must protect.  This confidentiality and integrity is achieved by the use of devices with strict anti-tampering  properties, widely known as Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). HSMs are employed for the  protection of cryptographic keys, and, although not exclusively meant for public key cryptography,  this is one of their main applications. HSMs are capable of performing cryptographic operations,  such as CA key pair usage for signing user certificates. The keys don’t exit the HSM and are protected  from unauthorized access.  In the European framework, the CEN standard CWA 14167 [26] defines Common Criteria protection  profiles for cryptographic modules for CSP signing operations:  1. CWA 14167-2 Part 2: Cryptographic Module for CSP signing operations with backup -  Protection profile (CMCSOB-PP)  2. CWA 14167-3 Part 3: Cryptographic module for CSP key generation services - Protection  profile (CMCKG-PP)  3. CWA 14167-4 Part 4: Cryptographic module for CSP signing operations - Protection profile -  CMCSO PP  The CWA 14167-2 was adopted as a recognized standard against which certification presumes the  product to be compliant with EU regulations.  Currently the Protection Profiles are not adapted to the new version of Common Criteria. These  standards are in the process of being updated for the new proposal.  Aside from the European framework, NIST FIPS 140-2 [36] certified products are common among  HSMs used by European trust service providers, which can be explained due to the wider availability  of these products on the market. The ENISA survey shows that 87% of respondents report using  products having a NIST FIPS 140-2 certification. Only slightly more than half, 53%, of used products  Page  20  have a CWA 14167-2 Common Criteria certification. However, as the graphic shows, it is becoming  regularly more common for manufacturers to achieve both certifications to adapt both the European  and American markets, and already 40% of the products do hold both.  Figure 8: Use of certified products for CA signing operations  4.4 Certification of secure signature creation devices  The main technical specification for the security aspects of signature creation devices for providers  of qualified certificates is the CEN workshop agreement CWA 14169 Secure Signature-creation  devices 'EAL 4+'. [27]  Conformity assessment against the CWA 14169 is assessed within the framework of the Common  Criteria, with a specified Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) of EAL 4+. EAL4 level stands for  methodically designed, tested, and reviewed, while “+” refers to certain augmentations over the  base level.  Currently the Protection Profiles are not adapted to the new version of Common Criteria. These  standards are in the process of being updated for the new proposal.  Common Criteria certified secure signature creation devices are used by the majority of the  providers, with 76% of the respondents reporting they used subject devices with this certification.  Half of the providers use FIPS certified products. When results are combined, they show around one  third of providers use products with both Common Criteria and FIPS certification. Additionally, a  small minority of providers report using products certified against other certification schemes or  with no certification.  Page  21  Figure 9: Use of certified products for subject signing operations  4.5 Certification of trustworthy systems  Trust service providers primarily have their systems audited, and do not seek certification based on  Common Criteria. The provider or auditor may require that products used by provider are certified.  For software used by trust service providers the Certificate Issuance and Management Components  (CIMC) Protection Profile9 issued by NIST is the most common used protection profile for PKI  software and there are many products on the market compliant with this PP.  9  http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/PP_CIMC_SL1_V1.0.pdf  http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/PP_CIMC_SL1_V1.0.pdf  Page  22  5 Supervision and audit of trust service providers  Supervision plays an important role in independently attesting that organizations in a certain sector  comply with the requirements set either in regulations, standards or best practices for that sector.  Supervision doesn’t include necessarily the conduction of audits; however this is a common practice  to be able to assess security practices.  Supervision is mainly foreseen to control if a certain set of requirements established by a regulatory  framework (usually defining safety or security requirements or protecting customers) is  fulfilled..Independent supervision usually takes place in unregulated sectors where however  providers adhere voluntarily to enhance their customers trust.  In many sectors, like the case of trust service providers, both supervision and audit coexist with  different focuses. The following section introduces the existing schemes and current auditing  practices for certification services.  5.1 Government supervision  5.1.1 Under Directive 1999/93/EC  The Directive 1999/93/EC [37] included some provisions regarding the supervision of trust service  providers. Supervision was foreseen primarily for providers who issue qualified certificates, however  the possibility of introducing voluntary accreditation schemes in member states for non-qualified  trust service providers was also introduced.  Within the qualification scheme, the Directive foresaw for each member state to ensure the  establishment of an appropriate system that allows for supervision of trust service providers which  are established on its territory and issue qualified certificates to the public. Following the entry in  force of Directive, all European member states designated a supervisory body and created a  supervision scheme.  Supervisors were set in charge of overseeing that providers of qualified certificates meet the  requirements established in the Directive. However, due to the lack of details of the Directive  1999/93/EC regarding supervisory functions or supervision schemes, the EU framework left some  gaps. This caused national legislation to differ, applying different requirements for supervision of  providers in each member state, regarding:  1. Enforcement or periodicity of audits, characteristics of the audits.  2. Documentation required for the TSP to be submitted to the supervisor.  3. Compliance with standards and needs for certification (further to those set by the European  legislation).  Another function of the supervisors was to maintain the denominated “Trusted Lists”. The Directive  established that member states have to notify the Commission and other member states regarding  the names and addresses of all accredited national trust service providers. This has been achieved  through the Trusted Lists, lists with standardized formats that contain information regarding all the  providers of qualified, and sometimes non qualified,  certificates in their respective member state  for manual and automatic processing. This list is meant to increase interoperability, so that member  states can accept qualified certificates issued in another member state.  5.1.2 Under the proposed Regulation  The new proposed Regulation [38] clarifies and strengthens the role of supervisory authorities in the  field of trust services. Within the scope of the new Regulation, the supervisory authority must not  Page  23  only supervise qualified trust service providers to ensure they fulfill the specific requirements laid  down in the Regulation, but also monitor that all trust service providers established in their country  fulfill the requirements laid down in Article 15 (security requirements).  Provisions regarding audits are also introduced:  1. Qualified trust services providers must send to the supervisory body an annual security audit  conducted by a recognized independent body. In addition, the supervisory body may  conduct security audits at any time on them, informing data protection authorities in the  case of personal data breaches. In the event of failures to comply detected in the audit  reports, the authority has the power to issue binding instructions to the provider. The  provider may lose its qualification status due to neglect to remedy the detected failures.  2. In the case of non-qualified trust service providers, the proposal foresees that any trust  service provider may submit the report of a security audit carried out by a recognised  independent body to the supervisory body to confirm that appropriate security measures  have been taken.  Although no authorization is needed to establish a trust service in Europe, supervisors must receive  an initial notification by qualified trust service providers intending to enter the market. This initial  notification needs to be accompanied by a security audit that will be reviewed by the supervisory  body to verify that they comply with the requirements set down in the Regulation.  In case of termination of a provider, the supervisory body must ensure that all relevant information  concerning data issued and received by the qualified trust service provider, in particular for the  purpose of providing evidence in legal proceedings, are preserved and kept accessible after the  activities of the provider have ceased, for an appropriate time with a view to guaranteeing  continuity of the service.  Finally, supervisors must produce a yearly report containing information regarding its supervisory  activities, statistics about the trust service market in the country and received breach notifications.  They must as well cooperate with supervisory bodies of other member states, especially regarding  information exchange and support in inspection activities, and continue to maintain the Trusted Lists  of qualified providers.  5.2 Independent auditing schemes  The main technical specifications used as a base for independent audit in the area of trust service  providers policies and practices are the TS 102 042 Policy requirements for certification authorities  issuing public key certificates [16] and the TS 101 456 Policy requirements for certification authorities  issuing qualified certificates [12]. Audits against TS 101 456 is sought mainly by providers of qualified  certificates, while certification against TS 102 042 is sought by all providers. Also audits against the,  more technical, CWA 14167-1  is being sought by CSPs.  However, there is not a clear European wide framework regarding auditing bodies accredited to  perform audits against these standards, and implementations depend on national regulations.  Aside from audit programs carried out against European standards, the program “WebTrust for  Certification Authorities” has a relatively high penetration in European, and non European, CSPs.  Webtrust is a program created by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and  the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) which provides a framework to assess the  adequacy of the controls in CAs that is consistent with international standards. CSPs adhered to the  Webtrust program must undergo audits every 12 months.  Page  24  Apart from these auditing schemes which are specific to certification services, providers may also  seek to undergo audits against general certification schemes such as the ISO/IEC 27000:2009  (Information technology -- Security techniques -- Information security management) systems family  of standards. Conformity assessment against the widely adopted ISO 27000 framework can be  sought for the general security practices used by the provider. ENISA survey shows that 82% report  following the ISO 27000 series.  For CA certificate inclusion in web browsers, audit requirements are determined by each browser  vendor.  5.3 Current practices  ENISA’s survey on security practices of trust service providers shows that, among trust service  providers participating in the survey, most providers are already included in some external auditing  scheme, with 91% reporting undergoing external audits.  Figure 10: Types of audits CSPs undergo  73% report to be subject to audits on the scope of a government audit scheme, and 78% report to  have joined an industry led / independent audit scheme. Finally, more than half of providers are  subject to both.  Page  25  Figure 11: Scope of external audits  Regarding periodicity of audits, 72% of respondents report undergoing an audit at least yearly or  more frequently, while only 7% report frequency periods of more than one year. The new proposal  for a Regulation on trust services sets yearly audits as a provision for qualified trust service  providers.  Figure 12: Frequency of audits  Page  26  6 Cryptographic algorithms in certification services  Certification services rely on public key cryptography as their main component to provide  authenticity and integrity, to some extent also confidentiality. Two types of cryptographic algorithms  are employed in the electronic certification services: public key algorithms and one way hash  functions.  European legislation has not introduced any provisions regarding the cryptographic algorithms and  key sizes to be used in electronic certificates, not even in qualified ones, although some member  states have defined accepted algorithms and key sizes for qualified certifications services in their  country. In general, the choice of algorithms is to be made by the CSP as long as the algorithm is  considered to provide the appropriate level of security for the intended service, otherwise the CSP  could face liability, or not be able to pass an audit.  Several algorithms exist both for public key algorithms and one way hash functions. This study has  focused only on those widely employed by European providers.  However, several standards and technical documents provide guidance to providers regarding  recommended algorithms and key lengths. ETSI produced the technical specification TS 102 176  Algorithms and Parameters for Secure Electronic Signatures [18] specifies a list of hash functions, as  well as a list of signature schemes together with the requirements on their parameters, as well as  the recommended combinations of these schemes with hash functions and padding methods in the  form of \"signature suites\".  There are also recommendations in the NIST 800 series of documents [34], and requirement from  the CA/B Forum [32][33] to consider.  6.1 Current practices  6.1.1 Public key algorithms  Several public key algorithms exist that can be implemented for certification services suites. The  ENISA survey on security practices of trust service providers shows that the most commonly  employed algorithm is RSA, created by RSA laboratories and defined in the document PKCS #1: RSA  Cryptography Standard. All survey respondents report using this standard for at least one of their  CAs.  Employed key sizes range from 1024 to 4096 bits. For Certification Authorities, 67% of participants  report having at least one CA using RSA-4096, 52% RSA-2048 and 4% RSA-1024. Meanwhile, a few  participants use eliptic curves cryptography algorithms (ECC) – 7% use ECC-256 and only 2% ECC- 384.  Page  27  Figure 13: Algorithm and key size use for CA signature  Regarding subject key sizes, ENISA survey results show that 96% of participants report issuing  certificates using RSA-2048, 33% RSA-1024 and 13% RSA-4096.  Figure 14: Algorithm and key size use for subject signatures  When looking more into depth in the RSA algorithm, results show that exactly half of the  respondents only use RSA-4096 and no smaller key sizes. 46% use a minimum of RSA-2048, but there  is a minority of 4% that still employ RSA-1024. While the use of RSA with key sizes of 2048 or 4096  for medium term use is accepted, the use of RSA with a key size of 1024 is not recommended by  most studies [34].  NIST and ETSI recommended the discontinuation of RSA 1024 for key generation as from 2010, to be  used for legacy purposes from 2011 to 2013, and discontinued by 2013. For key verification  purposes, RSA 1024 should be used only for legacy systems since 2010. Similarly, the ECRYPT II  recommendations deemed key sizes of less than 1248 only sufficient for short-term protection  against medium organizations and medium-term protection against small organizations; a key size of  more than 1776 should be used for legacy standard level, and a key size of more than 2436 for  medium term security. The German regulator for electronic signatures established that RSA 1024  should not be used for keys for qualified certificates since 2008, while RSA 2048 is deemed  acceptable until at least 2018.  Page  28  Figure 15: Minimum supported RSA key size  Elliptic curve algorithms are also being used by 9% of survey participants. Use of elliptic curves for  digital signatures is described in the American National Standard X9.62-2005 on the Elliptic Curve  Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).  In elliptic curves, the majority of providers using them issue ECC-256 signatures, and a minority ECC- 384. In the case of ECC, the three mentioned studies report the use of elliptic curves with key sizes  above 256 bits acceptable for current use at least until 2018.  6.1.2 One way hash functions  The ENISA survey on security practices of trust service providers shows the current standard practice  among trust service providers is to use the SHA algorithm, with all respondents employing it. The  SHA algorithm is defined in the NIST guides FIPS 180-1 and NIST FIPS 180-2 RIPEMD, defined in  ISO/IEC 10118-3 [8], is also used by a small minority of survey participants.  Regarding one way hash functions for CA signatures, results that 65% of participants report using  SHA-1, 63% SHA-256 and 2% SHA-512 for the hash function of at least one CA.  Page  29  Figure 16: Hash functions and digest sizes for CAs signatures  In the case of one way hash functions for subjects’ signatures, ENISA’s survey results show that 67%  of participants report using SHA-1, 59% SHA-256, 4% SHA-384 and 7% SHA-512 for at least one type  of certificate.  Figure 17: Hash functions and digest sizes for subjects’ signatures  When looking more into depth in the message digest sizes, results show that only around a third of  the respondents use a SHA-256 for all CAs, while the majority, two thirds, still use SHA-1. In the case  of subject certificates, results show that 71% of the respondents use SHA-1, 27% use SHA-256 and  2% use SHA-512.  NIST recommended the discontinuation of SHA-1 for digital signature generation from 2010, to be  used for legacy purposes from 2011 to 2013, and discontinued by 2013. For digital signature  verification purposes, SHA-1 should be used only for legacy systems since 2010. SHA-256 and SHA- 512 are accepted for all hash function applications. Similarly the ECRYPT II recommends against the  use of SHA-1 in new applications, and to phase out of SHA-1 for signature applications with medium  to high security. The German regulator for electronic signatures established that SHA-1 should not  be used for German qualified signature generation since 2008 and for certificate generation since  Page  30  2010; it can be used for verification of qualified certificates until 2015, while SHA-256, SHA-384 SHA- 512 are deemed acceptable until at least 2019.  Figure 18: Minimum SHA digest size supported  RIPEMD (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest), created by KU Leuven, is reported to  be used by a minority. Only 2% of the participants use RIPEMD with a digest size of 160. The German  regulator for electronic signatures established that RIPEMD-160 should not be used for German  qualified certificate generation since 2010; it can be used for verification of qualified certificates  until 2015.  Page  31  7 Recommendations  7.1 Trust service providers in the EU regulatory framework  Regarding the legal framework of trust service providers in the EU regulatory framework it is worth  noting that local variations exist. It is therefore recommended to verify with local authorities  regarding local policy and regulations in the area, and also investigate variations in other member  states where the TSP is intended to operate.  It is also recommended to consider the scope and usage of the TSP services, since requirements may  differ depending on the scope and usage of the services offered by a TSP.  For TSPs located outside of Europe it is important to investigate regulations for the services intended  to be offered within the scope of the EU regulation.  7.2 Standardization in the area of trust services  Regarding standards in the area of trust services it is recommended comply with standards like ETSI  TS 101 456 [12], ETSI TS 102 042 [16], RFC 3647 [23], CWA 14167 [26] (explanation in section 3) in  the area where the TSP operates.  It is important that before implementing any standards to check for updated version of the  standards. The standards mentioned in this report may be updated at any time.  7.3 Certification of electronic signature products  Different standards for certification of products have different, and sometimes low, penetration in  the market.  It is recommended that TSPs use certified products (Common Criteria [42] or FIPS 140-2 [36], as  explained in section 4), where possible and practical, and pay attention to supervision and auditing  within the area and member state there the TSP operates.  7.4 Supervision and audit of trust service providers  In general TSPs can choose which auditing scheme to follow and should choose an appropriate  auditing scheme depending on the intended scope and usage.  TSPs should consider auditing against ETSI, WebTrust, or equivalent auditing schemes. It is important  to investigate the requirements for the specific services the TSP intends to offer. For example if the  TSP aims to seek inclusion of CA certificates in web browsers, different browsers may have different  requirements.  7.5 Cryptographic algorithms in certification services  Several organisations publish recommendations regarding cryptographic algorithms, the most  notable being referenced by this document.  TSPs should investigate the latest recommendations, and keep themselves up to date, regarding the  choice of algorithms for CAs and subjects. The recommendations may differ slightly depending on  the intended scope, usage and member state.  In order to maintain maximum interoperability TSPs should consider using appropriate algorithms  and key sizes (ECRYPT [45] and similar studies can be a good guide).

Electronic seal: Data in electronic form which are attached to or logically associated with other  electronic data to ensure the origin and the integrity of the associated data; (Proposal eSignatures)  Electronic Signature: Data in electronic form which is attached to or logically associated to other  electronic data and serves as a method of authentication.  From a legal perspective, an electronic signature is not necessarily considered equivalent to a  handwritten signature. When it meets a number of conditions, it can be put on par with a  handwritten one.  Event: Occurrence of a particular set of circumstances  Page  33  Evidence: Information that either by itself or when used in conjunction with other information is  used to establish proof about an event or action. Evidence does not necessarily prove truth or  existence of something but contributes to establish proof.  Hash Function: A mathematical function which maps values from a large (possibly very large)  domain into a smaller range. A \"good\" hash function is such that the results of applying the function  to a set of values in the domain will be evenly distributed and apparently at random over the range.

assessment phases defined in [2]are followed:   Risk identification: Identifying the different factors (assets, threats, vulnerabilities,  consequences and incident scenarios) that will identify and evaluate the risks:  o System scope delimitation: Determining the scope included in the risk assessment  and its boundaries  o Asset identification: Identifying any type of item that has value to the organization  and that could cause damage if it is involved in an incident.  o Threat analysis: identifying all agents, either natural or human made, accidental or  intentional, internal or external, that could pose a threat to the organization.  o Vulnerability analysis: Identifying all potential weakness in the organization that  could facilitate a successful attack and cause damage to the assets.  o Consequence determination: Identifying the possible consequences that different  events could have on the organization.  o Incident scenario identification: Determining the possible events that could have an  impact on the organization and that will serve as a base to identify the risks.   Risk analysis: Determining the risk level based on the impact of each incident scenario and  their probability of occurrence.   Risk evaluation: Producing a scored list of all the identified risks, based on the risk analysis  results; the business criteria; the affected assets and their vulnerabilities and the potential  threats.

Security framework  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 1  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  iv  Executive summary  E-Government services have significant potential to make public services more efficient for the  benefit of citizens and businesses in terms of time and money. And while these benefits are  increasingly being felt nationally, e-Government services still face administrative and legal barriers  on a cross-border level, although pan-European projects like STORK2 have shown that technical  issues of interoperability of electronic identifications can be overcome. In order to remove existing  barriers for cross-border e-ID based services the Commission has proposed in June 2012 a draft  regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market [38], which will replace the existing Electronic Signature Directive 1999/93/EC [37]. The main  goals of this action are to:   ensure mutual recognition and acceptance of electronic identification across borders   give legal effect and mutual recognition to trust services   enhance current rules on e-signatures   provide a legal framework for electronic seals, time stamping, electronic document  acceptability, electronic delivery and website authentication.   ensure minimal security level of trust services providers systems   enforce obligation of notifications about security incidents at trust services providers  In Article 15 of the above mentioned draft regulation the Commission proposes that trust services  providers have to demonstrate due diligence, in relation to the identification of risks and adoption of  appropriate security practices, and notify competent bodies of any breach of security or loss of  integrity that has a significant impact on the trust service provided and on the personal data  maintained therein.  In this context, the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) developed  in 2013 the Guidelines for trust services providers, discussing the minimal security levels to be  maintained by the trust services providers. The study is split into three parts:  Security framework: describing the framework surrounding trust service providers (TPSs), focusing  on EU standards, but taking into account others where relevant.  Risk assessment: discussing the principles and concepts of managing the risks applicaple to TSPs by  defining and controlling threats and vulnerabilities.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents: recommending measures to mitigate the impact of  security incidents on trust service providers (TSP) by proposing suitable technical and organisational  means to handle the security risks posed to the TSP.  All three parts can also be used separately, as they address different issues and target different  audience, so the introductory sections overlap.  This document, Part 1: Security framework, describes the framework surrounding trust service  providers (TPSs) – the concepts and standards related to operations of a TSP. It focuses on EU  standards, but also takes into account others where relevant.  The document specifically outlines security requirements for qualified3 and non-qualified trust  service providers. It references the most important standards and standardization bodies involved in  technical specification, as well as certification, auditing and supervision schemes that can be used in  order to qualify as a notified trust service provider.  2  https://www.eid-stork.eu/  3 which meets the requirements laid down in Annex I of the Directive 1999/93/EC [37]  https://www.eid-stork.eu/  Security framework  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 1  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  v  The document also presents result of a survey4 conducted by ENISA amongst European trust service  providers related to the different aspects.  Finally, the document gives some summary recommendations for TSPs considering standards and  auditing schemes, grouped in the following areas:   Trust service providers in the EU regulatory framework   Standardization in the area of trust services   Certification of electronic signature products   Supervision and audit of trust service providers   Cryptographic algorithms in certification services  4  For the in-depth description of the study, please refer to the document “TSP services, standards and risk  analysis report”, ENISA 2013.

The  scope of such services includes, but is not limited to, electronic signatures and seals, electronic time  stamps, and electronic authentication. Usually, these services rely on electronic certificates issued by  certificate service providers (CSP) which is a type of TSP. For the sake of simplicity, we use the CSP as  a running example for a TSP within the document at hand. All recommendations apply analogously  to other types of TSP as well.  An electronic certificate (or certificate for short) is an electronic document that binds certain pieces  of data together and is signed by a trusted third party that vows for the binding. For example, an  attribute certificate binds an identity, such as a person, a service, or a device, to certain attributes,  such as profession or access rights. Another example is a public key certificate that binds an identity  to a public key. This certificate can then be used, amongst others, to verify the identity or signature  of the certificate holder. In order to keep things understandable, we use public key certificates as  running example throughout this document. All recommendations apply analogously to other types  of certificates as well.  Electronic certificates rely on public key cryptography. In public key cryptography, two separate  keys, mathematically linked, are provided to an entity. One of the keys is public and can be  disseminated, while the other key is private and needs to be under the sole custody of the key pair  owner. The private key cannot be derived by sole knowledge of the public key, but one key  completes the other in terms of cryptographic operations. For example, a cipher text created using  the public key can be decrypted using the private key; equally, the public key can be used to verify  signatures that were created by the private key. Because of this property of public key cryptography,  and by ensuring the secrecy of the private key and the authenticity of the public key, a relying party  can verify that an entity presenting a certificate is who it claims to be or that a signature is valid.  However, a third party is needed to ensure that the information contained in the certificate,  including the public key, is actually linked to the real identity of the entity. This is done by a TSP,  which uses its so-called certificate authority (CA) signing keys to sign the entities’ certificates. With  this operation the TSP attests that the certificate was issued to the entity whose information is  contained in it. Hence, we distinguish between two different types of certificates:   Subject certificates, also called end entity certificates, that are used for day to day tasks such  as authentication, signatures, or encryption. The holder of such a certificate is called the  subject.   CA signing certificates that are used to sign other certificates. Apart from signing subject  certificates, CA certificates are often also used to sign other CA certificates to establish a  trust relationship between CAs.  Electronic certificates can be used for a variety of purposes, some of the most common being to  support electronic signatures, electronic seals or website authentication. Electronic signatures or  seals are meant for natural persons (signatures) or legal entities (seals) to be able to produce digital  signatures on documents or messages in order to ensure:   The integrity of the document or message: attest that the document or message has not  been altered.   The authenticity and non-repudiation: attest that the document or message was produced  by the certificate owner.  Page  2  In the context of authentication, when an entity A presents itself to another entity B with its  electronic certificate, entity B can verify that the entity A is actually who it claims to be by checking  that entity A is in possession of the private key associated with the public key included in the  certificate.  In the case of encryption, electronic certificates can also be used to provide confidentiality. The use  of public key cryptography for the exchange of  session keys ensures the confidentiality of the  communication. Here, the session key is the entity that carries out the encryption of the messages.  The service of Certificate Service Providers can be broken down into the following component  services   Registration service: verifies the identity and, if applicable, any specific attributes of a  subject. The results of this service are passed to the certificate generation service.   Certificate generation service: creates and signs certificates based on the identity and other  attributes verified by the registration service.   Dissemination service: disseminates certificates to subjects, and if the subject consents,  makes them available to relying parties. This service also makes available the CA's terms and  conditions, and any published policy and practice information, to subscribers and relying  parties.   Revocation management service: processes requests and reports relating to revocation to  determine the necessary action to be taken. The results of this service are distributed  through the revocation status service.   Revocation status service: provides certificate revocation status information to relying  parties. This may be based upon certificate revocation lists or a real time service which  provides status information on an individual basis. The status information may be updated  on a regular basis and hence may not reflect the current status of the certificate.  and optionally:   Subject device provision service: prepares and provides a signature-creation device to  subjects.  Page  3  2 Trust service providers in the EU regulatory framework  2.1 The concept of certification services in the legal framework  The main legal text addressing the area of electronic certification services in the EU is the Directive  1999/93/EC on a Community framework for electronic signatures [37]. The objective of this Directive  is to facilitate the use of electronic signatures and to contribute to their legal recognition.  The Directive defines a ‘certification service provider’ as an entity or a legal or natural person who  issues certificates or provides other services related to electronic signatures, while ‘certificate’ is  defined as an electronic attestation which links signature-verification data to a person and confirms  the identity of that person. This definition stresses the fact that the scope of the current regulatory  framework is limited to certificates for electronic signatures. Providers of other types of certificates,  or complementary services related to electronic certificates but not oriented to electronic  signatures, are not regulated by the provisions set by the Directive.  This limitation in scope is about to change, as the current Directive is expected to be superseded by  a new Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the  internal market [38], which was presented as a proposal in July 2012. The proposal introduces some  important changes in the reach of the services covered. It extends the concept of certification  services further from electronic signatures to any type of electronic certificates.  In June and July 2013 ENISA conducted a survey among trust services providers, in which 46  participants took part. Its goal was to identify security practices in force at these organisations5. The  results show that a majority of the EU providers participating in the survey already issue these other  types of certificates. While 95% of the respondents report issuing certificates for individuals, making  it the most common type of service, 80% of participants also report issuing certificates for web site  authentication. Certificates for legal entities are also issued by 80% of the respondents.  Additionally, 33% of respondents reported issuing other types of certificates. Among the most cited  types were:   Code signing certificates, used to verify the integrity and authenticity of software programs;   Server certificates, used for automated signing operations by computer servers;   Device certificates, used for the authentication of devices;   Issuing CA certificates, used for generating intermediate CAs (CAs which issue certificates to  end users) from a root CA;  5  For the in-depth description of the study, please refer to the document “TSP services, standards and risk  analysis report”, ENISA 2013. The participants are mentioned in the acknowledgements at the beginning of  this document.  Page  4  Figure 1: Types of provided electronic certificates  2.2 The concept of trust services in the legal framework  In order to achieve a common nomenclature for all services related to electronic certificates  issuance and added services, the proposal introduces the new concept of trust services, which are  defined as any electronic service consisting in the creation, verification, validation, handling and  preservation of electronic signatures, electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic documents,  electronic delivery services, website authentication, and electronic certificates, including certificates  for electronic signature and for electronic seals.  In the new framework, certification services providers become a type of trust service providers.  ENISA’s survey on security practices of trust service providers shows that a majority of the EU  providers participating in the survey, 85%, already provide other services, such as time stamps or  long term signature preservation, in addition to pure certification services.  Trust service providers can be located both within the EU and outside of EU. How some of the EU  specific terms are to be interpreted for non EU located TSPs is not defined.  Figure 2: Types of trust services provided  Page  5  2.3 The qualification scheme  The Directive 1999/93/EC [37] introduced the concept of qualification of electronic signatures. The  main objective of the qualification scheme is to establish a certain set of requirements for an  electronic signature that, when conforming to it, would make the signature “satisfy the legal  requirements of a signature in relation to data in electronic form in the same manner as a  handwritten signature satisfies those requirements in relation to paper-based” and “admissible as  evidence in legal proceedings”.  It shall be noted, however, that the fact that an electronic signature isg non-qualified does not  invalidate the electronic signature. The difference lies in the fact that an electronic signature under  the qualification scheme will have a presumption of legal validity, while, for others, the univocal link  between the signatory and the signature, and the integrity of the signature, may have to be  demonstrated. The exact legal consequences however differ between member states because the  Directive had to be transposed to every member states national legislation.  The introduction of the qualification concept in the European legislation gave a legal foundation to  electronic signatures. This stimulated the European market of electronic certificates, where trust  service providers started to issue qualified certificates that could be used by EU citizens, especially in  their relationships with public administrations. As a result, many European providers issue qualified  certificates for electronic signatures nowadays, although there are large differences between  member states. ENISA’s survey on security practices of trust service providers shows that a majority  of the EU providers participating in the survey, 93%, issue qualified certificates.  However, the restriction of the scope of the qualification scheme to electronic signatures, combined  with the practice of most European providers of issuing several types of certificates, has prompted  as the most common practice to issue both qualified and non-qualified certificates, with 80% of the  respondents following this practice. Only 13% issue exclusively qualified certificates, while another  7% issue exclusively non-qualified certificates. These later group is mainly composed of providers  focused on web authentication certificates used for TLS/SSL connections in internet.  Figure 3: Provision of qualified certificates  Page  6  This double schema may have come as a burden for providers, which may be subject to government  supervision to issue qualified certificates, but that can apply this qualification only for electronic  signature certificates. They must follow a set of restrictive requirements for qualified certificates and  may not be able to leverage this supervision for other trust services they may provide in the same  conditions and subject to the same security requirements.  This issue has been addressed by the new proposal for a Regulation, which, in the same way it  extends the scope of the certification services, extends the possibility of qualification to other types  of certificates. Specifically three types are contemplated:   Qualified certificate for electronic signature.   Qualified certificate for electronic seal.   Qualified certificate for website authentication.  In the new framework, a qualified electronic signature, aimed at natural persons, “shall have the  legal effect of a handwritten signature”. This definition is very similar to that existing in the current  Directive. A qualified electronic seal, aimed at legal entities, “shall enjoy the legal presumption of  ensuring the origin and integrity of the data to which it is linked”. Qualified website authentication  certificates, aimed at web domains, are meant to “be an attestation which makes it possible to  authenticate a website and links the website to the entity to whom the certificate is issued”.  Aside from introducing new types of qualified certificates, the proposal also foresees the existence  of other qualified trust services, which are derived from the use of electronic certificates: electronic  time stamps, qualified electronic delivery services, qualified validation service for qualified electronic  signatures and qualified electronic signature preservation services. The ENISA study focuses in more  detail on the security aspects of these new types of trust services that are foreseen in the new  Proposal.  2.4 Security requirements for trust service providers  Directive 1999/93/EC didn’t introduce any general security requirements applicable to all providers,  regardless of the type of certificates they issue, requirements were only set for providers of qualified  certificates for electronic signatures. However, the maturity of the market has proved that electronic  certificates, whether they are used for binding signatures with legal presumption, or for securing  private electronic communications and transactions in the  Internet, need to be provided and  maintained within a secure environment to protect the sensitive operations they are employed for.  In this context, the new proposal for a Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for  electronic transactions in the internal market has introduced a specific provision addressing the  security of trust services, which are applicable to all providers. These provisions are compiled in  Article 15. Article 15 establishes that all providers must:   Take appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the  security of the trust services they provide.   Introduce measures to ensure that the level of security is appropriate to the degree of risk.   Take measures to prevent and minimise the impact of security incidents and inform  stakeholders of adverse effects of any incidents.  All providers are required in the new framework to conduct a risk assessment exercise on their  services, to implement the appropriate security measures to minimize the possibility of incidents  taking place, and to have in place the adequate measures to respond and manage possible incidents.  Page  7  As ENISA’s survey on security practices of trust service providers shows, a majority of the EU  providers participating in the survey already apply measures for these purposes. 96% of respondents  report having an approved information security policy. Conducting a formal risk assessment is not so  systematic yet, however 72% report having a business risk assessment document. Regarding the  management of incidents and continuity of operations, 83% declare having an incident response  plan and 80% a business continuity plan.  Figure 4: Security documents  Besides those security requirements, Article 15 also foresees that trust service providers must,  without undue delay and where feasible not later than 24 hours after having become aware of it,  notify the competent supervisory body, the competent national body for information security and  other relevant third parties such as data protection authorities of any breach of security or loss of  integrity that has a significant impact on the trust service provided and on the personal data  maintained therein.  The topic of breach notifications in trust service providers has been approached in more detail in the  ENISA report “Implementation of Art 15: Security breaches notifications in trust services”6.  2.5 Specific requirements for qualified certification services  Requirements for the different components of a qualified certification service were extensively  found in different sections of the Directive 1999/93/EC. These requirements concern both  technological measures to guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of the signature creation data,  as well as contractual and legal issues for the provider.  All the requirements for the components of a certification service derive from the requisite set for  an electronic signature to be considered qualified. A qualified electronic signature must be:   An advanced electronic signature   Created with a secure signature creation device  6  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/implementation-of-article-15  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/implementation-of-article-15  Page  8   Based on a qualified certificate issued by a trust service provider.  In the new Proposal, requirements for qualified electronic signatures or seals are analogous to the  ones present in the current Directive. For a web authentication certificate to be qualified it must be  issued by a qualified trust service provider and based on qualified certificates for website  authentication.  The following sections describe in detail what are the requirements set in the current and proposed  framework for a provider to be accredited as qualified, as well as for the certification components to  fulfill the provisions set for them.  2.5.1 Requirements on the trust service provider  Qualified certificates can only be provided by qualified certificate providers. Therefore the first stage  for a trust service provider to issue qualified certificates is to become a qualified trust service  provider. The requirements for qualified trust service providers are laid down in the Article 19 of the  new Proposal, and concern the following aspects:  Reliability in the service: Qualified trust service providers must demonstrate reliability for providing  the service. They must implement adequate policies and procedures which are in line with current  standards, and employ qualified and trained personnel with sufficient knowledge on the area of  electronic signatures and security procedures.  Proper establishment of contractual relationships: Qualified trust service providers must inform  individuals, before entering a contractual relationship with them, of the terms and conditions  applicable to the service. This information should include the use of the certificate, including any  limitations, the existence of a voluntary accreditation scheme and procedures for complaints and  dispute settlement.  Subject registration: Qualified trust service providers must verify, in accordance with national law,  the identity of the subject to whom the certificate is issued. Directive 1999/93/EC didn’t specify how  this verification of identity needs to be done, for example, if registration through electronic means is  possible. The new Proposal clarifies how the registration can be conducted:  1. By physical presence of the subject.  2. Remotely, using an identification means under a notified scheme that was issued through  physical presence.  The possibility of identifying the subject electronically, by means, for example, of the use of a  national electronic identity card is opened.  Use of trustworthy systems: Qualified trust service providers are required to use trustworthy  systems which are protected against modification and ensure the technical and cryptographic  security of the process supported by them. The Directive establishes that trustworthy systems that  store certificates must meet these requirements:   Only authorised persons can make entries and changes.   Information can be checked for authenticity.   Any technical changes compromising these security requirements are apparent to the  operator.   Certificates are publicly available for retrieval in only those cases for which the certificate  holder's consent has been obtained, and depending on member states' data protection laws.  The requirements for trustworthy systems set in Article 19 are similar to those established in the  Directive 1999/93/EC, with two variations. The first is that the new framework only foresees that  Page  9  trustworthy systems need to ensure the reliability, not the cryptographic security, of the processes  supported by them. This acknowledges the fact that the possible vulnerabilities that may appear in  algorithms considered secure until a certain moment are outside the control of the provider. The  second change is that in the new framework the requirements set for the systems storing  certificates are extended to all systems storing the information provided to the CSP.  Liability: Qualified trust service providers are required to maintain financial resources to operate  under the obligations laid down in the regulations and to be able to bear the risk of liability when  failure to comply results in damages for a certificate subject.  Accountability: Qualified trust service providers must keep records and logs of all relevant events  concerning the certificate life cycle, and record all relevant information concerning a qualified  certificate for an appropriate period of time, in particular for the purpose of providing evidence of  certification for the purposes of legal proceedings.  Confidentiality and integrity: Qualified trust service providers must take measures against forgery of  certificates to ensure their integrity. The current framework establishes that they must not store a  copy of the signatory signature creation data of the certificate subjects.  In the cases where the  provider generates the signature creation data for the subject, it must ensure the confidentiality of  this data when delivering them to the individual. The provider should not be in possession of the  subject’s private key, which must be under the sole custody of the certificate holder.  However this provision is not included in the new framework, as the possibility of providers to store  the signature creation data (for primary or back up purposes) on behalf of the certificate subject is  opened, as long it is done with the appropriate level of security.  Revocation status information: Qualified trust service providers must ensure the operation of a  secure and prompt security directory and an immediate revocation service, as well as the precision  and availability of the certificate issuing and revocation times.  ETSI [11] defines a time limit for providers issuing qualified certificates to process the revocation of  the certificate within 24 hours. ENISA’s survey on security practices of trust service providers shows  that, among EU trust service providers participating in the survey, 40% report that 5 minutes is the  maximum latency they guarantee for including the revocation of a certificate in the certificate  database after such revocation has taken effect, however 23% report one day latency, with the rest  providing intermediate latencies. The responses however do not differ between technically updating  the revocation database and the complete process of revocation, so answers may not be  comparable.  Termination: Providers need to have in place an up-to-date termination plan to ensure continuity of  service in accordance with arrangements issued by the supervisory body. ENISA’s survey on security  practices of trust service providers shows that, among trust service providers participating in the  survey shows that 75% of providers already have an approved CA Termination Plan.  2.5.2 Requirements for the components of the certification service  Qualified certificate profiles  A requirement set by the Directive 1999/93/EC [37] for an electronic signature to be considered  qualified is that such a signature be based on a qualified certificate. A qualified certificate is an  electronic certificate issued by a certificate provider that contains a minimum set of information  which is described in the Annex I of the Directive. These data include:   Indication that the certificate is issued as a Qualified Certificate   Identification of the provider and the state where it is established  Page  10   Name or pseudonym of the signatory, and if applicable, specific attributes used in the  certificate   Identity code and validity period of the certificate   Signature verification data   Advanced electronic signature of the trust service provider issuing the certificate   Limitations on the scope and value of transactions to be performed by the certificate, if  applicable  In the new Proposal, requirements for a qualified certificate are similar to those set in the Directive  1999/93/EC, with the introduction of some additional compulsory information, which are meant to  facilitate the verification of the status of the certificate and the provider:  1. Indication of the location where the advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic  seal of the issuing qualified trust service provider is available.  2. Indication of the location of the certificate validity status services that can be used to  enquire about the validity status of the qualified certificate.  3. If the electronic signature creation data are located in a qualified electronic signature  creation device, an indication of this.  Additionally, the new framework also defines qualified certificates requirements for electronic seals  in its Annex III, which are analogous to those for certificates for electronic signatures; with some  adaptions for electronic seal certificates being conceived for legal entities.  The requirements for certificates for website authentication are similar to those for qualified  certificates for electronic signatures and seals, with some differences, for example the certificate  must include the domain name operated by the legal entity to whom the certificate is issued. Also,  due to their nature, there is no provision for information regarding electronic signature validation  data or signature creation device.  Advanced electronic signature  The Directive 1999/93/EC determines that qualified electronic signatures are advanced electronic  signatures created with a secure signature creation device. Within the current Directive, an  advanced electronic signature is an electronic signature which fulfils these requirements:   Is uniquely linked to the signatory   Capable of identifying him/her   Created using means that the signatory can maintain under his/her sole control   Linked to the data to which it relates in such a manner that any subsequent change of the  data is detectable  The requirements set in the Proposal for an electronic signature to be considered advanced are  similar to those set in the previous the Directive 1999/93/EC. The only variation related to it is that  while in the current Directive the signature needs to be created using electronic signature creation  data that the signatory can maintain under his/her sole control, in the new Regulation the  requirement specifies can maintain under his/her sole control “with a high level of confidence”,  acknowledging the fact that there may some vulnerabilities that are outside the control of the  certificate subject or the provider.  Secure signature creation device  The other requirement set by Directive 1999/93/EC for an electronic signature to be considered  qualified is to be created in a secure signature creation device. Secure signature creation devices are  configured software or hardware that is used to implement the signature process with the signature  Page  11  data. They must ensure that the signature has been produced with the subject private key and  implement measures to guarantee its confidentiality.  The conditions for a signature creation device to be considered secure are set in the annex III of the  Directive 1999/93/EC:   Ensure that the signature-creation-data used for signature generation can practically occur  only once, and that their secrecy is reasonably assured.   Ensure that the signature-creation-data used for signature generation cannot, with  reasonable assurance, be derived and the signature is protected against forgery using  currently available technology.   Ensure that the signature-creation-data used for signature generation can be reliably  protected by the legitimate signatory against the use of others.   Not alter the data to be signed or prevent such data from being presented to the signatory  prior to the signature process.  In the new proposal, the requirements for signature creation devices to be qualified are similar to  those established in the Directive 1999/93/EC for secure signature creation devices, with some  variations which concern mainly the handling of the signature creation data, including the key pair,  by the provider in behalf of the certificate subject. This possibility, which was not foreseen by the  Directive, is opened both for the managing of the keys themselves, as for back up purposes:  1. Generation or managing of the signature creation data by the provider can be done by  qualified trust service providers.  2. The provider may keep a backup copy of the signature creation data on behalf of the  signatory, provided that the duplicated data sets are subject to the same level of security  and that they are the minimum necessary to ensure the continuity of the service.  As noted before there are no provisions for secure signature devices for website authentication  certificates.  Page  12  3 Standardisation in the area of trust services  Standards are specifications, adopted or created by a standardisation organization or user group, for  repeated or continuous application, with which compliance is not compulsory. The field of trust  services has produced several standards and technical specifications. One reason for the existence of  a large set of standards and technical specifications in the field of trust services is a high need for  interoperability and assurance, as trust services are meant to add security in the exchange of  information between different organizations and individuals.  Regulations in the area of trust services have also provided a high level of detail in terms of security  requirements of the services, especially due to the qualification scheme, and several of the  standards that have been created are oriented to offer guidance regarding compliance with the  regulations. But even for providers outside the compliance scope, standards have helped them to  obtain guidance in order to ensure the service is delivered with the appropriate level of assurance in  an international context.  Standards are always evolving, and the standards referenced in this chapter may be superseded by  updated standards from time to time.  The European Interoperability Framework (EIF) [51] is a set of recommendations which specify how  Administrations, Businesses and Citizens communicate with each other within the EU and across  member states borders. The goal is to provide a framework to enable interoperability and reuse  leading to improved public service delivery and lower cost.  The EIF recommends some basic principles regarding use of standards, such as that the use of ICT  should create equal opportunities for all citizens and businesses through inclusive services that are  publicly accessible without discrimination. Bearing this in mind it is important for TSPs operating  under the Directive, and the new proposal, to have a good understanding on standards relevant for  the field.  3.1 Organizations involved in the development of standards for certification  services  Several bodies have been involved in the creation of standards for certification services. One of the  first to develop the area of certification services was the International Telecommunication Union  (ITU) with the X.509 framework, which has been universally adopted as the standard for public key  infrastructures. Subsequently, several organizations, both at the international and European level,  have undertaken the task of developing standards in this area:   The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has produced several  standards to support the implementation of the European legislation in the area of trust  services, as well as to promote the adoption of international and industry standards in  Europe. Within ETSI, the ESI technical committee is in charge of producing technical  specifications in the area of trust services.   The European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has produced a series of technical  recommendations in the form of CEN Workshop Agreements (CWAs) in the area of products  for electronic signatures, some of which have become harmonized European standards.   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is an independent organization that produces  technical specifications, denominated Requests for Comments (RFCs), that have been widely  adopted as industry standards in several IT technology fields. In the area of certification  services IETF has produced several specifications that are widely employed and that have  been adapted by European standardization bodies to be used in European market.  Page  13  The ENISA survey on security practices of trust service providers shows that a majority of the EU  providers participating in the study are following standards from these three organizations. The  figure below shows that ETSI standards are, with 89% of responses, the most employed, probably  because they provide guidance for providers of qualified certificates, which most European trust  service providers issue. Nevertheless, IETF standards are also widely used, by 84% of the providers,  due to these standards being the most followed in the field internationally. Finally 80,4% of  respondents either employ a CEN standard, or more commonly, use products certified against a CEN  Workshop Agreement, as CEN standards are more focused on products.  Figure 5: Use of certification services related standards  3.2 Standards for certificate profiles  Certificate profiles define the formats and fields that certificates must contain in order to be  interoperable and readable by all participating parties. The basis for defining the complete  framework on public key infrastructures, including the formats for electronic certificates is the ITU-T  Recommendation X.509: Information technology - Open Systems Interconnection - The Directory:  Public-key and attribute certificate frameworks. This recommendation, adopted as an international  standard by ISO/IEC 9594-8:2008 [5], has been widely accepted as a standard for formats for public  key certificates, among others components of a public key infrastructure.  Based on the X.509 framework, the most widely employed standard for the definition of an  electronic certificate profile is the IETF technical specification RFC 5280 Internet X.509 Public Key  Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile [22]. RFC 5280 profiles the  X.509 v3 certificate and X.509 v2 certificate revocation list for use in the Internet.  For qualified certificates, the ETSI European Norm EN 319 412-5  Qualified Certificate profil  defines, based on the technical specifications of the IETF, the format of qualified certificates  complying with the Directive 1999/93/EC.  Another ETSI technical specification, TS 119 412-2 X.509 V.3 Certificate Profile for Certificates Issued  to Natural Persons defines a common profile dependant on the IETF standards for  Page  14  implementation of X.509 V.3 and the ETSI standard TS 101 862 (EN 319 412-5) , to allow  actual interoperability of certificates.  The CA and Browser Forum (CA/B Forum) is an organization of public Certificate Authorities and  browser vendors. The CA/B Forum establishes guidelines and requirements for web server  certificates on the Internet. If the CSP issues certificates for web servers the CA/B Forum  requirements7 define many properties for web server certificates.  3.3 Standards for Certification Practice Statements  In order to document and make available to its customers all the policies and procedures that a trust  service provider follows, two standardized document formats have been created: the Certificate  Policy and the Certification Practice Statement. These documents provide to users essential  information regarding aspects such as contractual issues and the security practices of the provider.  These two standards are widely used to obtain guidelines in the elaboration of these documents for  any trust service provider, issuing qualified or not qualified certificates:  At the international level, The IETF technical specification RFC 3647 Internet X.509 Public Key  Infrastructure Certificate Policy and Certification Practices Framework [23] provides a framework to  assist the writers and users of certificate policies or certification practice statements in drafting and  understanding these documents.  At a European level, the ETSI standard TS 102 042 Policy requirements for certification authorities  issuing public key certificate [16] defines policy requirements on the operation and management  practices of certification services providers such that users and relying parties may have confidence  in the applicability of the certificate in support of cryptographic mechanisms.  Regarding providers of qualified certificates, the most widely used standard is the ETSI standard TS  101 456 Policy requirements for certification authorities issuing qualified certificates [12]. TS 101 456  defines policy requirements on the operation and management practices of certification authorities  similar to those of TS 102 042 but meant to comply with the provisions set in the Directive  1999/93/EC. To support the implementation of TS 101 456, ETSI also produced the technical  specification TR 102 437 Guidance on TS 101 456 which provides guidelines on interpreting the TS  101 456 requirements.  All these standards are widely followed by European providers. ENISA’s survey on security practices  of trust service providers shows that among trust service providers participating in the survey, 84,8%  of respondents reported following RFC 3647, 80,4% ETSI 101 456 and 54,3% ETSI TS 102 042.  7  https://www.cabforum.org/  https://www.cabforum.org/  Page  15  Figure 6: Use of standards for certification policies and practices  When results are combined, results show that 98,8% followed at least one of the three standards  (RFC 3647, ETSI TS 101 456 or ETSI TS 102 042), with 45,7% of the survey participants reporting  following the three of them.  The ETSI Policy Requirement standards are currently in the process of being updated.  3.4 Standards for trustworthy systems  The Directive 1999/93/EC defined the concept of trustworthy systems. These systems are to be used  internally by the CSP in the operations for the certificate lifecycle management, especially regarding  the CA signing key usage.  To address the security requirements of trustworthy systems, CEN produced the workshop  agreement CWA 14167 Security requirements for trustworthy systems managing certificates for  electronic signatures. CWA 14167 is divided in four parts, the first one addressing systems security  requirements, and the other three parts addressing the security of the cryptographic module used  for CSP key generation services:  1. CWA 14167-1 Part 1: System Security Requirements  2. CWA 14167-2 Part 2: Cryptographic Module for CSP signing operations with backup -  Protection profile (CMCSOB-PP)  3. CWA 14167-3 Part 3: Cryptographic module for CSP key generation services - Protection  profile (CMCKG-PP)  4. CWA 14167-4 Part 4: Cryptographic module for CSP signing operations - Protection profile -  CMCSO PP  The CWA 14167-1 and the CWA 14167-2 have been adopted as harmonized standard Commission  Decision 2003/511/EC of 14 July 2003 on the publication of reference numbers of generally  recognised standards for electronic signature products in accordance with Directive 1999/93/EC.  These standards are in the process of being updated at the time of writing this document.  Page  16  3.5 Standards for secure signature creation devices  Secure signature creation devices are configured software or hardware that is used to implement  the signature process with the signature data. They manage the cryptographic operations performed  with the subject key pair, and as such they must have comprehensive security properties.  The main technical specification for the security aspects of the signature creation devices for  providers of qualified certificates is the CEN workshop agreement CWA 14169 Secure Signature- creation devices [27].  CWA 14169 has been adopted as a harmonized standard Commission Decision 2003/511/EC of 14  July 2003 on the publication of reference numbers of generally recognised standards for electronic  signature products in accordance with Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament.  Other standards have been created to support the CWA 14169. The CEN workshop agreement, CWA  14170 Security requirements for signature creation applications [29] specifies security requirements  and recommendations for signature creation applications that generate advanced electronic  signatures by means of a hardware signature creation device.  Additionally, to facilitate the implementation of secure signature creation devices in different  platforms, the CEN workshop agreement CWA 14355 Guidelines for the implementation of Secure  Signature-Creation Devices [28] gives guidance on the implementation of secure signature creation  devices Protection Profiles (SSCD PPs) for specific platforms (e.g. smart cards, personal data  assistants, mobile phones, or PCs), and the operation in specific environments (e.g. public terminals  or secured environments).  In the case the secure signature creation device platform is a smart card, the CWA 14890 Application  Interface for smart cards used as Secure Signature Creation Devices [30] (divided in two parts CWA  14890-1 and 14890-2) specifies the application interface to smart cards used as secure signature  creation devices.  In the case of software based signature creation devices, the CWA 14365-2 Guide on the Use of  Electronic Signatures - Part 2: Protection Profile for Software Signature Creation Devices provides a  Protection Profile (PP), based on the Common Criteria, for signature creation devices suitable for  general electronic signatures, which can be used for providers of non-qualified signatures.  These standards are in the process of being updated at the time of writing this document.  Page  17  4 Certification of electronic signature products  Proof of compliance with standards and technical specifications can be achieved by obtaining a  certificate of compliance. Certification is defined as the process by which a product or process is  awarded a conformity certificate after undergoing a conformity assessment process, usually  conformity against a regulation, a standard or a technical specification.  Providers or products often get certified in order to comply with regulations, although this is not the  sole driving force for certification. Within the European Union, the certification framework for  products follows a general certification scheme set in the Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the  European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation  and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products. Under this scheme, each member  state must designate an Accreditation Body, which itself accredits certification bodies which are  competent to conduct conformity assessments8. The use of accreditation varies among member  states.  In this European product certification framework, conformity assessment is conducted against  harmonised standards. A harmonized standard is a standard adopted on the basis of a request made  by the Commission for the application of Union harmonisation legislation. Products which are in  conformity with harmonised standards which have been published in the Official Journal of the  European Union are to be presumed to be in conformity with the requirements covered by those  standards set out in the corresponding regulations.  4.1 Standards in the area of electronic signatures  Regarding products to be employed in electronic certification services, the Commission issued the  Decision 2003/511/EC on the publication of reference numbers of generally recognised standards for  electronic signature products in accordance with Directive 1999/93/EC, which set the following  standards:  1. Recognised standards for trustworthy systems:  a. CWA 14167-1 (March 2003): security requirements for trustworthy systems  managing certificates for electronic signatures - Part 1: System Security  Requirements  b. CWA 14167-2 (March 2002): security requirements for trustworthy systems  managing certificates for electronic signatures - Part 2: cryptographic module for  CSP signing operations - Protection Profile (MCSO-PP)  2. Recognised standards for secure signature creation products:  a. CWA 14169 (March 2004, update foreseen in December 2013): Secure Signature-  creation devices [27]  Further, from the publication of recognized standards against which manufactures of electronic  signature products may become certified, an additional requirement was introduced for secure  signature creation devices. The Directive established that the conformity of these devices shall be  determined by appropriate public or private bodies designated by member states, and that the  criteria for member states to determine whether a body should be designated should be produced.  The criteria were set by the Commission Decision 2000/709/EC on the minimum criteria to be taken  into account by member states when designating bodies in accordance with Article 3(4) of Directive  1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on a Community framework for  8  This scheme currently does not apply to product certification within the scope of the draft regulation [38].  Another scheme under consideration is the informal SOG-IS MRA, http://www.sogisportal.eu/uk/mra_en.html.  http://www.sogisportal.eu/uk/mra_en.html  Page  18  electronic signatures. The names of these notified bodies able to assess conformity with the  requirements for secure signature creation devices need to be made available to all member states;  and the certifications they issue recognised by all member states.  Currently the Protection Profiles are not adapted to the latest version of Common Criteria. These  standards will be updated for the new proposal.  4.2 Existing certification schemes  Conformity assessment of products performing cryptographic operations has been foreseen by the  European legislation to be assessed within the Common Criteria framework for information  technology security evaluation. The Common Criteria is a multilateral agreement for mutual  recognition of ICT security products certifications, and has been adopted as an international  standard by the ISO/IEC 15408 Series: Information technology, Security techniques, Evaluation  criteria for IT security [9].  In the Common Criteria framework [42], certification candidates choose a Protection Profile for the  evaluation. Different protection profiles exist for different ICT products. The CWA 14167 [26] defines  profiles for cryptographic modules for CSP signing operations, while the CWA 14169 [27] does the  same for secure signature creation devices. Common Criteria evaluations can be conducted in  different levels of depth, denominated Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL), which rank from 1 to 7. In  the case of the CWA 14169, the specified Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL) is EAL 4+.  Aside from the European certification framework, the American certification scheme, the Federal  Information Processing Standards (FIPS) by the National Information Standardization Institute (NIST)  are relatively widely used by European providers. In the case of products for electronic signatures,  the Federal Information Processing Standard NIST FIPS 140-2 [36] on requirements for cryptographic  modules is used to accredit cryptographic modules. Similarly to the EAL level in Common Criteria,  NIST FIPS 140-2 establishes four security levels regarding the deep of security testing that a product  must undergo.  The main reason for the use of FIPS certified products among European trust service providers is the  higher availability of FIPS certified products versus Common Criteria products for some components.  Some European countries accept FIPS certifications for electronic signature products as equivalent to  Common Criteria certified. The ENISA survey shows that 89% of respondents report using at least  some product with a NIST FIPS certification, while 80% of use at least one Common Criteria certified  product.  Page  19  Figure 7: Use of certified signature generation products  4.3 Certification of cryptographic modules for TSP signing operations  Cryptographic modules for TSP signing operations are hardware devices that manage the  cryptographic operations performed with the keys of a Certification Authority. Trust service  providers must ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the key pairs that their CAs use to sign the  certificates they issue. This is a critical component in the chain of trust that a CSP must protect.  This confidentiality and integrity is achieved by the use of devices with strict anti-tampering  properties, widely known as Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). HSMs are employed for the  protection of cryptographic keys, and, although not exclusively meant for public key cryptography,  this is one of their main applications. HSMs are capable of performing cryptographic operations,  such as CA key pair usage for signing user certificates. The keys don’t exit the HSM and are protected  from unauthorized access.  In the European framework, the CEN standard CWA 14167 [26] defines Common Criteria protection  profiles for cryptographic modules for CSP signing operations:  1. CWA 14167-2 Part 2: Cryptographic Module for CSP signing operations with backup -  Protection profile (CMCSOB-PP)  2. CWA 14167-3 Part 3: Cryptographic module for CSP key generation services - Protection  profile (CMCKG-PP)  3. CWA 14167-4 Part 4: Cryptographic module for CSP signing operations - Protection profile -  CMCSO PP  The CWA 14167-2 was adopted as a recognized standard against which certification presumes the  product to be compliant with EU regulations.  Currently the Protection Profiles are not adapted to the new version of Common Criteria. These  standards are in the process of being updated for the new proposal.  Aside from the European framework, NIST FIPS 140-2 [36] certified products are common among  HSMs used by European trust service providers, which can be explained due to the wider availability  of these products on the market. The ENISA survey shows that 87% of respondents report using  products having a NIST FIPS 140-2 certification. Only slightly more than half, 53%, of used products  Page  20  have a CWA 14167-2 Common Criteria certification. However, as the graphic shows, it is becoming  regularly more common for manufacturers to achieve both certifications to adapt both the European  and American markets, and already 40% of the products do hold both.  Figure 8: Use of certified products for CA signing operations  4.4 Certification of secure signature creation devices  The main technical specification for the security aspects of signature creation devices for providers  of qualified certificates is the CEN workshop agreement CWA 14169 Secure Signature-creation  devices 'EAL 4+'. [27]  Conformity assessment against the CWA 14169 is assessed within the framework of the Common  Criteria, with a specified Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) of EAL 4+. EAL4 level stands for  methodically designed, tested, and reviewed, while “+” refers to certain augmentations over the  base level.  Currently the Protection Profiles are not adapted to the new version of Common Criteria. These  standards are in the process of being updated for the new proposal.  Common Criteria certified secure signature creation devices are used by the majority of the  providers, with 76% of the respondents reporting they used subject devices with this certification.  Half of the providers use FIPS certified products. When results are combined, they show around one  third of providers use products with both Common Criteria and FIPS certification. Additionally, a  small minority of providers report using products certified against other certification schemes or  with no certification.  Page  21  Figure 9: Use of certified products for subject signing operations  4.5 Certification of trustworthy systems  Trust service providers primarily have their systems audited, and do not seek certification based on  Common Criteria. The provider or auditor may require that products used by provider are certified.  For software used by trust service providers the Certificate Issuance and Management Components  (CIMC) Protection Profile9 issued by NIST is the most common used protection profile for PKI  software and there are many products on the market compliant with this PP.  9  http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/PP_CIMC_SL1_V1.0.pdf  http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/PP_CIMC_SL1_V1.0.pdf  Page  22  5 Supervision and audit of trust service providers  Supervision plays an important role in independently attesting that organizations in a certain sector  comply with the requirements set either in regulations, standards or best practices for that sector.  Supervision doesn’t include necessarily the conduction of audits; however this is a common practice  to be able to assess security practices.  Supervision is mainly foreseen to control if a certain set of requirements established by a regulatory  framework (usually defining safety or security requirements or protecting customers) is  fulfilled..Independent supervision usually takes place in unregulated sectors where however  providers adhere voluntarily to enhance their customers trust.  In many sectors, like the case of trust service providers, both supervision and audit coexist with  different focuses. The following section introduces the existing schemes and current auditing  practices for certification services.  5.1 Government supervision  5.1.1 Under Directive 1999/93/EC  The Directive 1999/93/EC [37] included some provisions regarding the supervision of trust service  providers. Supervision was foreseen primarily for providers who issue qualified certificates, however  the possibility of introducing voluntary accreditation schemes in member states for non-qualified  trust service providers was also introduced.  Within the qualification scheme, the Directive foresaw for each member state to ensure the  establishment of an appropriate system that allows for supervision of trust service providers which  are established on its territory and issue qualified certificates to the public. Following the entry in  force of Directive, all European member states designated a supervisory body and created a  supervision scheme.  Supervisors were set in charge of overseeing that providers of qualified certificates meet the  requirements established in the Directive. However, due to the lack of details of the Directive  1999/93/EC regarding supervisory functions or supervision schemes, the EU framework left some  gaps. This caused national legislation to differ, applying different requirements for supervision of  providers in each member state, regarding:  1. Enforcement or periodicity of audits, characteristics of the audits.  2. Documentation required for the TSP to be submitted to the supervisor.  3. Compliance with standards and needs for certification (further to those set by the European  legislation).  Another function of the supervisors was to maintain the denominated “Trusted Lists”. The Directive  established that member states have to notify the Commission and other member states regarding  the names and addresses of all accredited national trust service providers. This has been achieved  through the Trusted Lists, lists with standardized formats that contain information regarding all the  providers of qualified, and sometimes non qualified,  certificates in their respective member state  for manual and automatic processing. This list is meant to increase interoperability, so that member  states can accept qualified certificates issued in another member state.  5.1.2 Under the proposed Regulation  The new proposed Regulation [38] clarifies and strengthens the role of supervisory authorities in the  field of trust services. Within the scope of the new Regulation, the supervisory authority must not  Page  23  only supervise qualified trust service providers to ensure they fulfill the specific requirements laid  down in the Regulation, but also monitor that all trust service providers established in their country  fulfill the requirements laid down in Article 15 (security requirements).  Provisions regarding audits are also introduced:  1. Qualified trust services providers must send to the supervisory body an annual security audit  conducted by a recognized independent body. In addition, the supervisory body may  conduct security audits at any time on them, informing data protection authorities in the  case of personal data breaches. In the event of failures to comply detected in the audit  reports, the authority has the power to issue binding instructions to the provider. The  provider may lose its qualification status due to neglect to remedy the detected failures.  2. In the case of non-qualified trust service providers, the proposal foresees that any trust  service provider may submit the report of a security audit carried out by a recognised  independent body to the supervisory body to confirm that appropriate security measures  have been taken.  Although no authorization is needed to establish a trust service in Europe, supervisors must receive  an initial notification by qualified trust service providers intending to enter the market. This initial  notification needs to be accompanied by a security audit that will be reviewed by the supervisory  body to verify that they comply with the requirements set down in the Regulation.  In case of termination of a provider, the supervisory body must ensure that all relevant information  concerning data issued and received by the qualified trust service provider, in particular for the  purpose of providing evidence in legal proceedings, are preserved and kept accessible after the  activities of the provider have ceased, for an appropriate time with a view to guaranteeing  continuity of the service.  Finally, supervisors must produce a yearly report containing information regarding its supervisory  activities, statistics about the trust service market in the country and received breach notifications.  They must as well cooperate with supervisory bodies of other member states, especially regarding  information exchange and support in inspection activities, and continue to maintain the Trusted Lists  of qualified providers.  5.2 Independent auditing schemes  The main technical specifications used as a base for independent audit in the area of trust service  providers policies and practices are the TS 102 042 Policy requirements for certification authorities  issuing public key certificates [16] and the TS 101 456 Policy requirements for certification authorities  issuing qualified certificates [12]. Audits against TS 101 456 is sought mainly by providers of qualified  certificates, while certification against TS 102 042 is sought by all providers. Also audits against the,  more technical, CWA 14167-1  is being sought by CSPs.  However, there is not a clear European wide framework regarding auditing bodies accredited to  perform audits against these standards, and implementations depend on national regulations.  Aside from audit programs carried out against European standards, the program “WebTrust for  Certification Authorities” has a relatively high penetration in European, and non European, CSPs.  Webtrust is a program created by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and  the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) which provides a framework to assess the  adequacy of the controls in CAs that is consistent with international standards. CSPs adhered to the  Webtrust program must undergo audits every 12 months.  Page  24  Apart from these auditing schemes which are specific to certification services, providers may also  seek to undergo audits against general certification schemes such as the ISO/IEC 27000:2009  (Information technology -- Security techniques -- Information security management) systems family  of standards. Conformity assessment against the widely adopted ISO 27000 framework can be  sought for the general security practices used by the provider. ENISA survey shows that 82% report  following the ISO 27000 series.  For CA certificate inclusion in web browsers, audit requirements are determined by each browser  vendor.  5.3 Current practices  ENISA’s survey on security practices of trust service providers shows that, among trust service  providers participating in the survey, most providers are already included in some external auditing  scheme, with 91% reporting undergoing external audits.  Figure 10: Types of audits CSPs undergo  73% report to be subject to audits on the scope of a government audit scheme, and 78% report to  have joined an industry led / independent audit scheme. Finally, more than half of providers are  subject to both.  Page  25  Figure 11: Scope of external audits  Regarding periodicity of audits, 72% of respondents report undergoing an audit at least yearly or  more frequently, while only 7% report frequency periods of more than one year. The new proposal  for a Regulation on trust services sets yearly audits as a provision for qualified trust service  providers.  Figure 12: Frequency of audits  Page  26  6 Cryptographic algorithms in certification services  Certification services rely on public key cryptography as their main component to provide  authenticity and integrity, to some extent also confidentiality. Two types of cryptographic algorithms  are employed in the electronic certification services: public key algorithms and one way hash  functions.  European legislation has not introduced any provisions regarding the cryptographic algorithms and  key sizes to be used in electronic certificates, not even in qualified ones, although some member  states have defined accepted algorithms and key sizes for qualified certifications services in their  country. In general, the choice of algorithms is to be made by the CSP as long as the algorithm is  considered to provide the appropriate level of security for the intended service, otherwise the CSP  could face liability, or not be able to pass an audit.  Several algorithms exist both for public key algorithms and one way hash functions. This study has  focused only on those widely employed by European providers.  However, several standards and technical documents provide guidance to providers regarding  recommended algorithms and key lengths. ETSI produced the technical specification TS 102 176  Algorithms and Parameters for Secure Electronic Signatures [18] specifies a list of hash functions, as  well as a list of signature schemes together with the requirements on their parameters, as well as  the recommended combinations of these schemes with hash functions and padding methods in the  form of \"signature suites\".  There are also recommendations in the NIST 800 series of documents [34], and requirement from  the CA/B Forum [32][33] to consider.  6.1 Current practices  6.1.1 Public key algorithms  Several public key algorithms exist that can be implemented for certification services suites. The  ENISA survey on security practices of trust service providers shows that the most commonly  employed algorithm is RSA, created by RSA laboratories and defined in the document PKCS #1: RSA  Cryptography Standard. All survey respondents report using this standard for at least one of their  CAs.  Employed key sizes range from 1024 to 4096 bits. For Certification Authorities, 67% of participants  report having at least one CA using RSA-4096, 52% RSA-2048 and 4% RSA-1024. Meanwhile, a few  participants use eliptic curves cryptography algorithms (ECC) – 7% use ECC-256 and only 2% ECC- 384.  Page  27  Figure 13: Algorithm and key size use for CA signature  Regarding subject key sizes, ENISA survey results show that 96% of participants report issuing  certificates using RSA-2048, 33% RSA-1024 and 13% RSA-4096.  Figure 14: Algorithm and key size use for subject signatures  When looking more into depth in the RSA algorithm, results show that exactly half of the  respondents only use RSA-4096 and no smaller key sizes. 46% use a minimum of RSA-2048, but there  is a minority of 4% that still employ RSA-1024. While the use of RSA with key sizes of 2048 or 4096  for medium term use is accepted, the use of RSA with a key size of 1024 is not recommended by  most studies [34].  NIST and ETSI recommended the discontinuation of RSA 1024 for key generation as from 2010, to be  used for legacy purposes from 2011 to 2013, and discontinued by 2013. For key verification  purposes, RSA 1024 should be used only for legacy systems since 2010. Similarly, the ECRYPT II  recommendations deemed key sizes of less than 1248 only sufficient for short-term protection  against medium organizations and medium-term protection against small organizations; a key size of  more than 1776 should be used for legacy standard level, and a key size of more than 2436 for  medium term security. The German regulator for electronic signatures established that RSA 1024  should not be used for keys for qualified certificates since 2008, while RSA 2048 is deemed  acceptable until at least 2018.  Page  28  Figure 15: Minimum supported RSA key size  Elliptic curve algorithms are also being used by 9% of survey participants. Use of elliptic curves for  digital signatures is described in the American National Standard X9.62-2005 on the Elliptic Curve  Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).  In elliptic curves, the majority of providers using them issue ECC-256 signatures, and a minority ECC- 384. In the case of ECC, the three mentioned studies report the use of elliptic curves with key sizes  above 256 bits acceptable for current use at least until 2018.  6.1.2 One way hash functions  The ENISA survey on security practices of trust service providers shows the current standard practice  among trust service providers is to use the SHA algorithm, with all respondents employing it. The  SHA algorithm is defined in the NIST guides FIPS 180-1 and NIST FIPS 180-2 RIPEMD, defined in  ISO/IEC 10118-3 [8], is also used by a small minority of survey participants.  Regarding one way hash functions for CA signatures, results that 65% of participants report using  SHA-1, 63% SHA-256 and 2% SHA-512 for the hash function of at least one CA.  Page  29  Figure 16: Hash functions and digest sizes for CAs signatures  In the case of one way hash functions for subjects’ signatures, ENISA’s survey results show that 67%  of participants report using SHA-1, 59% SHA-256, 4% SHA-384 and 7% SHA-512 for at least one type  of certificate.  Figure 17: Hash functions and digest sizes for subjects’ signatures  When looking more into depth in the message digest sizes, results show that only around a third of  the respondents use a SHA-256 for all CAs, while the majority, two thirds, still use SHA-1. In the case  of subject certificates, results show that 71% of the respondents use SHA-1, 27% use SHA-256 and  2% use SHA-512.  NIST recommended the discontinuation of SHA-1 for digital signature generation from 2010, to be  used for legacy purposes from 2011 to 2013, and discontinued by 2013. For digital signature  verification purposes, SHA-1 should be used only for legacy systems since 2010. SHA-256 and SHA- 512 are accepted for all hash function applications. Similarly the ECRYPT II recommends against the  use of SHA-1 in new applications, and to phase out of SHA-1 for signature applications with medium  to high security. The German regulator for electronic signatures established that SHA-1 should not  be used for German qualified signature generation since 2008 and for certificate generation since  Page  30  2010; it can be used for verification of qualified certificates until 2015, while SHA-256, SHA-384 SHA- 512 are deemed acceptable until at least 2019.  Figure 18: Minimum SHA digest size supported  RIPEMD (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest), created by KU Leuven, is reported to  be used by a minority. Only 2% of the participants use RIPEMD with a digest size of 160. The German  regulator for electronic signatures established that RIPEMD-160 should not be used for German  qualified certificate generation since 2010; it can be used for verification of qualified certificates  until 2015.  Page  31  7 Recommendations  7.1 Trust service providers in the EU regulatory framework  Regarding the legal framework of trust service providers in the EU regulatory framework it is worth  noting that local variations exist. It is therefore recommended to verify with local authorities  regarding local policy and regulations in the area, and also investigate variations in other member  states where the TSP is intended to operate.  It is also recommended to consider the scope and usage of the TSP services, since requirements may  differ depending on the scope and usage of the services offered by a TSP.  For TSPs located outside of Europe it is important to investigate regulations for the services intended  to be offered within the scope of the EU regulation.  7.2 Standardization in the area of trust services  Regarding standards in the area of trust services it is recommended comply with standards like ETSI  TS 101 456 [12], ETSI TS 102 042 [16], RFC 3647 [23], CWA 14167 [26] (explanation in section 3) in  the area where the TSP operates.  It is important that before implementing any standards to check for updated version of the  standards. The standards mentioned in this report may be updated at any time.  7.3 Certification of electronic signature products  Different standards for certification of products have different, and sometimes low, penetration in  the market.  It is recommended that TSPs use certified products (Common Criteria [42] or FIPS 140-2 [36], as  explained in section 4), where possible and practical, and pay attention to supervision and auditing  within the area and member state there the TSP operates.  7.4 Supervision and audit of trust service providers  In general TSPs can choose which auditing scheme to follow and should choose an appropriate  auditing scheme depending on the intended scope and usage.  TSPs should consider auditing against ETSI, WebTrust, or equivalent auditing schemes. It is important  to investigate the requirements for the specific services the TSP intends to offer. For example if the  TSP aims to seek inclusion of CA certificates in web browsers, different browsers may have different  requirements.  7.5 Cryptographic algorithms in certification services  Several organisations publish recommendations regarding cryptographic algorithms, the most  notable being referenced by this document.  TSPs should investigate the latest recommendations, and keep themselves up to date, regarding the  choice of algorithms for CAs and subjects. The recommendations may differ slightly depending on  the intended scope, usage and member state.  In order to maintain maximum interoperability TSPs should consider using appropriate algorithms  and key sizes (ECRYPT [45] and similar studies can be a good guide).

assessment phases defined in [2]are followed:   Risk identification: Identifying the different factors (assets, threats, vulnerabilities,  consequences and incident scenarios) that will identify and evaluate the risks:  o System scope delimitation: Determining the scope included in the risk assessment  and its boundaries  o Asset identification: Identifying any type of item that has value to the organization  and that could cause damage if it is involved in an incident.  o Threat analysis: identifying all agents, either natural or human made, accidental or  intentional, internal or external, that could pose a threat to the organization.  o Vulnerability analysis: Identifying all potential weakness in the organization that  could facilitate a successful attack and cause damage to the assets.  o Consequence determination: Identifying the possible consequences that different  events could have on the organization.  o Incident scenario identification: Determining the possible events that could have an  impact on the organization and that will serve as a base to identify the risks.   Risk analysis: Determining the risk level based on the impact of each incident scenario and  their probability of occurrence.   Risk evaluation: Producing a scored list of all the identified risks, based on the risk analysis  results; the business criteria; the affected assets and their vulnerabilities and the potential  threats.

    "abstract": "This document describes the framework surrounding trust service providers (TPSs) – the concepts and standards related to operations of a TSP. It focuses on EU standards, but also takes into account others where relevant. The document specifically outlines security requirements for qualified and non-qualified trust service providers. It references the most important standards and standardization bodies involved in technical specification, as well as certification, auditing and supervision schemes that can be used in order to qualify as a notified trust service provider. The document also presents result of a survey conducted by ENISA amongst European trust service providers related to the different aspects. Finally, the document gives some summary recommendations for TSPs considering standards and auditing schemes."

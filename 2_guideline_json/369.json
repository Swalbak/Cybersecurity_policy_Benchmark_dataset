It enables import and  exports of goods, supply in energy, trade within the European Union and transport of  passengers and vehicles. This activity relies on more than 1 2001 seaports within the European  Union, each with different organisation, interests, challenges and activities.  The global digitalization trend and recent policies and regulations require ports to face new  challenges with regards to information and communication technology (ICT). Ports tend to rely  more on technologies to be more competitive, comply with some standards and policies and  optimize operations. This brings new stakes and challenges in in the area of cybersecurity, both  in the Information Technologies (IT) and Operation Technologies (OT) worlds.  This report identifies those challenges, in relation to critical operations, stakeholder’s ecosystem  and assets identification. It then lists the main threats posing risks to the port ecosystem and  describes key cyberattack scenarios that could impact them.  This approach allowed the identification of security measures that ports shall put in place to  better protect themselves from cyberattack. The main measures identified are described below  and intend to serve as good practices for people responsible for cybersecurity implementation in  Port Authorities and Terminal Operators (e.g. CISOs, CIOs etc.):   Define a clear governance around cybersecurity at port level, involving all  stakeholders involved in port operations. Indeed, many companies are involved in  port operation (port operators, Port Authority, pilotage company, shipping  companies, etc.), it is crucial to ensure they are all involved in cybersecurity  matters and aware about how they participate to the global port operation security.   Raise awareness of cybersecurity matters at port level and infuse a cybersecurity  culture. Indeed, the maritime sector is historically very aware of safety and security  matters, but it seems cybersecurity is not fully integrated yet in stakeholders’  minds. This measure shall be combined with training, to ensure proper  understanding of cybersecurity matters and ability to enforce it in daily operations.   Enforce the technical cybersecurity basics, like network segregation, updates  management, password hardening, segregation of rights, etc. In the context of OT,  with legacy systems that usually cannot be updated, network segregation and  password protection are key to ensure a correct level of cybersecurity.   Consider security by design in applications, especially as ports use many systems,  some of which are opened to third parties for data exchange. Any vulnerability on  those systems can be a gate to compromise the port systems.   Enforce detection and response capabilities at port level to react as fast as  possible to any cyberattack before it impacts port operation, safety or security.  Ports can rely on simple detection measures such as alerts when a specific action  is done (authentication attempt on a very critical asset for example) or search for  Indicators of Compromise (IOC), or on more comprehensive, using machine  learning to correlate information and identify compromising patterns. Such  initiatives have already started to rise within ports ecosystem2.  1 See https://www.globaltrademag.com/european-ports  2 See https://www.sauronproject.eu/  https://www.globaltrademag.com/european-ports/ https://www.sauronproject.eu/  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  10  1. INTRODUCTION  The European Union has identified ports as critical infrastructure and defined the ports as “any  specified area of land and water, with boundaries defined by the Member State in which the port  is situated, containing works and equipment designed to facilitate commercial maritime transport  operations” in Directive 2005/65/EC3.  Ports play a crucial role at different levels for many sectors and have been the successful  pioneers in Europe for interconnecting the different types of transport. As a main vehicle for  European imports and exports (food, commodities, etc.) with the rest of the world, ports enable  also trade and contacts between all European nations. Moreover, ports are important nodes for  passengers and vehicles transportation (inter and extra-EU) and play a key role in European  fishing activity.  For a number of years, ports have been undergoing a digital transformation in order to meet  emerging challenges, optimise existing processes and introduce new capabilities, such as  automation and real-time monitoring of operations4,5,6,7,8,9. This digitalisation has been centred  on the interconnectivity of Information Technology (IT) and Operation Technology (OT) assets  and the introduction of new technological enablers, such as cloud computing, big data and  Internet of Things (IoT).  This digital transformation has also led to a change in the sector’s cyber risk profile, as evident  by the proliferation of cybersecurity incidents in ports over the past few years, such as the  cyberattack in Antwerp port10, the NotPetya Ransomware incident and its impact on  Maersk11 and the wave of ransomware attacks in Port of Barcelona12 and San Diego13.  Indeed, this transition to the future and to concepts, such as Smart Ports, brings along  cybersecurity challenges that need to be met in order for future ports to fully unlock the potential  of new technologies.  1.1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  In November 2011, ENISA published the first EU report ever on cyber security challenges in the  Maritime Sector14. This analysis highlighted key insights, as well as existing initiatives, as a  baseline for cyber security of maritime ecosystem. This new ENISA study aims at addressing  the cybersecurity challenges related to the evolution of maritime port systems and services.  3 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32005L0060  4 See Port Digitalization with Open Data: Challenges, Opportunities, and Integrations:  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321853773_Digital_transformation_in_maritime_ports_analysis_and_a_game_the oretic_framework  5 See https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261343481_Intelligent_ports_based_on_Internet_of_Things and  https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2016/04/01/the-hamburg-port-authoritys-impressive-iot-project/#50f7ac776c64  6 See https://news.microsoft.com/fr-fr/2018/10/15/soget-et-microsoft-un-partenariat-strategique-pour-une-digitalisation- securisee-des-ports-francais-et-mondiaux/  7 See https://www.patersonsimons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TMS_SmartPort_InsightBee_Report-to- GUIDE_01.02.18.pdf  8 See https://www.big-data-value.eu/pilot/transforming-transport-ports-valencia/  9 See https://www.i-scoop.eu/blockchain-smart-port-project-case-container-release-port-antwerp  10 See https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24539417  11 See https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/  12 See https://www.securitynewspaper.com/2018/09/26/hacking-attack-in-port-of-barcelona  13 See https://www.darktrace.com/en/blog/troubled-waters-cyber-attacks-on-san-diego-and-barcelonas-ports and  https://www.portofsandiego.org/press-releases/general-press-releases/port-san-diego-releases-additional- information-cybersecurity  14 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-aspects-in-the-maritime-sector-1  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32005L0060 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321853773_Digital_transformation_in_maritime_ports_analysis_and_a_game_theoretic_framework https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321853773_Digital_transformation_in_maritime_ports_analysis_and_a_game_theoretic_framework https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261343481_Intelligent_ports_based_on_Internet_of_Things https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2016/04/01/the-hamburg-port-authoritys-impressive-iot-project/#50f7ac776c64 https://news.microsoft.com/fr-fr/2018/10/15/soget-et-microsoft-un-partenariat-strategique-pour-une-digitalisation-securisee-des-ports-francais-et-mondiaux/ https://news.microsoft.com/fr-fr/2018/10/15/soget-et-microsoft-un-partenariat-strategique-pour-une-digitalisation-securisee-des-ports-francais-et-mondiaux/ https://www.patersonsimons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TMS_SmartPort_InsightBee_Report-to-GUIDE_01.02.18.pdf https://www.patersonsimons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TMS_SmartPort_InsightBee_Report-to-GUIDE_01.02.18.pdf https://www.big-data-value.eu/pilot/transforming-transport-ports-valencia/ https://www.i-scoop.eu/blockchain-smart-port-project-case-container-release-port-antwerp https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24539417 https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/ https://www.securitynewspaper.com/2018/09/26/hacking-attack-in-port-of-barcelona/ https://www.darktrace.com/en/blog/troubled-waters-cyber-attacks-on-san-diego-and-barcelonas-ports/ https://www.portofsandiego.org/press-releases/general-press-releases/port-san-diego-releases-additional-information-cybersecurity https://www.portofsandiego.org/press-releases/general-press-releases/port-san-diego-releases-additional-information-cybersecurity https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-aspects-in-the-maritime-sector-1  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  11  The main objectives of the study are to build a baseline of good practices to ensure  cybersecurity of port systems and services, while mapping the relevant cybersecurity challenges  and threats and highlighting some attack scenarios. The study aims at being a reference point  to promote collaboration on maritime port ecosystem across the European Union and raise  awareness of the relevant threats. An additional important element of the study is to map port  services and systems through a high-level reference model to set the scope of the work to be  done and serve as a basis for future developments.  1.2 STUDY SCOPE  This study outlines good practices for cybersecurity in the maritime port ecosystem, both  concerning IT systems and OT systems. The port ecosystem includes all the stakeholders  involved in the port operations: the managing bodies of the port (Port Authorities, terminal and  facility operators), national authorities (customs, police, cities, etc.), transport companies  (shipping companies, railway companies, etc.) and all the service providers essential to port  operations (oil companies, energy companies, etc.).  The primary target audience of this study are people in charge of IT and OT security within the  port ecosystem: employees of Port Authorities and terminal operators or any other person in  charge of applying these practices. The study can also be useful for secondary stakeholders in  the port ecosystem: port ecosystem associations and especially members in charge of IT and  OT security matters, persons in charge of IT and OT in companies interacting with ports,  especially shipping companies, etc.  1.3 METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH  Task 1 - Definition of the project scope and identification of experts: the first step consisted  of establishing the scope of the project and selecting subject matter experts whose input and  insights were considered for the development of the report. Experts mainly include port  stakeholders in charge of cybersecurity as well as some national authorities.  Task 2 - Desktop research: during this step, extensive search for relevant documents in the  context of the project was conducted. The identified sources served as a reference to develop  good practices and other parts of the report.  Task 3 - Questionnaire and series of interviews with selected subject matter experts: a  questionnaire addressing port cybersecurity topics was developed and filled in by 14  stakeholders of the port ecosystem (from 13 European Port Authorities – either cybersecurity,  security, safety or IT and OT managers – and from one national cybersecurity agency,  representing 11 different Member States) and used to conduct interviews with 13 of them.  Task 4 - Analysis of collected material and report development: the input collected from  desktop research and collaboration with stakeholders were thoroughly analysed. Based on this  analysis, the first draft of this report was developed.  Task 5 - Review and validation: The report was validated with ENISA's subject matter experts  through sharing of the draft report and through obtaining comments and feedback.  Figure 1: Methodology adopted for the study  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  12  2. THE EU PORT LANDSCAPE  2.1 EU AND INTERNATIONAL POLICY AND REGULATORY CONTEXT  2.1.1 International context  At international level, the ISPS - International Ships and Port Facilities Security Code15, was  added to the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)16 Convention in 2002 to recognise the role of port  facilities in maritime security and define mandatory requirements and recommendations that  ships and port facilities must follow. This chapter has been defined to address ports security, but  requirements can be related also to ports cybersecurity to some extent (access control and  authentication requirements).  The ISPS Code requires ports to design a Port Facility Security Assessment (PFSA) to  identify major assets, possible threats and countermeasures and a Port Facility Security Plan  (PFSP) to identify, for each of the different security levels the procedures to be followed, the  measures to be put in place and the actions to be undertaken. The PFSA must address within a  port facility, the following aspects: physical security, structural integrity, personnel protection  systems, procedural policies, radio and telecommunication systems, including computer  systems and networks and relevant transportation infrastructure. The PFSP must address  access to the port facility, restricted areas within the port facility, handling of cargo, delivery of  ship’s stores and monitoring the security of the port facility.  SOLAS and FAL17 (Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic) conventions define nine  standardized forms to be used to exchange information within the maritime ecosystem,  especially between port and third parties. Electronic exchange of required information is  mandatory since April 9th, 2019, especially using “Single Window” systems offset up by public  authorities18. This standardisation of data exchanges has a strong impact on port IT ecosystems  and poses new IT security challenges.  Cybersecurity for the maritime ecosystem, in particular for ships, has been only directly  addressed at International level since 2017 through guidelines and recommendations to the  global maritime ecosystem.  IMO Facilitation Committee (FAL) and the Maritime Security Committee (MSC) defined IMO  Guidelines on maritime cyber risk management in MSC-FAL.1/Circ.319. Both recognized the  urgent need to raise awareness on cyber risk threats and vulnerabilities and to provide high-  level recommendations on maritime cyber risk management from current and emerging cyber  threats and vulnerabilities, including main areas that support effective cyber risk management  (identify, protect, detect, respond and recover).  15 See IMO Conventions: http://www.imo.org/en/about/conventions/listofconventions/pages/default.aspx  16 See IMO Conventions: http://www.imo.org/en/about/conventions/listofconventions/pages/default.aspx  17 See http://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/facilitation/conventionscodesguidelines/pages/default.aspx  18 See Chapter 3 “Application of Single Window Concept  http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Facilitation/FormsCertificates/Documents/FAL%2040-19%20- %20Report%20Of%20The%20Facilitation%20Committee%20On%20Its%20Fortieth%20Session%20(Secretariat).pdf#sear ch=single%20window  19 See Guidelines on Maritime Cyber Risk Management (MSC-FAL.1/Circ.3):  http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Security/Guide_to_Maritime_Security/Documents/MSC-FAL.1-Circ.3%20- %20Guidelines%20On%20Maritime%20Cyber%20Risk%20Management%20(Secretariat).pdf  http://www.imo.org/en/about/conventions/listofconventions/pages/default.aspx http://www.imo.org/en/about/conventions/listofconventions/pages/default.aspx http://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/facilitation/conventionscodesguidelines/pages/default.aspx http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Facilitation/FormsCertificates/Documents/FAL%2040-19%20-%20Report%20Of%20The%20Facilitation%20Committee%20On%20Its%20Fortieth%20Session%20(Secretariat).pdf#search=single%20window http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Facilitation/FormsCertificates/Documents/FAL%2040-19%20-%20Report%20Of%20The%20Facilitation%20Committee%20On%20Its%20Fortieth%20Session%20(Secretariat).pdf#search=single%20window http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Facilitation/FormsCertificates/Documents/FAL%2040-19%20-%20Report%20Of%20The%20Facilitation%20Committee%20On%20Its%20Fortieth%20Session%20(Secretariat).pdf#search=single%20window http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Security/Guide_to_Maritime_Security/Documents/MSC-FAL.1-Circ.3%20-%20Guidelines%20On%20Maritime%20Cyber%20Risk%20Management%20(Secretariat).pdf http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Security/Guide_to_Maritime_Security/Documents/MSC-FAL.1-Circ.3%20-%20Guidelines%20On%20Maritime%20Cyber%20Risk%20Management%20(Secretariat).pdf  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  13  These guidelines make the distinction between IT systems (use of data as information) and OT  systems (use of data to control or monitor physical processes). They recognize that all  organizations in the shipping industry are different and shall refer to Member Governments' and  Flag Administrations' requirements and relevant international or industry standards and best  practices (e.g. NIST Framework20, ISO/IEC 2700121) in order to address the most relevant  security measures.  2.1.2 European context  Some EU regulation impacted the maritime ecosystem and directly or indirectly ports with  regards to safety, security and data exchange:   Some chapters of the SOLAS Convention were transposed in the European  Union through several regulations; Regulation (EC) 725/200422 focuses on  enhancing ship and port facility security and on the implementation of the  International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code while Directive  2005/65/EC23 on enhancing port security. Regulation (EC) 336/200624 focuses on  the implementation of the International Safety Management Code (ISM)25 within  maritime sector in the European Union, though it should be mentioned that the  ISM code is not applicable to ports; and   Directive 2010/65/EU26 requires that ports of the Member States accept  standardised forms (FAL forms) in order to ease traffic. This directive also  introduces SafeSeaNet systems27 established at national and European Union  level to facilitate secure data exchange between Member States’ maritime  authorities and other authorities’ systems (e.g. customs systems).  More concretely, Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 and Directive 2005/65/EC are the legal  frameworks which support risk assessments and security plans for ports and port facilities: the  Member States must design a PFSA and the Port Authorities must design their PFSP to be  approved, prior to their implementation, by the Member States which are responsible for  ensuring that the implementation of PFSPs is monitored.  In 2014, the European Maritime Security Strategy (EUMSS)28 was defined (and revised in  2018)29 as a shared and comprehensive tool to identify, prevent and respond to any challenge  that affects the security of European people, activities and assets in the maritime ecosystem,  including ports. This strategy identifies the maritime security risks and threats which are  “terrorism and other intentional unlawful acts at sea and in ports against ships, cargo, crew and  passengers, ports and port facilities and critical maritime and energy infrastructure, including  cyber-attacks”. The revision of the EUMSS, as adopted by the General Affairs Council on 26  June 2018, aims at a more focused reporting process to enhance awareness and better follow-  up to the strategy  In 2016, the Regulation (EU) 2016/679, called the General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR)30, on the protection of natural persons regarding the processing of personal data and  20 See https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework  21 See https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html  22 See more about European Directives and Regulations: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/homepage.html  23 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1568879817427&uri=CELEX:32005L0065  24 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1568879842121&uri=CELEX:32006R0336  25 See IMO Conventions: http://www.imo.org/en/about/conventions/listofconventions/pages/default.aspx  26 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1568879869082&uri=CELEX:32010L0065  27 See more about SafeSeaNet systems: http://www.emsa.europa.eu/ssn-main.html  28 See the European Maritime Security Strategy: https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/policy/maritime-security_en  29 See https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/06/26/maritime-security-eu-revises-its-action-plan/  30 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679  https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html https://eur-lex.europa.eu/homepage.html https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1568879817427&uri=CELEX:32005L0065 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1568879842121&uri=CELEX:32006R0336 http://www.imo.org/en/about/conventions/listofconventions/pages/default.aspx https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1568879869082&uri=CELEX:32010L0065 http://www.emsa.europa.eu/ssn-main.html https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/policy/maritime-security_en https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/06/26/maritime-security-eu-revises-its-action-plan/ https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  14  on the free movement of such data, defined requirements for the protection of personal data,  applied for all sectors including the maritime sector.  The Directive 2016/1148 (NIS Directive)31  is an EU-wide cybersecurity legislation harmonizing  national cybersecurity capabilities, cross-border collaboration and the supervision of critical  sectors across the EU. The recitals number 10 and 11 are specific to the maritime sector:  “security requirements for companies, ships, port facilities, ports and vessel traffic services  under Union legal acts cover all operations, including radio and telecommunication systems,  computer systems and networks” and “when identifying operators” of essential services “in the  water transport sector, Member States should take into account existing and future international  codes and guidelines developed in particular by the International Maritime Organisation, with a  view to providing individual maritime operators with a coherent approach”.  Operators of essential services identified in the water transport ecosystem are the following:   Inland, sea and coastal passenger and freight water transport companies, as  defined for maritime transport in Appendix I to Regulation (EC) 725/200432 not  including the individual vessels operated by those companies;   Managing bodies of ports (defined as “any specified area of land and water, with  boundaries defined by the Member State in which the port is situated, containing  works and equipment designed to facilitate commercial maritime transport  operations” in the Directive 2005/65/EC33) including their port facilities (defined as  “a location where the ship/port interface takes place; this includes areas such as  anchorages, awaiting berths and approaches from seaward, as appropriate” in the  Regulation (EC) No 725/200434) and entities operating works and equipment  contained within ports; and   Operators of vessel traffic services (defined as “service designed to improve the  safety and efficiency of vessel traffic and to protect the environment, which has the  capability to interact with the traffic and to respond to traffic situations developing  in the VTS area” in the Directive 2002/59/EC35).  Finally, in 2019, the EU Cybersecurity Act36 strengthens the position of ENISA within  cybersecurity matters for EU Member states and defines an EU-wide cybersecurity certification  framework for ICT products, services and processes. This framework will provide a  comprehensive set of rules, technical requirements, standards and procedures in order to attest  that ICT products and services can be trusted based on EU requirements.  In addition to International and European regulatory and policy initiatives, several Member  States have also developed their own initiatives to improve cyber risk management in general or  specifically in the maritime sector such as national cybersecurity strategies, good practices or  recommendations, for example the French CIIP law37, UK’s cyber security code of practice for  ports 38, German “IT-Grundschutz”39, etc.  31 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148  32 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:129:0006:0091:EN:PDF  33 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:310:0028:0039:FR:PDF  34 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/En/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32004R0725  35 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2002:208:0010:0027:FR:PDF  36 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eu-cybersecurity-act  37 See https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/cybersecurity-in-france/ciip-in-france/  38 See https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ports-and-port-systems-cyber-security-code-of-practice  39 See https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/itgrundschutz_node.html  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:129:0006:0091:EN:PDF https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:310:0028:0039:FR:PDF https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/En/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32004R0725 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2002:208:0010:0027:FR:PDF https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eu-cybersecurity-act https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/cybersecurity-in-france/ciip-in-france/ https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ports-and-port-systems-cyber-security-code-of-practice https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/itgrundschutz_node.html  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  15  2.2 PORT INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES  The port infrastructure and services exhibit a high degree of diversity from one port to another  and from one Member State to another: over the years, the ports have adapted their  infrastructure and services to the local geographic and territorial specificities, to the activities  related to the location of the port (existing fishing basins around, an ideal location for tourism, a  location at the crossroads of different countries and continents, etc.) and to the different  challenges that ports have to face.  The global infrastructure of a port is composed of marine infrastructure (breakwaters, dredging,  locks, basins, jetties, quays, mooring piers, etc.), distribution infrastructure (internal roads,  railways, walkways, etc.), buildings and terminals managed and maintained by the Port  Authority. The port facilities are usually let by the Port Authority to private terminal operators in  charge of managing and maintaining the superstructure (such as cranes, silos, specific fencing,  control facilities, passenger terminals) to deliver the specific port facility operations.  Besides, various authorities reside in ports facilities to provide services, controls and inspections  related to ship and port operations (see 3.3).  A port can address three main categories of activities, to which infrastructures and services are  adapted:   Activities related to maritime cargo (container, general cargo, liquid or dry bulk,  etc.) with dedicated infrastructure and services to welcome cargo vessels and  manage related operations (e.g. unloading and loading, storage, customs  inspection, sanitary controls, etc.).   Activities related to passengers and vehicles transport with dedicated  infrastructure and services to welcome passengers and vehicles on ships and  manager related operations (e.g. passenger gangways, parking, restaurants and  bars, border control, etc.). This includes RoRo (Roll-on/roll-off ships) activity as  cargo is on trucks.   Activities related to fishing with dedicated infrastructure and services to  welcome fishing boats and manage related operations (e.g. fish unloading/loading,  fish inspection, fish refrigerated storage, etc.)  In order to support these various activities, the port provides main services, represented in the  Figure 2: Port services and infrastructure and detailed in Table 1: Detailed port services. These  services are grouped into seven categories, which were defined based on the desktop research  and information provided by the experts who contributed to this report.  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  16  Figure 2: Port services and infrastructure  Table 1: Detailed port services  Service category Service description  Vessel berthing  services  When a vessel arrives and leaves a port, different services are provided: berth allocation, marine pilotage,  ship supplies such as refuelling or food supply, towing, mooring, vessel safety and security management,  bulk water management, services to the crew, ship repair, etc.  Vessel loading and  unloading services  When a vessel is berthed in a port, different services are provided to load and unload freight, fishes,  passengers and vehicles: quay cranes and conveyor belts operations, pumping, freight tracking,  passenger gangways set up, access controls at boarding, safety and security, operations monitoring, etc.  Temporary storage  and staying services  When freight or fishes are on quays, temporary storage services are provided before they are distributed  and transferred, depending on the nature of the freight: container moving, storage and stacking; bulk solids  conveyor belts operations and storage; grain conveyors and silos operations; bulk liquids pumping and  reservoirs filling; general cargo storage; refrigerated cargo storage; etc.  In a similar way, staying services are provided for vehicles and passengers: parking, passenger lounges,  luggage handling facilities, restaurants and bars, shopping malls, etc.  Distribution and  transfer services  To ensure the hinterland connectivity, distributing and transferring services are provided: inland port  services, train stations and marshalling yards, passenger and luggage controls, intermodal transport hubs,  container scanning, port entry and exit, etc.  Support services  To support the services describing above, the Port Authority or other private companies provide the  following service: freight tracking, maritime traffic control, land and infrastructure management, real estate  and facility management, terminal operations management, berthing and pilotage management, dangerous  goods management, maintenance, port operations management, port administration, etc.  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  17  Security and safety  services  To protect infrastructure, services and people working and passing through the port, security and safety  services are provided to prevent accident or malicious activities such as terrorism: cameras and radar  surveillance, access controls, alarms, signals, detections, etc.  Authorities’ services  Authorities can be located within port facilities to provide various services, included controls and  inspections: customs, police, coast guards, firefighters, port state control, civil security, rescue at sea,  health, navigation safety, pollution prevention, sanitary and veterinary controls, fish catch controls, etc.  2.3 OVERVIEW OF KEY STAKEHOLDERS  The panorama of the stakeholders involved in port operations and processes is complex and is  accentuated by the considerable differences in governance and functioning that may exist  between European ports. However, a high-level overview can be drawn to differentiate  categories of stakeholders by macro roles, based on the desktop research and information  provided by the experts who contributed to this report.  Figure 3: Overview of port stakeholders  2.4 HIGH-LEVEL REFERENCE MODEL  The complexity and the diversity of the port ecosystem (various operational and economic  models, different governance, large typology of stakeholders involved, responsibilities shared  between stakeholders, etc.) and the unicity of each port are reflected in a very diverse approach  to information and operational technology (IT/OT) systems management. Indeed, from one port  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  18  to another, IT and OT systems are not the same, are not operated and managed by the same  types of stakeholders and not implemented in the same way.  This report provides a high-level reference model based on the desktop research and  information provided by the experts who contributed to this report. Its objectives are to list, from  a high-level perspective, the main port systems, data flows and interactions with external  systems. However, this model must be nuanced and adapted, because it cannot fully  correspond to the specificities of each port. For instance, the Port Community System  functionality differs between ports, depending on their specific activities and services as well as  their overseeing authorities.  Figure 4: High-level reference model of the port systems  2.4.1 Description of the systems  The high-level reference model represents the port systems (block in the middle), and the third  parties’ systems interacting with them.  Third parties' systems are grouped into 4 main categories: systems used by maritime  stakeholders’ (shipping companies, ship agent, ship master and crew, etc.), systems used by  other transport stakeholders to share freight or passenger information and enable the  transhipment (inland waterborne transport companies, roadway companies, railway companies,  etc.), systems used by authorities at local, national and European levels and systems used for  satellite and maritime surveillance.  Regarding port systems, they are regrouped into two main categories:  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  19   exchange data systems of the port community for vessel, fishing or freight  related services, especially used as central point for data exchange with shipping  companies, also called “single window”;   port management information systems, that includes maritime traffic control  systems, corporate systems (emails, ERP, etc.), security and safety systems as  well as Terminal Operation Management Systems, often owned by private  companies.  2.4.2 Description of data flows  Port systems interact with a wide range of systems through machine-to-machine  interconnections or manual ones (with information exchanged though web interfaces, by phone  calls, emails, paper or fax).  A large amount of data is exchanged between the port and the different stakeholders, which is  classified into 5 categories according to this reference model:   the mandatory declarations (information that shipping companies or other  stakeholders must report to the Port Authority or other authorities, with respect to  the international, European and national legislations);   the control and authorisation given by the authorities to the commercial  stakeholders (e.g. authorisation to access to the port, authorisation to unload the  goods);   the operational data related to the port services and processes (e.g. needs for  ship refuelling, scheduling of cargo operations);   the financial data (e.g. invoicing from the port to its client, payment); and   the navigation data (e.g. GPS position of a ship in the port area, AIS data).  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  20  3. PORT ASSET TAXONOMY  3.1 ASSET TAXONOMY OVERVIEW  To identify cyber threats associated to the port ecosystem, it is essential to start from  identification and breakdown of the port’s assets. Figure 5 provides an overview of the main  asset categories that could be found in a port and details the assets for each category: this  taxonomy should not be considered as comprehensive; it aims at representing the main assets  and doesn’t reflect the diversity and the specificities of different ports. Table 3 describes each  asset represented in the asset taxonomy.  Ten asset categories are identified based on the desktop research and information provided by  the experts who contributed to this report: the fixed infrastructure, the mobile infrastructure, the  OT systems and networks, the OT end-devices associated, the IT systems, the IT end-devices  associated, the networks and communications components, the safety and security systems,  the information and data, and the people.  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  21  Figure 5: Asset taxonomy  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  22  3.2 DESCRIPTION OF PORT ASSETS  Table 2: Description of port’s assets  Sub-categories Description  Fixed infrastructure  Seaside  connectivity  Those assets are related to the navigation between the seaside and the port area to ensure that the  vessels can enter and exit the port: breakwaters, sea locks, buoys, light beacons, marking of waterways,  tide, wind and currents monitoring, radar monitoring of waterways.  Portuary  infrastructure  The assets are related to the mooring of the vessels in the port (docks, quays, jetties, piers), the lighting,  the access control (gates, plate reading systems, detectors) and the transport inside the port areas (roads,  railways, waterways, walk roads).  Buildings  The port buildings host the different offices related to the port services (Harbour Master office, customs  office, etc.) and the data centres hosting all the IT and OT systems.  Energy  Those assets are related to the supply of energy for the port ecosystem (buildings, vessels, etc.): electricity  network (with high-voltage for large ports), fresh water bunkering and delivery stations, pipeline, fuel, petrol,  etc.  Waste treatment  systems  The port manages not only its waste but also the waste of the vessels (solid waste such as plastic, paper,  glass, food and liquid waste such as bilge water, sludge and sewage).  Hinterland  connectivity  The port, as an interface between the sea and the hinterland transport systems, has hinterland connectivity  assets such as railway stations and rolling stock loading and dispatch systems, road infrastructure,  intermodal stations, canals and port infrastructures connecting with inland waterways.  Safety &  security  The port has also dedicated infrastructure to ensure safety and security: control tower, operational room,  security centre, first response facilities (firefighting, pollution, containment, evacuation routes, medical  facilities, etc.).  Mobile infrastructure  Port service  ships  The port has dedicated service ships at disposal to deliver specific services on water to the vessels: pilot  boats, tugboats, boatage and mooring assistance, supply vessels, safety vessels, inspection and security  vessels.  Special vehicles  Identically, the port has dedicated vehicles at disposal to deliver inland services: firefighting, ambulance,  mobile cargo control units, etc.  Physical floating  barriers  To protect other critical vessels and port areas, to contain pollutions and other purpose, the port can use  physical floating barriers.  OT systems and networks  Industrial  control systems  (ICS)  In the port, there are different Industrial Control Systems (ICS), for managing port access and vessels  berthing (bridges, locks, gates, etc.), port infrastructure (buildings, etc.) and terminal operations (cranes,  storage, etc.). The ICS is composed of the following components: automatons and analysers (PLCs,  RTUs), databases (Historian, MES, etc.), supervisory systems (DCS, SCADA), HMI / workstations  (programming consoles, engineering workstation), Maintenance systems and Safety Instrumented Systems  (SIS).  ICS  Communications  networks &  components  To ensure the communications between the ICS components, the port manage the following assets:  switches (managed and unmanaged), wireless access points, protocols, power supply systems (water,  electricity, etc.)  OT END devices  Related to port  facility specific  lay-out  The end-devices of the ICS related to the port facility specific lay-out are: specific fencing and access  control, specific safety and security equipment, first response equipment, specific operational room, etc.  Related to  vessels berthing  The end-devices of the ICS related to the port vessels berthing are: boatage, berth management systems,  specific inspection and control equipment, etc.  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  23  Related to  vessel loading  and unloading  To load and unload the vessels, many OT end-devices are used: terminal-specific handling equipment and  systems (cranes, ramps for passengers, pipelines, belt, conveyors, etc.), terminal-specific freight tracking  systems (barcodes, liquid meters, RFID, seals, scales etc.), people badge or ticket scanners, plates reading  systems, fault detectors in automated loading/unloading systems (leakages, shocks, jamming etc.)  Related to  temporary  storage  Once the cargo or container are out of the vessel, they are temporary stored in the port areas, different OT  end-devices are used: internal transport systems (straddle carrier, yard, truck, chassis, etc.), storage  equipment systems (pallet racks, tankage, etc.), cooled and uncooled stores, silos, tanks, switches  (managed and unmanaged) for pipes and conveyor belts, wireless access points for « smart » seals and  container self-localisation devices, etc.  Related to  hinterland  connectivity  To get in or out the cargo, container, vehicles or passengers, different end-devices are used to control and  inspect them, and then transport them to other transport systems: control and inspection systems  (scanners, inspection systems, Xray), railway station, marshalling yards for wagons, multimodal transport  hubs for people (passengers, workers…), inland port facilities, port gate control equipment (plates reading,  badges, barcodes reading, detectors)  IT systems  Port Community  System (PCS)  The Port Community System is usually owned and managed by the Port Authority or port stakeholders40,  increasingly organised, as a single window system to share information on port operations related to the  vessels between all the port stakeholders (date of arrival or departure of the ship given by the shipping  companies, mandatory declarations such as crew list, dangerous goods declarations, bookings of vessel  services, etc.).  Cargo  Community  System (CCS)  The Cargo Community System is usually owned and managed by port stakeholders41 that are usually  private companies in charge of the terminal port operations. This system is used to share information on  port operations related to the cargo and containers between all involved stakeholders (content of the cargo,  localisation of a container, hour of its transfer, customs declarations, etc.).  Fisheries  Information  Management  System (FIMS)  For ports hosting fishing activities, the FIMS, as an integrated collection of applications and processes, is  owned by the local fisheries authority and used by port stakeholders to manage fisheries operations  (loading and unloading), traceability of fish catches, catch certifications.42  Port Corporate  Systems  The Port Corporate Systems are composed of different applications, systems, workstations and servers,  common to every companies: financial, human resources (HR), communication and networks systems,  emailing systems, sales and marketing systems (ERP), etc.  Terminal  Operations  Management  Systems  The Terminal Operations Management Systems, usually owned, used and maintained by private terminal  operators, are mainly composed of different systems: enterprise operations systems to plan and manage  the logistics and operations (ERP, CRM, etc.), the OT systems specific to the terminal operations (cranes,  etc.), terminal operating systems (TOS) used to optimise the logistics, transhipment and warehouse  systems.  VTS/VTMIS  A Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) is a marine traffic monitoring system. The Vessel Traffic Management  Information System (VTMIS) is an extension of the VTS which integrates other information and  functionalities to increase the effectiveness of port operations (allocation of resources, etc.).  Berth  Management  Systems  Those systems are used by Port Authorities to manage and ensure safety in mooring processes: warnings  and alerts, meteorological data, video cameras streams, berth allocation management, etc.  IT END-devices  Workstations  Different workstations are used in ports: dedicated to IT systems, dedicated to OT systems, to  maintenance, mobile and fixes workstations, etc.  Mobile devices  Different mobile devices are used in ports: smartphones, tablets, TETRA radios, specific devices used for  logistics (scanning, etc.) etc.  40 The governance of PCS is complex and differs from one port to another. For instance, the PCS of the ports of Rotterdam  and Amsterdam were merged to create a unique one, receiving a license to operate from the port communities of  Amsterdam and Rotterdam and becoming the PCS of Dutch ports. See https://www.portbase.com/en/about-us/  41 The governance of CCS is also complex and differs from one port to another and from one Member State from anther.  For example, due to the French regulations, although closely connected, the PCS and CCS are different systems with  specific governance: the CCS is operated by private companies (operated by SOGET for different French ports such as Le  Havre). Whereas, in other countries, to use again the example of the ports of Amsterdam and Rotterdam, the CCS is the  same system than the PCS. See http://www.soget.fr/en/soget-siege-3/about-us.html  42 See http://www.franciscoblaha.info/fisheries-information-systems  https://www.portbase.com/en/about-us/ http://www.soget.fr/en/soget-siege-3/about-us.html http://www.franciscoblaha.info/fisheries-information-systems  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  24  Networks and communication components  Radio  Radio systems (RFID, VHF, etc.) are used for many port processes: communication with ships, safety and  security operations, logistics management, etc.  Protocols Protocols are used to exchange information: EDI, API, authentication protocols, etc.  Servers  Numerous servers are used in the ports for different uses: web servers, application servers, proxy servers,  mail servers, virtual servers, printers, etc.  Networks  Different networks are set up in ports: VHF radios (Internet, WiMAX/WIFI, Satellite, ad-hoc networks,  VLAN/LAN, etc. They can be managed by different stakeholders at different levels.  Switches,  Routers, Hubs  Those components are used to forward packet in different manner between different networks.  Network security  To protect the network, firewall, IPS/IDS, PKI/MFA, Antivirus, SIEM and other security solutions are set up  in the port areas.  Cloud Ports can use some Cloud solutions to host some of its data, for example emails and shared folders.  Information and  data  Mandatory  declarations  Many declarations are mandatory for a ship to get into the port area, in respect with international,  European, national and local regulations. For instance, mandatory by the FAL Convention: passenger and  crew, vessel, cargo, border control, waste, security, health, travel information is required.  Commercial and  financial data  As any company, the ports deliver services to companies (shipping companies, etc.) and books different  services to their providers (ICT providers for example): financial and commercial are exchanges (money  transfer, invoicing, etc.).  Navigation data  Through satellite and navigation data (AIS, SafeSeaNet, etc.), the different stakeholders share navigation  data with the port (GPS position, information on maritime routes, etc.).  Control &  Authorisation  The Port Authorities and other national authorities control and deliver authorisation for vessel and cargo  movement.  Operational data  In order to plan and manage all the services (ship services, logistics services, etc.), operational data are  shared between the port stakeholders.  Safety and security systems  Many systems are set up in the port areas to ensure safety and security of people and port infrastructure:   Detection systems such as video-surveillance (CCTV), incident management systems, first response  centre systems, IDS (intrusion detection systems), abnormal behaviour detection systems;   Emergency communication systems;   Access control systems such as automatic gates, smart fencing systems, badging systems, access  monitoring and counting systems;   Traffic monitoring systems such as radar and electro-optic monitoring systems, train and truck traffic  monitoring systems;   Surveillance & inspection systems such as patrolling staff, oats, dogs and vehicles, detectors (fires, gas  leaks, nuclear, etc.), X-ray scanners;   Evacuation systems such as exit route guidance, muster points, guidance screens, emergency doors;   Identification & authentication systems such as face recognition systems, biometric systems, ID control  portable terminals; and  Alerting systems such as sirens and loudspeakers.  People  Port authority  staff  The Port Authority employs directly people, as statuary staff.  Permanent  commercial staff  The companies operating permanently in the ports employs people, as statuary staff (terminal operators,  permanent service providers, etc.).  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  25  IT/OT staff  The IT and OT staff, employed by the Port Authorities and private companies operates in different systems  to set up new solutions and maintain them (CISO, CIO, administrations, etc.).  External staff  Many other people operate in ports: port facility external staff, other service staff (third-parties), temporarily  authorized staff (contractors, taxi drivers, etc.).  Ship crews  When a ship arrives in a port, the crew’s members and their captain can use the different facilities of the  port (restaurant, bar, etc.).  Passengers The passengers pass through the port areas to go up in the cruise ships and ferries.  General public Usually, some port areas are opened to the public (tourism, research, etc.).  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  26  4. CYBERSECURITY THREATS AND  CHALLENGES  4.1 THREAT TAXONOMY  Ports face numerous cybersecurity challenges, some of them are quite generic within any IT  and OT environment, while others are quite specific to port ecosystems. Table 3 identifies the  possible impact of cybersecurity incidents for a port.  Table 3: Possible impacts for ports  Impacts Description  Shutdown of  operations, port  paralysis  The shutdown of the port operations is a much-feared impact by the port  ecosystem: if it lasts more than a few hours, it can harm strongly the  commercial operations (loss of money), the delivery of essential goods for a  nation, especially for the islands (food, fuel, etc.) as well as pose safety and  security issues (queue of several boats at the port entrance).  Human injuries or  death, Kidnapping  Ports must face high security and safety challenges, because many people  work in port areas can perform dangerous jobs (manipulation of cranes, of  dangerous goods, etc.) and because ports also must manage a quite large  passenger flow easy to predict (ferries, large cruise vessels, etc.).  Sensitive and critical  data theft  Port systems may hold critical information, whether it is personal information  (crew or passenger data), critical commercial information (location and  content of containers, competitive know-how) or National security information  (port being essential assets for a nation): the theft of these information can  have disastrous consequences.  Cargo and goods  stealing  Attackers can browse cargo and container lists to identify the most valuable  goods for black markets (to be stolen in the port or targeted for future piracy  attacks when the ship in at sea).  Illegal trafficking  The marine ecosystem is one of the largest playgrounds for organized crime:  ports are often used for illegal and criminal traffic (drugs, arms, prohibited  goods, most wanted people...).  Financial loss and  costs  A port can lose a lot of money due to the stop of operations or for repair  budget, in case of damage on its systems and infrastructure  Fraud and money  steal  As any major company, the financial systems of the ports can be  compromised to steal money from them. Indeed, especially for the biggest  ports, the port revenues are important: for example, the Port of Rotterdam  Authority’s revenue, in 2017, was € 712.1 million. Moreover, since ports are  the border between two States or continents, fraudulent companies can  falsify their customs declarations (VAT fraud).  Systems damages or  worst, destruction  Due to the high complexity of port systems and infrastructure, some of which  are critical (e.g. industrial systems that manage large amounts of dangerous  goods), damage or worse, destruction to those systems and infrastructure  has disastrous consequences for port operations and safety and security,  including people. Tankers (especially refined products and gas) are very  vulnerable to fire and explosion; local storage of flammables and chemicals is  also possibly massive.  Tarnished  reputation, loss of  competitiveness  Nowadays, ports are in an extremely competitive international ecosystem: the  slightest incident or problem on its activities and operations can damage its  reputation and lose customers who could direct their traffic to neighbouring  ports.  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  27  Environmental  disaster  As the port is the direct interface between the hinterland and the sea, an  environmental disaster in port areas can have disastrous consequences on  populations, fauna and flora and human infrastructure, at a very long distance  (oil spill, gas explosion, ocean pollution, shipwrecks, etc.).  Finally, main threats that port ecosystems can be exposed to are described in Figure 6: Threat  taxonomy and detailed in the Table 4: Threat description.  Figure 6: Threat taxonomy  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  28  Table 4: Threat description  Sub-categories Description  Eavesdropping, interception, hijacking  Interception of  emissions  Hackers can intercept the communication between the port and the different stakeholders (radio,  exchanges between ships and port, etc.).  Interception of  sensitive data  Communications can be listened, or the systems can be scanned to intercept sensitive data for  corporate espionage, state espionage or criminal crime and piracy espionage.  Man-in-the-middle,  session hijacking  In a Man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker relays and possibly alters the communication between two  parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.  With session hijacking hacker can exploit systems vulnerabilities to gain the same access rights than  the targeted clients (authentication cookies for instance)  Network  reconnaissance  and traffic  manipulation  The attacker scans the network passively until he can find an entry door which reveals to him internal  port network information (open ports, used protocols, etc.). With this knowledge, the attacker operates  to comprise the targeted systems.  Nefarious activity and abuse  Denial of service  (DoS)  A DoS attack can target different systems: RGPS, network, applications, IoT, etc. The objectives of  such attack is to lead to system unavailability and production disruption. Most DoS attacks are caused  by several sources at the same time (e.g. massive number of requests sent by different systems at the  same time) sent to the target system, also called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).  Malware  The penetration of malicious software in the port systems can lead to unwanted and unauthorised  actions, exploiting for some of them vulnerabilities to elevate the privileges which may cause damage  on port IT/OT systems, infrastructure, data integrity and operations.  There are different types of malware created for different purpose: ransomware, viruses, Trojan  horses, spyware, injection or web application attacks, etc.  Brute force  The brute force attack is used for gaining unauthorised access to an organisation’s resources (i.e.  data, systems, devices, etc.) through many attempts to guess the correct key or password. If the port  systems allow the utilisation of simple or defaults passwords, they can be especially vulnerable to this  kind of attacks.  Identity theft  A hacker can use, deliberately, the identity of a person involved in the port ecosystem, through for  example the stealing of credentials, to obtain financial gain, critical information, unauthorised access to  a system, etc. The “fake president” fraud, using identity of powerful people in the ecosystem, can have  serious impact.  Social engineering,  phishing  An attacker can use human interaction to obtain or compromise information about port organization  and port processes: by asking questions, by pretending to be another person, the attacker can piece  together information he needs to infiltrate the port systems. The attacker can ask several sources, by  relying on the information he can get from the first source to add to his credibility or sending malicious  links.  The phishing attacks is the most common social engineering attack: hackers use email or malicious  websites to solicit personal information by posing as a trustworthy organization.  Other forms exist: vishing attack (though voice communication), smishing attack (exploitation of SMS,  text, messages containing malicious link, etc.)  Targeted attacks  A targeted attack is a sophisticated and malicious attack specifically targeting the port, designed to  infiltrate its systems for different purposes. For instance, the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a  stealthy, diffuse and continuous attack over a long period of time designed to integrate malicious code  into targeted systems that perform specific tasks without being noticed.  Abuse and theft of  data  The hacker, through different means, steals sensitive data (personal data, freight tracking data,  operational data, etc.) and/or abuse the certificates used in the port operations (ship certificates, etc.).  Manipulation of  data  The hacker can manipulate data (financial data, navigation data, freight data, operations, etc.) in the  systems to fulfil its objectives.  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  29  Geo-localisation  signals  spoofing/jamming  The hacker can manipulate geo-localisation and navigation systems to change the trajectory of a  vessel provoke accidents for instance. Recent attacks using GPS spoofing and AIS tampering show  that this threat is important and must be considered, especially in the maritime context.43  Physical attacks  Fraud  A fraud is an intentional deception which aims to violate the civil law for different purposes. For  example, in the port ecosystem, through fake customs declarations, companies can carry out VAT  fraud.  Sabotage  A sabotage is a deliberation action realised to deteriorate or destroy the port systems and  infrastructure in order to weaken the port ecosystem (mostly for military, political or ideological  objectives). The sabotage can be external (from people not directly involved in the port operations) or  internal (from people directly involved in the port operations, such as resentful employees, etc.).  Vandalism  A vandalism is a voluntary act of destruction or deterioration of port assets without any specific reason.  In the port ecosystem, vandalism can be done on port IT and OT systems, ships or other vehicles, and  freight (goods, cargo, container, etc.).  Theft  An attacker can steal mobile devices (mobile phone, radios, etc.), fixed hardware, backups, printed  documents (list of goods, ships, etc.), freight (goods, cargo, container, etc.).  Unauthorised  access  An attacker can bypass access control systems to enter in the port areas, access to a ship or other  vehicles or OT end-devices (cranes, etc.). Moreover, unauthorised vehicles and ships can also entry to  the port areas.  Terrorism  Terrorism is defined as the use of intentional violence, generally against civilians, for political,  ideological and religious purposes  Hacktivism Hacktivism is the use of technology to promote a political agenda or a social change.  Coercion, extortion  or corruption  Extortion and coercion are defined as the use of violence or threats to obtain something, especially  money. Corruption is defined as a dishonest or illegal behavior targeting powerful people in the port  ecosystem such as bribery.  Piracy, illegal  crime, mafia  Piracy, illegal crime and mafia are illegal and unauthorised organizations who break the law to maintain  their power and their illegal activities (drug trafficking, cargo theft, etc.)  Unintentional damage  Use of unreliable  source  The use of unreliable source for the port systems (defective update, malicious software, etc.) can  cause systems to malfunction or spread. The NotPetya attack is a perfect example of this.  Erroneous  administration of  IT/OT systems  Even with good intentions, if the administrators of port systems are not enough trained and made  aware of the impacts of such errors, erroneous administration can impact strongly the port systems,  and if they are critical, directly the port operations.  Resulting from  penetration testing  In order to test the security level of port systems, the port may order penetration testing which, if not  carried out properly, could damage the systems.  Data deletion  By mistakes, employees or other stakeholders accessing port systems can delete critical information  which could have impact on port operations (for instance, freight or navigation information).  3rd party security  failure  The port systems are managed and maintained by different service providers: if their accesses are not  properly controlled, the security breaches of the 3rd party can directly affect the port systems (in case of  maintenance for instance).  Information  leakage  Employees can share, by mistakes or ignorance, sensitive data if there is an insufficient awareness  and data protection solution.  Failures and malfunctions  Failures or  malfunctions of  systems or devices  A failure or a malfunction of IT or OT systems or end-devices can occasionally happen, especially if  proper maintenance and compliance with the manuals and instructions during the exploitation is not  ensured, or if the proper functioning is not measured and monitored regularly.  43 See https://www.ship-technology.com/features/ship-navigation-risks/  https://www.ship-technology.com/features/ship-navigation-risks/  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  30  Vulnerabilities  exploitation of  systems or devices  Systems and devices may have vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers, particularly if  systems or devices are not patched on time or regularly monitored while corrective measures are put in  place in the meantime.  Failures and  malfunctions of  other stakeholders’  systems  The systems (navigation, communication and other systems) of other port actors (ships, other transport  actors, etc.) may have malfunctions or failures that may lead to the slowing or even stopping of port  operations. In addition, if those systems are linked to port systems, an attacker can exploit the  vulnerabilities of those systems as an entry door to port systems.  Main supply  systems  The port is dependent on different supply systems (electricity, fuel, etc.) which are essential to ensure  port operations: in the event of failure or interruption of those systems, port operations will be slowed  down or even stopped.  Failure or  disruption of  service providers  The port is dependent of many service providers, and some of them can be critical for the port  operations. A failure or disruption of these service providers can strongly impact the port operations.  Outages  Main supply  outages  Outages on main supply can have important impacts on the port operations: shutdown on the fuelling  supply leads to block the ships in the port, outage on the electricity networks impact the IT and OT  systems (for example, no communication possible between the port stakeholders, the refrigerated  storage can no longer maintain frozen goods)  Network outage  Port networks are essential for port operations and communication between the various actors (Port  Authority, terminal operators, ships, other authorities, etc.): failures in port networks can strongly affect  their operations.  Absence of  personnel  An incident could occur in a port area or at a time where port employees are not present and may have  significant consequences in port systems and infrastructure, especially in the case of increasing  automation of the port processes.  Disaster  Environmental  disaster  The threat of incident and unfavourable conditions such as fires, pollution, dust, corrosion, explosions,  which may cause physical damage to the port assets.  Natural disaster  The threat of natural disaster such as floods, lightning strikes, powerful waves, storms, heavy winds,  rain, which may cause damage to the port assets.  4.2 CYBERSECURITY CHALLENGES  Based on the desk research and data from interviews, the main challenges currently faced by  ports to implement cybersecurity measures are the following:   Lack of digital culture in the port ecosystem, in which some stakeholders are  still conservative. Indeed, new trends such as digitisation and IoT initiatives are  colliding with the conservative nature of the maritime industry, but are becoming  more and more adopted. In this context, the cyber security needs and best  practices of these initiatives are often not considered as a priority by stakeholders  who are first looking at technology adoption;   Lack of awareness and training regarding cybersecurity: ports ecosystem  used to only rely on safety and physical security to address risks, IT and OT bring  new challenges with regards to cybersecurity that port stakeholders often do not  fully anticipate and master;   Lack of time and budget allocated to cybersecurity: as a consequence of poor  awareness, especially of top management with regards to cybersecurity  challenges;   Lack of human resources and qualified people regarding cybersecurity  matters: the ports do not have enough people in IT and OT staff to manage all  projects, especially cybersecurity projects. Moreover, cybersecurity skills are very  specific and scarce which makes it difficult for small companies to hire adequately  qualified people on those topics;  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  31   Complexity of the port ecosystem due to the number and diversity of  stakeholders taking part in port operations: stakeholders within a port can be  numerous (up to 900 for the biggest ports). This ecosystem is built from  companies of various sizes, with various levels of cybersecurity capabilities and  can even be direct competitors among themselves. This makes the overall  cybersecurity control at port level difficult with heterogeneous level of controls  within the port. 44   Need to find a right balance between business efficiency and cybersecurity,  especially by guaranteeing the continuity of services while keeping IT and OT  secure, such as disconnecting critical systems and updating systems without any  business impacts;   Legacy of some systems and practices: especially regarding systems  managing navigation data and OT systems which can be very old and vulnerable  and for which extra cybersecurity measures must be enforced;   Lack of regulatory requirements regarding cybersecurity: the NIS Directive is  a first base to implement cybersecurity measures, but only concerns some of the  stakeholders in the maritime sector. This is not yet enough to ensure a proper  level of cybersecurity over the entire port ecosystem and to allow enough budgets  to be released to meet the requirements; and   Difficulty to stay up to date with the latest threats, especially in view of the  diversity of stakeholders operating in the ports, the processes, the systems  implemented and used and the rapid growth of innovations in the port ecosystem;   Technical complexity of port IT and OT systems: the port stakeholders use  different systems that are developed, managed and maintained by different teams  or entities. For example, they can be developed either by port IT teams, either by  third-parties or by IT providers. Moreover, they can be based on various  technologies. Finally, teams managing the security of IT and OT systems can also  be different. Therefore, the mapping of all port systems is difficult to define and to  maintain overtime;   IT and OT convergence and interconnection: Usually OT systems, more  vulnerable than IT systems, are protected because they are separated from IT  systems and networks. But, increasingly, IT and OT systems and networks,  become more and more dependent and interconnected, exposing OT systems to  higher risks;   Supply chain challenges. A number of cybersecurity challenges are associated  with the supply chain: lack of cybersecurity certifications for port products and  services, security risks related to supplier remote access to the port  networks/systems, long patching cycles for certain types of systems (e.g. ICS),  heterogeneity and high number of supplier landscape, difficulty to change supplier  services. Contractors do not have much control over the cybersecurity level of  their suppliers and, consequently, over the cyber risks they involve (supply chain  attacks);   Strong interdependencies between port systems and services and external  services from other sectors (e.g. energy) that introduce interdependency  cybersecurity risks; and   New cyber risks resulting from the digital transformation of ports: ports are  currently launching several projects to digitalize port processes, in particular with  the emergence of the SmartPort concept45, cyber risks should be taken into  account in the initial phases of those projects.  44 See: Port Management Information systems towards privatization.

Each scenario is associated with a list  of security measures, detailed later in Chapter 5, that will mitigate the risk of this scenario  occurring. The security measures are formalised in the form of, to take one example, “TP-01:  Network segmentation”, with “TP” as the group of the measures (in this case “Technical  Practices”), the associated number (in this case “01”) and the name of the measure (in this case  “Network segmentation”).  Scenario A – Compromising of critical data to steal high value cargo or allow illegal  trafficking through a targeted attack  This scenario is a sophisticated and targeted attack on port systems (Advanced Persistent  Threat): attackers must have in-depth knowledge of port systems and networks (social  engineering, network scan), port processes and port infrastructure (physical intrusion) to  perform cargo and container theft. An example of such an attack occurred at one of Antwerp's  port terminals in Belgium46.  Figure 7: Compromising of critical data to steal high value cargo or allow illegal trafficking  scenario  Impacts   Cargo and goods stealing   Illegal trafficking   Tarnished reputation  Assets affected Stakeholders involved   Cargo Community Systems (CCS)   Networks   Email   People   Terminal Operators   Police   Shipping and maritime freight companies   Senders and consignees  46 https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24539417  EXAMPLE OF  TARGETED  ATTACK  A large-scale  targeted attack has  already taken place  at one of Antwerp's  port terminals in  Belgium. A drug  cartel took control of  containers movement  and retrieved the  data needed to  collect it before legit  owner.  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24539417  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  33  Attack details   On the one hand, attackers identify and retrieve authentication data (credentials) to get access to useful  systems:  o Attackers gather information on port systems through social engineering  o Then they identify the targeted systems used for cargo and container management and identity  of the people using them  o Once systems and their operators/users are identified, attackers launch phishing attacks to  retrieve credentials to access to those systems   On the other hand, attackers install components to gain access remotely to the port network and bypass  network security:  o Attackers scan the port networks to find vulnerabilities to exploit them and gather information  o They install, if necessary, through physical intrusion, components to access remotely to the port  networks (wireless access point)  o To ensure constant access and adapt to each network and infrastructure changes in the long  term, they spy on networks   Attackers have now access to the freight tracking systems and other relevant port systems and they can  access critical information on containers they want to steal (localisation, content, pick-up code, etc.) from  outside of the port facilities.   Attackers can then steal the cargo before the official pickup date  Main security measures   OP-10: Security awareness raising program   OP-16: Creation of a Cybersecurity Operations Centre (SOC)   TP-01: Network segmentation   TP-02: Regular network scans   TP-08: Multi-factor authentication  Scenario B – Propagation of ransomware leading to a total shutdown of port operations  This scenario can be a targeted or a non-targeted attack (as collateral damage of targeted  attack on other companies through the ransomware propagation): the hackers can develop a  ransomware exploiting different vulnerabilities to spread it into the port networks and encrypt the  different systems and devices (workstations, servers, etc.), leading to the destruction of the  infected systems and the potential loss of backups (within servers which could be encrypted).  An example of a destructive ransomware-like malware attack was the large-scale incident  affecting the operations of Maersk47.  47 http://fortune.com/2017/06/27/maersk-petya-ransomware-cyber-attack/  EXAMPLE OF  RANSOMWARE  ATTACK  A large-scale  destructive and  ransomware-like  malware attack  (NotPetya) affected  Maersk. This attack  led a total paralysis of  the Maersk terminal  in Rotterdam, with  high risks of security  and safety incidents,  and port terminal  operations were  managed manually  for more than two  weeks.  http://fortune.com/2017/06/27/maersk-petya-ransomware-cyber-attack/  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  34  Figure 8: Propagation of ransomware leading to a total shutdown of port operations scenario  Impacts   Tarnished reputation   Financial loss and costs   Systems damage, or worst, destruction   Shutdown of port operations, port paralysis  Assets affected Stakeholders involved   IT systems   OT systems and networks   OT end-devices   People   Information and data   All port stakeholders  Attack details   The port updates one of its servers with a compromised update (ransomware) – other ways can be used  to introduce a ransomware on port systems, for example social engineering (phishing or USB-drop for  example) or bad network segregation (wide exposure to the Internet)   The ransomware spreads into the port’s network, using some unpatched vulnerabilities and lack of  network segmentation;   The ransomware is executed on port’s systems and devices and steal stored credentials   The ransomware executes a mechanism of elevation of privileges, using bad segregation of highly  privileged accounts   The ransomware spreads into other part of the port’s network by the same mechanism   The infected systems and devices are encrypted and cannot be used anymore   A ransom is required while all the systems and devices are down  Main security measures   OP-01: Endpoint protection strategy   OP-05: Define a vulnerability management process   OP-16: Creation of a Cybersecurity Operations Centre (SOC)   TP-01: Network segmentation  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  35   TP-13: Privilege Account Management (PAM)   TP-15: Anti-malware and anti-virus management   TP-23: Update management process   TP-24: Source of update verification   PS-15: Ensure cyber resilience of port systems   PS-17: Define a crisis management organization  Scenario C – Compromise of Port Community System for manipulation or theft of data  This scenario is a targeted attack on the systems used for the exchanges between all  stakeholders (usually the Port Community Systems). The objectives are to falsify the information  on port services to disrupt the operations or to modify some operations in the systems (implying  financial loss for the port). This scenario is realistic because those systems are exposed to all  port stakeholders by different ways (usually using different networks and systems, through VPN  access, or through the Internet, most of the time via machine-to-machine interconnections).  Indeed, those systems are increasingly automatically interconnected with external systems (via  API, EDI exchanges, etc.): third parties’ systems thus become an additional attack surface to  reach port systems.  Because these systems are different from one port to another, there can be multiple ways to set  up this attack: for example, if the Port Community Systems are exposed through a web  application, the attacker can exploit common vulnerabilities of web applications; if it is an  application developed internally by developers employed by the port and if standard security  development rules are not applied, specific vulnerabilities can be exploited; etc.  Figure 9: Compromise of Port Community System for manipulation or theft of data scenario  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  36  Impacts   Financial loss   Disruption of port operations   Accident (related to Dangerous goods management)  Assets affected Stakeholders involved   Port Community Systems (PCS)   Finance systems   ERP   Port Authority   Port Terminal Operators  Attack details   Depending on the PCS architecture and network exposition:  o If the PCS is exposed to third parties through a dedicated web interface, the attacker can exploit  common web application vulnerabilities to have access to the PCS (SQL injection, brute force  attack, exploitation of bad access rights segregation, etc.);  o If the PCS is automatically connected with external systems through data exchanges protocols  such as API or EDI protocols, the attacker can organise a man-in-the-middle attack by  intercepting the data exchanges and modifying them in case data exchanges are not secured  enough;  o Or if direct access to the PCS itself out of the port network is possible, the attacker can exploit  weak network security measures to have direct access to this system and use credentials he  may have stolen through social engineering;   Once the attacker has non-authorised access to the PCS with enough access rights, he can manipulate  data directly to the PCS (modification of the port operations, theft of critical data, deletion of data on some  operations, etc.)   The loss of integrity of the PCS data has many consequences: chaos in port operations, potential financial  loss for the port that loses information on operations preventing it from invoicing the operations carried out  or even accident if data related dangerous goods are manipulated or made unavailable.  Main security measures   PS-09: Project methodology including security assessments and checkpoints   OP-11: Strict control of third parties’ accesses   OP-16: Creation of a Cybersecurity Operations Centre (SOC)   OP-17: Regular network scans   OP-18: Perimeter security with filtering policy   OP-19: Perform regular cybersecurity audits   TP-01: Network segmentation   TP-05: Identity & Access Management (IAM) strategy   TP-08: Multi-factor authentication   TP-19: Secure mechanisms for machine-to-machine exchanges   TP-25: Log correlation and analysis systems  Scenario D – Compromise of OT systems creating a major accident in port areas  This scenario is specific to the OT world and the ICS specificities and is considered to be  realistic even no such attacks in ports are publicly known. Indeed, similar attacks occur in other  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  37  critical sectors, especially in the energy sector48. This kind of attack doesn’t need to be  generally sophisticated to be impactful and the major risks remain the connection with external  networks and systems, especially the Internet. The specificities of such attacks are the close  link between the physical and logical world: the attack usually begins in the logical world (from  the IT component) and has impacts in the physical world (damage to OT systems and end-  devices, safety and security incidents, etc.).  A port contains various OT networks, systems and end-devices used for different services and  operations and owned, managed and maintained by different stakeholders: cranes for vessel  loading and unloading in port terminals, bridges at the entry of the port to get vessels in and out,  systems in refrigerated warehouses to keep fragile foods at a safe temperature, the sensors  and systems used to transport, store and monitor dangerous goods, etc.  Figure 10: Compromise of OT systems creating a major accident in port areas scenario  48 See https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanmarcollagnier/2018/10/01/the-next-cyberattack-staying-ahead-of-hackers-is- becoming-a-greater-challenge/#3772585c4f0fy  Impacts   Shutdown of port operations, port paralysis   Systems damages, or worst, destruction   Human injuries or death   Financial loss and costs   Tarnished reputation and loss of competitiveness   Environmental disaster  Assets affected Stakeholders involved   OT systems and networks   OT end-devices   Mobile infrastructure   Fixed infrastructure   People   Port Authority   Port Terminal Operators   Service providers   Delivery chain  https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanmarcollagnier/2018/10/01/the-next-cyberattack-staying-ahead-of-hackers-is-becoming-a-greater-challenge/#3772585c4f0f https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanmarcollagnier/2018/10/01/the-next-cyberattack-staying-ahead-of-hackers-is-becoming-a-greater-challenge/#3772585c4f0f  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  38  Attack details   A maintenance laptop accessing OT control systems is compromised with a malicious code (either  through compromised USB drive or email, download of malicious software from the Internet, etc.)   The malicious code is spreading onto the OT networks and then the OT systems when the laptop  connects to it   If the Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are sophisticated (IoT, remote server, etc.), the attackers can  deploy mechanisms to command the ICS remotely   If not, the ICS code is modified to execute predefined commands contained in the malicious code   The OT end-devices, such as cranes or bridges, move erratically or unexpectedly   This can cause security and safety incident leading to damage or destruction of port infrastructure, injury  or death, etc.  Security measures   OP-01: Define an endpoint protection strategy   OP-09: Develop specific and mandatory cybersecurity training courses for some key  population   OP-12: Clearly define all relevant aspects of the partnership with third parties,  include security measures   OP-16: Creation of a Cybersecurity Operations Centre   OP-21 and OP-22: IT and OT physical protection   TP-11: Installation and configuration policy   TP-14: Dedicated administration network   TP-30: Network segmentation between IT and OT systems   TP-29 and TP-31: Consider OT and IoT systems into all the security measures and  set up specific security measures   TP-25: Log correlation and analysis systems  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  39  5. SECURITY MEASURES  5.1 SECURITY MEASURES CATEGORISATION  Development of security measures for ports was one of the focal points of this study. The  objective is to provide guidelines and recommendations for Port Authorities, private companies  operating in ports and other stakeholders involved in the port ecosystem to help prevent or  properly respond to potential cyberattacks on the port systems.  To define the categorisation of these measures, the study relied on identified cyberattack  scenarios in part 4.3 as well as security measures from policies and standards listed in section  2.2.2 and common frameworks for cybersecurity like the Reference document on security  measures for Operators of Essential Services49, ISO 27001/250 or NIST51.  Finally, a list of 22 security domains have been defined to classify all security measures in  relation with ports. To organise the domains in a logical manner, they were classified into three  main groups:   Policies   Organisational practices   Technical practices  As the target audience of this report is eligible to fall under the provisions of the NIS Directive as  Operators of Essential Services, the following measures have been developed to map to the  measures proposed in the Reference document on security measures for Operators of Essential  Services. Still, a few exceptions do exists, most notably Cloud security, Machine-to-machine  security and OT & Industrial control systems security, which indicates that a more sector-  focused approach may be pertinent to address the specificities of the maritime/port sector.  5.2 POLICIES  It is essential that ports define policies and governance in regard to IT and OT, enforcing  cybersecurity best practices, especially for most critical assets, with a risk-based approach.  5.2.1 Security policy and organisation  Security measures to implement and maintain up-to-date an information system security policy  (ISSP)   PS-01: Write and implement an information systems security policy (ISSP) which  describes all organisational and technical means and procedures, including topics related to  the OT environment. This ISSP must be approved by the port's top management team to  guarantee the high-level endorsement of the policy. Key elements of the ISSP can be  integrated in the Port Facility Security Plan required by the ISPS Code.   PS-02: Enforce security governance of both IT and OT environments through the ISSP by  describing the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder (Port Authority, terminal  operators, service providers, suppliers, etc.).  49 See http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/image/document/2018- 30/reference_document_security_measures_0040C183-FF20-ECC4-A3D11FA2A80DAAC6_53643.pdf  50 See https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html  51 See https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/image/document/2018-30/reference_document_security_measures_0040C183-FF20-ECC4-A3D11FA2A80DAAC6_53643.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/image/document/2018-30/reference_document_security_measures_0040C183-FF20-ECC4-A3D11FA2A80DAAC6_53643.pdf https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  40   PS-03: Share this ISSP with all stakeholders involved in port operations, or, if more  relevant a light version underlying each party responsibilities towards cybersecurity at port  level.   PS-04: Review annually the ISSP by considering the results of cyber security tests and  risk analysis to tackle new threats and risks.  5.2.2 Risk and Threats Management  Security measures to identify and manage continuously risks and threats related to the port  ecosystem.   PS-05: Adopt a risk-based approach to build the port cybersecurity strategy and set up a  continuous improvement process to ensure that the risks identified are under control and that  new risks are properly identified in a timely manner. Ensure identified cyber risks are  considered in safety and security plans to align cybersecurity with physical security and safety  (in particular, through the Port Facility Security Assessment required by the ISPS Code).   PS-06: Conduct and regularly update risk analysis to identify risk and threats related to the  port ecosystem. In particular, risk analysis must be conducted for new projects (SmartPort  initiatives such as Big Data, IoT, blockchain, etc.).   PS-07: Set up security indicators and assessment methods to evaluate the compliance of  the port systems and processes to the ISSP and risk management performance, by involving  several stakeholders when relevant.52   PS-08: Set up a threat intelligence process to watch continuously for vulnerabilities,  identify new risks and threats and deploy actions to mitigate them.  This measure can be improved by developing collaborative private-public initiatives of  sharing information on threat intelligence at European level.53  5.2.3 Security and privacy by design  Security measures that should be applied from the first stages of systems development and  during the development lifecycle in order to increase by design the security levels of any  solutions and applications, to protect critical data and ensure the privacy of personal data.   PS-09: Develop a project methodology including security assessments and checkpoints,  including for agile projects (risk analysis, architecture security review, security tests, security  approval, etc.) for new and existing projects, considering the criticality and exposure of the  system.

See  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283489805_Performance_Indicators_and_Port_Authority_Management  53 As an example, in the US, The Maritime and Port Security Information Sharing & Analysis Center was created in 2015.  See https://mpsisao.org/about  54 Compliance with the GDPR is essential for ports, because major attacks against the extraction of personal data have  already taken place in the maritime sector (see Table 11).  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283489805_Performance_Indicators_and_Port_Authority_Management https://mpsisao.org/about/  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  41  5.2.4 Asset

Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan).   PS-16: Define important parameters for port’s business continuity, such as a recovery time  objective (RTO), recovery point objective (RPO), maximum tolerable outage (MTO) and  minimum business continuity objective (MBCO).   PS-17: Define a crisis management organization by formalising a specific policy and by  setting up the associated crisis management process, including all the port stakeholders.   PS-18: Ensure the efficiency of recovery procedures by setting up annual training  exercises, making sure that all critical port stakeholders (local authorities, Port Authorities,  terminal operators, service providers, etc.) are involved as much as possible, and by  formalizing post-exercise reports.  5.3 ORGANISATIONAL PRACTICES  Ports shall define relevant practices and processes regarding IT and OT management, to be  followed by all port employees or more specifically by IT and OT teams in their daily operations  within the port ecosystem.  5.3.1 Endpoints protection and lifecycle management  Security measures related to the protection of IT end devices such as laptops, desktops,  tablets, mobile phones.  

port to define categories of  incidents and the potential impacts by using the results of risk analysis, threat intelligence,  previous incident history, discussion with other ports, etc.  56 Indeed, every day, most of ports experience multiple vulnerability scans on public IPs from hackers: to thwart these  attacks, ports must remediate vulnerabilities before the hackers find them. See  https://piernext.portdebarcelona.cat/en/technology/are-ports-prepared-to-deal-with-threats-from-hackers  57 For example, the port of Rotterdam appointed in 2016 a Port Cyber Resilience Officer:  https://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/news-and-press-releases/port-of-rotterdam-appoints-port-cyber-resilience-officer  58 For example, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore have collaborated with the Singapore Shipping Association  and Polytechnic to develop a new Maritime Cybersecurity Training course of maritime personnel:  https://smartmaritimenetwork.com/2019/05/16/maritime-cybersecurity-operations-centre-opens-in-singapore  59 See an example of awareness program in the EMSA website: http://www.emsa.europa.eu/implementation- tasks/maritime-cybersecurity.html  https://piernext.portdebarcelona.cat/en/technology/are-ports-prepared-to-deal-with-threats-from-hackers/ https://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/news-and-press-releases/port-of-rotterdam-appoints-port-cyber-resilience-officer https://smartmaritimenetwork.com/2019/05/16/maritime-cybersecurity-operations-centre-opens-in-singapore/ http://www.emsa.europa.eu/implementation-tasks/maritime-cybersecurity.html http://www.emsa.europa.eu/implementation-tasks/maritime-cybersecurity.html  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  43   OP-14: Define a policy and procedures for incident detection and reaction including the  description of the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder of the port or state level (if  applicable), as well as the coordination method and communicate this to all relevant parties.   OP-15: Improve and keep these procedures up-to-date by testing them through training  exercise, and identification of new feared events.   OP-16: Consider the setup of a Cybersecurity Operations Centre (SOC) including IT and  OT environments to support security and cyber incidents.

CONCLUSIONS  As ports undergo their digital transformation, cybersecurity should be viewed not only as a key  factor to be considered in terms of keeping pace with the technical evolutions but also as an  enabler of further developments and automation. Considering the complexity of both the port  landscape in terms of involved stakeholders and communication flows and system interactions,  but also in terms of the evolving IT and OT environment, this is by no means an easy or  straightforward endeavour.  This report aims to serve as a reference document for stakeholders involved in port  cybersecurity. The previous chapters provide an overview of the port landscape, including the  policy context, a high-level reference model and a comprehensive asset taxonomy and discuss  their cybersecurity dimension by listing the existing threats and security challenges and by  describing some key attack scenarios. Finally, the present document provides a list of practical  baseline security measures to strengthen cybersecurity in port operations and systems.  Still, people responsible for port cybersecurity, i.e. CISOs, CIOs, IT Managers etc. from Port  Authorities and Terminal Operators are encouraged to go beyond the good practices proposed  in the present document and address additional topics as well, such as:   Awareness raising about cybersecurity at board and staff level; the former will likely  increase the strategic attention paid to cybersecurity risks and result in higher  investment and more resources to mitigate them, while the latter is essential in  ensuring cybersecurity in day-to-day operations in ports   Improved information sharing amongst port operators (port authorities, terminal  operators etc.) and between port operators and other maritime stakeholders, such as  shipping companies. Sharing information on threats, incidents and good practices is  key in improving the overall cybersecurity posture of the sector and several proven  models, such as ISACs, can be adapted to provide tangible results.   Addressing cybersecurity in the supply chain. While a holistic approach to address  this complex issue is not an easy task, several good practices can be adopted or  investigated, including cybersecurity certification of critical components, well-defined  supplier obligations for the entire lifecycle of products/services (e.g. vulnerability  management, patching), specific provisions for supply chain management etc.   Integrating interdependencies cybersecurity risks in the overall cyber risk  management process to account for the multiple and complex interconnections of  ports with other sectors.

Each port has its own governance and  infrastructure model which depends on services delivered, local authorities governance,  challenges linked to port geographical situation and national regulations. Ports play a crucial  role at different levels for many sectors and have been the successful pioneers in Europe for  interconnecting the different types of transport. As a main vehicle for European imports and  exports (food, commodities, etc.) with the rest of the world, ports enable also trade and contacts  between all European nations. Moreover, ports are important nodes for passengers and  vehicles transportation (inter and extra-EU) and play a key role in European fishing activity.  Ports ensure also the security and the supply of energy, vital for all EU Member States (fuel,  electricity, gas, etc.). Finally, ports have strong impact on society as a source of employment  and taking responsibility for pollution prevention.  Additionally, at the European Union level ports are a cornerstone of the development of the  Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T). Moreover, they are at the heart of the maritime  ecosystem and as such, key to promote a maritime ecosystem with fair competition, non-  discriminatory access to services and efficient use. In May 2013, the European Commission  adopted a set of initiatives to increase the competitiveness and the attractiveness of the TEN-T  ports: 329 European ports were identified as key ports63.  Table 5: Key statistics about ports role in the European Union  Key Roles Key Statistics  Port, as a main  gateway for the  European trade  Almost 90% of the EU’s external freight trade is seaborne, short sea shipping represents one third of intra- EU exchanges in terms of ton-kilometres and 74% of EU trade goes by ship.64  Importance in  worldwide trade  Europe counts 3 ports in the top 15 world’s biggest ports: Rotterdam (11th), Hamburg (14th), Antwerp (15th);  all three representing12% of goods handled at a global scale and 20% for EU.65  Key role in energy  sector  EU ports have a key role in energy sector66 : they are energy hubs for conventional and renewable  energies and 25% of the ports have more than 50% of their traffic linked to energy commodities67  Passenger and  vehicle transport  Each year, more than 400 million passengers embark and disembark at European ports.68  Social issues 1.5 million workers are employed in European ports69.  Fishing ports  EU is the 4th largest producer worldwide for fish, counting for about 5% of global fisheries. EU trade (i.e.  imports and exports) has increased over the past few years, reaching 29.1 billion € in 2014. EU is a net  importer of fisheries products and trade between EU countries is very significant and plays an essential  role in the EU’s fisheries trade.70  63 See https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/modes/maritime/ports/doc/2014-04-29-brochure-ports.pdf  64 See https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime_en  65 See https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime/infographics_en  66 See https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime/ports/ports_en  67 See https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics- explained/index.php/Maritime_ports_freight_and_passenger_statistics#Liquid_bulk_made_up_37.4.C2.A0.25_of_the_total_cargo_handled  68 See https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime_en  69 See https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime/ports/ports_en  70 See https://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/sites/fisheries/files/docs/body/pcp_en.pdf  https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/modes/maritime/ports/doc/2014-04-29-brochure-ports.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime_en https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime/infographics_en https://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/sites/fisheries/files/docs/body/pcp_en.pdf  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  55  The ranking of biggest European ports is different depending on the activities: the biggest ports  related to freight activities are mainly centralised in the North of Europe (Netherlands, Belgium  or Germany for the Top 3), while those related to passenger transport activities are mainly  situated in the South of Europe or in the Nordics. The EU fishing ports are not so big in  comparison with the world fishing ports – only 7 European ports are in the Top 100 biggest  fishing ports - and are mainly located in the Nordics.

Indeed, ports  increasingly rely on IT and OT to be more competitive (through standardization, digitalization  and automation), adapt to policies and regulations (especially for administrative procedures or  environment protection) and adapt to new maritime assets.  Table 7: Example of stakes leading to digital transformation for ports  Stake Explanation  Integrated logistic  chain development  In order to boost its attractiveness and performance, ports have to offer to their clients the most efficient  global and integrated logistic chain: they provide value-added services that includes integrated services.  For example, some ports now offer the service of filling in customs declarations on behalf of maritime  companies.72 The port systems become then a central point for data exchange for all port ecosystem  stakeholders.  Environmental  stakes  In April 2018, at the 22nd session of Marine Environment Protection Committee, IMO adopted a strategy to  reduce pollution such as gas emission in the maritime sector. In parallel, ESPO presented its annual  Environmental Report for 2018 at the Greenport Congress, including performance benchmark indicators  and the Top 10 Environmental priorities of the ports. New technologies will help ports to reach their  objectives in terms of sustainability.73  Digitalization and  standardisation of  administrative  procedures  Administrative procedures related to the maritime ecosystem are often complex and time-consuming.  Several initiatives have been launched to digitalise these procedures and set up modern electronic data  systems. In a 2009 European Commission Communication, a true “European maritime transport space  without barriers” is established to improve electronic transmission74. The notion of “single window” has  also developed to streamline the access to the various ICT systems from a unique portal for the whole port  community. Other “single window” systems are developed by EMSA at National (NSW) and EU level  (EMSW).75  New generation of  vessels  Two stakes are related with the construction of new generation of vessels and will impact strongly the  ports: the vessels are built to be bigger and more and more connected.  The new generation of vessels are built to be more connected to reduce cost and security issues. The ship  builders are already designing the autonomous ships that could go to sea with strong impacts on ports IT  environments.76  Ports must be increasingly innovative and find ways to address those stakes while keeping their  operations safe and secured. This is one of the reasons why the concept of “Smart Port”77 has  emerged. Through this concept, we can find different types of innovations and initiatives,  detailed in Table 8: Detailed innovations that ports set up linked with “Smart Port” concept: IoT,  blockchain, cloud, automation, artificial intelligence and many more.78 Those innovations bring  also new stakes in terms of cybersecurity as they place IT and OT at heart of ports operations.  72 For example, in the port of Rotterdam, the customs declarations can be filled in through the Port Community System:  https://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/doing-business/services/service-range/port-customs  73 See https://www.espo.be/news/espo-publishes-environmental-report-2018-top-10-en  74 See Modernisation of Port Authorities' Management Information Systems (PMIS), Jonas Mendes Constante – Fundación  Valenciaport, Martina Grzancic – Luka Kopler  75 See http://www.emsa.europa.eu/related-projects/emsw.html  76 See https://www.rolls-royce.com/~/media/Files/R/Rolls-Royce/documents/customers/marine/ship-intel/rr-ship-intel-aawa-8pg.pdf  77 See SmartPort definition: http://parisinnovationreview.com/articles-en/what-is-a-smart-port  78 See Port Digitalization with Open Data: Challenges, Opportunities, and Integrations:  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321853773_Digital_transformation_in_maritime_ports_analysis_and_a_game_the oretic_framework  https://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/doing-business/services/service-range/port-customs https://www.espo.be/news/espo-publishes-environmental-report-2018-top-10-en http://www.emsa.europa.eu/related-projects/emsw.html https://www.rolls-royce.com/~/media/Files/R/Rolls-Royce/documents/customers/marine/ship-intel/rr-ship-intel-aawa-8pg.pdf http://parisinnovationreview.com/articles-en/what-is-a-smart-port https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321853773_Digital_transformation_in_maritime_ports_analysis_and_a_game_theoretic_framework https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321853773_Digital_transformation_in_maritime_ports_analysis_and_a_game_theoretic_framework  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  57  Table 8: Detailed innovations that ports set up linked with “Smart Port” concept  Innovations Details  Internet of Things  (IoT)  Various ports are studying or launching an IoT project to improve their competitiveness and their performance  and monitor their infrastructure to prevent security or safety incidents. Applied to maritime traffic surveillance,  infrastructure management and terminal operations on goods or passengers, an IoT platform could monitor the  port environment and operations, collect data to optimize processes and improve the decision-making process.  This would be possible through the implementation of sensors and RFID technology on port assets.79  More specifically, the port of Rotterdam has launched his own IoT platform by implementing different sensors  on buoys, walls and quays to allow port actors to identify the best timing and location for a ship to dock.80  Cloud  In order to coordinate all the stakeholders of their ecosystem and enable an efficient and real-time exchange of  data in a centralised way, some ports have recently launched Cloud projects to improved operations efficiency  and develop “Port Single Window” systems, central systems to manage all data exchange related to the port  operations and mandatory declarations.  For example, SOGET, a public-private partnership between the Port Community of Le Havre, Port of Le Havre  Authority and French Customs, in charge of developing the e-Maritime Port Single Window, has developed a  partnership with a cloud provider to base its solution on Cloud technology.81  Big Data  The entire port ecosystem manages everyday a vast amount of data for different objectives (data related to  monitor the movements of ships and the movements of cargo or container, to manage the port infrastructure,  etc.). Today, in most ports, the potential of the data is not yet fully exploited because the data are often used in  silos without correlating them. Some ports are currently launching Big Data projects to improve port operations,  processes, security and safety. For example, collecting and correlating information on ship positions arriving,  leaving or staying in ports and weather can enable to prevent accidents.82  For example, the port of Valencia has recently launched a Big data project to improve the efficiency of terminal  logistics to optimize the operations and set up an advanced dashboard.83  Blockchain  Seaborne trade is very inclined to malicious activities such as organized crime: a real need exists today in port  ecosystem for data trust and privacy, especially for container management, that it is accentuated by the  complex panorama of stakeholders included in the logistic chain of a port. Indeed, to transport a container, it  can involve more than 30 different parties, with an average of 200 interactions between them. The application  of blockchain on port operations and processes seems to be an excellent way for ports to bring trust and  privacy with smart contracts.  Indeed, the port of Antwerp has recently collaborated with a blockchain start-up to develop a solution adapted  to the port processes concerning certificates (for instance, phytosanitary certificates).84  Automation  One of the key success factors for the increase of the competitiveness, the efficiency and the performance of a  port is to automate as much as possible port operations and processes. Numerous innovations are developed  today with ports to automate these processes at all levels. For example, ports are deploying aircraft and  aquatics drones or also automated gates, studies are being carried out to make cranes autonomous, etc.  For instance, the ports of Rotterdam and Amsterdam have authorized aerial and marine drones in their areas  to improve the port operations (maintenance inspections, management of incidents and emergencies, etc.)85  Prediction and  analytics through  artificial  intelligence  In parallel of projects of automation, Big Data, IoT, etc., artificial intelligence can bring an in-depth analysis of  the data related to all port operations and processes and deploy a predictive model of the behaviour of port  operations. For example, the artificial intelligence can give to the terminal operators a dynamic forecast of the  workload of their workers, such as truck drivers or dockworkers that evolve according to the changes in the  port conditions and environment, such as real ship arrival time or saturation of access routes.86  The port of Antwerp has recently launched a data science project to better optimize the operational chain,  anticipate bottlenecks and improve decision-making process.87  79 See https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261343481_Intelligent_ports_based_on_Internet_of_Things and  https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2016/04/01/the-hamburg-port-authoritys-impressive-iot-project/#50f7ac776c64  80 See https://www.alliancy.fr/a-laffiche/internet-objets-mtom/2018/04/04/rotterdam-connecte-entierement-son-port  81 See https://news.microsoft.com/fr-fr/2018/10/15/soget-et-microsoft-un-partenariat-strategique-pour-une-digitalisation- securisee-des-ports-francais-et-mondiaux/  82 See https://www.patersonsimons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TMS_SmartPort_InsightBee_Report-to- GUIDE_01.02.18.pdf  83 See https://www.big-data-value.eu/pilot/transforming-transport-ports-valencia/  84 See https://www.i-scoop.eu/blockchain-smart-port-project-case-container-release-port-antwerp and  https://www.portofantwerp.com/en/news/antwerp-blockchain-pilot-pioneers-secure-and-efficient-document-workflow  85 See https://www.portofamsterdam.com/en/port-amsterdam/drones-amsterdam-port-area and  https://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/news-and-press-releases/water-drone-is-rotterdams-latest-port-innovation  86 See https://piernext.portdebarcelona.cat/en/technology/artificial-intelligence-ports-are-beginning-to-take-up-positions  87 See https://en.blog.businessdecision.com/how-is-the-port-of-antwerp-optimising-logistics-with-data-science  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261343481_Intelligent_ports_based_on_Internet_of_Things https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2016/04/01/the-hamburg-port-authoritys-impressive-iot-project/#50f7ac776c64 https://news.microsoft.com/fr-fr/2018/10/15/soget-et-microsoft-un-partenariat-strategique-pour-une-digitalisation-securisee-des-ports-francais-et-mondiaux/ https://news.microsoft.com/fr-fr/2018/10/15/soget-et-microsoft-un-partenariat-strategique-pour-une-digitalisation-securisee-des-ports-francais-et-mondiaux/ https://www.patersonsimons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TMS_SmartPort_InsightBee_Report-to-GUIDE_01.02.18.pdf https://www.patersonsimons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TMS_SmartPort_InsightBee_Report-to-GUIDE_01.02.18.pdf https://www.big-data-value.eu/pilot/transforming-transport-ports-valencia/ https://www.i-scoop.eu/blockchain-smart-port-project-case-container-release-port-antwerp/ https://www.portofantwerp.com/en/news/antwerp-blockchain-pilot-pioneers-secure-and-efficient-document-workflow https://www.portofamsterdam.com/en/port-amsterdam/drones-amsterdam-port-area https://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/news-and-press-releases/water-drone-is-rotterdams-latest-port-innovation https://piernext.portdebarcelona.cat/en/technology/artificial-intelligence-ports-are-beginning-to-take-up-positions/ https://en.blog.businessdecision.com/how-is-the-port-of-antwerp-optimising-logistics-with-data-science/  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  58  C ANNEX: CATEGORIES OF  PORT STAKEHOLDERS  Table 9: Categories of port stakeholders  Categories Sub-Categories Description  Port Authority  The Port Authority, a governmental or almost governmental public authority, sitting at the heart of the  interactions between all stakeholders, in collaboration with other local and national authorities, is  responsible of maintaining and developing the port infrastructure and the transport infrastructure, ensuring  the global safety and security of port and ship operations through the harbour master. Moreover, the Port  Authority oversees some controls and inspections in respect with national, European and international  legislations.  Port Terminal  Operators  Terminal operators, usually private companies, are responsible for maintaining security and safety on the  land they rent from the Port Authority and managing the services related to terminal operations (loading  and unloading cargo or passengers for instance).  Vessels related  stakeholders  Shipowners and crew  The shipowner is in charge of equipping and exploiting a commercial  vessel, hiring licensed crew and captains to operate the ship.  Flag state  The flag state of a commercial vessel is the jurisdiction under whose laws  the vessel is registered: the flag state enforced regulations such as  inspection, certification, and security requirements. Each vessel operates  and navigates under the law of its flag state that list and enforce  international conventions (IMO conventions notably).  Ship insurance  Ship insurance covers the loss or damage of ships, cargo, terminals, and  any transport by which the property is transferred, acquired, or held  between the points of origin and the destination.  Delivery chain  stakeholders  Shipping and maritime  freight companies  These private companies are in charge of transferring and forwarding  freight from a place to another, by bookings services for all kind of transport  (maritime transport, railways, etc.).  Ferries and cruise lines  These private companies oversee offering to passengers’ transport  services through ferries and cruise  Fisheries  According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, a  fishery is typically defined in terms of the \"people involved, species or type  of fish, area of water or seabed, method of fishing, class of boats, and  purpose of the activities or a combination of the foregoing features\".  Hinterland liaisons  This category relates to all stakeholders, private as public, interacting in the  multi-modal ecosystem of the port: waterways, roads, railways, etc.  Freight sender and  consignee  The sender is the person, company or organisation, at the origin of the  forwarding of a good or other item which can be sent by sea.  The consignee is the receiver of this good, also a person, a company or an  organisation.  Maritime agent  Also called ship agent, the maritime agent acts as a representative of the  shipowner to fulfil the requirements for each port the ship visits.  Service providers  Ship services providers  A ship can book different services to the port. For some of these services,  the port delegates these services to external companies (e.g. refuelling).  Dockers  The dockers are employed by private companies – which could be terminal  operators – to realise the terminal operations (e.g. loading and unloading  vessel cargo).  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  59  Security providers  To ensure security in ports, private companies operates and maintains  security systems in the port (such as CCTV).  Infrastructure providers  A port can contract private companies to operate in the port to ensure the  installation of port infrastructure and its maintenance.  Ship repair services  Shipping companies or shipowners can book ship repair services to the port  for damage cases of all kinds, delivered by different actors depending on  their expertise (propulsion systems, governors, etc.).  ICT integrators  To support the port processes and operations, ports use daily Information  and Communication Technology (ICT) systems which are, for most of them,  set up, operated and maintained by private specialised companies in IT and  Communications development.  Classification societies  As a non-governmental organisation, classification societies set standards  for the construction and operation of ships and offshore structures and  certify that the construction of a ship complies with those standards by  delivering a certificate.  Other entities  The port ecosystem includes many secondary actors, the most important of which are as follows:  - Banks: As in any business, ports deliver different services that they invoice to shipping companies and  other stakeholders. Banks are therefore a key factor in these services  - Organisations and associations, created for different objectives and at different levels. For instance, the  ESPO (European Sea Ports Organisations) is acting as the main interface between European seaports  and European institutions, IAPH (International association of Ports and Harbours) is the global trade  association for seaports worldwide, the IPCSA (International Port Community System Association, etc.)  - Innovation, Research and Education stakeholders: the port ecosystem is composed by different actors  acting strongly in favour of innovation (such as start-accelerators, with, for example PortXL, alliances for  developing Smart Port), research (research and expertise centres) and education (universities).  Other commercial providers  Other bodies  Customs  The customs authorities are responsible of the administration and the  application of national and international customs law through the collection  of duties and taxes, in particular for importation, exportation, movement or  storage of goods in ports.  Fishery Control  The fishery control authorities are in charge to ensure the fishing of good  quality and sustainable seafood by defining controls and requirements that  the fishing industry must follow. For instance, they control the permit for a  vessel to fish, the origin of the fish catches, etc.  Coast Guards  Coast Guards are maritime organizations in charge of ensuring navigation  safety and security and enforcing the law on the maritime territory under the  responsibility of the country.  Border Control  The border control authorities are responsible of taking measures to  monitor the state borders and to regulate the movement of people, animals  and goods. In the EU, with Schengen agreement, the crews and  passengers are controlled only once when they come from a non-EU  country.  Port State Control  The Port State Control is responsible of making inspections of foreign ships  (with a flag state different from the port) in ports to verify the compliance of  the ships with international and national regulations. The Port State Control  can take actions against non-compliant ships (sanctions, etc.).  Civil Security, police and  rescue at sea  The civil security and police authorities are responsible of law enforcement  and of deploying measures to fight against criminals (terrorism, organized  crime, etc.). Each port has its own local civil security and police. According  to local and national specificities, they can also oversee rescue at sea to  assist people and vessels in case of distress situations.

It enables import and  exports of goods, supply in energy, trade within the European Union and transport of  passengers and vehicles. This activity relies on more than 1 2001 seaports within the European  Union, each with different organisation, interests, challenges and activities.  The global digitalization trend and recent policies and regulations require ports to face new  challenges with regards to information and communication technology (ICT). Ports tend to rely  more on technologies to be more competitive, comply with some standards and policies and  optimize operations. This brings new stakes and challenges in in the area of cybersecurity, both  in the Information Technologies (IT) and Operation Technologies (OT) worlds.  This report identifies those challenges, in relation to critical operations, stakeholder’s ecosystem  and assets identification. It then lists the main threats posing risks to the port ecosystem and  describes key cyberattack scenarios that could impact them.  This approach allowed the identification of security measures that ports shall put in place to  better protect themselves from cyberattack. The main measures identified are described below  and intend to serve as good practices for people responsible for cybersecurity implementation in  Port Authorities and Terminal Operators (e.g. CISOs, CIOs etc.):   Define a clear governance around cybersecurity at port level, involving all  stakeholders involved in port operations. Indeed, many companies are involved in  port operation (port operators, Port Authority, pilotage company, shipping  companies, etc.), it is crucial to ensure they are all involved in cybersecurity  matters and aware about how they participate to the global port operation security.   Raise awareness of cybersecurity matters at port level and infuse a cybersecurity  culture. Indeed, the maritime sector is historically very aware of safety and security  matters, but it seems cybersecurity is not fully integrated yet in stakeholders’  minds. This measure shall be combined with training, to ensure proper  understanding of cybersecurity matters and ability to enforce it in daily operations.   Enforce the technical cybersecurity basics, like network segregation, updates  management, password hardening, segregation of rights, etc. In the context of OT,  with legacy systems that usually cannot be updated, network segregation and  password protection are key to ensure a correct level of cybersecurity.   Consider security by design in applications, especially as ports use many systems,  some of which are opened to third parties for data exchange. Any vulnerability on  those systems can be a gate to compromise the port systems.   Enforce detection and response capabilities at port level to react as fast as  possible to any cyberattack before it impacts port operation, safety or security.  Ports can rely on simple detection measures such as alerts when a specific action  is done (authentication attempt on a very critical asset for example) or search for  Indicators of Compromise (IOC), or on more comprehensive, using machine  learning to correlate information and identify compromising patterns. Such  initiatives have already started to rise within ports ecosystem2.  1 See https://www.globaltrademag.com/european-ports  2 See https://www.sauronproject.eu/  https://www.globaltrademag.com/european-ports/ https://www.sauronproject.eu/  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  10  1. INTRODUCTION  The European Union has identified ports as critical infrastructure and defined the ports as “any  specified area of land and water, with boundaries defined by the Member State in which the port  is situated, containing works and equipment designed to facilitate commercial maritime transport  operations” in Directive 2005/65/EC3.  Ports play a crucial role at different levels for many sectors and have been the successful  pioneers in Europe for interconnecting the different types of transport. As a main vehicle for  European imports and exports (food, commodities, etc.) with the rest of the world, ports enable  also trade and contacts between all European nations. Moreover, ports are important nodes for  passengers and vehicles transportation (inter and extra-EU) and play a key role in European  fishing activity.  For a number of years, ports have been undergoing a digital transformation in order to meet  emerging challenges, optimise existing processes and introduce new capabilities, such as  automation and real-time monitoring of operations4,5,6,7,8,9. This digitalisation has been centred  on the interconnectivity of Information Technology (IT) and Operation Technology (OT) assets  and the introduction of new technological enablers, such as cloud computing, big data and  Internet of Things (IoT).  This digital transformation has also led to a change in the sector’s cyber risk profile, as evident  by the proliferation of cybersecurity incidents in ports over the past few years, such as the  cyberattack in Antwerp port10, the NotPetya Ransomware incident and its impact on  Maersk11 and the wave of ransomware attacks in Port of Barcelona12 and San Diego13.  Indeed, this transition to the future and to concepts, such as Smart Ports, brings along  cybersecurity challenges that need to be met in order for future ports to fully unlock the potential  of new technologies.  1.1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  In November 2011, ENISA published the first EU report ever on cyber security challenges in the  Maritime Sector14. This analysis highlighted key insights, as well as existing initiatives, as a  baseline for cyber security of maritime ecosystem. This new ENISA study aims at addressing  the cybersecurity challenges related to the evolution of maritime port systems and services.  3 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32005L0060  4 See Port Digitalization with Open Data: Challenges, Opportunities, and Integrations:  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321853773_Digital_transformation_in_maritime_ports_analysis_and_a_game_the oretic_framework  5 See https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261343481_Intelligent_ports_based_on_Internet_of_Things and  https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2016/04/01/the-hamburg-port-authoritys-impressive-iot-project/#50f7ac776c64  6 See https://news.microsoft.com/fr-fr/2018/10/15/soget-et-microsoft-un-partenariat-strategique-pour-une-digitalisation- securisee-des-ports-francais-et-mondiaux/  7 See https://www.patersonsimons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TMS_SmartPort_InsightBee_Report-to- GUIDE_01.02.18.pdf  8 See https://www.big-data-value.eu/pilot/transforming-transport-ports-valencia/  9 See https://www.i-scoop.eu/blockchain-smart-port-project-case-container-release-port-antwerp  10 See https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24539417  11 See https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/  12 See https://www.securitynewspaper.com/2018/09/26/hacking-attack-in-port-of-barcelona  13 See https://www.darktrace.com/en/blog/troubled-waters-cyber-attacks-on-san-diego-and-barcelonas-ports and  https://www.portofsandiego.org/press-releases/general-press-releases/port-san-diego-releases-additional- information-cybersecurity  14 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-aspects-in-the-maritime-sector-1  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32005L0060 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321853773_Digital_transformation_in_maritime_ports_analysis_and_a_game_theoretic_framework https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321853773_Digital_transformation_in_maritime_ports_analysis_and_a_game_theoretic_framework https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261343481_Intelligent_ports_based_on_Internet_of_Things https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2016/04/01/the-hamburg-port-authoritys-impressive-iot-project/#50f7ac776c64 https://news.microsoft.com/fr-fr/2018/10/15/soget-et-microsoft-un-partenariat-strategique-pour-une-digitalisation-securisee-des-ports-francais-et-mondiaux/ https://news.microsoft.com/fr-fr/2018/10/15/soget-et-microsoft-un-partenariat-strategique-pour-une-digitalisation-securisee-des-ports-francais-et-mondiaux/ https://www.patersonsimons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TMS_SmartPort_InsightBee_Report-to-GUIDE_01.02.18.pdf https://www.patersonsimons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TMS_SmartPort_InsightBee_Report-to-GUIDE_01.02.18.pdf https://www.big-data-value.eu/pilot/transforming-transport-ports-valencia/ https://www.i-scoop.eu/blockchain-smart-port-project-case-container-release-port-antwerp https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24539417 https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/ https://www.securitynewspaper.com/2018/09/26/hacking-attack-in-port-of-barcelona/ https://www.darktrace.com/en/blog/troubled-waters-cyber-attacks-on-san-diego-and-barcelonas-ports/ https://www.portofsandiego.org/press-releases/general-press-releases/port-san-diego-releases-additional-information-cybersecurity https://www.portofsandiego.org/press-releases/general-press-releases/port-san-diego-releases-additional-information-cybersecurity https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-aspects-in-the-maritime-sector-1  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  11  The main objectives of the study are to build a baseline of good practices to ensure  cybersecurity of port systems and services, while mapping the relevant cybersecurity challenges  and threats and highlighting some attack scenarios. The study aims at being a reference point  to promote collaboration on maritime port ecosystem across the European Union and raise  awareness of the relevant threats. An additional important element of the study is to map port  services and systems through a high-level reference model to set the scope of the work to be  done and serve as a basis for future developments.  1.2 STUDY SCOPE  This study outlines good practices for cybersecurity in the maritime port ecosystem, both  concerning IT systems and OT systems. The port ecosystem includes all the stakeholders  involved in the port operations: the managing bodies of the port (Port Authorities, terminal and  facility operators), national authorities (customs, police, cities, etc.), transport companies  (shipping companies, railway companies, etc.) and all the service providers essential to port  operations (oil companies, energy companies, etc.).  The primary target audience of this study are people in charge of IT and OT security within the  port ecosystem: employees of Port Authorities and terminal operators or any other person in  charge of applying these practices. The study can also be useful for secondary stakeholders in  the port ecosystem: port ecosystem associations and especially members in charge of IT and  OT security matters, persons in charge of IT and OT in companies interacting with ports,  especially shipping companies, etc.  1.3 METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH  Task 1 - Definition of the project scope and identification of experts: the first step consisted  of establishing the scope of the project and selecting subject matter experts whose input and  insights were considered for the development of the report. Experts mainly include port  stakeholders in charge of cybersecurity as well as some national authorities.  Task 2 - Desktop research: during this step, extensive search for relevant documents in the  context of the project was conducted. The identified sources served as a reference to develop  good practices and other parts of the report.  Task 3 - Questionnaire and series of interviews with selected subject matter experts: a  questionnaire addressing port cybersecurity topics was developed and filled in by 14  stakeholders of the port ecosystem (from 13 European Port Authorities – either cybersecurity,  security, safety or IT and OT managers – and from one national cybersecurity agency,  representing 11 different Member States) and used to conduct interviews with 13 of them.  Task 4 - Analysis of collected material and report development: the input collected from  desktop research and collaboration with stakeholders were thoroughly analysed. Based on this  analysis, the first draft of this report was developed.  Task 5 - Review and validation: The report was validated with ENISA's subject matter experts  through sharing of the draft report and through obtaining comments and feedback.  Figure 1: Methodology adopted for the study  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  12  2. THE EU PORT LANDSCAPE  2.1 EU AND INTERNATIONAL POLICY AND REGULATORY CONTEXT  2.1.1 International context  At international level, the ISPS - International Ships and Port Facilities Security Code15, was  added to the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)16 Convention in 2002 to recognise the role of port  facilities in maritime security and define mandatory requirements and recommendations that  ships and port facilities must follow. This chapter has been defined to address ports security, but  requirements can be related also to ports cybersecurity to some extent (access control and  authentication requirements).  The ISPS Code requires ports to design a Port Facility Security Assessment (PFSA) to  identify major assets, possible threats and countermeasures and a Port Facility Security Plan  (PFSP) to identify, for each of the different security levels the procedures to be followed, the  measures to be put in place and the actions to be undertaken. The PFSA must address within a  port facility, the following aspects: physical security, structural integrity, personnel protection  systems, procedural policies, radio and telecommunication systems, including computer  systems and networks and relevant transportation infrastructure. The PFSP must address  access to the port facility, restricted areas within the port facility, handling of cargo, delivery of  ship’s stores and monitoring the security of the port facility.  SOLAS and FAL17 (Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic) conventions define nine  standardized forms to be used to exchange information within the maritime ecosystem,  especially between port and third parties. Electronic exchange of required information is  mandatory since April 9th, 2019, especially using “Single Window” systems offset up by public  authorities18. This standardisation of data exchanges has a strong impact on port IT ecosystems  and poses new IT security challenges.  Cybersecurity for the maritime ecosystem, in particular for ships, has been only directly  addressed at International level since 2017 through guidelines and recommendations to the  global maritime ecosystem.  IMO Facilitation Committee (FAL) and the Maritime Security Committee (MSC) defined IMO  Guidelines on maritime cyber risk management in MSC-FAL.1/Circ.319. Both recognized the  urgent need to raise awareness on cyber risk threats and vulnerabilities and to provide high-  level recommendations on maritime cyber risk management from current and emerging cyber  threats and vulnerabilities, including main areas that support effective cyber risk management  (identify, protect, detect, respond and recover).  15 See IMO Conventions: http://www.imo.org/en/about/conventions/listofconventions/pages/default.aspx  16 See IMO Conventions: http://www.imo.org/en/about/conventions/listofconventions/pages/default.aspx  17 See http://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/facilitation/conventionscodesguidelines/pages/default.aspx  18 See Chapter 3 “Application of Single Window Concept  http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Facilitation/FormsCertificates/Documents/FAL%2040-19%20- %20Report%20Of%20The%20Facilitation%20Committee%20On%20Its%20Fortieth%20Session%20(Secretariat).pdf#sear ch=single%20window  19 See Guidelines on Maritime Cyber Risk Management (MSC-FAL.1/Circ.3):  http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Security/Guide_to_Maritime_Security/Documents/MSC-FAL.1-Circ.3%20- %20Guidelines%20On%20Maritime%20Cyber%20Risk%20Management%20(Secretariat).pdf  http://www.imo.org/en/about/conventions/listofconventions/pages/default.aspx http://www.imo.org/en/about/conventions/listofconventions/pages/default.aspx http://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/facilitation/conventionscodesguidelines/pages/default.aspx http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Facilitation/FormsCertificates/Documents/FAL%2040-19%20-%20Report%20Of%20The%20Facilitation%20Committee%20On%20Its%20Fortieth%20Session%20(Secretariat).pdf#search=single%20window http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Facilitation/FormsCertificates/Documents/FAL%2040-19%20-%20Report%20Of%20The%20Facilitation%20Committee%20On%20Its%20Fortieth%20Session%20(Secretariat).pdf#search=single%20window http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Facilitation/FormsCertificates/Documents/FAL%2040-19%20-%20Report%20Of%20The%20Facilitation%20Committee%20On%20Its%20Fortieth%20Session%20(Secretariat).pdf#search=single%20window http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Security/Guide_to_Maritime_Security/Documents/MSC-FAL.1-Circ.3%20-%20Guidelines%20On%20Maritime%20Cyber%20Risk%20Management%20(Secretariat).pdf http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Security/Guide_to_Maritime_Security/Documents/MSC-FAL.1-Circ.3%20-%20Guidelines%20On%20Maritime%20Cyber%20Risk%20Management%20(Secretariat).pdf  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  13  These guidelines make the distinction between IT systems (use of data as information) and OT  systems (use of data to control or monitor physical processes). They recognize that all  organizations in the shipping industry are different and shall refer to Member Governments' and  Flag Administrations' requirements and relevant international or industry standards and best  practices (e.g. NIST Framework20, ISO/IEC 2700121) in order to address the most relevant  security measures.  2.1.2 European context  Some EU regulation impacted the maritime ecosystem and directly or indirectly ports with  regards to safety, security and data exchange:   Some chapters of the SOLAS Convention were transposed in the European  Union through several regulations; Regulation (EC) 725/200422 focuses on  enhancing ship and port facility security and on the implementation of the  International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code while Directive  2005/65/EC23 on enhancing port security. Regulation (EC) 336/200624 focuses on  the implementation of the International Safety Management Code (ISM)25 within  maritime sector in the European Union, though it should be mentioned that the  ISM code is not applicable to ports; and   Directive 2010/65/EU26 requires that ports of the Member States accept  standardised forms (FAL forms) in order to ease traffic. This directive also  introduces SafeSeaNet systems27 established at national and European Union  level to facilitate secure data exchange between Member States’ maritime  authorities and other authorities’ systems (e.g. customs systems).  More concretely, Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 and Directive 2005/65/EC are the legal  frameworks which support risk assessments and security plans for ports and port facilities: the  Member States must design a PFSA and the Port Authorities must design their PFSP to be  approved, prior to their implementation, by the Member States which are responsible for  ensuring that the implementation of PFSPs is monitored.  In 2014, the European Maritime Security Strategy (EUMSS)28 was defined (and revised in  2018)29 as a shared and comprehensive tool to identify, prevent and respond to any challenge  that affects the security of European people, activities and assets in the maritime ecosystem,  including ports. This strategy identifies the maritime security risks and threats which are  “terrorism and other intentional unlawful acts at sea and in ports against ships, cargo, crew and  passengers, ports and port facilities and critical maritime and energy infrastructure, including  cyber-attacks”. The revision of the EUMSS, as adopted by the General Affairs Council on 26  June 2018, aims at a more focused reporting process to enhance awareness and better follow-  up to the strategy  In 2016, the Regulation (EU) 2016/679, called the General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR)30, on the protection of natural persons regarding the processing of personal data and  20 See https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework  21 See https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html  22 See more about European Directives and Regulations: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/homepage.html  23 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1568879817427&uri=CELEX:32005L0065  24 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1568879842121&uri=CELEX:32006R0336  25 See IMO Conventions: http://www.imo.org/en/about/conventions/listofconventions/pages/default.aspx  26 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1568879869082&uri=CELEX:32010L0065  27 See more about SafeSeaNet systems: http://www.emsa.europa.eu/ssn-main.html  28 See the European Maritime Security Strategy: https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/policy/maritime-security_en  29 See https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/06/26/maritime-security-eu-revises-its-action-plan/  30 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679  https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html https://eur-lex.europa.eu/homepage.html https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1568879817427&uri=CELEX:32005L0065 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1568879842121&uri=CELEX:32006R0336 http://www.imo.org/en/about/conventions/listofconventions/pages/default.aspx https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1568879869082&uri=CELEX:32010L0065 http://www.emsa.europa.eu/ssn-main.html https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/policy/maritime-security_en https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/06/26/maritime-security-eu-revises-its-action-plan/ https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  14  on the free movement of such data, defined requirements for the protection of personal data,  applied for all sectors including the maritime sector.  The Directive 2016/1148 (NIS Directive)31  is an EU-wide cybersecurity legislation harmonizing  national cybersecurity capabilities, cross-border collaboration and the supervision of critical  sectors across the EU. The recitals number 10 and 11 are specific to the maritime sector:  “security requirements for companies, ships, port facilities, ports and vessel traffic services  under Union legal acts cover all operations, including radio and telecommunication systems,  computer systems and networks” and “when identifying operators” of essential services “in the  water transport sector, Member States should take into account existing and future international  codes and guidelines developed in particular by the International Maritime Organisation, with a  view to providing individual maritime operators with a coherent approach”.  Operators of essential services identified in the water transport ecosystem are the following:   Inland, sea and coastal passenger and freight water transport companies, as  defined for maritime transport in Appendix I to Regulation (EC) 725/200432 not  including the individual vessels operated by those companies;   Managing bodies of ports (defined as “any specified area of land and water, with  boundaries defined by the Member State in which the port is situated, containing  works and equipment designed to facilitate commercial maritime transport  operations” in the Directive 2005/65/EC33) including their port facilities (defined as  “a location where the ship/port interface takes place; this includes areas such as  anchorages, awaiting berths and approaches from seaward, as appropriate” in the  Regulation (EC) No 725/200434) and entities operating works and equipment  contained within ports; and   Operators of vessel traffic services (defined as “service designed to improve the  safety and efficiency of vessel traffic and to protect the environment, which has the  capability to interact with the traffic and to respond to traffic situations developing  in the VTS area” in the Directive 2002/59/EC35).  Finally, in 2019, the EU Cybersecurity Act36 strengthens the position of ENISA within  cybersecurity matters for EU Member states and defines an EU-wide cybersecurity certification  framework for ICT products, services and processes. This framework will provide a  comprehensive set of rules, technical requirements, standards and procedures in order to attest  that ICT products and services can be trusted based on EU requirements.  In addition to International and European regulatory and policy initiatives, several Member  States have also developed their own initiatives to improve cyber risk management in general or  specifically in the maritime sector such as national cybersecurity strategies, good practices or  recommendations, for example the French CIIP law37, UK’s cyber security code of practice for  ports 38, German “IT-Grundschutz”39, etc.  31 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148  32 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:129:0006:0091:EN:PDF  33 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:310:0028:0039:FR:PDF  34 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/En/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32004R0725  35 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2002:208:0010:0027:FR:PDF  36 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eu-cybersecurity-act  37 See https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/cybersecurity-in-france/ciip-in-france/  38 See https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ports-and-port-systems-cyber-security-code-of-practice  39 See https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/itgrundschutz_node.html  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:129:0006:0091:EN:PDF https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:310:0028:0039:FR:PDF https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/En/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32004R0725 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2002:208:0010:0027:FR:PDF https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eu-cybersecurity-act https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/cybersecurity-in-france/ciip-in-france/ https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ports-and-port-systems-cyber-security-code-of-practice https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/itgrundschutz_node.html  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  15  2.2 PORT INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES  The port infrastructure and services exhibit a high degree of diversity from one port to another  and from one Member State to another: over the years, the ports have adapted their  infrastructure and services to the local geographic and territorial specificities, to the activities  related to the location of the port (existing fishing basins around, an ideal location for tourism, a  location at the crossroads of different countries and continents, etc.) and to the different  challenges that ports have to face.  The global infrastructure of a port is composed of marine infrastructure (breakwaters, dredging,  locks, basins, jetties, quays, mooring piers, etc.), distribution infrastructure (internal roads,  railways, walkways, etc.), buildings and terminals managed and maintained by the Port  Authority. The port facilities are usually let by the Port Authority to private terminal operators in  charge of managing and maintaining the superstructure (such as cranes, silos, specific fencing,  control facilities, passenger terminals) to deliver the specific port facility operations.  Besides, various authorities reside in ports facilities to provide services, controls and inspections  related to ship and port operations (see 3.3).  A port can address three main categories of activities, to which infrastructures and services are  adapted:   Activities related to maritime cargo (container, general cargo, liquid or dry bulk,  etc.) with dedicated infrastructure and services to welcome cargo vessels and  manage related operations (e.g. unloading and loading, storage, customs  inspection, sanitary controls, etc.).   Activities related to passengers and vehicles transport with dedicated  infrastructure and services to welcome passengers and vehicles on ships and  manager related operations (e.g. passenger gangways, parking, restaurants and  bars, border control, etc.). This includes RoRo (Roll-on/roll-off ships) activity as  cargo is on trucks.   Activities related to fishing with dedicated infrastructure and services to  welcome fishing boats and manage related operations (e.g. fish unloading/loading,  fish inspection, fish refrigerated storage, etc.)  In order to support these various activities, the port provides main services, represented in the  Figure 2: Port services and infrastructure and detailed in Table 1: Detailed port services. These  services are grouped into seven categories, which were defined based on the desktop research  and information provided by the experts who contributed to this report.  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  16  Figure 2: Port services and infrastructure  Table 1: Detailed port services  Service category Service description  Vessel berthing  services  When a vessel arrives and leaves a port, different services are provided: berth allocation, marine pilotage,  ship supplies such as refuelling or food supply, towing, mooring, vessel safety and security management,  bulk water management, services to the crew, ship repair, etc.  Vessel loading and  unloading services  When a vessel is berthed in a port, different services are provided to load and unload freight, fishes,  passengers and vehicles: quay cranes and conveyor belts operations, pumping, freight tracking,  passenger gangways set up, access controls at boarding, safety and security, operations monitoring, etc.  Temporary storage  and staying services  When freight or fishes are on quays, temporary storage services are provided before they are distributed  and transferred, depending on the nature of the freight: container moving, storage and stacking; bulk solids  conveyor belts operations and storage; grain conveyors and silos operations; bulk liquids pumping and  reservoirs filling; general cargo storage; refrigerated cargo storage; etc.  In a similar way, staying services are provided for vehicles and passengers: parking, passenger lounges,  luggage handling facilities, restaurants and bars, shopping malls, etc.  Distribution and  transfer services  To ensure the hinterland connectivity, distributing and transferring services are provided: inland port  services, train stations and marshalling yards, passenger and luggage controls, intermodal transport hubs,  container scanning, port entry and exit, etc.  Support services  To support the services describing above, the Port Authority or other private companies provide the  following service: freight tracking, maritime traffic control, land and infrastructure management, real estate  and facility management, terminal operations management, berthing and pilotage management, dangerous  goods management, maintenance, port operations management, port administration, etc.  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  17  Security and safety  services  To protect infrastructure, services and people working and passing through the port, security and safety  services are provided to prevent accident or malicious activities such as terrorism: cameras and radar  surveillance, access controls, alarms, signals, detections, etc.  Authorities’ services  Authorities can be located within port facilities to provide various services, included controls and  inspections: customs, police, coast guards, firefighters, port state control, civil security, rescue at sea,  health, navigation safety, pollution prevention, sanitary and veterinary controls, fish catch controls, etc.  2.3 OVERVIEW OF KEY STAKEHOLDERS  The panorama of the stakeholders involved in port operations and processes is complex and is  accentuated by the considerable differences in governance and functioning that may exist  between European ports. However, a high-level overview can be drawn to differentiate  categories of stakeholders by macro roles, based on the desktop research and information  provided by the experts who contributed to this report.  Figure 3: Overview of port stakeholders  2.4 HIGH-LEVEL REFERENCE MODEL  The complexity and the diversity of the port ecosystem (various operational and economic  models, different governance, large typology of stakeholders involved, responsibilities shared  between stakeholders, etc.) and the unicity of each port are reflected in a very diverse approach  to information and operational technology (IT/OT) systems management. Indeed, from one port  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  18  to another, IT and OT systems are not the same, are not operated and managed by the same  types of stakeholders and not implemented in the same way.  This report provides a high-level reference model based on the desktop research and  information provided by the experts who contributed to this report. Its objectives are to list, from  a high-level perspective, the main port systems, data flows and interactions with external  systems. However, this model must be nuanced and adapted, because it cannot fully  correspond to the specificities of each port. For instance, the Port Community System  functionality differs between ports, depending on their specific activities and services as well as  their overseeing authorities.  Figure 4: High-level reference model of the port systems  2.4.1 Description of the systems  The high-level reference model represents the port systems (block in the middle), and the third  parties’ systems interacting with them.  Third parties' systems are grouped into 4 main categories: systems used by maritime  stakeholders’ (shipping companies, ship agent, ship master and crew, etc.), systems used by  other transport stakeholders to share freight or passenger information and enable the  transhipment (inland waterborne transport companies, roadway companies, railway companies,  etc.), systems used by authorities at local, national and European levels and systems used for  satellite and maritime surveillance.  Regarding port systems, they are regrouped into two main categories:  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  19   exchange data systems of the port community for vessel, fishing or freight  related services, especially used as central point for data exchange with shipping  companies, also called “single window”;   port management information systems, that includes maritime traffic control  systems, corporate systems (emails, ERP, etc.), security and safety systems as  well as Terminal Operation Management Systems, often owned by private  companies.  2.4.2 Description of data flows  Port systems interact with a wide range of systems through machine-to-machine  interconnections or manual ones (with information exchanged though web interfaces, by phone  calls, emails, paper or fax).  A large amount of data is exchanged between the port and the different stakeholders, which is  classified into 5 categories according to this reference model:   the mandatory declarations (information that shipping companies or other  stakeholders must report to the Port Authority or other authorities, with respect to  the international, European and national legislations);   the control and authorisation given by the authorities to the commercial  stakeholders (e.g. authorisation to access to the port, authorisation to unload the  goods);   the operational data related to the port services and processes (e.g. needs for  ship refuelling, scheduling of cargo operations);   the financial data (e.g. invoicing from the port to its client, payment); and   the navigation data (e.g. GPS position of a ship in the port area, AIS data).  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  20  3. PORT ASSET TAXONOMY  3.1 ASSET TAXONOMY OVERVIEW  To identify cyber threats associated to the port ecosystem, it is essential to start from  identification and breakdown of the port’s assets. Figure 5 provides an overview of the main  asset categories that could be found in a port and details the assets for each category: this  taxonomy should not be considered as comprehensive; it aims at representing the main assets  and doesn’t reflect the diversity and the specificities of different ports. Table 3 describes each  asset represented in the asset taxonomy.  Ten asset categories are identified based on the desktop research and information provided by  the experts who contributed to this report: the fixed infrastructure, the mobile infrastructure, the  OT systems and networks, the OT end-devices associated, the IT systems, the IT end-devices  associated, the networks and communications components, the safety and security systems,  the information and data, and the people.  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  21  Figure 5: Asset taxonomy  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  22  3.2 DESCRIPTION OF PORT ASSETS  Table 2: Description of port’s assets  Sub-categories Description  Fixed infrastructure  Seaside  connectivity  Those assets are related to the navigation between the seaside and the port area to ensure that the  vessels can enter and exit the port: breakwaters, sea locks, buoys, light beacons, marking of waterways,  tide, wind and currents monitoring, radar monitoring of waterways.  Portuary  infrastructure  The assets are related to the mooring of the vessels in the port (docks, quays, jetties, piers), the lighting,  the access control (gates, plate reading systems, detectors) and the transport inside the port areas (roads,  railways, waterways, walk roads).  Buildings  The port buildings host the different offices related to the port services (Harbour Master office, customs  office, etc.) and the data centres hosting all the IT and OT systems.  Energy  Those assets are related to the supply of energy for the port ecosystem (buildings, vessels, etc.): electricity  network (with high-voltage for large ports), fresh water bunkering and delivery stations, pipeline, fuel, petrol,  etc.  Waste treatment  systems  The port manages not only its waste but also the waste of the vessels (solid waste such as plastic, paper,  glass, food and liquid waste such as bilge water, sludge and sewage).  Hinterland  connectivity  The port, as an interface between the sea and the hinterland transport systems, has hinterland connectivity  assets such as railway stations and rolling stock loading and dispatch systems, road infrastructure,  intermodal stations, canals and port infrastructures connecting with inland waterways.  Safety &  security  The port has also dedicated infrastructure to ensure safety and security: control tower, operational room,  security centre, first response facilities (firefighting, pollution, containment, evacuation routes, medical  facilities, etc.).  Mobile infrastructure  Port service  ships  The port has dedicated service ships at disposal to deliver specific services on water to the vessels: pilot  boats, tugboats, boatage and mooring assistance, supply vessels, safety vessels, inspection and security  vessels.  Special vehicles  Identically, the port has dedicated vehicles at disposal to deliver inland services: firefighting, ambulance,  mobile cargo control units, etc.  Physical floating  barriers  To protect other critical vessels and port areas, to contain pollutions and other purpose, the port can use  physical floating barriers.  OT systems and networks  Industrial  control systems  (ICS)  In the port, there are different Industrial Control Systems (ICS), for managing port access and vessels  berthing (bridges, locks, gates, etc.), port infrastructure (buildings, etc.) and terminal operations (cranes,  storage, etc.). The ICS is composed of the following components: automatons and analysers (PLCs,  RTUs), databases (Historian, MES, etc.), supervisory systems (DCS, SCADA), HMI / workstations  (programming consoles, engineering workstation), Maintenance systems and Safety Instrumented Systems  (SIS).  ICS  Communications  networks &  components  To ensure the communications between the ICS components, the port manage the following assets:  switches (managed and unmanaged), wireless access points, protocols, power supply systems (water,  electricity, etc.)  OT END devices  Related to port  facility specific  lay-out  The end-devices of the ICS related to the port facility specific lay-out are: specific fencing and access  control, specific safety and security equipment, first response equipment, specific operational room, etc.  Related to  vessels berthing  The end-devices of the ICS related to the port vessels berthing are: boatage, berth management systems,  specific inspection and control equipment, etc.  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  23  Related to  vessel loading  and unloading  To load and unload the vessels, many OT end-devices are used: terminal-specific handling equipment and  systems (cranes, ramps for passengers, pipelines, belt, conveyors, etc.), terminal-specific freight tracking  systems (barcodes, liquid meters, RFID, seals, scales etc.), people badge or ticket scanners, plates reading  systems, fault detectors in automated loading/unloading systems (leakages, shocks, jamming etc.)  Related to  temporary  storage  Once the cargo or container are out of the vessel, they are temporary stored in the port areas, different OT  end-devices are used: internal transport systems (straddle carrier, yard, truck, chassis, etc.), storage  equipment systems (pallet racks, tankage, etc.), cooled and uncooled stores, silos, tanks, switches  (managed and unmanaged) for pipes and conveyor belts, wireless access points for « smart » seals and  container self-localisation devices, etc.  Related to  hinterland  connectivity  To get in or out the cargo, container, vehicles or passengers, different end-devices are used to control and  inspect them, and then transport them to other transport systems: control and inspection systems  (scanners, inspection systems, Xray), railway station, marshalling yards for wagons, multimodal transport  hubs for people (passengers, workers…), inland port facilities, port gate control equipment (plates reading,  badges, barcodes reading, detectors)  IT systems  Port Community  System (PCS)  The Port Community System is usually owned and managed by the Port Authority or port stakeholders40,  increasingly organised, as a single window system to share information on port operations related to the  vessels between all the port stakeholders (date of arrival or departure of the ship given by the shipping  companies, mandatory declarations such as crew list, dangerous goods declarations, bookings of vessel  services, etc.).  Cargo  Community  System (CCS)  The Cargo Community System is usually owned and managed by port stakeholders41 that are usually  private companies in charge of the terminal port operations. This system is used to share information on  port operations related to the cargo and containers between all involved stakeholders (content of the cargo,  localisation of a container, hour of its transfer, customs declarations, etc.).  Fisheries  Information  Management  System (FIMS)  For ports hosting fishing activities, the FIMS, as an integrated collection of applications and processes, is  owned by the local fisheries authority and used by port stakeholders to manage fisheries operations  (loading and unloading), traceability of fish catches, catch certifications.42  Port Corporate  Systems  The Port Corporate Systems are composed of different applications, systems, workstations and servers,  common to every companies: financial, human resources (HR), communication and networks systems,  emailing systems, sales and marketing systems (ERP), etc.  Terminal  Operations  Management  Systems  The Terminal Operations Management Systems, usually owned, used and maintained by private terminal  operators, are mainly composed of different systems: enterprise operations systems to plan and manage  the logistics and operations (ERP, CRM, etc.), the OT systems specific to the terminal operations (cranes,  etc.), terminal operating systems (TOS) used to optimise the logistics, transhipment and warehouse  systems.  VTS/VTMIS  A Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) is a marine traffic monitoring system. The Vessel Traffic Management  Information System (VTMIS) is an extension of the VTS which integrates other information and  functionalities to increase the effectiveness of port operations (allocation of resources, etc.).  Berth  Management  Systems  Those systems are used by Port Authorities to manage and ensure safety in mooring processes: warnings  and alerts, meteorological data, video cameras streams, berth allocation management, etc.  IT END-devices  Workstations  Different workstations are used in ports: dedicated to IT systems, dedicated to OT systems, to  maintenance, mobile and fixes workstations, etc.  Mobile devices  Different mobile devices are used in ports: smartphones, tablets, TETRA radios, specific devices used for  logistics (scanning, etc.) etc.  40 The governance of PCS is complex and differs from one port to another. For instance, the PCS of the ports of Rotterdam  and Amsterdam were merged to create a unique one, receiving a license to operate from the port communities of  Amsterdam and Rotterdam and becoming the PCS of Dutch ports. See https://www.portbase.com/en/about-us/  41 The governance of CCS is also complex and differs from one port to another and from one Member State from anther.  For example, due to the French regulations, although closely connected, the PCS and CCS are different systems with  specific governance: the CCS is operated by private companies (operated by SOGET for different French ports such as Le  Havre). Whereas, in other countries, to use again the example of the ports of Amsterdam and Rotterdam, the CCS is the  same system than the PCS. See http://www.soget.fr/en/soget-siege-3/about-us.html  42 See http://www.franciscoblaha.info/fisheries-information-systems  https://www.portbase.com/en/about-us/ http://www.soget.fr/en/soget-siege-3/about-us.html http://www.franciscoblaha.info/fisheries-information-systems  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  24  Networks and communication components  Radio  Radio systems (RFID, VHF, etc.) are used for many port processes: communication with ships, safety and  security operations, logistics management, etc.  Protocols Protocols are used to exchange information: EDI, API, authentication protocols, etc.  Servers  Numerous servers are used in the ports for different uses: web servers, application servers, proxy servers,  mail servers, virtual servers, printers, etc.  Networks  Different networks are set up in ports: VHF radios (Internet, WiMAX/WIFI, Satellite, ad-hoc networks,  VLAN/LAN, etc. They can be managed by different stakeholders at different levels.  Switches,  Routers, Hubs  Those components are used to forward packet in different manner between different networks.  Network security  To protect the network, firewall, IPS/IDS, PKI/MFA, Antivirus, SIEM and other security solutions are set up  in the port areas.  Cloud Ports can use some Cloud solutions to host some of its data, for example emails and shared folders.  Information and  data  Mandatory  declarations  Many declarations are mandatory for a ship to get into the port area, in respect with international,  European, national and local regulations. For instance, mandatory by the FAL Convention: passenger and  crew, vessel, cargo, border control, waste, security, health, travel information is required.  Commercial and  financial data  As any company, the ports deliver services to companies (shipping companies, etc.) and books different  services to their providers (ICT providers for example): financial and commercial are exchanges (money  transfer, invoicing, etc.).  Navigation data  Through satellite and navigation data (AIS, SafeSeaNet, etc.), the different stakeholders share navigation  data with the port (GPS position, information on maritime routes, etc.).  Control &  Authorisation  The Port Authorities and other national authorities control and deliver authorisation for vessel and cargo  movement.  Operational data  In order to plan and manage all the services (ship services, logistics services, etc.), operational data are  shared between the port stakeholders.  Safety and security systems  Many systems are set up in the port areas to ensure safety and security of people and port infrastructure:   Detection systems such as video-surveillance (CCTV), incident management systems, first response  centre systems, IDS (intrusion detection systems), abnormal behaviour detection systems;   Emergency communication systems;   Access control systems such as automatic gates, smart fencing systems, badging systems, access  monitoring and counting systems;   Traffic monitoring systems such as radar and electro-optic monitoring systems, train and truck traffic  monitoring systems;   Surveillance & inspection systems such as patrolling staff, oats, dogs and vehicles, detectors (fires, gas  leaks, nuclear, etc.), X-ray scanners;   Evacuation systems such as exit route guidance, muster points, guidance screens, emergency doors;   Identification & authentication systems such as face recognition systems, biometric systems, ID control  portable terminals; and  Alerting systems such as sirens and loudspeakers.  People  Port authority  staff  The Port Authority employs directly people, as statuary staff.  Permanent  commercial staff  The companies operating permanently in the ports employs people, as statuary staff (terminal operators,  permanent service providers, etc.).  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  25  IT/OT staff  The IT and OT staff, employed by the Port Authorities and private companies operates in different systems  to set up new solutions and maintain them (CISO, CIO, administrations, etc.).  External staff  Many other people operate in ports: port facility external staff, other service staff (third-parties), temporarily  authorized staff (contractors, taxi drivers, etc.).  Ship crews  When a ship arrives in a port, the crew’s members and their captain can use the different facilities of the  port (restaurant, bar, etc.).  Passengers The passengers pass through the port areas to go up in the cruise ships and ferries.  General public Usually, some port areas are opened to the public (tourism, research, etc.).  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  26  4. CYBERSECURITY THREATS AND  CHALLENGES  4.1 THREAT TAXONOMY  Ports face numerous cybersecurity challenges, some of them are quite generic within any IT  and OT environment, while others are quite specific to port ecosystems. Table 3 identifies the  possible impact of cybersecurity incidents for a port.  Table 3: Possible impacts for ports  Impacts Description  Shutdown of  operations, port  paralysis  The shutdown of the port operations is a much-feared impact by the port  ecosystem: if it lasts more than a few hours, it can harm strongly the  commercial operations (loss of money), the delivery of essential goods for a  nation, especially for the islands (food, fuel, etc.) as well as pose safety and  security issues (queue of several boats at the port entrance).  Human injuries or  death, Kidnapping  Ports must face high security and safety challenges, because many people  work in port areas can perform dangerous jobs (manipulation of cranes, of  dangerous goods, etc.) and because ports also must manage a quite large  passenger flow easy to predict (ferries, large cruise vessels, etc.).  Sensitive and critical  data theft  Port systems may hold critical information, whether it is personal information  (crew or passenger data), critical commercial information (location and  content of containers, competitive know-how) or National security information  (port being essential assets for a nation): the theft of these information can  have disastrous consequences.  Cargo and goods  stealing  Attackers can browse cargo and container lists to identify the most valuable  goods for black markets (to be stolen in the port or targeted for future piracy  attacks when the ship in at sea).  Illegal trafficking  The marine ecosystem is one of the largest playgrounds for organized crime:  ports are often used for illegal and criminal traffic (drugs, arms, prohibited  goods, most wanted people...).  Financial loss and  costs  A port can lose a lot of money due to the stop of operations or for repair  budget, in case of damage on its systems and infrastructure  Fraud and money  steal  As any major company, the financial systems of the ports can be  compromised to steal money from them. Indeed, especially for the biggest  ports, the port revenues are important: for example, the Port of Rotterdam  Authority’s revenue, in 2017, was € 712.1 million. Moreover, since ports are  the border between two States or continents, fraudulent companies can  falsify their customs declarations (VAT fraud).  Systems damages or  worst, destruction  Due to the high complexity of port systems and infrastructure, some of which  are critical (e.g. industrial systems that manage large amounts of dangerous  goods), damage or worse, destruction to those systems and infrastructure  has disastrous consequences for port operations and safety and security,  including people. Tankers (especially refined products and gas) are very  vulnerable to fire and explosion; local storage of flammables and chemicals is  also possibly massive.  Tarnished  reputation, loss of  competitiveness  Nowadays, ports are in an extremely competitive international ecosystem: the  slightest incident or problem on its activities and operations can damage its  reputation and lose customers who could direct their traffic to neighbouring  ports.  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  27  Environmental  disaster  As the port is the direct interface between the hinterland and the sea, an  environmental disaster in port areas can have disastrous consequences on  populations, fauna and flora and human infrastructure, at a very long distance  (oil spill, gas explosion, ocean pollution, shipwrecks, etc.).  Finally, main threats that port ecosystems can be exposed to are described in Figure 6: Threat  taxonomy and detailed in the Table 4: Threat description.  Figure 6: Threat taxonomy  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  28  Table 4: Threat description  Sub-categories Description  Eavesdropping, interception, hijacking  Interception of  emissions  Hackers can intercept the communication between the port and the different stakeholders (radio,  exchanges between ships and port, etc.).  Interception of  sensitive data  Communications can be listened, or the systems can be scanned to intercept sensitive data for  corporate espionage, state espionage or criminal crime and piracy espionage.  Man-in-the-middle,  session hijacking  In a Man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker relays and possibly alters the communication between two  parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.  With session hijacking hacker can exploit systems vulnerabilities to gain the same access rights than  the targeted clients (authentication cookies for instance)  Network  reconnaissance  and traffic  manipulation  The attacker scans the network passively until he can find an entry door which reveals to him internal  port network information (open ports, used protocols, etc.). With this knowledge, the attacker operates  to comprise the targeted systems.  Nefarious activity and abuse  Denial of service  (DoS)  A DoS attack can target different systems: RGPS, network, applications, IoT, etc. The objectives of  such attack is to lead to system unavailability and production disruption. Most DoS attacks are caused  by several sources at the same time (e.g. massive number of requests sent by different systems at the  same time) sent to the target system, also called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).  Malware  The penetration of malicious software in the port systems can lead to unwanted and unauthorised  actions, exploiting for some of them vulnerabilities to elevate the privileges which may cause damage  on port IT/OT systems, infrastructure, data integrity and operations.  There are different types of malware created for different purpose: ransomware, viruses, Trojan  horses, spyware, injection or web application attacks, etc.  Brute force  The brute force attack is used for gaining unauthorised access to an organisation’s resources (i.e.  data, systems, devices, etc.) through many attempts to guess the correct key or password. If the port  systems allow the utilisation of simple or defaults passwords, they can be especially vulnerable to this  kind of attacks.  Identity theft  A hacker can use, deliberately, the identity of a person involved in the port ecosystem, through for  example the stealing of credentials, to obtain financial gain, critical information, unauthorised access to  a system, etc. The “fake president” fraud, using identity of powerful people in the ecosystem, can have  serious impact.  Social engineering,  phishing  An attacker can use human interaction to obtain or compromise information about port organization  and port processes: by asking questions, by pretending to be another person, the attacker can piece  together information he needs to infiltrate the port systems. The attacker can ask several sources, by  relying on the information he can get from the first source to add to his credibility or sending malicious  links.  The phishing attacks is the most common social engineering attack: hackers use email or malicious  websites to solicit personal information by posing as a trustworthy organization.  Other forms exist: vishing attack (though voice communication), smishing attack (exploitation of SMS,  text, messages containing malicious link, etc.)  Targeted attacks  A targeted attack is a sophisticated and malicious attack specifically targeting the port, designed to  infiltrate its systems for different purposes. For instance, the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a  stealthy, diffuse and continuous attack over a long period of time designed to integrate malicious code  into targeted systems that perform specific tasks without being noticed.  Abuse and theft of  data  The hacker, through different means, steals sensitive data (personal data, freight tracking data,  operational data, etc.) and/or abuse the certificates used in the port operations (ship certificates, etc.).  Manipulation of  data  The hacker can manipulate data (financial data, navigation data, freight data, operations, etc.) in the  systems to fulfil its objectives.  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  29  Geo-localisation  signals  spoofing/jamming  The hacker can manipulate geo-localisation and navigation systems to change the trajectory of a  vessel provoke accidents for instance. Recent attacks using GPS spoofing and AIS tampering show  that this threat is important and must be considered, especially in the maritime context.43  Physical attacks  Fraud  A fraud is an intentional deception which aims to violate the civil law for different purposes. For  example, in the port ecosystem, through fake customs declarations, companies can carry out VAT  fraud.  Sabotage  A sabotage is a deliberation action realised to deteriorate or destroy the port systems and  infrastructure in order to weaken the port ecosystem (mostly for military, political or ideological  objectives). The sabotage can be external (from people not directly involved in the port operations) or  internal (from people directly involved in the port operations, such as resentful employees, etc.).  Vandalism  A vandalism is a voluntary act of destruction or deterioration of port assets without any specific reason.  In the port ecosystem, vandalism can be done on port IT and OT systems, ships or other vehicles, and  freight (goods, cargo, container, etc.).  Theft  An attacker can steal mobile devices (mobile phone, radios, etc.), fixed hardware, backups, printed  documents (list of goods, ships, etc.), freight (goods, cargo, container, etc.).  Unauthorised  access  An attacker can bypass access control systems to enter in the port areas, access to a ship or other  vehicles or OT end-devices (cranes, etc.). Moreover, unauthorised vehicles and ships can also entry to  the port areas.  Terrorism  Terrorism is defined as the use of intentional violence, generally against civilians, for political,  ideological and religious purposes  Hacktivism Hacktivism is the use of technology to promote a political agenda or a social change.  Coercion, extortion  or corruption  Extortion and coercion are defined as the use of violence or threats to obtain something, especially  money. Corruption is defined as a dishonest or illegal behavior targeting powerful people in the port  ecosystem such as bribery.  Piracy, illegal  crime, mafia  Piracy, illegal crime and mafia are illegal and unauthorised organizations who break the law to maintain  their power and their illegal activities (drug trafficking, cargo theft, etc.)  Unintentional damage  Use of unreliable  source  The use of unreliable source for the port systems (defective update, malicious software, etc.) can  cause systems to malfunction or spread. The NotPetya attack is a perfect example of this.  Erroneous  administration of  IT/OT systems  Even with good intentions, if the administrators of port systems are not enough trained and made  aware of the impacts of such errors, erroneous administration can impact strongly the port systems,  and if they are critical, directly the port operations.  Resulting from  penetration testing  In order to test the security level of port systems, the port may order penetration testing which, if not  carried out properly, could damage the systems.  Data deletion  By mistakes, employees or other stakeholders accessing port systems can delete critical information  which could have impact on port operations (for instance, freight or navigation information).  3rd party security  failure  The port systems are managed and maintained by different service providers: if their accesses are not  properly controlled, the security breaches of the 3rd party can directly affect the port systems (in case of  maintenance for instance).  Information  leakage  Employees can share, by mistakes or ignorance, sensitive data if there is an insufficient awareness  and data protection solution.  Failures and malfunctions  Failures or  malfunctions of  systems or devices  A failure or a malfunction of IT or OT systems or end-devices can occasionally happen, especially if  proper maintenance and compliance with the manuals and instructions during the exploitation is not  ensured, or if the proper functioning is not measured and monitored regularly.  43 See https://www.ship-technology.com/features/ship-navigation-risks/  https://www.ship-technology.com/features/ship-navigation-risks/  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  30  Vulnerabilities  exploitation of  systems or devices  Systems and devices may have vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers, particularly if  systems or devices are not patched on time or regularly monitored while corrective measures are put in  place in the meantime.  Failures and  malfunctions of  other stakeholders’  systems  The systems (navigation, communication and other systems) of other port actors (ships, other transport  actors, etc.) may have malfunctions or failures that may lead to the slowing or even stopping of port  operations. In addition, if those systems are linked to port systems, an attacker can exploit the  vulnerabilities of those systems as an entry door to port systems.  Main supply  systems  The port is dependent on different supply systems (electricity, fuel, etc.) which are essential to ensure  port operations: in the event of failure or interruption of those systems, port operations will be slowed  down or even stopped.  Failure or  disruption of  service providers  The port is dependent of many service providers, and some of them can be critical for the port  operations. A failure or disruption of these service providers can strongly impact the port operations.  Outages  Main supply  outages  Outages on main supply can have important impacts on the port operations: shutdown on the fuelling  supply leads to block the ships in the port, outage on the electricity networks impact the IT and OT  systems (for example, no communication possible between the port stakeholders, the refrigerated  storage can no longer maintain frozen goods)  Network outage  Port networks are essential for port operations and communication between the various actors (Port  Authority, terminal operators, ships, other authorities, etc.): failures in port networks can strongly affect  their operations.  Absence of  personnel  An incident could occur in a port area or at a time where port employees are not present and may have  significant consequences in port systems and infrastructure, especially in the case of increasing  automation of the port processes.  Disaster  Environmental  disaster  The threat of incident and unfavourable conditions such as fires, pollution, dust, corrosion, explosions,  which may cause physical damage to the port assets.  Natural disaster  The threat of natural disaster such as floods, lightning strikes, powerful waves, storms, heavy winds,  rain, which may cause damage to the port assets.  4.2 CYBERSECURITY CHALLENGES  Based on the desk research and data from interviews, the main challenges currently faced by  ports to implement cybersecurity measures are the following:   Lack of digital culture in the port ecosystem, in which some stakeholders are  still conservative. Indeed, new trends such as digitisation and IoT initiatives are  colliding with the conservative nature of the maritime industry, but are becoming  more and more adopted. In this context, the cyber security needs and best  practices of these initiatives are often not considered as a priority by stakeholders  who are first looking at technology adoption;   Lack of awareness and training regarding cybersecurity: ports ecosystem  used to only rely on safety and physical security to address risks, IT and OT bring  new challenges with regards to cybersecurity that port stakeholders often do not  fully anticipate and master;   Lack of time and budget allocated to cybersecurity: as a consequence of poor  awareness, especially of top management with regards to cybersecurity  challenges;   Lack of human resources and qualified people regarding cybersecurity  matters: the ports do not have enough people in IT and OT staff to manage all  projects, especially cybersecurity projects. Moreover, cybersecurity skills are very  specific and scarce which makes it difficult for small companies to hire adequately  qualified people on those topics;  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  31   Complexity of the port ecosystem due to the number and diversity of  stakeholders taking part in port operations: stakeholders within a port can be  numerous (up to 900 for the biggest ports). This ecosystem is built from  companies of various sizes, with various levels of cybersecurity capabilities and  can even be direct competitors among themselves. This makes the overall  cybersecurity control at port level difficult with heterogeneous level of controls  within the port. 44   Need to find a right balance between business efficiency and cybersecurity,  especially by guaranteeing the continuity of services while keeping IT and OT  secure, such as disconnecting critical systems and updating systems without any  business impacts;   Legacy of some systems and practices: especially regarding systems  managing navigation data and OT systems which can be very old and vulnerable  and for which extra cybersecurity measures must be enforced;   Lack of regulatory requirements regarding cybersecurity: the NIS Directive is  a first base to implement cybersecurity measures, but only concerns some of the  stakeholders in the maritime sector. This is not yet enough to ensure a proper  level of cybersecurity over the entire port ecosystem and to allow enough budgets  to be released to meet the requirements; and   Difficulty to stay up to date with the latest threats, especially in view of the  diversity of stakeholders operating in the ports, the processes, the systems  implemented and used and the rapid growth of innovations in the port ecosystem;   Technical complexity of port IT and OT systems: the port stakeholders use  different systems that are developed, managed and maintained by different teams  or entities. For example, they can be developed either by port IT teams, either by  third-parties or by IT providers. Moreover, they can be based on various  technologies. Finally, teams managing the security of IT and OT systems can also  be different. Therefore, the mapping of all port systems is difficult to define and to  maintain overtime;   IT and OT convergence and interconnection: Usually OT systems, more  vulnerable than IT systems, are protected because they are separated from IT  systems and networks. But, increasingly, IT and OT systems and networks,  become more and more dependent and interconnected, exposing OT systems to  higher risks;   Supply chain challenges. A number of cybersecurity challenges are associated  with the supply chain: lack of cybersecurity certifications for port products and  services, security risks related to supplier remote access to the port  networks/systems, long patching cycles for certain types of systems (e.g. ICS),  heterogeneity and high number of supplier landscape, difficulty to change supplier  services. Contractors do not have much control over the cybersecurity level of  their suppliers and, consequently, over the cyber risks they involve (supply chain  attacks);   Strong interdependencies between port systems and services and external  services from other sectors (e.g. energy) that introduce interdependency  cybersecurity risks; and   New cyber risks resulting from the digital transformation of ports: ports are  currently launching several projects to digitalize port processes, in particular with  the emergence of the SmartPort concept45, cyber risks should be taken into  account in the initial phases of those projects.  44 See: Port Management Information systems towards privatization.

Each scenario is associated with a list  of security measures, detailed later in Chapter 5, that will mitigate the risk of this scenario  occurring. The security measures are formalised in the form of, to take one example, “TP-01:  Network segmentation”, with “TP” as the group of the measures (in this case “Technical  Practices”), the associated number (in this case “01”) and the name of the measure (in this case  “Network segmentation”).  Scenario A – Compromising of critical data to steal high value cargo or allow illegal  trafficking through a targeted attack  This scenario is a sophisticated and targeted attack on port systems (Advanced Persistent  Threat): attackers must have in-depth knowledge of port systems and networks (social  engineering, network scan), port processes and port infrastructure (physical intrusion) to  perform cargo and container theft. An example of such an attack occurred at one of Antwerp's  port terminals in Belgium46.  Figure 7: Compromising of critical data to steal high value cargo or allow illegal trafficking  scenario  Impacts   Cargo and goods stealing   Illegal trafficking   Tarnished reputation  Assets affected Stakeholders involved   Cargo Community Systems (CCS)   Networks   Email   People   Terminal Operators   Police   Shipping and maritime freight companies   Senders and consignees  46 https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24539417  EXAMPLE OF  TARGETED  ATTACK  A large-scale  targeted attack has  already taken place  at one of Antwerp's  port terminals in  Belgium. A drug  cartel took control of  containers movement  and retrieved the  data needed to  collect it before legit  owner.  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24539417  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  33  Attack details   On the one hand, attackers identify and retrieve authentication data (credentials) to get access to useful  systems:  o Attackers gather information on port systems through social engineering  o Then they identify the targeted systems used for cargo and container management and identity  of the people using them  o Once systems and their operators/users are identified, attackers launch phishing attacks to  retrieve credentials to access to those systems   On the other hand, attackers install components to gain access remotely to the port network and bypass  network security:  o Attackers scan the port networks to find vulnerabilities to exploit them and gather information  o They install, if necessary, through physical intrusion, components to access remotely to the port  networks (wireless access point)  o To ensure constant access and adapt to each network and infrastructure changes in the long  term, they spy on networks   Attackers have now access to the freight tracking systems and other relevant port systems and they can  access critical information on containers they want to steal (localisation, content, pick-up code, etc.) from  outside of the port facilities.   Attackers can then steal the cargo before the official pickup date  Main security measures   OP-10: Security awareness raising program   OP-16: Creation of a Cybersecurity Operations Centre (SOC)   TP-01: Network segmentation   TP-02: Regular network scans   TP-08: Multi-factor authentication  Scenario B – Propagation of ransomware leading to a total shutdown of port operations  This scenario can be a targeted or a non-targeted attack (as collateral damage of targeted  attack on other companies through the ransomware propagation): the hackers can develop a  ransomware exploiting different vulnerabilities to spread it into the port networks and encrypt the  different systems and devices (workstations, servers, etc.), leading to the destruction of the  infected systems and the potential loss of backups (within servers which could be encrypted).  An example of a destructive ransomware-like malware attack was the large-scale incident  affecting the operations of Maersk47.  47 http://fortune.com/2017/06/27/maersk-petya-ransomware-cyber-attack/  EXAMPLE OF  RANSOMWARE  ATTACK  A large-scale  destructive and  ransomware-like  malware attack  (NotPetya) affected  Maersk. This attack  led a total paralysis of  the Maersk terminal  in Rotterdam, with  high risks of security  and safety incidents,  and port terminal  operations were  managed manually  for more than two  weeks.  http://fortune.com/2017/06/27/maersk-petya-ransomware-cyber-attack/  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  34  Figure 8: Propagation of ransomware leading to a total shutdown of port operations scenario  Impacts   Tarnished reputation   Financial loss and costs   Systems damage, or worst, destruction   Shutdown of port operations, port paralysis  Assets affected Stakeholders involved   IT systems   OT systems and networks   OT end-devices   People   Information and data   All port stakeholders  Attack details   The port updates one of its servers with a compromised update (ransomware) – other ways can be used  to introduce a ransomware on port systems, for example social engineering (phishing or USB-drop for  example) or bad network segregation (wide exposure to the Internet)   The ransomware spreads into the port’s network, using some unpatched vulnerabilities and lack of  network segmentation;   The ransomware is executed on port’s systems and devices and steal stored credentials   The ransomware executes a mechanism of elevation of privileges, using bad segregation of highly  privileged accounts   The ransomware spreads into other part of the port’s network by the same mechanism   The infected systems and devices are encrypted and cannot be used anymore   A ransom is required while all the systems and devices are down  Main security measures   OP-01: Endpoint protection strategy   OP-05: Define a vulnerability management process   OP-16: Creation of a Cybersecurity Operations Centre (SOC)   TP-01: Network segmentation  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  35   TP-13: Privilege Account Management (PAM)   TP-15: Anti-malware and anti-virus management   TP-23: Update management process   TP-24: Source of update verification   PS-15: Ensure cyber resilience of port systems   PS-17: Define a crisis management organization  Scenario C – Compromise of Port Community System for manipulation or theft of data  This scenario is a targeted attack on the systems used for the exchanges between all  stakeholders (usually the Port Community Systems). The objectives are to falsify the information  on port services to disrupt the operations or to modify some operations in the systems (implying  financial loss for the port). This scenario is realistic because those systems are exposed to all  port stakeholders by different ways (usually using different networks and systems, through VPN  access, or through the Internet, most of the time via machine-to-machine interconnections).  Indeed, those systems are increasingly automatically interconnected with external systems (via  API, EDI exchanges, etc.): third parties’ systems thus become an additional attack surface to  reach port systems.  Because these systems are different from one port to another, there can be multiple ways to set  up this attack: for example, if the Port Community Systems are exposed through a web  application, the attacker can exploit common vulnerabilities of web applications; if it is an  application developed internally by developers employed by the port and if standard security  development rules are not applied, specific vulnerabilities can be exploited; etc.  Figure 9: Compromise of Port Community System for manipulation or theft of data scenario  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  36  Impacts   Financial loss   Disruption of port operations   Accident (related to Dangerous goods management)  Assets affected Stakeholders involved   Port Community Systems (PCS)   Finance systems   ERP   Port Authority   Port Terminal Operators  Attack details   Depending on the PCS architecture and network exposition:  o If the PCS is exposed to third parties through a dedicated web interface, the attacker can exploit  common web application vulnerabilities to have access to the PCS (SQL injection, brute force  attack, exploitation of bad access rights segregation, etc.);  o If the PCS is automatically connected with external systems through data exchanges protocols  such as API or EDI protocols, the attacker can organise a man-in-the-middle attack by  intercepting the data exchanges and modifying them in case data exchanges are not secured  enough;  o Or if direct access to the PCS itself out of the port network is possible, the attacker can exploit  weak network security measures to have direct access to this system and use credentials he  may have stolen through social engineering;   Once the attacker has non-authorised access to the PCS with enough access rights, he can manipulate  data directly to the PCS (modification of the port operations, theft of critical data, deletion of data on some  operations, etc.)   The loss of integrity of the PCS data has many consequences: chaos in port operations, potential financial  loss for the port that loses information on operations preventing it from invoicing the operations carried out  or even accident if data related dangerous goods are manipulated or made unavailable.  Main security measures   PS-09: Project methodology including security assessments and checkpoints   OP-11: Strict control of third parties’ accesses   OP-16: Creation of a Cybersecurity Operations Centre (SOC)   OP-17: Regular network scans   OP-18: Perimeter security with filtering policy   OP-19: Perform regular cybersecurity audits   TP-01: Network segmentation   TP-05: Identity & Access Management (IAM) strategy   TP-08: Multi-factor authentication   TP-19: Secure mechanisms for machine-to-machine exchanges   TP-25: Log correlation and analysis systems  Scenario D – Compromise of OT systems creating a major accident in port areas  This scenario is specific to the OT world and the ICS specificities and is considered to be  realistic even no such attacks in ports are publicly known. Indeed, similar attacks occur in other  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  37  critical sectors, especially in the energy sector48. This kind of attack doesn’t need to be  generally sophisticated to be impactful and the major risks remain the connection with external  networks and systems, especially the Internet. The specificities of such attacks are the close  link between the physical and logical world: the attack usually begins in the logical world (from  the IT component) and has impacts in the physical world (damage to OT systems and end-  devices, safety and security incidents, etc.).  A port contains various OT networks, systems and end-devices used for different services and  operations and owned, managed and maintained by different stakeholders: cranes for vessel  loading and unloading in port terminals, bridges at the entry of the port to get vessels in and out,  systems in refrigerated warehouses to keep fragile foods at a safe temperature, the sensors  and systems used to transport, store and monitor dangerous goods, etc.  Figure 10: Compromise of OT systems creating a major accident in port areas scenario  48 See https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanmarcollagnier/2018/10/01/the-next-cyberattack-staying-ahead-of-hackers-is- becoming-a-greater-challenge/#3772585c4f0fy  Impacts   Shutdown of port operations, port paralysis   Systems damages, or worst, destruction   Human injuries or death   Financial loss and costs   Tarnished reputation and loss of competitiveness   Environmental disaster  Assets affected Stakeholders involved   OT systems and networks   OT end-devices   Mobile infrastructure   Fixed infrastructure   People   Port Authority   Port Terminal Operators   Service providers   Delivery chain  https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanmarcollagnier/2018/10/01/the-next-cyberattack-staying-ahead-of-hackers-is-becoming-a-greater-challenge/#3772585c4f0f https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanmarcollagnier/2018/10/01/the-next-cyberattack-staying-ahead-of-hackers-is-becoming-a-greater-challenge/#3772585c4f0f  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  38  Attack details   A maintenance laptop accessing OT control systems is compromised with a malicious code (either  through compromised USB drive or email, download of malicious software from the Internet, etc.)   The malicious code is spreading onto the OT networks and then the OT systems when the laptop  connects to it   If the Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are sophisticated (IoT, remote server, etc.), the attackers can  deploy mechanisms to command the ICS remotely   If not, the ICS code is modified to execute predefined commands contained in the malicious code   The OT end-devices, such as cranes or bridges, move erratically or unexpectedly   This can cause security and safety incident leading to damage or destruction of port infrastructure, injury  or death, etc.  Security measures   OP-01: Define an endpoint protection strategy   OP-09: Develop specific and mandatory cybersecurity training courses for some key  population   OP-12: Clearly define all relevant aspects of the partnership with third parties,  include security measures   OP-16: Creation of a Cybersecurity Operations Centre   OP-21 and OP-22: IT and OT physical protection   TP-11: Installation and configuration policy   TP-14: Dedicated administration network   TP-30: Network segmentation between IT and OT systems   TP-29 and TP-31: Consider OT and IoT systems into all the security measures and  set up specific security measures   TP-25: Log correlation and analysis systems  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  39  5. SECURITY MEASURES  5.1 SECURITY MEASURES CATEGORISATION  Development of security measures for ports was one of the focal points of this study. The  objective is to provide guidelines and recommendations for Port Authorities, private companies  operating in ports and other stakeholders involved in the port ecosystem to help prevent or  properly respond to potential cyberattacks on the port systems.  To define the categorisation of these measures, the study relied on identified cyberattack  scenarios in part 4.3 as well as security measures from policies and standards listed in section  2.2.2 and common frameworks for cybersecurity like the Reference document on security  measures for Operators of Essential Services49, ISO 27001/250 or NIST51.  Finally, a list of 22 security domains have been defined to classify all security measures in  relation with ports. To organise the domains in a logical manner, they were classified into three  main groups:   Policies   Organisational practices   Technical practices  As the target audience of this report is eligible to fall under the provisions of the NIS Directive as  Operators of Essential Services, the following measures have been developed to map to the  measures proposed in the Reference document on security measures for Operators of Essential  Services. Still, a few exceptions do exists, most notably Cloud security, Machine-to-machine  security and OT & Industrial control systems security, which indicates that a more sector-  focused approach may be pertinent to address the specificities of the maritime/port sector.  5.2 POLICIES  It is essential that ports define policies and governance in regard to IT and OT, enforcing  cybersecurity best practices, especially for most critical assets, with a risk-based approach.  5.2.1 Security policy and organisation  Security measures to implement and maintain up-to-date an information system security policy  (ISSP)   PS-01: Write and implement an information systems security policy (ISSP) which  describes all organisational and technical means and procedures, including topics related to  the OT environment. This ISSP must be approved by the port's top management team to  guarantee the high-level endorsement of the policy. Key elements of the ISSP can be  integrated in the Port Facility Security Plan required by the ISPS Code.   PS-02: Enforce security governance of both IT and OT environments through the ISSP by  describing the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder (Port Authority, terminal  operators, service providers, suppliers, etc.).  49 See http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/image/document/2018- 30/reference_document_security_measures_0040C183-FF20-ECC4-A3D11FA2A80DAAC6_53643.pdf  50 See https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html  51 See https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/image/document/2018-30/reference_document_security_measures_0040C183-FF20-ECC4-A3D11FA2A80DAAC6_53643.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/image/document/2018-30/reference_document_security_measures_0040C183-FF20-ECC4-A3D11FA2A80DAAC6_53643.pdf https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  40   PS-03: Share this ISSP with all stakeholders involved in port operations, or, if more  relevant a light version underlying each party responsibilities towards cybersecurity at port  level.   PS-04: Review annually the ISSP by considering the results of cyber security tests and  risk analysis to tackle new threats and risks.  5.2.2 Risk and Threats Management  Security measures to identify and manage continuously risks and threats related to the port  ecosystem.   PS-05: Adopt a risk-based approach to build the port cybersecurity strategy and set up a  continuous improvement process to ensure that the risks identified are under control and that  new risks are properly identified in a timely manner. Ensure identified cyber risks are  considered in safety and security plans to align cybersecurity with physical security and safety  (in particular, through the Port Facility Security Assessment required by the ISPS Code).   PS-06: Conduct and regularly update risk analysis to identify risk and threats related to the  port ecosystem. In particular, risk analysis must be conducted for new projects (SmartPort  initiatives such as Big Data, IoT, blockchain, etc.).   PS-07: Set up security indicators and assessment methods to evaluate the compliance of  the port systems and processes to the ISSP and risk management performance, by involving  several stakeholders when relevant.52   PS-08: Set up a threat intelligence process to watch continuously for vulnerabilities,  identify new risks and threats and deploy actions to mitigate them.  This measure can be improved by developing collaborative private-public initiatives of  sharing information on threat intelligence at European level.53  5.2.3 Security and privacy by design  Security measures that should be applied from the first stages of systems development and  during the development lifecycle in order to increase by design the security levels of any  solutions and applications, to protect critical data and ensure the privacy of personal data.   PS-09: Develop a project methodology including security assessments and checkpoints,  including for agile projects (risk analysis, architecture security review, security tests, security  approval, etc.) for new and existing projects, considering the criticality and exposure of the  system. More specifically, strongly include cybersecurity issues in SmartPort projects from the  design stage to implementation.   PS-10: Address privacy related issues based on applicable local and international  regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).54   PS-11: Launch a data classification project to identify critical data for port operations as  well as personal data and to protect them accordingly and to map the data flows, especially  for personal data and operational data related to vessel, dangerous goods and cargo.  52 For now, ports have developed key performance indicators (KPI) to monitor port operations performance, but still very  few have implemented key cyber risk reduction indicators (KRIs). See  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283489805_Performance_Indicators_and_Port_Authority_Management  53 As an example, in the US, The Maritime and Port Security Information Sharing & Analysis Center was created in 2015.  See https://mpsisao.org/about  54 Compliance with the GDPR is essential for ports, because major attacks against the extraction of personal data have  already taken place in the maritime sector (see Table 11).  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283489805_Performance_Indicators_and_Port_Authority_Management https://mpsisao.org/about/  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  41  5.2.4 Asset inventory and management  Security measures regarding ecosystem mapping, including assets of the ports and assets of  third-party interacting with the port assets.   PS-12: Use centralised tools for asset inventory and management and ensure that you  keep them up-to-date (applications, software platforms, networks, network components,  servers, physical devices, OT systems, administration components, etc.)55   PS-13: Define a policy regarding authorized devices and software to ensure than only  reliable components are introduced to the port network.   PS-14: Use centralised tools to monitor the different assets by adapting them according  the specificities and the associated risks (e.g. passive monitoring for OT systems) and detect  unauthorized assets.  5.2.5 Cyber resilience (Business continuity and crisis management)  Security measures set up to ensure, in case of any incident, or worst, disaster, the continuity of  port operations and recover data.   PS-15: Ensure cyber resilience of port systems by defining objectives and strategic  guidelines regarding business continuity and recovery management and set up associated  key services and processes (Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan).   PS-16: Define important parameters for port’s business continuity, such as a recovery time  objective (RTO), recovery point objective (RPO), maximum tolerable outage (MTO) and  minimum business continuity objective (MBCO).   PS-17: Define a crisis management organization by formalising a specific policy and by  setting up the associated crisis management process, including all the port stakeholders.   PS-18: Ensure the efficiency of recovery procedures by setting up annual training  exercises, making sure that all critical port stakeholders (local authorities, Port Authorities,  terminal operators, service providers, etc.) are involved as much as possible, and by  formalizing post-exercise reports.  5.3 ORGANISATIONAL PRACTICES  Ports shall define relevant practices and processes regarding IT and OT management, to be  followed by all port employees or more specifically by IT and OT teams in their daily operations  within the port ecosystem.  5.3.1 Endpoints protection and lifecycle management  Security measures related to the protection of IT end devices such as laptops, desktops,  tablets, mobile phones.   OP-01: Define an endpoint protection strategy to monitor port end-devices and to enforce  their security by implementing security tools and mechanisms such as antivirus, encryption,  mobile device management (MDM) and hardening (disabling of unnecessary services,  especially by securing USB ports in all port systems).   OP-02: Implement device and software whitelists and review the list at least annually or in  case of a major system change.   OP-03: Define a change management process to introduce any new device into the port  systems (acceptance tests, validation steps, etc.).   OP-04: Ensure all employees and contractors return their end-devices at contract  termination and define processes for secure end-devices disposal.  55 The port of Marseille launched in 2019, into its SmartPort initiatives, a project to map all the port assets:  https://lefrenchsmartportinmed.com/les-defis/defi-naval-group  https://lefrenchsmartportinmed.com/les-defis/defi-naval-group  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  42  5.3.2 Vulnerabilities management  Security measures to ensure systems are kept up to date and protected from vulnerabilities.   OP-05: Define a vulnerability management process to identify asset vulnerabilities, it can  be based on automatic and manual tools such as vulnerability scans.56   OP-06: Define intelligence processes for cybersecurity in order to be aware of newly  disclosed vulnerabilities and take quick compensatory actions (network segregation, service  disabling, etc.)   OP-07: Establish tight collaboration of OT and IT departments ensuring that their  collaboration with systems business owners, decision-making authorities and other  stakeholders is efficient and ensure a homogeneous cybersecurity level for IT and OT.  5.3.3 Human Resource Security  Security measures to ensure good mastery of IT and OT operations and awareness of all  employees.   OP-08: Ensure professional references and audits of criminal records of key personnel for  IT and OT management (system administrators, developers, etc.) and key personnel  appointed in security roles such as CISO or DPO.57   OP-09: Develop specific and mandatory

a security awareness raising program to address the whole port ecosystem,  focusing first on the main threats (e.g. social engineering).59  5.3.4 Supply chain management  Security measures to understand and secure the relationship with third parties in regards with  cybersecurity and ensure legit access to port systems.   OP-11: Strictly control access of third parties to port systems by only granting access on  demand, in a specified time window, for a specific purpose, and in a least privileged way.   OP-12: Clearly define all relevant aspects of the partnership with third parties, including  security, within the appropriate agreements and contracts, especially for critical systems  provided by third-parties (PCS, CCS, security systems, etc.)  5.3.5 Detection and Incident response  Security measures to define processes regarding detection and response of security incidents  occurring in the port ecosystem.   OP-13: Identify the risks and threats at all levels of the port to define categories of  incidents and the potential impacts by using the results of risk analysis, threat intelligence,  previous incident history, discussion with other ports, etc.  56 Indeed, every day, most of ports experience multiple vulnerability scans on public IPs from hackers: to thwart these  attacks, ports must remediate vulnerabilities before the hackers find them. See  https://piernext.portdebarcelona.cat/en/technology/are-ports-prepared-to-deal-with-threats-from-hackers  57 For example, the port of Rotterdam appointed in 2016 a Port Cyber Resilience Officer:  https://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/news-and-press-releases/port-of-rotterdam-appoints-port-cyber-resilience-officer  58 For example, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore have collaborated with the Singapore Shipping Association  and Polytechnic to develop a new Maritime Cybersecurity Training course of maritime personnel:  https://smartmaritimenetwork.com/2019/05/16/maritime-cybersecurity-operations-centre-opens-in-singapore  59 See an example of awareness program in the EMSA website: http://www.emsa.europa.eu/implementation- tasks/maritime-cybersecurity.html  https://piernext.portdebarcelona.cat/en/technology/are-ports-prepared-to-deal-with-threats-from-hackers/ https://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/news-and-press-releases/port-of-rotterdam-appoints-port-cyber-resilience-officer https://smartmaritimenetwork.com/2019/05/16/maritime-cybersecurity-operations-centre-opens-in-singapore/ http://www.emsa.europa.eu/implementation-tasks/maritime-cybersecurity.html http://www.emsa.europa.eu/implementation-tasks/maritime-cybersecurity.html  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  43   OP-14: Define a policy and procedures for incident detection and reaction including the  description of the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder of the port or state level (if  applicable), as well as the coordination method and communicate this to all relevant parties.   OP-15: Improve and keep these procedures up-to-date by testing them through training  exercise, and identification of new feared events.   OP-16: Consider the setup of a Cybersecurity Operations Centre (SOC) including IT and  OT environments to support security and cyber incidents. The SOCs of the different  stakeholders must collaborate (or can be mutualised) to ensure the detection and reaction of  incidents at port level.60   OP-17: Define alerting procedures and identify the right contacts for each stakeholder of  the port depending on the incident criticality (CISO, port management and board, national  authorities, CSIRTs, etc.).   OP-18: Implement procedures for incident reporting and continuous improvement,  5.3.6 Control and auditing  Security measures to control IT and OT compliance to ISSP and to security best practices.   OP-19: Perform regular cybersecurity audits (penetration testing, red team, etc.) to check  the application and effectiveness of security measures and assess the level of security of port  systems.   OP-20: Perform periodic reviews of network rules, access control privileges and asset  configurations.  5.3.7 IT and OT physical protection  Security measures to prevent unauthorized physical access to IT and OT systems.   OP-21: Ensure IT and OT systems hosted in the port are protected following established  best practices for safety (fire detection, air-conditioning, etc.) and security (access control,  CCTV, etc.)   OP-22: Keep traceability of all maintenance operations done on IT and OT physical  systems.  5.4 TECHNICAL MEASURES  Ports shall enforce several technical measures in order to prevent cyber-attacks on ports IT or  OT systems, detect and react to any attack and be resilient in case of a major impact from a  cyberattack.  5.4.1 Network security  Security measures to avoid unauthorized access to port systems, mitigate the propagation of IT  security incidents within systems or subsystems and protect systems from unauthorized access.   TP-01: Define a network segmentation architecture to limit the propagation of attacks  within the port systems and avoid direct access from the Internet to very critical port systems  such as VTS/VTMIS and security systems.   TP-02: Perform regular network scans to detect unauthorised and malicious networks  (WIFI for example) as well as end-devices acting as bridges between two segregated zones  (with interfaces in two network zones for example).   TP-03:  Define perimetric security, with filtering rules.  60 For example, the port of Amsterdam established in 2019 a cyber hotline and created the CYREN network (Cyber  Resilient North Sea Canal Area) that can be contacted by any companies working in the port. See  https://smartmaritimenetwork.com/2019/01/30/new-cyber-programme-for-port-of-amsterdam  https://smartmaritimenetwork.com/2019/01/30/new-cyber-programme-for-port-of-amsterdam/  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  44  5.4.2 Access control  Security measures to ensure legit access to port systems.   TP-04: Set up centralised tools to manage identities and access rights to the port systems.  If different tools are set up, due to diversity of the port stakeholders (Port Authorities, terminal  operators, local authorities, third-parties, etc.) and their systems, automatic or manual  provisioning can be defined.   TP-05: Define an Identity & Access Management (IAM) strategy and its associated  processes to manage the lifecycle of identities and their access rights (automatic deactivation  of accounts, regular review, least privilege principle and segregation of duties61, password  guidelines, etc.). This strategy must be, as much as possible, built in common with the  stakeholders of the port ecosystem.   TP-06: Forbid as much as possible the use of generic accounts, by enforcing unique and  individual accounts in all port systems, especially for sensitive systems (PCS, CCS, TOS,  VTS/VTMIS, security systems).   TP-07: Enforce, whenever possible, password complexity policies and rules for systems.   TP-08: Implement multi-factor authentication mechanisms for accounts accessing critical  applications (especially for PCS, CCS, TOS, VTS/VTMIS) and data (personal data, sensitive  operational data such detailed information on vessels, dangerous goods and cargo), and in  case of poorly or unprotected environments (external access through Internet for example,  third-party access from other corporate networks, etc.).   TP-09: Consider physical access in the access lifecycle (port facilities, port area, buildings,  etc.) and define specific measures for remote access.   TP-10: Regularly perform accounts and access right reviews to ensure accesses are still  legit, especially for accounts that have access to sensitive data (personal data, sensitive  operational data, dangerous goods information, etc.).  5.4.3 Administration and Configuration Management  Security measures to ensure secured administration of IT and OT assets.   TP-11: Define installation and configuration policy and rules and establish security  baselines to only install needed services and functionalities and authorise essential equipment  for the security and the functioning of port systems.   TP-12: Set up specific accounts only used by administrators to perform administration  operations (installation, configuration, maintenance, supervision, etc.).   TP-13: Define Privilege Account Management (PAM) process, security requirements on  those accounts and rules to manage their lifecycle.

CONCLUSIONS  As ports undergo their digital transformation, cybersecurity should be viewed not only as a key  factor to be considered in terms of keeping pace with the technical evolutions but also as an  enabler of further developments and automation. Considering the complexity of both the port  landscape in terms of involved stakeholders and communication flows and system interactions,  but also in terms of the evolving IT and OT environment, this is by no means an easy or  straightforward endeavour.  This report aims to serve as a reference document for stakeholders involved in port  cybersecurity. The previous chapters provide an overview of the port landscape, including the  policy context, a high-level reference model and a comprehensive asset taxonomy and discuss  their cybersecurity dimension by listing the existing threats and security challenges and by  describing some key attack scenarios. Finally, the present document provides a list of practical  baseline security measures to strengthen cybersecurity in port operations and systems.  Still, people responsible for port cybersecurity, i.e. CISOs, CIOs, IT Managers etc. from Port  Authorities and Terminal Operators are encouraged to go beyond the good practices proposed  in the present document and address additional topics as well, such as:   Awareness raising about cybersecurity at board and staff level; the former will likely  increase the strategic attention paid to cybersecurity risks and result in higher  investment and more resources to mitigate them, while the latter is essential in  ensuring cybersecurity in day-to-day operations in ports   Improved information sharing amongst port operators (port authorities, terminal  operators etc.) and between port operators and other maritime stakeholders, such as  shipping companies. Sharing information on threats, incidents and good practices is  key in improving the overall cybersecurity posture of the sector and several proven  models, such as ISACs, can be adapted to provide tangible results.   Addressing cybersecurity in the supply chain. While a holistic approach to address  this complex issue is not an easy task, several good practices can be adopted or  investigated, including cybersecurity certification of critical components, well-defined  supplier obligations for the entire lifecycle of products/services (e.g. vulnerability  management, patching), specific provisions for supply chain management etc.   Integrating interdependencies cybersecurity risks in the overall cyber risk  management process to account for the multiple and complex interconnections of  ports with other sectors.

Each port has its own governance and  infrastructure model which depends on services delivered, local authorities governance,  challenges linked to port geographical situation and national regulations. Ports play a crucial  role at different levels for many sectors and have been the successful pioneers in Europe for  interconnecting the different types of transport. As a main vehicle for European imports and  exports (food, commodities, etc.) with the rest of the world, ports enable also trade and contacts  between all European nations. Moreover, ports are important nodes for passengers and  vehicles transportation (inter and extra-EU) and play a key role in European fishing activity.  Ports ensure also the security and the supply of energy, vital for all EU Member States (fuel,  electricity, gas, etc.). Finally, ports have strong impact on society as a source of employment  and taking responsibility for pollution prevention.  Additionally, at the European Union level ports are a cornerstone of the development of the  Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T). Moreover, they are at the heart of the maritime  ecosystem and as such, key to promote a maritime ecosystem with fair competition, non-  discriminatory access to services and efficient use. In May 2013, the European Commission  adopted a set of initiatives to increase the competitiveness and the attractiveness of the TEN-T  ports: 329 European ports were identified as key ports63.  Table 5: Key statistics about ports role in the European Union  Key Roles Key Statistics  Port, as a main  gateway for the  European trade  Almost 90% of the EU’s external freight trade is seaborne, short sea shipping represents one third of intra- EU exchanges in terms of ton-kilometres and 74% of EU trade goes by ship.64  Importance in  worldwide trade  Europe counts 3 ports in the top 15 world’s biggest ports: Rotterdam (11th), Hamburg (14th), Antwerp (15th);  all three representing12% of goods handled at a global scale and 20% for EU.65  Key role in energy  sector  EU ports have a key role in energy sector66 : they are energy hubs for conventional and renewable  energies and 25% of the ports have more than 50% of their traffic linked to energy commodities67  Passenger and  vehicle transport  Each year, more than 400 million passengers embark and disembark at European ports.68  Social issues 1.5 million workers are employed in European ports69.  Fishing ports  EU is the 4th largest producer worldwide for fish, counting for about 5% of global fisheries. EU trade (i.e.  imports and exports) has increased over the past few years, reaching 29.1 billion € in 2014. EU is a net  importer of fisheries products and trade between EU countries is very significant and plays an essential  role in the EU’s fisheries trade.70  63 See https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/modes/maritime/ports/doc/2014-04-29-brochure-ports.pdf  64 See https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime_en  65 See https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime/infographics_en  66 See https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime/ports/ports_en  67 See https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics- explained/index.php/Maritime_ports_freight_and_passenger_statistics#Liquid_bulk_made_up_37.4.C2.A0.25_of_the_total_cargo_handled  68 See https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime_en  69 See https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime/ports/ports_en  70 See https://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/sites/fisheries/files/docs/body/pcp_en.pdf  https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/modes/maritime/ports/doc/2014-04-29-brochure-ports.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime_en https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime/infographics_en https://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/sites/fisheries/files/docs/body/pcp_en.pdf  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  55  The ranking of biggest European ports is different depending on the activities: the biggest ports  related to freight activities are mainly centralised in the North of Europe (Netherlands, Belgium  or Germany for the Top 3), while those related to passenger transport activities are mainly  situated in the South of Europe or in the Nordics. The EU fishing ports are not so big in  comparison with the world fishing ports – only 7 European ports are in the Top 100 biggest  fishing ports - and are mainly located in the Nordics.

Indeed, ports  increasingly rely on IT and OT to be more competitive (through standardization, digitalization  and automation), adapt to policies and regulations (especially for administrative procedures or  environment protection) and adapt to new maritime assets.  Table 7: Example of stakes leading to digital transformation for ports  Stake Explanation  Integrated logistic  chain development  In order to boost its attractiveness and performance, ports have to offer to their clients the most efficient  global and integrated logistic chain: they provide value-added services that includes integrated services.  For example, some ports now offer the service of filling in customs declarations on behalf of maritime  companies.72 The port systems become then a central point for data exchange for all port ecosystem  stakeholders.  Environmental  stakes  In April 2018, at the 22nd session of Marine Environment Protection Committee, IMO adopted a strategy to  reduce pollution such as gas emission in the maritime sector. In parallel, ESPO presented its annual  Environmental Report for 2018 at the Greenport Congress, including performance benchmark indicators  and the Top 10 Environmental priorities of the ports. New technologies will help ports to reach their  objectives in terms of sustainability.73  Digitalization and  standardisation of  administrative  procedures  Administrative procedures related to the maritime ecosystem are often complex and time-consuming.  Several initiatives have been launched to digitalise these procedures and set up modern electronic data  systems. In a 2009 European Commission Communication, a true “European maritime transport space  without barriers” is established to improve electronic transmission74. The notion of “single window” has  also developed to streamline the access to the various ICT systems from a unique portal for the whole port  community. Other “single window” systems are developed by EMSA at National (NSW) and EU level  (EMSW).75  New generation of  vessels  Two stakes are related with the construction of new generation of vessels and will impact strongly the  ports: the vessels are built to be bigger and more and more connected.  The new generation of vessels are built to be more connected to reduce cost and security issues. The ship  builders are already designing the autonomous ships that could go to sea with strong impacts on ports IT  environments.76  Ports must be increasingly innovative and find ways to address those stakes while keeping their  operations safe and secured. This is one of the reasons why the concept of “Smart Port”77 has  emerged. Through this concept, we can find different types of innovations and initiatives,  detailed in Table 8: Detailed innovations that ports set up linked with “Smart Port” concept: IoT,  blockchain, cloud, automation, artificial intelligence and many more.78 Those innovations bring  also new stakes in terms of cybersecurity as they place IT and OT at heart of ports operations.  72 For example, in the port of Rotterdam, the customs declarations can be filled in through the Port Community System:  https://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/doing-business/services/service-range/port-customs  73 See https://www.espo.be/news/espo-publishes-environmental-report-2018-top-10-en  74 See Modernisation of Port Authorities' Management Information Systems (PMIS), Jonas Mendes Constante – Fundación  Valenciaport, Martina Grzancic – Luka Kopler  75 See http://www.emsa.europa.eu/related-projects/emsw.html  76 See https://www.rolls-royce.com/~/media/Files/R/Rolls-Royce/documents/customers/marine/ship-intel/rr-ship-intel-aawa-8pg.pdf  77 See SmartPort definition: http://parisinnovationreview.com/articles-en/what-is-a-smart-port  78 See Port Digitalization with Open Data: Challenges, Opportunities, and Integrations:  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321853773_Digital_transformation_in_maritime_ports_analysis_and_a_game_the oretic_framework  https://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/doing-business/services/service-range/port-customs https://www.espo.be/news/espo-publishes-environmental-report-2018-top-10-en http://www.emsa.europa.eu/related-projects/emsw.html https://www.rolls-royce.com/~/media/Files/R/Rolls-Royce/documents/customers/marine/ship-intel/rr-ship-intel-aawa-8pg.pdf http://parisinnovationreview.com/articles-en/what-is-a-smart-port https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321853773_Digital_transformation_in_maritime_ports_analysis_and_a_game_theoretic_framework https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321853773_Digital_transformation_in_maritime_ports_analysis_and_a_game_theoretic_framework  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  57  Table 8: Detailed innovations that ports set up linked with “Smart Port” concept  Innovations Details  Internet of Things  (IoT)  Various ports are studying or launching an IoT project to improve their competitiveness and their performance  and monitor their infrastructure to prevent security or safety incidents. Applied to maritime traffic surveillance,  infrastructure management and terminal operations on goods or passengers, an IoT platform could monitor the  port environment and operations, collect data to optimize processes and improve the decision-making process.  This would be possible through the implementation of sensors and RFID technology on port assets.79  More specifically, the port of Rotterdam has launched his own IoT platform by implementing different sensors  on buoys, walls and quays to allow port actors to identify the best timing and location for a ship to dock.80  Cloud  In order to coordinate all the stakeholders of their ecosystem and enable an efficient and real-time exchange of  data in a centralised way, some ports have recently launched Cloud projects to improved operations efficiency  and develop “Port Single Window” systems, central systems to manage all data exchange related to the port  operations and mandatory declarations.  For example, SOGET, a public-private partnership between the Port Community of Le Havre, Port of Le Havre  Authority and French Customs, in charge of developing the e-Maritime Port Single Window, has developed a  partnership with a cloud provider to base its solution on Cloud technology.81  Big Data  The entire port ecosystem manages everyday a vast amount of data for different objectives (data related to  monitor the movements of ships and the movements of cargo or container, to manage the port infrastructure,  etc.). Today, in most ports, the potential of the data is not yet fully exploited because the data are often used in  silos without correlating them. Some ports are currently launching Big Data projects to improve port operations,  processes, security and safety. For example, collecting and correlating information on ship positions arriving,  leaving or staying in ports and weather can enable to prevent accidents.82  For example, the port of Valencia has recently launched a Big data project to improve the efficiency of terminal  logistics to optimize the operations and set up an advanced dashboard.83  Blockchain  Seaborne trade is very inclined to malicious activities such as organized crime: a real need exists today in port  ecosystem for data trust and privacy, especially for container management, that it is accentuated by the  complex panorama of stakeholders included in the logistic chain of a port. Indeed, to transport a container, it  can involve more than 30 different parties, with an average of 200 interactions between them. The application  of blockchain on port operations and processes seems to be an excellent way for ports to bring trust and  privacy with smart contracts.  Indeed, the port of Antwerp has recently collaborated with a blockchain start-up to develop a solution adapted  to the port processes concerning certificates (for instance, phytosanitary certificates).84  Automation  One of the key success factors for the increase of the competitiveness, the efficiency and the performance of a  port is to automate as much as possible port operations and processes. Numerous innovations are developed  today with ports to automate these processes at all levels. For example, ports are deploying aircraft and  aquatics drones or also automated gates, studies are being carried out to make cranes autonomous, etc.  For instance, the ports of Rotterdam and Amsterdam have authorized aerial and marine drones in their areas  to improve the port operations (maintenance inspections, management of incidents and emergencies, etc.)85  Prediction and  analytics through  artificial  intelligence  In parallel of projects of automation, Big Data, IoT, etc., artificial intelligence can bring an in-depth analysis of  the data related to all port operations and processes and deploy a predictive model of the behaviour of port  operations. For example, the artificial intelligence can give to the terminal operators a dynamic forecast of the  workload of their workers, such as truck drivers or dockworkers that evolve according to the changes in the  port conditions and environment, such as real ship arrival time or saturation of access routes.86  The port of Antwerp has recently launched a data science project to better optimize the operational chain,  anticipate bottlenecks and improve decision-making process.87  79 See https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261343481_Intelligent_ports_based_on_Internet_of_Things and  https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2016/04/01/the-hamburg-port-authoritys-impressive-iot-project/#50f7ac776c64  80 See https://www.alliancy.fr/a-laffiche/internet-objets-mtom/2018/04/04/rotterdam-connecte-entierement-son-port  81 See https://news.microsoft.com/fr-fr/2018/10/15/soget-et-microsoft-un-partenariat-strategique-pour-une-digitalisation- securisee-des-ports-francais-et-mondiaux/  82 See https://www.patersonsimons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TMS_SmartPort_InsightBee_Report-to- GUIDE_01.02.18.pdf  83 See https://www.big-data-value.eu/pilot/transforming-transport-ports-valencia/  84 See https://www.i-scoop.eu/blockchain-smart-port-project-case-container-release-port-antwerp and  https://www.portofantwerp.com/en/news/antwerp-blockchain-pilot-pioneers-secure-and-efficient-document-workflow  85 See https://www.portofamsterdam.com/en/port-amsterdam/drones-amsterdam-port-area and  https://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/news-and-press-releases/water-drone-is-rotterdams-latest-port-innovation  86 See https://piernext.portdebarcelona.cat/en/technology/artificial-intelligence-ports-are-beginning-to-take-up-positions  87 See https://en.blog.businessdecision.com/how-is-the-port-of-antwerp-optimising-logistics-with-data-science  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261343481_Intelligent_ports_based_on_Internet_of_Things https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2016/04/01/the-hamburg-port-authoritys-impressive-iot-project/#50f7ac776c64 https://news.microsoft.com/fr-fr/2018/10/15/soget-et-microsoft-un-partenariat-strategique-pour-une-digitalisation-securisee-des-ports-francais-et-mondiaux/ https://news.microsoft.com/fr-fr/2018/10/15/soget-et-microsoft-un-partenariat-strategique-pour-une-digitalisation-securisee-des-ports-francais-et-mondiaux/ https://www.patersonsimons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TMS_SmartPort_InsightBee_Report-to-GUIDE_01.02.18.pdf https://www.patersonsimons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TMS_SmartPort_InsightBee_Report-to-GUIDE_01.02.18.pdf https://www.big-data-value.eu/pilot/transforming-transport-ports-valencia/ https://www.i-scoop.eu/blockchain-smart-port-project-case-container-release-port-antwerp/ https://www.portofantwerp.com/en/news/antwerp-blockchain-pilot-pioneers-secure-and-efficient-document-workflow https://www.portofamsterdam.com/en/port-amsterdam/drones-amsterdam-port-area https://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/news-and-press-releases/water-drone-is-rotterdams-latest-port-innovation https://piernext.portdebarcelona.cat/en/technology/artificial-intelligence-ports-are-beginning-to-take-up-positions/ https://en.blog.businessdecision.com/how-is-the-port-of-antwerp-optimising-logistics-with-data-science/  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  58  C ANNEX: CATEGORIES OF  PORT STAKEHOLDERS  Table 9: Categories of port stakeholders  Categories Sub-Categories Description  Port Authority  The Port Authority, a governmental or almost governmental public authority, sitting at the heart of the  interactions between all stakeholders, in collaboration with other local and national authorities, is  responsible of maintaining and developing the port infrastructure and the transport infrastructure, ensuring  the global safety and security of port and ship operations through the harbour master. Moreover, the Port  Authority oversees some controls and inspections in respect with national, European and international  legislations.  Port Terminal  Operators  Terminal operators, usually private companies, are responsible for maintaining security and safety on the  land they rent from the Port Authority and managing the services related to terminal operations (loading  and unloading cargo or passengers for instance).  Vessels related  stakeholders  Shipowners and crew  The shipowner is in charge of equipping and exploiting a commercial  vessel, hiring licensed crew and captains to operate the ship.  Flag state  The flag state of a commercial vessel is the jurisdiction under whose laws  the vessel is registered: the flag state enforced regulations such as  inspection, certification, and security requirements. Each vessel operates  and navigates under the law of its flag state that list and enforce  international conventions (IMO conventions notably).  Ship insurance  Ship insurance covers the loss or damage of ships, cargo, terminals, and  any transport by which the property is transferred, acquired, or held  between the points of origin and the destination.  Delivery chain  stakeholders  Shipping and maritime  freight companies  These private companies are in charge of transferring and forwarding  freight from a place to another, by bookings services for all kind of transport  (maritime transport, railways, etc.).  Ferries and cruise lines  These private companies oversee offering to passengers’ transport  services through ferries and cruise  Fisheries  According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, a  fishery is typically defined in terms of the \"people involved, species or type  of fish, area of water or seabed, method of fishing, class of boats, and  purpose of the activities or a combination of the foregoing features\".  Hinterland liaisons  This category relates to all stakeholders, private as public, interacting in the  multi-modal ecosystem of the port: waterways, roads, railways, etc.  Freight sender and  consignee  The sender is the person, company or organisation, at the origin of the  forwarding of a good or other item which can be sent by sea.  The consignee is the receiver of this good, also a person, a company or an  organisation.  Maritime agent  Also called ship agent, the maritime agent acts as a representative of the  shipowner to fulfil the requirements for each port the ship visits.  Service providers  Ship services providers  A ship can book different services to the port. For some of these services,  the port delegates these services to external companies (e.g. refuelling).  Dockers  The dockers are employed by private companies – which could be terminal  operators – to realise the terminal operations (e.g. loading and unloading  vessel cargo).  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  59  Security providers  To ensure security in ports, private companies operates and maintains  security systems in the port (such as CCTV).  Infrastructure providers  A port can contract private companies to operate in the port to ensure the  installation of port infrastructure and its maintenance.  Ship repair services  Shipping companies or shipowners can book ship repair services to the port  for damage cases of all kinds, delivered by different actors depending on  their expertise (propulsion systems, governors, etc.).  ICT integrators  To support the port processes and operations, ports use daily Information  and Communication Technology (ICT) systems which are, for most of them,  set up, operated and maintained by private specialised companies in IT and  Communications development.  Classification societies  As a non-governmental organisation, classification societies set standards  for the construction and operation of ships and offshore structures and  certify that the construction of a ship complies with those standards by  delivering a certificate.  Other entities  The port ecosystem includes many secondary actors, the most important of which are as follows:  - Banks: As in any business, ports deliver different services that they invoice to shipping companies and  other stakeholders. Banks are therefore a key factor in these services  - Organisations and associations, created for different objectives and at different levels. For instance, the  ESPO (European Sea Ports Organisations) is acting as the main interface between European seaports  and European institutions, IAPH (International association of Ports and Harbours) is the global trade  association for seaports worldwide, the IPCSA (International Port Community System Association, etc.)  - Innovation, Research and Education stakeholders: the port ecosystem is composed by different actors  acting strongly in favour of innovation (such as start-accelerators, with, for example PortXL, alliances for  developing Smart Port), research (research and expertise centres) and education (universities).  Other commercial providers  Other bodies  Customs  The customs authorities are responsible of the administration and the  application of national and international customs law through the collection  of duties and taxes, in particular for importation, exportation, movement or  storage of goods in ports.  Fishery Control  The fishery control authorities are in charge to ensure the fishing of good  quality and sustainable seafood by defining controls and requirements that  the fishing industry must follow. For instance, they control the permit for a  vessel to fish, the origin of the fish catches, etc.  Coast Guards  Coast Guards are maritime organizations in charge of ensuring navigation  safety and security and enforcing the law on the maritime territory under the  responsibility of the country.  Border Control  The border control authorities are responsible of taking measures to  monitor the state borders and to regulate the movement of people, animals  and goods. In the EU, with Schengen agreement, the crews and  passengers are controlled only once when they come from a non-EU  country.  Port State Control  The Port State Control is responsible of making inspections of foreign ships  (with a flag state different from the port) in ports to verify the compliance of  the ships with international and national regulations. The Port State Control  can take actions against non-compliant ships (sanctions, etc.).  Civil Security, police and  rescue at sea  The civil security and police authorities are responsible of law enforcement  and of deploying measures to fight against criminals (terrorism, organized  crime, etc.). Each port has its own local civil security and police. According  to local and national specificities, they can also oversee rescue at sea to  assist people and vessels in case of distress situations.  Prevention of Pollution  The prevention of pollution authorities are responsible of ensuring that  national and international regulations are applied in the port ecosystem  (management of ship waste, etc.).  PORT CYBERSECURITY  November 2019  60  Cities  At local level, the cities are strongly involved in the development and the  operations of ports: investment in port infrastructure, in maritime tourism,  planification of road construction, financing university research, etc. The  cities are a major stakeholder involved in the construction of each port  strategy.  International bodies  At international level, they are also different bodies involved in port  ecosystem, for instance: IMO (International Maritime Organization), WCO  (World Customs Organization), IMB (International Maritime Bureau, a  specialised division of the International Chamber of Commerce acting  against all types of maritime crime and malpractice), CIMSEC (Centre for  International Maritime Security), etc.  EU Agencies  Numerous EU agencies are involved in the port ecosystem, interacting  mainly with the local and national authorities detailed above, for instance:  EMSA (European Maritime Safety Agency), EFCA (European Fisheries  Control Agency), FRONTEX (European Border and Coast Guard Agency),  EUROPOL (European Police Office), ENISA (European Union Agency for  Network and Information Security Agency), etc.  Maritime administrations  and national authorities  and bodies  At national level, we find the same types of authorities as at the  international and European level, considering the specificities of each  Member State: maritime administrations88, Ministry of Transport, etc.  88 See http://emsa.europa.eu/overview-maritime-administrations.html  http://emsa.europa.eu/overview-maritime-administrations.html  T P  -0 2  -1 9  -8 6  9 -E  N -N  ABOUT ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) has been working to make Europe  cyber secure since 2004. ENISA works with the EU, its member states, the private sector  and Europe’s citizens to develop advice and recommendations on good practice in  information security. It assists EU member states in implementing relevant EU legislation  and works to improve the resilience of Europe’s critical information infrastructure and  networks. ENISA seeks to enhance existing expertise in EU member states by supporting  the development of cross-border communities committed to improving network and  information security throughout the EU.  Since 2019, it has been drawing up cybersecurity  certification schemes. More information about ENISA and its work can be found at  www.enisa.europa.eu.

    "abstract": "Developed in collaboration with several EU ports, this report intends to provide a useful foundation on which CIOs and CISOs of entities involved in the port ecosystem, especially port authorities and terminal operators, can build their cybersecurity strategy. The study lists the main threats posing risks to the port ecosystem and describes key cyber-attack scenarios that could impact them. This approach allowed the identification of security measures that ports shall put in place to better protect themselves from cyberattack. The main measures identified intend to serve as good practices for people responsible for cybersecurity implementation. The study can be useful for other stakeholders in the broader community within the port ecosystem, such shipping companies and maritime policy makers."

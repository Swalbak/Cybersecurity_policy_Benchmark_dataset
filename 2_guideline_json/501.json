Conclusions 44  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  05  Executive Summary  Telecommunication is an industry that can be considered as the backbone of modern economies.  Economic development is strongly related to the existence and well-functioning of the  telecommunication networks. Telecommunications demands advanced technologies and processes,  playing a vital yet growing role in the European Union (EU). Current developments have determined  some changes within customer preferences over the years, changes that have made it crucial for  telecommunications operators to illustrate transparency, customer innovation and bring new services  to the market. At the same time, operators have to maintain high security and availability standards.  Security incidents affecting this sector can have detrimental effects that can manifest themselves in a  number of ways.  Measuring the impact of incidents has become one of the toughest challenges nowadays, given the  multitude of factors/indicators that must be taken into consideration. To address this issue, indicators  are used, accompanied by thresholds, to assess the impact of incidents. This approach allows evaluation  of incidents from various perspectives, such as business perspective, compliance with regulations, root  causes, impact on customers etc. Incidents can vary in nature, and this report tries to include as many  indicators as possible, so that as many types of incidents as possible are covered.  The overall purpose of the document is to provide guidelines to national regulatory authorities (NRAs)  and telecommunications providers (providers) within EU member states, to assist them in the process  of measuring the impact of security incidents affecting electronic communication services.  This report comes as a practical approach, and contains the view of both NRAs and providers within EU,  on real indicators used for measuring significance of incidents affecting telecommunication networks  and services. Therefore, interested stakeholders have at their disposal a catalogue of indicators to be  used to tailor impact assessment and design the corresponding solutions.  As the survey performed had also the objective of analysing the approached taken by NRAs and providers  in defining indicators and significance, the results indicated that while there are some discrepancies  between NRAs and providers in terms of why they measure security incidents, and for what purpose  they use certain indicators over others, it is still plausible to state that the approaches taken and  indicators used by both parties are more similar than they are different, as more than half of the  respondents have stated this. Further developments regarding harmonisations of the approaches taken  are still needed but overall the situation is running smoothly, the processes are in place, and the  reporting of significant incidents is being done at national and EU level. From the study, it was realized  that approaches taken by NRAs and providers varied depending on certain country-level factors. Some  were much more mature than others. Due to several advantageous circumstances, some NRAs  experienced strong cooperation with their providers when it came to implementing the necessary  changes.  Having said this, it is advised that making use of a standardized approach among NRAs and providers can  help derive more precise results in the incident reporting process. So, along with the list of indicators to  use, the key recommendation from the study is that NRAs and providers should further increase the  level of harmonisations in the approach taken to measure the impact of security incidents. Studying the  approaches taken, including the benefits and challenges of each measurement method led to gaining an  insight of the most common approaches used to assess security incidents. The list below summarises the  main classes of indicators, as identified during the study:   User/connection related indicators  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  06   Time/duration related indicators   Geographic area related indicators   Indicators related to infrastructure and services affected   Root cause dependent indicators   Economic impact related indicators   Indicators related to cyberattacks   Impact on confidentiality, availability and integrity  ENISA recommends the extensive use of this list of indicators, in related activities carried out by both  NRAs and telecommunications providers within EU and abroad. Measuring the impact of security  incidents, is a rather difficult process and the use of the current study can bring additional clarity.  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  07  1. Introduction  Background  Advances in electronic communication services have resulted in many changes, altering, reshaping and  even modernizing the way in which people communicate with each other. Some industries are strongly  revolutionized, especially those that deal with human senses, including entertainment, healthcare,  education and advertising. Electronic communications services warrant a smooth transmission of data  in this strongly interconnected world by providing the infrastructure for other business services to run.  Electronic communication services also play a significant role in national security, emergency response  and even in the economic well-being of a country. As a result, an outage in any one of these areas can  result in severe consequences. For example, impact could range from strong customer dissatisfaction to  impairing security and public safety and leading to economic repercussions.  In that context, measuring the impact of security incidents affecting telecommunications providers has  become a necessity in nowadays interconnected digital market. The European Commission (EC) has  made significant steps in this direction, with the 2009 Telecom Package, that included Art. 13a, a  regulation enforcing mandatory incident reporting for security incidents in the telecommunication  networks. The purpose of Article 13a of the Directive 2009/140 EC is to ensure the security and integrity  of electronic communication networks and services in the European Union, mostly by preventing  disruption of networks and services among others. As only significant incidents had to be reported,  meaning the ones with greater impact, member states have struggled for some time to define  “significant”.  To be able to identify significant incidents, providers and NRAS need to know how to measure their  impact. Measuring the impact of security incidents is not always easy as there are several different  variables which play a role. Furthermore, the impact of an incident can be evaluated from different  perspectives, making the process rather complicated.  By studying the indicators used to measure the impact of security incidents, especially the ones affecting  the availability of the service (disruptions), this report aims at collecting good practices and expertise in  order to share it across, encourage the exchange of these practices between member states and improve  harmonisation of the existing approaches. Evaluating the direct and indirect impact of security related  incidents can be crucial as a basis for investment in recovery strategies as well as investment in  prevention and mitigation strategies.  Scope of the document  This report aims to provide guidelines to NRAs and providers, to assist them in the process of measuring  the impact of security incidents affecting the availability of electronic communication services. Therefore,  interested stakeholders, especially telecommunications providers, will have at their disposal a catalogue  of indicators to be used to tailor impact assessment and design the corresponding solutions.  The goal of this study is to help policy makers at EU and member states level, along with the European  Commission and ENISA, develop better policies in order to further increase the security and resilience of  the electronic communications sector.  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  08  Target audience  Electronic communications providers (named providers as for the rest of the document), professionals  in the telecommunications industry, along with national regulatory agencies (NRAs) within the EU are  the main targets of this report. The report is also addressed to experts within the policy making area,  such as European Commission.  Methodology  The study was carried out in 3 phases. Firstly, a desktop research was performed to review approaches  taken by different member states and non-EU countries.  Next, a range of NRAs and service providers were identified and selected in order to complete an online  survey. A questionnaire was designed and communicated with those who agreed to take part.  Finally, telephone interviews were scheduled and conducted. Interview guides were sent to the selected  participants prior to the interview in order to foster meaningful conversations and gather useful insights.  Conclusions in this report are driven from the desktop research, interviews and the results of the online  survey. A total of 9 NRAs and 4 providers were reached for the interviews, whereas 13 NRAs and 23  providers responded to the online survey.  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  09  2. Varying approaches on measuring the impact of incidents  A milestone in measuring the significance of incidents within the telecommunications sector in the EU was  set up along with the adoption of the Framework Directive (Directive 2009/140 EC) within the 2009  Telecom Package, which included Art. 13a.  Art. 13a aims at ensuring the security and integrity of electronic communication networks and services in  the EU. This is partially achieved through requiring telecommunication service providers to take the  appropriate technical and organizational measures to manage the risks posed to security of networks and  services, guarantee the integrity of their networks (ensure the continuity of supply of services provided  over those networks) and notify the competent national regulatory authority (NRA) of a breach of security  or loss of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation of networks or services.  When article 13a was initially published, NRAs and providers were required to make some changes to their  internal procedures so as to comply with its requirements. This was especially true with regards to how  security incidents were measured and reported.  To have a well-established incident reporting method, NRAs and providers need to know how to  effectively measure the impact of a security incident. However, measuring the impact of a security  incident can often be a lengthy and complex process. In addition to this, there are some differences in the  approach taken between member states as well as the approach taken among NRAs and service providers.  Approaches taken by member states (NRAs)  The approaches taken by NRAs can be classified into two main categories.  The first category is one wherein NRAs have taken a reasonably collaborative approach with the  providers in adopting indicators to measure security incidents. In these cases, there has been a lot of  communication between the various groups involved. Furthermore, the indicators were defined and  agreed upon through consultation between the NRAs and providers.  The second approach however, is somewhat that of directly implementing the provisions of the  directive. Providers did not have much to say in the incident reporting process and instead had to comply  with the requirements of their NRAs. Differences in the approach taken can primarily be attributed to  country particularities. Regardless of whether the approach was more or less collaborative, NRAs and  providers were encouraged to use an additional second-level regulations along with ENISA’s technical  guidelines. However, this was not the approach taken by all member states. The reason for which  additional measures exists in some cases (but not in all), is related to the fact that the Telecom Package,  does not explicitly mention the indicators or reporting procedures that member states must follow.  2.1.1 Challenges  Since providers can vary in size, popularity but also in terms of their maturity levels, NRAs can find it  difficult to agree on a measurement method, which is applicable to all. Although mentioned as a medium  challenge, providers and NRAs are using different measurement methodologies (stated by 45% of the  respondents from the survey). A difference in the approach taken to measure security incidents can  potentially impact the results of the incident reporting process, and may not always represent a true and  fair view of the current situation in the country.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  10  Figure 1: Challenges of measuring security incidents - NRAs  That being said, identifying appropriate indicators and accurately measuring them, is in fact most  problematic (38% of the NRAs expressed this to be their medium to big challenge). Although only listed  as a medium challenge, NRAs also experienced difficulty in clearly defining an indicator (46% responded  that this was the case). The fact that NRAs experienced confusion in defining, identifying and accurately  measuring security incident indicators, can, for the most part, be attributed to Article 13a’s relative  ambiguity. Article 13a asks NRAs and providers to take appropriate steps to guarantee the integrity of  networks, but does not specify what is meant by “appropriate steps” nor does it specify on what basis  “integrity” is defined.  The directive also lacks necessary details needed for defining “significance” of  incidents. To provide more clarity, the Art. 13a Expert Group, coordinated by ENISA, has been established  in order to help by issuing good practices on these matters. Accurately measuring the indicators has  been mentioned as big to medium challenge by half of the NRA respondents.  2.1.2 Goals and benefits  Identifying the type of incident including the reason behind it (i.e. if the incident was accidental or  deliberate) and identifying the target of the incident, such as whether the incident affected customers  or networks etc. is seen as a key goal and benefit among NRAs (92% of respondents replied this to be  the case). This is in line with expectations as NRAs ultimately aim to protect citizens. Therefore,  measuring the impact an incident has on the population is necessary. Furthermore, accurately measuring  security incidents enables NRAs to have a better overview of the “as-is” situation in their country. By  identifying the types of incidents that can occur at a national level, NRAs are also more likely to put in  place the right kind of risk assessment and security measures (77% agreed).  NRAs were also keen on  understanding how security incidents impacted their citizens, with 62% replying that this was another  one of their main goals/benefits. 62% of survey respondents also stated that they were measuring the  impact of security incidents so as to comply with EU regulations (which was seen as a key goal/benefit).  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  Difficult to identify  appropriate indicators  Difficult to collect appropriate data  Difficult to clearly define indicators  Difficult to accurately  measure the indicators  Different measuring  methodologies between provider  and NRA  Administration burden  Other  In your opinion, what are the challenges of measuring the impact of security  incidents?  No Challenge Small Challenge Medium Challenge Big Challenge No answer  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  11  An additional benefit to measuring the impact of a security incident, from the perspective of the NRAs  is that the information can be used as a basis for maintaining statistics (as expressed by 38% of the  respondents).  Figure 2: Goals and benefits of measuring security incidents – NRAs  Issuing guidelines to providers on strengthening infrastructures and using the measurement  methodologies as an input for discussing challenges can be of benefit. Furthermore, it can also aid in  discussing issues with other providers and other sectors. However, both these indicators were seen as  more of a secondary objective rather than a primary one (38% for strengthening infrastructures and 31%  for discussing challenges).  In terms of the indirect goals, analysing indicators, resulted in the NRAs’ ability to perform better risk  assessment procedures at a national level, and to increase the level of security nationwide (38% said  that it helped perform risk assessments at national level and 46% agreed that it improved security  nationwide).  Approaches taken by e-communications providers  The approaches taken by providers can be directly correlated with their level of maturity in terms of  country legislations and practices (which can be seen when benchmarking one member state with  another). Approaches also vary among providers in terms of the providers’ business maturity, as well as  their level of maturity as regards the relationship and collaboration with their respective NRAs.  For providers who were very mature, the reporting process, including the indicators used to measure  security incidents were incorporated to a relatively good standard in their day-to-day practices.  Providers with an average level of maturity, including smaller providers were either eager to improve  their internal processes and security measures, identifying it as an opportunity to improve or were  reluctant to do so due to additional effort and resources needed.

No answer  Not applicable  Indirect goals/benefits Secondary goals/benefits Key goals/benefits  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  12  fewer or different indicators than the ones defined in the guidelines. In order to comply with the  regulations, small providers had to implement these security measures from scratch.  2.2.1 Advantages  Benefits in the approach taken by providers were quite similar to the benefits experienced by the NRAs.  Having a more transparent affiliation with the NRA, wherein there existed good communication and  transfer of information and knowledge between the two, meant that the transition process to the new  requirements of Article 13a, was a lot more easy than when compared to provider’s whose relationship  was not so strong. Furthermore, providers were able to better understand the importance of Article 13a  and how the former could positively benefit them. Effectively using the guidelines meant that providers  experienced less implementation costs and efforts taken to comply with the regulations. This was  especially true for the bigger telecommunications providers, as well as those who had greater  investment capacities.  As for the smaller players in the industry, although they may not have had the right capital to invest in,  or the relevant expertise and skills to do so, the advantage for them is that they have had the opportunity  to learn from the methods used by their counterparts, and based on this, adopt some of the leading  practices which would be most applicable to them. By doing so, they can also gain a competitive  advantage which is core to the nature of their business.  2.2.2 Challenges  Unsurprisingly, providers felt that measuring the impact of a security incident was a process that was  not only time consuming but also, expensive (30% said that it was time consuming and 30% mentioned  that they had insufficient budget). Providers expressed more in detail, their  concerns during the interviews. For example in situations where the NRA had  implemented a second level of regulation, providers were asked to issue two  incident reports, instead of just one. They were asked to issue the first report  within 24 hours following the identification of an incident. The second report was  requested to be issued within two weeks following the incident fix. Therefore, this  situation led to some administrative burdens and delay in resolving the incident  (13% stated that this was a big challenge and 57% agreed that it was a medium  one). Similarly, it was sometimes the case that the same incident was measured  twice. The incident was measured once by the provider for internal purposes and was later measured  again for the purpose of reporting to the NRA. Given that there are usually limited resources which are  usually supposed to be dedicated to resolving the issue; providers felt in such situations that they are  “wasting” time in writing reports, and measuring the impact. The former could denote that more  transparency and cooperation within the indicators area is required between providers and NRAs.  57%  Of providers felt  that measuring  security incidents  was an  Administrative  burden  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  13  Figure 3: Challenges of measuring security incidents - Providers  Furthermore, measuring security incident indicators also resulted in limited value for money (48% of  the providers responded that this was a big challenge whereas 43% stated that the challenge was a small  one).  Regardless of maturity levels however, and similar to the NRAs, all providers experienced some level of  difficulty when it came to identifying, collecting the relevant data, and accurately measuring security  incident indicators.  2.2.3 Goals and benefits  Complying with national regulations is one of the main objectives of measuring security indicators (43%  of the respondents agreed). Additionally, goals and benefits in the assessment approach means that  providers can in consequence also be able to better identify incidents and to establish a more rigorous  incident response mechanism (35% strongly felt that this improved identification of security incidents,  and 43% replied that this meant ensuring a more rigorous incident response system)  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  Difficult to identify  appropriate indicators  Difficult to collect appropriate data  Difficult to clearly define indicators  Difficult to accurately  measure the indicators  Administration burden  Limited value for money  Insufficient budget  Time consuming Other  In your opinion, what are the challenges of measuring the impact of security  incidents?  No Challenge Small Challenge Medium Challenge Big Challenge No answer  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  14  Figure 4: Goals and benefits for measuring security indicators - Providers  Another benefit from the viewpoint of the provider is that measuring security incident indicators can  enable them to use the information collected, as a basis for maintaining statistics (70% agreed). Using  the indicators also means that providers can identify repeated incidents and thus, put in place certain  measures so as to reduce the impact on their customers (52% believed this to be the case).  What is interesting to note is that informing other providers of the major impacts following an incident  was neither a benefit nor a goal (39% felt this way). At the same time, input for discussing challenges  and issues with other providers and other sectors also appeared to be neutral as well. From this  information, it can be assumed that providers were not so willing to share or discuss of the security  incidents among each other or within different sectors.  In addition to this, although complying with national regulations is one of the main aims, many providers  expressed that their goals were not always in line with that of their NRAs. Unlike the NRAs, whose  ultimate purpose is to protect citizens, providers are much more business oriented. Providers are  constantly seeking new ways to grow their business and increase revenue and are also trying to position  themselves strategically in the market. Their objective is to deliver a positive experience for their  customers. Having said this, being customer centric meant that providers were using security indicators  (i.e. root cause of an incident, number of users affected, time duration etc.) to design effective security  mechanisms to not lose reputation among the public. The measures were also being used to assess  damage of the incidents and to also identify revenue for their business.  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80%  Identify the type of incident  Used as a basis for maintain statistics  Better incident response management  Achieve greater transparency by improving the incidents reporting process  Inform the NRA about major impact following incidents which could have a possible impact in other Member States  Inform other providers about major impact following incidents  Perform risk assessments (network level)  Comply with national regulations  Assess whether you need to invest in stronger infrastructure  Improve security and resilience of networks and services  Identify the cause of failure and/or isolation in order to prevent them from happening again  Input for discussing challenges and issues with other providers and other sectors  Have an overview of the main types of incidents in the network (kind of risk assessment)  Minimize impact for customers  For you as a provider, what are your main goals or benefits when using such indicators?  No answer  Strongly agree  Agree  Neutral  Disagree  Strongly disagree  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  15  Approaches taken by non EU states  Researching the methodologies used to assess security incident indicators outside of the EU, can help  assist NRAs and providers in refining their existing procedures to a further extent. The former can  provide useful insights which can eventually be applied, and also leveraged upon among the different  members states. A lot of information is available on threats and security issues associated with  “information security” in particular. This is especially true for countries such as the United States and  India. As a principle, it was noted that three aspects of information security are considered:  “availability”, “integrity” and “confidentiality” of information. While availability is the main area of focus  for Article 13a, other sectors have directed their attention towards “confidentiality” instead.  For example, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States measures the impact  of security incidents using several key indicators. Furthermore, they have also established an incident  reporting process which provides guidelines to telecom operators in the United States on what to report  and when to notify of incidents. To facilitate the incident reporting process, the FCC has also set  threshold values.  Telecommunications operators are requested to report on the following; the date  and time of onset of the outage; a brief description of the problem; service effects and the geographic  area affected by the outage. A distinction is also made on “initial” and “final” reports meaning that  similar to Article 13a, providers report the same incident more than once (once initially and after it is  resolved).  Outage reporting requirements are categorized based on the service that is affected.  Services include cable services, IXC1 tandem facilities, outages to satellite communications, signaling  system, wireless services and interconnected VOIP service providers. For more information, readers can  refer to the ecfr.gov website.  To achieve efficiency and encourage the public to communicate the incidents, the FCC has issued key  information via their online website. They have also established a page which is dedicated to providing  information to users including the FCC phone directory, organizational charts, the FCC’s offices and  emergency contact information.  In India, the Department of Information Technology (DIT) has defined Service Level Indicators for their  SWAN operation (State Wide Area Network). Indicators for SWAN are requested to be considered by the  respective states within India for incorporation in their Service Level Agreements with operators.  Thresholds values are defined which help in measuring the impact of an incident. In addition to this,  emphasis is also placed on the time duration of an incident (initial response time and issue resolution  time). To assess severity of an impact, the DIT also recommends operators to measure the availability  and extent of outage experienced for the following: internet availability, firewall outage, IDS outage and  Denial of Service. This is different to the existing indicators used at EU level and assessing the impact of  incidents through this viewpoint can allow member states to obtain technical insight on the cause of an  incident or vulnerabilities surrounding existing infrastructures and services. For more information on the  thresholds including how they are used among different states in India and on the specificities of the  technical information, such as bandwidth and availability etc., readers can access this website.  The indicators used to measure security incidents in both these situations, can be related to the ones  transposed in the European Union, linked to Article 13a.  1 Interexchange Carrier or long-distance telephone company.  http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=617740ce7d789a296ccb55edda008c40&mc=true&node=pt47.1.4&rgn=div5#se47.1.4_15 http://deity.gov.in/sites/upload_files/dit/files/downloads/policiesandguidelines/swan/An3_Guidelines_Bandwidth.pdf  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  16  Harmonizing NRAs & Providers  To remain a key player in the market, providers should know how to attract and retain customers. For  this, they need to be able to provide the best services to their customers. One way of achieving this, is  to continuously monitor the functionality of infrastructures and services. In contrast, the approach taken  by the NRAs is not necessarily going to be the same (NRAs do not have the same commercial objective  as that of a provider). NRAs are concerned with protecting their citizens and on improving security within  the country.  Regardless of the role and purpose of the NRA and provider, the bottom line is the same. Both need  to take appropriate measures to guarantee security, but the main purpose of why they offer security  differs from one to the other.  Sometimes it appears to be difficult to know of the internal regulations used by operators. Furthermore,  it is difficult to say if these regulations are in place in an attempt to comply with country level regulations  or if they already existed beforehand.  Other than the incidents that are reported to the NRA (as part of the reporting process), several NRAs  did not know of the additional indicators that providers were using (23% stated this to be the case).  Figure 5: Similarity of indicators among NRAs and providers – NRAs perspective  The same was also conveyed more in detail during the interviews, wherein NRAs described that even if  they had a good overview of the security measures taken by the big operators within the country, access  to relevant information on the smaller players was very much limited.  In situations where the NRA did have an indication of the measurement methods however, it was found  that providers were using similar indicators for the same kind of services (54% of the NRAs agreed).  Nevertheless, there were some notes by providers, stating that although the indicators used may be the  same, in some cases the measurement method is not the same. For instance, when measuring affected  users on a fixed voice service, the value of the indicator will differ if the NRA uses provisioned customers  and the provider uses statistic usage curves.  54%  8%  15%  23%  0%  Are the indicators used by the different providers similar for the same services  Yes, the indicators used by the different providers are similar  Yes, the indicators used by the different providers are similar but some providers use additional indicators  No, the indicators used by different providers vary quite a lot  I don't know the indicators used by the provider  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  17  In one example though, the NRA argued the opposite. It explained how 5 of the largest providers in the  country represented 90% of the market in terms of customers, while 500 small providers represented  only 10%. Indicators were calculated based on affected customers, geographic area and loss of capacity  etc. The smaller providers found it difficult to meet the standards of the reporting process, and felt more  comfortable with reporting on loss of capacity only.  In addition to this, if for example an incident affects a large provider, it would be  more likely that the incident is published in the news and/or media. When the  incident affects a smaller provider instead, the visibility of that incident is not so  apparent, therefore making it much more difficult for the NRAs to come to know of  it.  15% of survey respondents mentioned that the indicators used by different  providers, varied quite a lot from one provider to another and 8% expressed that  the indicators used were similar, but that some providers were using additional  indicators. From this, it is reasonable to say that NRAs had differing opinions on the level of  harmonization between them and their providers. Some felt that the harmonization levels were good  and that there existed a good alignment between the two, whereas others expressed that this level of  harmonization could be further improved.  Differing opinions in harmonization levels was also perceived among providers as well. 54% of the  respondents from the survey felt that there was a good level of collaboration between them and their  NRAs.  That being said, 13% described that they were in fact using a greater number of indicators than what  had been defined by their NRAs. As resulted from the response, it’s quite normal that a large provider  uses more indicators that those requested by the NRA. While the NRA is interested in “major” indicators  of impacts on citizens, the provider needs a lot more indicators to help manage the day-to-day  operations. Nevertheless, it cannot be assumed that the indicators that the NRA requests are within the  indicators already used by the provider.  Figure 6: Similarity of the indicators among NRAs and providers –Provider’s perspective  44%  13%  17%  13%  13%  0%  Do you use similar indicators than the ones defined by the NRA?  Yes, we collaborate with the NRA to define adequate indicators to measure the impact of security incidents  Yes, but we use a greater number of indicators than what is defined by the NRA  Yes, but we use a fewer number of indicators than what is defined by the NRA  No, we have two different methodologies of measuring the impact incidents  I don't know the indicators used by the NRA  54%  Of providers felt  that there was a  good level of  collaboration  between them  and their NRAs  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  18  Using fewer indicators as opposed to using more is what essentially can lead to some issues ( 17% of the  providers mentioned that they were using a fewer number of indicators than their NRAs). This often  resulted in additional costs and extra effort. For example, providers already had in place certain  indicators to fulfil their own objectives and goals (i.e. build good relationships with customers, establish  a good reputation in the marketplace, become the leading provider in the industry etc.). However,  complying with the requirements of the NRA meant that they had to make some changes to the way in  which they measured security incidents. This also included measuring the same type of incident based  on a new set of thresholds. A misalignment in the way in each of the indicators were measured  sometimes resulted in a difference in opinion between the NRA and the provider and in some cases also  had an impact on the relationship between the NRA and the provider.  Furthermore, the “misalignment” most often manifested itself in the incident reporting process. For  example, according to the guidelines of 8 of the NRAs interviewed, an incident report should be sent by  the provider to the NRA with one hour after identifying an incident. However, the incident is not  necessarily resolved within that hour. The time taken to report an incident actually results in a delay in  time to resolve the incident. That being said, in the majority of the cases the team who is responsible for  reporting the incident to the NRA is also the same team involved in resolving the incident. A lot of effort  is required in terms of reporting the incident and additional work is also performed when reporting the  same incident for the second time (incident is reported within 1 hour of being identified and then  reported again once resolved). While this demands quite a lot of effort from the side of the providers,  measuring incidents in this way, actually adds value to the incident reporting process from the viewpoint  of the NRAs (NRAs are able to gather more insight on the nature of the incident).  To reinforce this point, when asked if objectives of the NRA were aligned with the providers objectives,  54% of NRAs from the survey, felt that objectives were “somewhat aligned”. In other words, even if  protecting end users vs building a good reputation, differed to some extent, the means of achieving the  objectives are in actual fact similar (Fig. 7). Only 23% of the survey respondents replied that both NRAs  and providers had exactly the same objectives when defining indicators to measure the security  incidents, whereas only 8% replied that the objectives were different.  To summarize, irrespective of the differing opinions among NRAs and providers and irrespective  of if internal procedures differed based on the type of incident in scope, it was found that NRAs  and providers mainly use similar indicators  to measure security incidents. There are although  slight differences regarding the measurement methods, as reported by some providers.

To add to this, 30% replied that both  they and their NRA had the same objectives. 17% claimed that they did not know of  the objectives of their NRA and another 9% stated that the objectives were  different. The key message here is that providers share the same objectives as NRAs.  In the same way, to gain an insight on the satisfaction levels, NRAs and providers  were asked to also give their opinion as regards to the indicators used by providers  as well as the guidelines provided by the NRA. From what can be noted, the majority  of NRAs were satisfied with the indicators used by providers. 62% of NRAs replied  that they were somewhat satisfied whereas only 15% stated that they were missing details on the impact  of incidents. Another 23% replied that security incidents were measured in an accurate and timely  manner by the providers.  According to 44% of the providers, NRAs facilitated them in their process of defining appropriate  indicators. However, 13% answered that these guidelines could be somewhat improved. Another 13%  answered that they did not need help any from the NRA when measuring security incidents at all. This  could because they were already using a good set of indicators, which happened to also be the ones  purported by the NRA. There could have also been a certain degree of reluctance on the part of the  provider to complying with the recommendations as mentioned in the guidelines. Finally not all  providers may have seen the value, or return on investment in complying with regulations.

Analysis of identified incident indicators  The indicators presented within this chapter have been obtained and were compiled as the most  commonly used indicators from the views of both NRAs and providers. The results from the graph below  represent the average percentage of users that replied as using the indicators for measuring security  incidents for all technologies. In cases where the user did not answer or the indicator was not used, these  percentages were omitted from the calculation.  Figure 12: Commonly used indicators among NRAs and providers  From the graph, it can be noted that “number of users impacted” and “duration of an incident” were the  most common indicators which were used by 100% of NRAs, whereas providers used these indicators  on average 61% for “number of users impacted” and 63% for “time duration” of an incident.  Furthermore, “impact on emergency services”, “networks and assets impacted” as well as “geographical  area impacted”, was also used quite frequently. This is especially true among NRAs in particular. To  obtain more information on the indicators used by both NRAs and providers for each individual  technology however, readers can refer to the following sections of the report.  Keeping this in mind, it is important to note that the above does not represent the exhaustive list of  indicators. Referring to the summary below, it is possible to also get more information on the  measurement methodologies of each indicator including the indicators benefits and challenges.  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 120%  Number of users impacted  Duration of an incident  Specific time at which an…  Time to recover from an…  Fluctuating timeperiod  Geographical area impacted  Services affected  Networks and assets impacted  Impact on emergency services  Impact on sensitive areas  Impact on interconnections  Number of base stations…  Impact to recoverability  Impact on confidentiality  Impact on integrity  Impact on availability  Average percentage of indicators used among NRAs and providers for all technologies  Providers NRAs  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  23   User/connection related indicators   Number of users affected (fixed telephony)   Number of users affected (mobile telephony)   Time/duration related indicators   Time duration of an incident   Specific time at which an incident occurred   Time to recover   Fluctuating time period of an incident   Geographic area related indicators   Impact based on location   Geographic area based on infrastructure coverage   Geographic area based on number of customers affected   Geographic area based on number of services affected   Indicators related to infrastructure and services affected   Network infrastructures and assets   Impact on emergency services   Root cause dependent indicators   Human error   System failures   Natural phenomena   Internal vs. Third party failure   Economic impact related indicators   Indicators related to cyberattacks   Sources/destination of “attacks” related indicators   Vulnerabilities related to networks and services   Impact on confidentiality, availability and integrity  User/connection related indicators  Calculating the number of users or connections affected was identified as a key indicator among NRAs  and providers. This indicator was being used by all respondents of the surveys, to measure the impact  of any given security incident.  During the interviews, it came to light however that the measurement method for assessing this  particular indicator was in fact, the most challenging one. To add to the difficulty, there are different  technologies that are offered to customers, such as fixed telephony and mobile telephony etc. which  complicate the measurement even further. A common measurement method for each service cannot be  applied. For this reason the measurements are grouped per technology.  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  24  Figure 13:  Measuring incidents based on number of users affected  3.1.1 Number of users affected (fixed telephony)  Identifying the number of users impacted for fixed line telephony is relatively easy to measure when  compared with mobile telephony. Fixed telephony service providers can use the number of customers  connected to a Switch to estimate the number of affected customers (usually 1 line = 1 subscriber).  Furthermore, as providers know the number of users connected to specific equipment, they are in a  position to better determine the impact of an incident. However, not all providers are able to apply this  method as sometimes 1 line can have many users and this is not always easy to know. The former is  often the case when the user is a company (not an individual customer) and unless the providers are  able to have access to information about the number of connections/subscribers in the company, the  measurement method is not so accurate.  When considering the number of users impacted by a security incident, providers can also approach this  by measuring both the provisioned number of customers impacted, as well as the actual usage. This  allows for a differentiation between the two because the number of users affected by an incident will  not be the same at 4PM than at 4AM. This information can be useful for a number of reasons including  for example, maintenance purposes. In addition to the former, the provider can also have in place a  detailed process for measuring “service usage”. By using a service usage curve, it is possible to examine  the number of users using a given service at a specific point in time as opposed to the number of  provisioned users for that particular service.  3.1.2 Number of users affected (mobile telephony)  For mobile services the guidelines are much more flexible. Therefore, providers can chose in which way  they want to perform the analysis to determine the impact on their customers. For example, providers  can chose to look at the number of people who are living in the affected area or to look at the market  share in the specific area and on how the network is dimensioned in this particular area, to find out how  many possible affected subscribers are included.  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  120%  Fixed telephony Mobile telephony Fîxed internet access Mobile internet access Other  Which indicators do you currently use to assess the impact of security incidents  affecting the electronic communications sector: Number of users impacted  NRAs Providers  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  25  As opposed to fixed telephony, mobile telephony is the provision of telephone services to phones which  may move around freely rather than stay fixed in one location, thus making it difficult to measure. An  approach taken by some NRAs to overcome the challenge in measuring the number of users affected for  mobile services, is to request providers to assess the traffic use of the previous week of the incident or  to compare the traffic of the previous week day with the traffic of the current day on the affected  equipment and multiply this number with the total number of SIMs they had before the incident took  place.  (Traffic last Thursday - Traffic this Thursday) x number of SIM cards = number of SIM cards affected  While calculating the number of SIM cards can be one way of determining the number of users affected  in a geographic area, not all the providers have the ability to obtain the exact number. Therefore most  of the operators have a rule that considers the average number of users per base station.  In the case of moving disturbances such as a storm, the NRA can request to receive a map from the  providers showing the area where the outage occurs at a particular point and the number of affected  based stations.  To summarize, even if NRAs have equipped their providers with guidelines on  measuring the number of users or lines that have been affected following an  incident, the choice of methodology has been left to the providers.  According to the study, 100% of the NRAs are asking for the number of users  affected for fixed and mobile telephony and internet services. When making the  same comparison at the provider level, the majority of providers were measuring  the number of users affected for fixed telephony and internet technologies, than  they were for mobile telephony and mobile internet technologies (74% for fixed  telephony and internet and 48% for mobile telephony and internet technologies).  It can be assumed that the reason for which there exists a difference in the figures  at the provider level is because some providers are not so sure on how to effectively  measure mobile telephony and internet access services than when compared to  fixed lines. As mentioned above, this is because it is easier to detect how many  users are connected to fixed line services and also to calculate how many users are impacted following  an incident than when calculating the number of mobile users as mobile services can be used for many  purposes (not only  for phone calls). Furthermore, mobile users are constantly “on the move”. Therefore  if for example one were to measure the number of mobile users impacted based on geographical area,  this would be different based on individual factors (the user may work in a different area to where he  lives). There are many other individual factors as such, making the process complicated. Similarly it is  difficult to make correlations between users who use fixed and mobile services simultaneously.  Time/duration related indicators  The gravity of the incident and the type of resources it affects will determine the amount of time and  resources needed to recover from that incident. An incident may require far more resources to recover  from than what the organization can handle. Those resolving an incident should consider the effort  necessary to actually recover from an incident and carefully weigh that against the value of the recovery  effort. As with number of users affected, this indicator can be measured in different ways. The commonly  identified methods for NRAs and providers were to assess the impact of the former based on the time  duration of an incident but also the time to recover from an incident.  74%  Of providers  measure  incidents for  fixed  technologies  48%  Of providers  measure  incidents for  mobile  technologies  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  26  For example, “time duration” and “time to recovery” were used as indicators by 100% of NRAs who took  part in the survey. Indicators such as “fluctuating time period”, was used on average by 31% and “specific  time” at which an incident occurred was only used by 15% of the NRAs.  Figure 14: Measuring incidents based on time – NRAs perspective  Figure 15: Measuring incidents based on time- Providers perspective  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  120%  Fixed telephony Mobile telephony Fixed internet access Mobile internet access Other  Time/Duration related indicators  Duration of an incident Specific time at which incident occured  Time to recovery Fluctuating time period of an incident  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  Fixed telephony Mobile telephony Fixed internet access Mobile internet access Other  Time/Duration related indicators  Duration of an incident Specific time at which incident occured  Time to recovery Fluctuating time period of an incident  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  27  Similarly providers were more commonly using the same two indicators (“time duration” and “time to  recovery”) in comparison to the other time related indicators too. 74% replied that they were measuring  the duration of an incident and time to recover from an incident for fixed telephony and internet  technologies. The same is also true for mobile technologies which were used by 48% for “duration of an  incident” and 52% for “time to recovery”.  3.2.1 Duration of an incident  The time duration of an incident can be assessed from the moment at which the incident is identified  until full recovery of the connections (i.e. up until the last connection is restored on the last based station  affected).  However, the challenges that some providers have expressed is that there is a lapse of time during which  service starts to degrade but is not reported by the providers. Therefore the incident may not fully reflect  the total duration of an incident interruption.  Another way to calculate duration of an incident is to break it down into several sections including when  the incident started, when it is estimated to be over, and when it is actually over. This helps in  determining how long the interruption lasted. Determining the time duration of an incident is a  beneficial approach as it is possible to see how long it took to recover from the incident and thus measure  how efficient the provider was in resolving it.  In some cases, duration of an incident is only measured after the incident has been resolved, not during  resolution.  3.2.2 Specific time at which an incident occurred  Incidents can also be measured based on the specific time at which they occurred. For example, an  incident that happened on the weekend can have a different impact from that which took place during  a weekday (and that too during working hours). This is because, the chances that more people were  making use of telecommunications services during that time are greater, and thus the impact of the  incident as well as its consequences, would have also been greater. So, this indicator would be addressed  if the number of affected users was calculated based on statistic usage curves (which vary throughout  the day) and not based on provisioned customers.  3.2.3 Time to recover  Time to recover can often be confused with duration of an incident. Therefore it is necessary to create a  distinction between the two. Where duration of an incident reflects the action taken from beginning to  end of an incident, time to recover is calculated from the moment the restoration work has started on  the incident and ends with full recovery. Time to recover from an incident (i.e. hours or minutes etc.),  often takes less time than the actual duration of the incident.  That being said, there are also some additional complexities with measuring this indicator. This is  because it is often hard to differentiate between when an incident actually occurred, in comparison to  when it was realized or acknowledged. Furthermore, in terms of calculating the time to recover from an  incident, NRAs and providers also expressed that they found it a bit challenging to know on what basis  to measure the recovery of an incident. For example, does this depend on the time it took for all services  and users to fully recover from an impact of an incident, or did this depend on when the number of users  and services affected, were within a certain range (i.e. below the defined threshold).  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  28  3.2.4 Fluctuating time period of an incident  Measuring the fluctuating time period of an incident might prove challenging because the quality of the  offered service usually will not degrade instantly. There may be some fluctuations in the services’  functionality which could still be rather volatile, for a certain amount of time, before the service  eventually results in total failure. Focus should be placed on service degradation.  That being said, when providers report on time/duration related indicators, they need to be specific on  what basis they are measuring “time”. This is because if one provider has calculated the impact based  on time to recover from the incident, whereas the other has done the same based on time duration of  the incident, the end information reported to the NRAs cannot be accurately measured nor compared  between one another.  Geographical area related indicators  Measuring security incidents which affect certain geographical areas, allows NRAs and providers to  identify which region is most affected by an incident.  The benefit of measuring security incidents using  this approach is that, through this, it is possible to determine whether or not the geographic landscape  of a location plays a role in the frequency at which an incident takes place and in determining the type  of incident that has occurred. Geographic impact, on both fixed line and mobile services, is calculated by  almost all respondents of the survey.  Figure 16:  Measuring incidents based on area impacted  Calculating the geographic spread of an incident is especially important to consider in countries with  diverse surroundings. For example, places that are urbanised and better connected would experience  less disruptions, but the disruptions would affect more people than when compared to areas that are  less urbanised. That being said, the impact of an incident affecting an island near the sea would be  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  Fixed telephony Mobile telephony Fîxed internet access Mobile internet access Other  Which indicators do you currently use to assess the impact of security incidents  affecting the electronic communications sector Geographic Impact  NRAs Providers  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  29  greater due to poor network coverage. Furthermore, the chance of an incident occurring in remote areas  is greater due to national hazards such as storms and bad weather.  3.3.1 Impact based on location  Security incidents can be measured as per the number of square km affected. For instance, in countries  where access to certain areas is rather remote (i.e. mountains, isolated islands, forests etc.), an outage  can impact either half the city, or nobody at all (which should be taken into consideration).  Furthermore, depending on the size of the geographic area and the impact which the incident caused,  the incident is either requested to be reported to the NRA, or not reported at all. Whether or not to  report an incident depends on the thresholds set by the NRA. In most cases, the NRAs were found to  have followed the guidelines provided by ENISA when defining such thresholds.  For some NRAs, it’s difficult to assess the location of an incident as one incident can affect several  locations. Furthermore, if there is an area with only one operator and this operator experienced an  interruption of services, there is an increased chance that the consequences of the incident will be more  severe.  3.3.2 Geographic area based on infrastructure coverage  Another way to measure incidents’ impact can be based on the geographical coverage of the networks.  Some NRAs did not use a specific geographic area to measure this indicator as one base station can cover  many areas. Instead, this indicator can be measured by calculating the number of base stations that are  affected. By identifying the number of base stations impacted, it is possible to identify each of the  different areas that are associated with that base station and hence, calculate the geographic spread.  3.3.3 Geographic area based on number of customers affected  Measuring the geographic impact of an incident can also be calculated by combining the geographic  spread with the number of customers affected. That being said, regardless of the area which was  impacted, the total number of customers can be measured first. Based on the total number of customers  that are impacted, it was later easy to identify the area in which the incident took place.  3.3.4 Geographic area based on number of services affected  Similarly, geographic impact can also be calculated based on the number of services affected and the  areas where they are provided. Services such fixed or mobile telephony, voice and internet access  services are included in this calculation. Taking the example of fixed line services, if 500 or more  customers are affected, then the incident is considered as significant (depending on the thresholds set  by the country), and as such should be reported to the NRA. Determining the number of services affected  ant the area where the services are provided, can help determine and locate the geographic spread of  the incident.  Indicators related to affected infrastructure and services  Providers are requested to assess the types of infrastructures and services that are affected following an  incident. Assessing the types of infrastructure and services affected can enable an overview of the ones  that are most vulnerable to threats. Precaution can therefore be taken on those assets and investment  in newer infrastructures can also be made if needed.  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  30  3.4.1 Network infrastructure and assets  Using indicators to measure security incidents on network infrastructure and assets is generally quite  straightforward. Providers are requested to give information to their NRAs on the types of  infrastructures that have been impacted. This includes information such as the providers’ internal  networks (core networks and active networks) that are affected as well as on the type of services that  were affected (TV services, voicemail services etc.).  However, it is not always clear on how to measure this aspect. The main question that needs to be asked  is does this calculation depend on the number of services and assets that have resulted in total shut  down, or does this instead refer to a percentage in the number of service that are impacted (20% of  services for example).  Figure 17: Measuring incidents based on services affected  Impact on emergency services  Ensuring that security incidents do not impact emergency services is highly important in the  telecommunications sector. In case of any emergency, people expect to be able to reach the right  services and on time. This includes dialling numbers such as 112, to report events such as accidents,  burglary, fires etc. Emergency functions should be working at all times in order to protect the general  safety of the public.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  Fixed telephony Mobile telephony Fîxed internet access Mobile internet access Other  Which indicators do you currently use to assess the impact of security incidents  affecting the electronic communications sector:  Services affected  NRAs Providers  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  31  Figure 18: Measuring incidents based on emergency services  Analysing the impact of incidents on the emergency services was measured for all technology types such  as fixed telephony, fixed internet access, mobile telephony and mobile internet access. This is especially  true for NRAs wherein 92% were measuring the former for fixed technologies and 85% for mobile.  That being said, measurement methods can be complicated because for example, if an incident affects  a phone service, it can potentially affect emergency service calls as well. In some cases, only the  emergency services are affected while other telecommunications services are still functioning. The  numbers of affected users are counted differently here as users may still have their services working  while being unable to reach the emergency services. In this situation, the number of users is the number  of users that cannot connect to an emergency number. As stated by most of the respondents, for  determining the impact on emergency services, it is often the case that NRAs and providers rely on  estimates (such as previous statistics etc.).  Root causes dependent indicators  Determining the impact of an incident based on the analysis of the root cause, can be a good approach.  Determining what went wrong, and what led to the incident to occur in the first place, can minimize or  monitor similar patterns of the incident should such an incident occur in the future.  However, some issues that providers can be faced with, is that although they were required to report  the root cause of the incident, the form which they had to complete, was structured in a way that made  it difficult to understand. The form was sometimes too technical and those completing it were not able  to provide enough precision on the specific reason for the incident. Without enough precision on the  root cause of the incident, it makes it difficult for NRAs and even providers to clearly analyse what went  wrong and assess the points of improvement.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  Fixed telephony Mobile telephony Fîxed internet access Mobile internet access Other  which indicators do you currently use to assess the impact of security incidents  affecting the electronic communications sector:  Impact on emergency services  NRAs Providers  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  32  Malicious attacks also falls under this category but has been explained more in detail in section 3.8 of  the report  3.6.1 Human errors  Using “human errors” as a measurement to assess security incidents can help to assess whether the  incidents have taken place due to negligence and/or lack of awareness of people. Human error incidents  are usually caused during the operation of equipment or facilities, the use of tools and the executions of  procedures, etc. In order to avoid this kind of error in the future, trainings can be conducted for the  relevant parties involved. That being said, human error also includes things such as misconfigurations. If  a system is not properly configured, it can lead to security incidents.  3.6.2 System failures  Measuring the impact of security incidents as a result of system failures, such as hardware and software  failure, can encourage the NRAs but mostly providers to put in place rigorous monitoring mechanisms  of their systems. Furthermore, in case there are a lot of incidents that have occurred due to system  failures, providers can look to invest in newer infrastructures. Nevertheless, this process can get quite  technical. Therefore, by analysing the reason for which the incident resulted in system failure and  thereafter providing high-level information on this can help the necessary people concerned to  determine whether or not to spend on new infrastructure.  3.6.3 Natural phenomena  The indicator “natural phenomena” includes measuring incidents that are caused by severe weather,  earthquakes, floods, wildfires, and so on. After measuring the probability of an incident occurring due  to natural hazards, providers can build stronger infrastructure or backup systems in order to ensure  continued availability. That being said, after identifying the areas which are most likely to be affected by  natural phenomenon and/or measuring the probability of natural phenomenon occurrence, means that  providers can be better prepared for such incidents and take the necessary precautions accordingly.  3.6.4 Internal vs. Third party failure  Third party failures are an important variable when measuring security incidents. If the incident was due  to an outside vendor technical issues, is an important thing to consider, as outsourcing some of the  services to outside parties is a common approach of providers nowadays. Determining if an incident is  internal or external can assist providers in the identification of whom the incident will impact and areas  to approach in order to mitigate the incident. 16% of all incidents reported in 20142 to ENISA, were third  party failures.  3.6.5 Malicious actions / cyberattacks  Incidents related to cyber-attacks can also have an impact on telecommunications services. As such NRAs  and providers should also consider measuring security incidents from this point of view. This is especially  true for internet services (both fixed and mobile). For example, denial of service attacks (DOS), or attacks  on the network (related to cyber-attacks) can result in downtime. As with the telecommunications  2 Annual Incident Report 2014  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2014  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  33  sector, cyber-security related incidents can affect a varied range of industries. There is plenty of  information on how to calculate the impact of an attack, detailing the use of algorithms etc.  Source/destination of “attacks”  Measuring the source or destination of an incident can help NRAs and providers to identify the cause of  an attack as well as its target. This also helps in identifying incident’s criticality as well as the severity of  its impact. Understanding the severity of the impact can be derived by studying who the former will  affect: the customers, the network or the whole country. Necessary measures to mitigate the risks  depending on the destination of the attack can thereafter be put in place. That being said, identifying  the source of an attack helps in determining if or not the incident was intentional. The need to identify  “attack” incident types is becoming more and more common as such incidents are being encountered  on an often basis. NRAs and providers should be prepared to handle such situations. Furthermore, there  are different types of cyber security attacks and the necessary measures to address them, may differ  from one another.  Vulnerabilities within networks and services  Taking into account network and services vulnerabilities can also be another approach to take. As a  provider, knowing and understanding vulnerabilities within the network can be an advantage when  addressing incidents. For example, if one segment of the network can be made unavailable due to a  serious vulnerability, that may be also present in other segments, knowing the situation and how to  address it can help the provider in preparing the response to the incident and can help him prevent  similar incidents in the future.  Economic impact related indicators  Though it was expressed by both the NRAs and providers that cost of damage was an indicator which  was not used commonly, assessing security related incidents from this viewpoint can lead to some  benefits. Providers were using cost to recover from an incident more frequently to measure the impact  of recovery of an incident (50%) than when compared with measuring the actual loss of revenue  following an incident (38%) or measuring the loss of market share (14%).  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  34  Figure 19: Economic related indicators to measure security incidents  Examining economic impact related indicators can be used by the providers to assess the overall damage  of an incident.  Impact on confidentiality, availability and integrity (CIA)  Evaluating the impact an incident has on availability, is the most pertinent factor in the  telecommunications sector and the majority of providers were measuring impact of an incident based  this metric (40% agreed). Nevertheless, security incidents can also negatively affect other areas too. If  information is disclosed to unauthorized individuals, or if, for example, the information is not accurately  available, businesses may suffer undesirable consequences. This could lead to a loss in customer  confidence, contractual damages and can even result in financial losses  13%  37%  50%  0%  Measuring the impact of an incident based on factors impacting the economy  Loss of market share  Actual loss of revenue  Cost to recover  No answer  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  35  Figure 20: CIA related indicators to measure security incidents – provider’s perspective  As a general remark, the CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity and availability) is designed to guide policies  for information security within an organization. The triad can be adapted to telecommunications without  only emphasising on availability. At the moment only 30% of providers are measuring incidents based  on confidentially and integrity.  Figure 20: CIA related indicators to measure security incidents – NRAs perspective  Similarly, availability was the most commonly assessed indicator among NRAs, with 55% using this indicator  to measure the impact of security incidents (mainly due to Art. 13a specific requirements). Integrity was  measured among 27% and 18% focused on the confidentiality aspect to measure security incidents.  30%  30%  40%  Measuring the impact of an incident based on confidentiality, integrity and  availability  Confidentiality  Integrity  Availability  18%  27% 55%  Measuring the impact of an incident based on confidentiality, integrity and  availability  Confidentiality  Integrity  Availability  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  36  Protecting sensitive information is becoming a key topic, not only in telecoms but in information security as  well and by measuring the impact an incident has on sensitive information and on the integrity of such  information can be another angle by which to assess security related repercussions.  Indicators used per technology  A point which needs to be highlighted is that for some of the questions in the survey, respondents were  allowed to select more than one technology when specifying the indicators used to measure security  incidents (as seen in sections 3.1 to 3.9). For example, for the indicator “number of users impacted”,  providers answered that they used this indicator to measure the impact of an incident for “fixed  telephony”, “mobile telephony” and “fixed internet”, “mobile internet” etc.  To identify the percentage of indicators used per each individual technology, the same data used in the  sections above can be presented in a different way. Using this method it is possible to identify why some  indicators were used a lot less or a lot more for some technologies than when compared to others.  Figure 21:  Indicators used per technology- Fixed technology  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  120%  Number of users impacted  Duration of an incident  Time to recovery Geographical area impacted  Impact on emergency  services  Services affected Networks and assets impacted  Indicators per technology: Fixed telephony  NRAs Providers  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  37  Figure 22: Indicators used per technology- Mobile Telephony  Figure 23: Indicators used per technology – Fixed internet  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  120%  Number of users impacted  Duration of an incident  Time to recovery Geographical area impacted  Impact on emergency  services  Services affected Networks and assets impacted  Indicators used per technology: Mobile telephony  NRAs Providers  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  120%  Number of users impacted  Duration of an incident  Time to recovery Geographical area impacted  Impact on emergency  services  Services affected Networks and assets impacted  Indicators used per technology: Fixed internet  NRAs Providers  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  38  Figure 24: Indicators used per technology – Mobile internet  From the analysis it can be said that indicators used in the context of fixed technologies (both telephony  and internet) were used in general more than when compared to mobile technologies, among both NRAs  and providers.  To add to this point, it can be said that NRAs seem to be using the indicators more “effectively” than  providers. For example, indicators such as “number of users impacted” and “duration of incidents”, is used  by all NRAs who answered to the survey, for all technologies (100%).  Furthermore, at the NRA level, the  answers were very similar from one technology to the other. On the other hand, this was not the case at  the provider level. The extent to which each indicator was used, and that too for each technology  depended a lot on the provider’s level of maturity and also to a big extent on the provider’s relationship  with its NRA. On average, indicators were used quite well for fixed telephony technologies. However, the  percentage of providers who were using the indicators (mentioned above), to measure the impact on  mobile internet, was considerably less (almost half as less), for mobile technologies. The reason for this  relates once again to the fact that knowing how to evaluate the impact of a fixed technology is more  straightforward than that of mobile. As is described at the start of this section, there are many additional  complexities involved in mobile telephony and mobile internet services that both NRAs and providers  should consider.  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  120%  Number of users impacted  Duration of an incident  Time to recovery Geographical area impacted  Impact on emergency  services  Services affected Networks and assets impacted  Indicators used per technology: Mobile internet  NRAs Providers  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  39  4. Particularities regarding measuring the impact of incidents  Defining significance of an incident  Defining the significance of an incident is an important aspect for measuring its impact. That being said,  some indicators are definitely more pertinent than others. The Article 13a group along with ENISA have  established some informal indicators along with the corresponding thresholds, to be used by NRAs and  providers in the EU. These are not imposed, however they can be used to measure the significance or  severity of an incident and can also encourage NRAs and providers to use their own thresholds. Based  on those thresholds and indicators, they could be adopted as is by the involved stakeholders or modified  accordingly, based on their necessity. This was also the case of most NRAs that used the indicators and  thresholds as an inspirations, but followed a national approach based on their particularities.  According to the data gathered during this study, significance is mostly measured based on two key  indicators: the number of customers impacted, and the duration of an incident. An additional indicator  which is also commonly used is the number of services affected. To derive appropriate results, NRAs and  providers can use a combination of these indicators in their calculation methods. For example,  significance can either be calculated based on the number of users impacted vs. duration of an incident,  or the number of services affected vs. duration of an incident.  If an incident results in downtime, but the time taken to recover from the impact is below the threshold  defined by the NRA, or the number of users that were affected by the incident is below a certain  threshold, then providers are not obliged to report the incident to their NRAs, as the incident is not of a  significant impact. As per the informal guidelines of the Article 13a group, incidents should only be  reported if the incident reaches the red areas from the table below, as regards to the number of affected  users and the duration:  Figure 25: Example of thresholds used for the Art.13a annual summary reporting  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  40  Using scales of criticality for assessing the impact  Another approach to take when measuring the significance is to measure the criticality of the incident.  Using scales of criticality to assess a security incident, to a certain extent coincides with measuring the  significance of an incident. NRAs and/or providers can categorize indicators into criticality levels such as:  “red”, “amber” and “green”. If for example, several incidents took place within the same time frame,  making use of the criticality levels can help in prioritizing which incident to resolve first.  Figure 26: Scales of criticality– provider’s perspective  That being said, in cases where criticality levels were being considered, for the most part almost all relied  on the ENISA metrics. 83% of respondents revealed that they were using this to categorize the impact of  the incidents.  One provider mentioned that the number of resources required to solve an incident also  depended on its criticality. For them, the general rule they were using depending on the criticality of an  incident is that a serious incident would be addressed by a specific department within the organization,  a very serious incident, would require the help of several departments and finally, if the incident resulted  in a crisis, the incident would be taken care of at operator level.  Using combination of indicators  To assess the severity of an incident and to also be able to know the level of resources required to solve  the incident, the provider was relying on certain thresholds. The impact of an incident depended on the  time duration as well as the number of users affected for each service category. Measuring security  incidents using a combination of indicators is an interesting approach to take. Many providers and NRAs  are already using this method and the main advantage is that they can observe the impact of a security  incident from various perspectives.  Furthermore, combining indicators can help gather more precise information on the impact of an  incident. For example, it can allow NRAs and providers to understand the correlation between the  number of user vs. the number of services impacted, and the number of users vs. time duration etc.  That  being said, the indicators which can be use are countless, and it is up to the specific NRA and provider to  83%  17%  0% 0%  Do you use scale/categories for determining the criticality/significance of  an incident/situation  Yes  No  Other  No answer  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  41  decide how the want to use the indicators, and on what basis they want to calculate the impact of an  incident.  Figure 27: Using a combination of indicators – provider’s perspective  Among providers, the most commonly used indicators were the following: number of users affected  combined with duration of an incident (83%) and number of users affected combined with geographic  spread (74%). Furthermore, providers were also calculating number of users affected with geographic  spread (70%). The same is also true for NRAs wherein number of users impacted was often calculated in  combination with the duration of the incident (for 85%).  Assessing impact of incidents based on customer “importance”  Assessing the impact of an incident based on customer “importance” is another methodology which can  be used mostly by providers.  From the viewpoint of the NRA, measuring incidents based on customer importance can service to the  needs of high profile clients, or critical infrastructure clients who deal with sensitive information, such  as banks, special government institutions, hospitals etc.  Focusing on these clients can also help ensure  greater security overall.  From the viewpoint of the provider, measuring security incidents based on customer importance has  other merits, since this can help towards gaining customer loyalty and trust. Furthermore, doing so can  improve the customer’s perception of reliability with regards to the providers, thus resulting in  competitive advantage and customer retention.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  Number of users affected  Duration of an incident  Geographic spread  Infrastructures and services  affected  Impact on emergency  services  Root causes Other  Do you combine the following indicators among themselves?  Number of users affected Duration of the incident Geographic spread  Infrastructures and services affected Impact on emergency services  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  42  Figure 28: “Standard” vs “Important” clients – provider’s view  However, measuring incidents based on customer importance is not so widely used among NRAs and  providers. All 100% of the NRAs stated that a distinction between important and standard users was not  made. Nevertheless, during interviews it was identified that most providers had a special group of  customers, with whom either they held extra SLAs or who they knew is critical for them. For those  customers, most providers, kept a more close watch and notified them should anything happen. This is  especially true for critical infrastructures (banks, hospitals, etc.)  Assessing impact of incidents based on quality and service degradation  There are quite a lot of differing opinions on how to measure the impact of an incident based on quality  and the degradation level of services. While at the moment, this indicator is not being used, the concept  of service degradation and assessing the quality of a service remains important. That being said,  clarification needs to be made surrounding the concept of what is considered “service degradation”. For  example, does this refer to the moment at which providers experience a loss in service to some of their  systems (while others are still functioning), or is this the moment at which all services are completely  unavailable. Furthermore, since service degradation can fluctuate, is this indicator calculated during the  time period at which systems are facing service degradation or will this be later measured after the  incident has occurred. Using the correct terminology can help providers and NRAs achieve more  accuracy when measuring the impact of a security incident based on this indicator. This includes knowing  how to differentiate between concepts such as “services failing”, “services going down”, “services  affected”, “total failure” and “services that are not working correctly” etc.  To summarize this point however, it is important to emphasise that technology is always changing,  meaning that measurement methods which could seem appropriate at one point in time may not  necessarily be so at another. The same is also true for service degradation in particular where in the  future due to more advanced technologies, it may be the case that systems would not face total or  complete loss of service, but rather periods of service degradation instead.  End-user requirements  End-users can play a vital role in the security incident reporting process as they are the ones who  essentially make use of these infrastructures and services.  Furthermore, bringing more transparency  13%  87%  0%  Do you use different indicators depending on whether the users are  \"standard\" or \"important\"?  Yes, we use extra indicators in case of incidents impacting important users  No, we always use the same indicators independently from the users  No answer  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  43  into the process by informing end-users of the indicators used for measuring security incidents and also  informing them of the incidents that have taken place, can be a beneficial approach. Empowering end- users with the necessary skills on incident identification and reporting could be an approach to be  adopted, as suggested by some respondents.  So far, almost all providers report incidents to their NRAs only, while end-users do not have access to  such information. To add to this point, end-users have to either specifically request for this information  if they need it, or wait for the yearly reports from the NRAs or ENISA. However, the information that  they receive will most likely be of past incidents that have occurred in the year, and therefore may not  be so relevant to them anymore. Similarly, end-users many only find out about the incidents through the  media.  Only one provider, who was interviewed, mentioned that apart from the yearly reports sent to the NRA,  they already had in place another reporting process which was being used in parallel to ensure that end- users were also made aware of the security incidents. The majority however, stated that they had no  direct interaction with their end-users whatsoever. Thus, the former can be seen as a potential area for  further improvement and/or development. Working more closely with end-users can lead to gaining the  trust of the customer and at the same time, further result in greater competitive advantage which is a  key priority from the view point of the providers. However, as a provider, going public with details  regarding incidents can be disadvantageous in certain situations (e.g. exposing a  service/technology/infrastructure vulnerability which increases the appetite for attacks).  That being said, some end-users require more attention than others. These end-users include  organizations such as banks that not only need to be informed immediately of the incidents but also  have to have a contractual agreement with the providers, such as an SLA with which they may rely on  the measurement of certain indicators like uptime etc. This is especially needed in the banking sector.  To summarize on this, further information has not been collected from the NRAs or from providers  regarding the requests/satisfaction of end users on the specific matter of indicators.  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  44  5. Conclusions  The overall purpose of this document is to provide guidelines to national regulatory authorities (NRAs)  and telecommunications providers within EU member states and to assist them in the process of  measuring the impact of security incidents affecting the availability of electronic communication  services. Therefore, interested stakeholders have at their disposal a catalogue of indicators to be used  to tailor impact assessment and design the corresponding solutions.  A milestone in measuring the significance of incidents within the telecommunications sector in EU was  set up along with the adoption of the Framework Directive (Directive 2009/140 EC) within the 2009  Telecom Package, which included Art. 13a. This article aims at ensuring the security and integrity of  electronic communication networks and services in EU. This is partially achieved through requiring  telecommunication service providers to take the appropriate technical and organizational measures to  manage the risks posed to security of networks and services, guarantee the integrity of their networks  (ensure the continuity of supply of services provided over those networks) and notify the competent  national regulatory authority (NRA) of a breach of security or loss of integrity that has had a significant  impact on the operation of networks or services.  Measuring the significance of telecommunications incidents became a necessity within the EU, and led  to numerous debates between involved stakeholders. A lot of work has been done in this area both by  ENISA, along with the Art. 13a expert group, and also by private or independent bodies, as some work is  publicly available online. This report comes as a practical approach, and contains the view of both NRAs  and providers within the EU, on real indicators used for measuring significance of incidents affecting the  availability of telecommunication network and services.  As the survey performed had also the objective of analysing the approached taken by NRAs and providers  in defining indicators and significance, the results indicated that while there are some discrepancies  between NRAs and providers in terms of why they measure security incidents, and for what purpose  they use certain indicators over others, it is still plausible to state that the approaches taken and  indicators used by both parties are more similar than they are different, as more than half of the  respondents have stated this. Further developments regarding harmonisations of the approaches taken  are still needed but overall the situation is running smoothly, the processes are in place, and the  reporting of significant incidents is being done at national and EU level. From the study, it was realized  that approaches taken by NRAs and providers varied depending on certain country-level factors. Some  were much more mature than others. Due to several advantageous circumstances, some NRAs  experienced strong cooperation with their providers when it came to implementing the necessary  changes.  Having said this, is it advised that making use of a standardized approach among NRAs and providers can  help derive more precise results in the incident reporting process. So, the key recommendation from the  study is that NRAs and providers should further increase the level of harmonisations in the approach  taken to measure security incidents.  ENISA will continue to support the community through the Art. 13a group, and continue to provide best  practices, guidelines and support for all stakeholders in members states.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vass.

Conclusions 44  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  05  Executive Summary  Telecommunication is an industry that can be considered as the backbone of modern economies.  Economic development is strongly related to the existence and well-functioning of the  telecommunication networks. Telecommunications demands advanced technologies and processes,  playing a vital yet growing role in the European Union (EU). Current developments have determined  some changes within customer preferences over the years, changes that have made it crucial for  telecommunications operators to illustrate transparency, customer innovation and bring new services  to the market. At the same time, operators have to maintain high security and availability standards.  Security incidents affecting this sector can have detrimental effects that can manifest themselves in a  number of ways.  Measuring the impact of incidents has become one of the toughest challenges nowadays, given the  multitude of factors/indicators that must be taken into consideration. To address this issue, indicators  are used, accompanied by thresholds, to assess the impact of incidents. This approach allows evaluation  of incidents from various perspectives, such as business perspective, compliance with regulations, root  causes, impact on customers etc. Incidents can vary in nature, and this report tries to include as many  indicators as possible, so that as many types of incidents as possible are covered.  The overall purpose of the document is to provide guidelines to national regulatory authorities (NRAs)  and telecommunications providers (providers) within EU member states, to assist them in the process  of measuring the impact of security incidents affecting electronic communication services.  This report comes as a practical approach, and contains the view of both NRAs and providers within EU,  on real indicators used for measuring significance of incidents affecting telecommunication networks  and services. Therefore, interested stakeholders have at their disposal a catalogue of indicators to be  used to tailor impact assessment and design the corresponding solutions.  As the survey performed had also the objective of analysing the approached taken by NRAs and providers  in defining indicators and significance, the results indicated that while there are some discrepancies  between NRAs and providers in terms of why they measure security incidents, and for what purpose  they use certain indicators over others, it is still plausible to state that the approaches taken and  indicators used by both parties are more similar than they are different, as more than half of the  respondents have stated this. Further developments regarding harmonisations of the approaches taken  are still needed but overall the situation is running smoothly, the processes are in place, and the  reporting of significant incidents is being done at national and EU level. From the study, it was realized  that approaches taken by NRAs and providers varied depending on certain country-level factors. Some  were much more mature than others. Due to several advantageous circumstances, some NRAs  experienced strong cooperation with their providers when it came to implementing the necessary  changes.  Having said this, it is advised that making use of a standardized approach among NRAs and providers can  help derive more precise results in the incident reporting process. So, along with the list of indicators to  use, the key recommendation from the study is that NRAs and providers should further increase the  level of harmonisations in the approach taken to measure the impact of security incidents. Studying the  approaches taken, including the benefits and challenges of each measurement method led to gaining an  insight of the most common approaches used to assess security incidents. The list below summarises the  main classes of indicators, as identified during the study:   User/connection related indicators  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  06   Time/duration related indicators   Geographic area related indicators   Indicators related to infrastructure and services affected   Root cause dependent indicators   Economic impact related indicators   Indicators related to cyberattacks   Impact on confidentiality, availability and integrity  ENISA recommends the extensive use of this list of indicators, in related activities carried out by both  NRAs and telecommunications providers within EU and abroad. Measuring the impact of security  incidents, is a rather difficult process and the use of the current study can bring additional clarity.  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  07  1. Introduction  Background  Advances in electronic communication services have resulted in many changes, altering, reshaping and  even modernizing the way in which people communicate with each other. Some industries are strongly  revolutionized, especially those that deal with human senses, including entertainment, healthcare,  education and advertising. Electronic communications services warrant a smooth transmission of data  in this strongly interconnected world by providing the infrastructure for other business services to run.  Electronic communication services also play a significant role in national security, emergency response  and even in the economic well-being of a country. As a result, an outage in any one of these areas can  result in severe consequences. For example, impact could range from strong customer dissatisfaction to  impairing security and public safety and leading to economic repercussions.  In that context, measuring the impact of security incidents affecting telecommunications providers has  become a necessity in nowadays interconnected digital market. The European Commission (EC) has  made significant steps in this direction, with the 2009 Telecom Package, that included Art. 13a, a  regulation enforcing mandatory incident reporting for security incidents in the telecommunication  networks. The purpose of Article 13a of the Directive 2009/140 EC is to ensure the security and integrity  of electronic communication networks and services in the European Union, mostly by preventing  disruption of networks and services among others. As only significant incidents had to be reported,  meaning the ones with greater impact, member states have struggled for some time to define  “significant”.  To be able to identify significant incidents, providers and NRAS need to know how to measure their  impact. Measuring the impact of security incidents is not always easy as there are several different  variables which play a role. Furthermore, the impact of an incident can be evaluated from different  perspectives, making the process rather complicated.  By studying the indicators used to measure the impact of security incidents, especially the ones affecting  the availability of the service (disruptions), this report aims at collecting good practices and expertise in  order to share it across, encourage the exchange of these practices between member states and improve  harmonisation of the existing approaches. Evaluating the direct and indirect impact of security related  incidents can be crucial as a basis for investment in recovery strategies as well as investment in  prevention and mitigation strategies.  Scope of the document  This report aims to provide guidelines to NRAs and providers, to assist them in the process of measuring  the impact of security incidents affecting the availability of electronic communication services. Therefore,  interested stakeholders, especially telecommunications providers, will have at their disposal a catalogue  of indicators to be used to tailor impact assessment and design the corresponding solutions.  The goal of this study is to help policy makers at EU and member states level, along with the European  Commission and ENISA, develop better policies in order to further increase the security and resilience of  the electronic communications sector.  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  08  Target audience  Electronic communications providers (named providers as for the rest of the document), professionals  in the telecommunications industry, along with national regulatory agencies (NRAs) within the EU are  the main targets of this report. The report is also addressed to experts within the policy making area,  such as European Commission.  Methodology  The study was carried out in 3 phases. Firstly, a desktop research was performed to review approaches  taken by different member states and non-EU countries.  Next, a range of NRAs and service providers were identified and selected in order to complete an online  survey. A questionnaire was designed and communicated with those who agreed to take part.  Finally, telephone interviews were scheduled and conducted. Interview guides were sent to the selected  participants prior to the interview in order to foster meaningful conversations and gather useful insights.  Conclusions in this report are driven from the desktop research, interviews and the results of the online  survey. A total of 9 NRAs and 4 providers were reached for the interviews, whereas 13 NRAs and 23  providers responded to the online survey.  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  09  2. Varying approaches on measuring the impact of incidents  A milestone in measuring the significance of incidents within the telecommunications sector in the EU was  set up along with the adoption of the Framework Directive (Directive 2009/140 EC) within the 2009  Telecom Package, which included Art. 13a.  Art. 13a aims at ensuring the security and integrity of electronic communication networks and services in  the EU. This is partially achieved through requiring telecommunication service providers to take the  appropriate technical and organizational measures to manage the risks posed to security of networks and  services, guarantee the integrity of their networks (ensure the continuity of supply of services provided  over those networks) and notify the competent national regulatory authority (NRA) of a breach of security  or loss of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation of networks or services.  When article 13a was initially published, NRAs and providers were required to make some changes to their  internal procedures so as to comply with its requirements. This was especially true with regards to how  security incidents were measured and reported.  To have a well-established incident reporting method, NRAs and providers need to know how to  effectively measure the impact of a security incident. However, measuring the impact of a security  incident can often be a lengthy and complex process. In addition to this, there are some differences in the  approach taken between member states as well as the approach taken among NRAs and service providers.  Approaches taken by member states (NRAs)  The approaches taken by NRAs can be classified into two main categories.  The first category is one wherein NRAs have taken a reasonably collaborative approach with the  providers in adopting indicators to measure security incidents. In these cases, there has been a lot of  communication between the various groups involved. Furthermore, the indicators were defined and  agreed upon through consultation between the NRAs and providers.  The second approach however, is somewhat that of directly implementing the provisions of the  directive. Providers did not have much to say in the incident reporting process and instead had to comply  with the requirements of their NRAs. Differences in the approach taken can primarily be attributed to  country particularities. Regardless of whether the approach was more or less collaborative, NRAs and  providers were encouraged to use an additional second-level regulations along with ENISA’s technical  guidelines. However, this was not the approach taken by all member states. The reason for which  additional measures exists in some cases (but not in all), is related to the fact that the Telecom Package,  does not explicitly mention the indicators or reporting procedures that member states must follow.  2.1.1 Challenges  Since providers can vary in size, popularity but also in terms of their maturity levels, NRAs can find it  difficult to agree on a measurement method, which is applicable to all. Although mentioned as a medium  challenge, providers and NRAs are using different measurement methodologies (stated by 45% of the  respondents from the survey). A difference in the approach taken to measure security incidents can  potentially impact the results of the incident reporting process, and may not always represent a true and  fair view of the current situation in the country.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  10  Figure 1: Challenges of measuring security incidents - NRAs  That being said, identifying appropriate indicators and accurately measuring them, is in fact most  problematic (38% of the NRAs expressed this to be their medium to big challenge). Although only listed  as a medium challenge, NRAs also experienced difficulty in clearly defining an indicator (46% responded  that this was the case). The fact that NRAs experienced confusion in defining, identifying and accurately  measuring security incident indicators, can, for the most part, be attributed to Article 13a’s relative  ambiguity. Article 13a asks NRAs and providers to take appropriate steps to guarantee the integrity of  networks, but does not specify what is meant by “appropriate steps” nor does it specify on what basis  “integrity” is defined.  The directive also lacks necessary details needed for defining “significance” of  incidents. To provide more clarity, the Art. 13a Expert Group, coordinated by ENISA, has been established  in order to help by issuing good practices on these matters. Accurately measuring the indicators has  been mentioned as big to medium challenge by half of the NRA respondents.  2.1.2 Goals and benefits  Identifying the type of incident including the reason behind it (i.e. if the incident was accidental or  deliberate) and identifying the target of the incident, such as whether the incident affected customers  or networks etc. is seen as a key goal and benefit among NRAs (92% of respondents replied this to be  the case). This is in line with expectations as NRAs ultimately aim to protect citizens. Therefore,  measuring the impact an incident has on the population is necessary. Furthermore, accurately measuring  security incidents enables NRAs to have a better overview of the “as-is” situation in their country. By  identifying the types of incidents that can occur at a national level, NRAs are also more likely to put in  place the right kind of risk assessment and security measures (77% agreed).  NRAs were also keen on  understanding how security incidents impacted their citizens, with 62% replying that this was another  one of their main goals/benefits. 62% of survey respondents also stated that they were measuring the  impact of security incidents so as to comply with EU regulations (which was seen as a key goal/benefit).  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  Difficult to identify  appropriate indicators  Difficult to collect appropriate data  Difficult to clearly define indicators  Difficult to accurately  measure the indicators  Different measuring  methodologies between provider  and NRA  Administration burden  Other  In your opinion, what are the challenges of measuring the impact of security  incidents?  No Challenge Small Challenge Medium Challenge Big Challenge No answer  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  11  An additional benefit to measuring the impact of a security incident, from the perspective of the NRAs  is that the information can be used as a basis for maintaining statistics (as expressed by 38% of the  respondents).  Figure 2: Goals and benefits of measuring security incidents – NRAs  Issuing guidelines to providers on strengthening infrastructures and using the measurement  methodologies as an input for discussing challenges can be of benefit. Furthermore, it can also aid in  discussing issues with other providers and other sectors. However, both these indicators were seen as  more of a secondary objective rather than a primary one (38% for strengthening infrastructures and 31%  for discussing challenges).  In terms of the indirect goals, analysing indicators, resulted in the NRAs’ ability to perform better risk  assessment procedures at a national level, and to increase the level of security nationwide (38% said  that it helped perform risk assessments at national level and 46% agreed that it improved security  nationwide).  Approaches taken by e-communications providers  The approaches taken by providers can be directly correlated with their level of maturity in terms of  country legislations and practices (which can be seen when benchmarking one member state with  another). Approaches also vary among providers in terms of the providers’ business maturity, as well as  their level of maturity as regards the relationship and collaboration with their respective NRAs.  For providers who were very mature, the reporting process, including the indicators used to measure  security incidents were incorporated to a relatively good standard in their day-to-day practices.  Providers with an average level of maturity, including smaller providers were either eager to improve  their internal processes and security measures, identifying it as an opportunity to improve or were  reluctant to do so due to additional effort and resources needed.

In order to comply with the  regulations, small providers had to implement these security measures from scratch.  2.2.1 Advantages  Benefits in the approach taken by providers were quite similar to the benefits experienced by the NRAs.  Having a more transparent affiliation with the NRA, wherein there existed good communication and  transfer of information and knowledge between the two, meant that the transition process to the new  requirements of Article 13a, was a lot more easy than when compared to provider’s whose relationship  was not so strong. Furthermore, providers were able to better understand the importance of Article 13a  and how the former could positively benefit them. Effectively using the guidelines meant that providers  experienced less implementation costs and efforts taken to comply with the regulations. This was  especially true for the bigger telecommunications providers, as well as those who had greater  investment capacities.  As for the smaller players in the industry, although they may not have had the right capital to invest in,  or the relevant expertise and skills to do so, the advantage for them is that they have had the opportunity  to learn from the methods used by their counterparts, and based on this, adopt some of the leading  practices which would be most applicable to them. By doing so, they can also gain a competitive  advantage which is core to the nature of their business.  2.2.2 Challenges  Unsurprisingly, providers felt that measuring the impact of a security incident was a process that was  not only time consuming but also, expensive (30% said that it was time consuming and 30% mentioned  that they had insufficient budget). Providers expressed more in detail, their  concerns during the interviews. For example in situations where the NRA had  implemented a second level of regulation, providers were asked to issue two  incident reports, instead of just one. They were asked to issue the first report  within 24 hours following the identification of an incident. The second report was  requested to be issued within two weeks following the incident fix. Therefore, this  situation led to some administrative burdens and delay in resolving the incident  (13% stated that this was a big challenge and 57% agreed that it was a medium  one). Similarly, it was sometimes the case that the same incident was measured  twice. The incident was measured once by the provider for internal purposes and was later measured  again for the purpose of reporting to the NRA. Given that there are usually limited resources which are  usually supposed to be dedicated to resolving the issue; providers felt in such situations that they are  “wasting” time in writing reports, and measuring the impact. The former could denote that more  transparency and cooperation within the indicators area is required between providers and NRAs.  57%  Of providers felt  that measuring  security incidents  was an  Administrative  burden  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  13  Figure 3: Challenges of measuring security incidents - Providers  Furthermore, measuring security incident indicators also resulted in limited value for money (48% of  the providers responded that this was a big challenge whereas 43% stated that the challenge was a small  one).  Regardless of maturity levels however, and similar to the NRAs, all providers experienced some level of  difficulty when it came to identifying, collecting the relevant data, and accurately measuring security  incident indicators.  2.2.3 Goals and benefits  Complying with national regulations is one of the main objectives of measuring security indicators (43%  of the respondents agreed). Additionally, goals and benefits in the assessment approach means that  providers can in consequence also be able to better identify incidents and to establish a more rigorous  incident response mechanism (35% strongly felt that this improved identification of security incidents,  and 43% replied that this meant ensuring a more rigorous incident response system)  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  Difficult to identify  appropriate indicators  Difficult to collect appropriate data  Difficult to clearly define indicators  Difficult to accurately  measure the indicators  Administration burden  Limited value for money  Insufficient budget  Time consuming Other  In your opinion, what are the challenges of measuring the impact of security  incidents?  No Challenge Small Challenge Medium Challenge Big Challenge No answer  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  14  Figure 4: Goals and benefits for measuring security indicators - Providers  Another benefit from the viewpoint of the provider is that measuring security incident indicators can  enable them to use the information collected, as a basis for maintaining statistics (70% agreed). Using  the indicators also means that providers can identify repeated incidents and thus, put in place certain  measures so as to reduce the impact on their customers (52% believed this to be the case).  What is interesting to note is that informing other providers of the major impacts following an incident  was neither a benefit nor a goal (39% felt this way). At the same time, input for discussing challenges  and issues with other providers and other sectors also appeared to be neutral as well. From this  information, it can be assumed that providers were not so willing to share or discuss of the security  incidents among each other or within different sectors.  In addition to this, although complying with national regulations is one of the main aims, many providers  expressed that their goals were not always in line with that of their NRAs. Unlike the NRAs, whose  ultimate purpose is to protect citizens, providers are much more business oriented. Providers are  constantly seeking new ways to grow their business and increase revenue and are also trying to position  themselves strategically in the market. Their objective is to deliver a positive experience for their  customers. Having said this, being customer centric meant that providers were using security indicators  (i.e. root cause of an incident, number of users affected, time duration etc.) to design effective security  mechanisms to not lose reputation among the public. The measures were also being used to assess  damage of the incidents and to also identify revenue for their business.  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80%  Identify the type of incident  Used as a basis for maintain statistics  Better incident response management  Achieve greater transparency by improving the incidents reporting process  Inform the NRA about major impact following incidents which could have a possible impact in other Member States  Inform other providers about major impact following incidents  Perform risk assessments (network level)  Comply with national regulations  Assess whether you need to invest in stronger infrastructure  Improve security and resilience of networks and services  Identify the cause of failure and/or isolation in order to prevent them from happening again  Input for discussing challenges and issues with other providers and other sectors  Have an overview of the main types of incidents in the network (kind of risk assessment)  Minimize impact for customers  For you as a provider, what are your main goals or benefits when using such indicators?

The former can  provide useful insights which can eventually be applied, and also leveraged upon among the different  members states. A lot of information is available on threats and security issues associated with  “information security” in particular. This is especially true for countries such as the United States and  India. As a principle, it was noted that three aspects of information security are considered:  “availability”, “integrity” and “confidentiality” of information. While availability is the main area of focus  for Article 13a, other sectors have directed their attention towards “confidentiality” instead.  For example, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States measures the impact  of security incidents using several key indicators. Furthermore, they have also established an incident  reporting process which provides guidelines to telecom operators in the United States on what to report  and when to notify of incidents. To facilitate the incident reporting process, the FCC has also set  threshold values.  Telecommunications operators are requested to report on the following; the date  and time of onset of the outage; a brief description of the problem; service effects and the geographic  area affected by the outage. A distinction is also made on “initial” and “final” reports meaning that  similar to Article 13a, providers report the same incident more than once (once initially and after it is  resolved).  Outage reporting requirements are categorized based on the service that is affected.  Services include cable services, IXC1 tandem facilities, outages to satellite communications, signaling  system, wireless services and interconnected VOIP service providers. For more information, readers can  refer to the ecfr.gov website.  To achieve efficiency and encourage the public to communicate the incidents, the FCC has issued key  information via their online website. They have also established a page which is dedicated to providing  information to users including the FCC phone directory, organizational charts, the FCC’s offices and  emergency contact information.  In India, the Department of Information Technology (DIT) has defined Service Level Indicators for their  SWAN operation (State Wide Area Network). Indicators for SWAN are requested to be considered by the  respective states within India for incorporation in their Service Level Agreements with operators.  Thresholds values are defined which help in measuring the impact of an incident. In addition to this,  emphasis is also placed on the time duration of an incident (initial response time and issue resolution  time). To assess severity of an impact, the DIT also recommends operators to measure the availability  and extent of outage experienced for the following: internet availability, firewall outage, IDS outage and  Denial of Service. This is different to the existing indicators used at EU level and assessing the impact of  incidents through this viewpoint can allow member states to obtain technical insight on the cause of an  incident or vulnerabilities surrounding existing infrastructures and services. For more information on the  thresholds including how they are used among different states in India and on the specificities of the  technical information, such as bandwidth and availability etc., readers can access this website.  The indicators used to measure security incidents in both these situations, can be related to the ones  transposed in the European Union, linked to Article 13a.  1 Interexchange Carrier or long-distance telephone company.  http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=617740ce7d789a296ccb55edda008c40&mc=true&node=pt47.1.4&rgn=div5#se47.1.4_15 http://deity.gov.in/sites/upload_files/dit/files/downloads/policiesandguidelines/swan/An3_Guidelines_Bandwidth.pdf  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  16  Harmonizing NRAs & Providers  To remain a key player in the market, providers should know how to attract and retain customers. For  this, they need to be able to provide the best services to their customers. One way of achieving this, is  to continuously monitor the functionality of infrastructures and services. In contrast, the approach taken  by the NRAs is not necessarily going to be the same (NRAs do not have the same commercial objective  as that of a provider). NRAs are concerned with protecting their citizens and on improving security within  the country.  Regardless of the role and purpose of the NRA and provider, the bottom line is the same. Both need  to take appropriate measures to guarantee security, but the main purpose of why they offer security  differs from one to the other.  Sometimes it appears to be difficult to know of the internal regulations used by operators. Furthermore,  it is difficult to say if these regulations are in place in an attempt to comply with country level regulations  or if they already existed beforehand.  Other than the incidents that are reported to the NRA (as part of the reporting process), several NRAs  did not know of the additional indicators that providers were using (23% stated this to be the case).  Figure 5: Similarity of indicators among NRAs and providers – NRAs perspective  The same was also conveyed more in detail during the interviews, wherein NRAs described that even if  they had a good overview of the security measures taken by the big operators within the country, access  to relevant information on the smaller players was very much limited.  In situations where the NRA did have an indication of the measurement methods however, it was found  that providers were using similar indicators for the same kind of services (54% of the NRAs agreed).  Nevertheless, there were some notes by providers, stating that although the indicators used may be the  same, in some cases the measurement method is not the same. For instance, when measuring affected  users on a fixed voice service, the value of the indicator will differ if the NRA uses provisioned customers  and the provider uses statistic usage curves.  54%  8%  15%  23%  0%  Are the indicators used by the different providers similar for the same services  Yes, the indicators used by the different providers are similar  Yes, the indicators used by the different providers are similar but some providers use additional indicators  No, the indicators used by different providers vary quite a lot  I don't know the indicators used by the provider  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  17  In one example though, the NRA argued the opposite. It explained how 5 of the largest providers in the  country represented 90% of the market in terms of customers, while 500 small providers represented  only 10%. Indicators were calculated based on affected customers, geographic area and loss of capacity  etc. The smaller providers found it difficult to meet the standards of the reporting process, and felt more  comfortable with reporting on loss of capacity only.  In addition to this, if for example an incident affects a large provider, it would be  more likely that the incident is published in the news and/or media. When the  incident affects a smaller provider instead, the visibility of that incident is not so  apparent, therefore making it much more difficult for the NRAs to come to know of  it.  15% of survey respondents mentioned that the indicators used by different  providers, varied quite a lot from one provider to another and 8% expressed that  the indicators used were similar, but that some providers were using additional  indicators. From this, it is reasonable to say that NRAs had differing opinions on the level of  harmonization between them and their providers. Some felt that the harmonization levels were good  and that there existed a good alignment between the two, whereas others expressed that this level of  harmonization could be further improved.  Differing opinions in harmonization levels was also perceived among providers as well. 54% of the  respondents from the survey felt that there was a good level of collaboration between them and their  NRAs.  That being said, 13% described that they were in fact using a greater number of indicators than what  had been defined by their NRAs. As resulted from the response, it’s quite normal that a large provider  uses more indicators that those requested by the NRA. While the NRA is interested in “major” indicators  of impacts on citizens, the provider needs a lot more indicators to help manage the day-to-day  operations. Nevertheless, it cannot be assumed that the indicators that the NRA requests are within the  indicators already used by the provider.  Figure 6: Similarity of the indicators among NRAs and providers –Provider’s perspective  44%  13%  17%  13%  13%  0%  Do you use similar indicators than the ones defined by the NRA?

This often  resulted in additional costs and extra effort. For example, providers already had in place certain  indicators to fulfil their own objectives and goals (i.e. build good relationships with customers, establish  a good reputation in the marketplace, become the leading provider in the industry etc.). However,  complying with the requirements of the NRA meant that they had to make some changes to the way in  which they measured security incidents. This also included measuring the same type of incident based  on a new set of thresholds. A misalignment in the way in each of the indicators were measured  sometimes resulted in a difference in opinion between the NRA and the provider and in some cases also  had an impact on the relationship between the NRA and the provider.  Furthermore, the “misalignment” most often manifested itself in the incident reporting process. For  example, according to the guidelines of 8 of the NRAs interviewed, an incident report should be sent by  the provider to the NRA with one hour after identifying an incident. However, the incident is not  necessarily resolved within that hour. The time taken to report an incident actually results in a delay in  time to resolve the incident. That being said, in the majority of the cases the team who is responsible for  reporting the incident to the NRA is also the same team involved in resolving the incident. A lot of effort  is required in terms of reporting the incident and additional work is also performed when reporting the  same incident for the second time (incident is reported within 1 hour of being identified and then  reported again once resolved). While this demands quite a lot of effort from the side of the providers,  measuring incidents in this way, actually adds value to the incident reporting process from the viewpoint  of the NRAs (NRAs are able to gather more insight on the nature of the incident).  To reinforce this point, when asked if objectives of the NRA were aligned with the providers objectives,  54% of NRAs from the survey, felt that objectives were “somewhat aligned”. In other words, even if  protecting end users vs building a good reputation, differed to some extent, the means of achieving the  objectives are in actual fact similar (Fig. 7). Only 23% of the survey respondents replied that both NRAs  and providers had exactly the same objectives when defining indicators to measure the security  incidents, whereas only 8% replied that the objectives were different.  To summarize, irrespective of the differing opinions among NRAs and providers and irrespective  of if internal procedures differed based on the type of incident in scope, it was found that NRAs  and providers mainly use similar indicators  to measure security incidents. There are although  slight differences regarding the measurement methods, as reported by some providers.

To add to this, 30% replied that both  they and their NRA had the same objectives. 17% claimed that they did not know of  the objectives of their NRA and another 9% stated that the objectives were  different. The key message here is that providers share the same objectives as NRAs.  In the same way, to gain an insight on the satisfaction levels, NRAs and providers  were asked to also give their opinion as regards to the indicators used by providers  as well as the guidelines provided by the NRA. From what can be noted, the majority  of NRAs were satisfied with the indicators used by providers. 62% of NRAs replied  that they were somewhat satisfied whereas only 15% stated that they were missing details on the impact  of incidents. Another 23% replied that security incidents were measured in an accurate and timely  manner by the providers.  According to 44% of the providers, NRAs facilitated them in their process of defining appropriate  indicators. However, 13% answered that these guidelines could be somewhat improved. Another 13%  answered that they did not need help any from the NRA when measuring security incidents at all. This  could because they were already using a good set of indicators, which happened to also be the ones  purported by the NRA. There could have also been a certain degree of reluctance on the part of the  provider to complying with the recommendations as mentioned in the guidelines. Finally not all  providers may have seen the value, or return on investment in complying with regulations.

Analysis of identified incident indicators  The indicators presented within this chapter have been obtained and were compiled as the most  commonly used indicators from the views of both NRAs and providers. The results from the graph below  represent the average percentage of users that replied as using the indicators for measuring security  incidents for all technologies. In cases where the user did not answer or the indicator was not used, these  percentages were omitted from the calculation.  Figure 12: Commonly used indicators among NRAs and providers  From the graph, it can be noted that “number of users impacted” and “duration of an incident” were the  most common indicators which were used by 100% of NRAs, whereas providers used these indicators  on average 61% for “number of users impacted” and 63% for “time duration” of an incident.  Furthermore, “impact on emergency services”, “networks and assets impacted” as well as “geographical  area impacted”, was also used quite frequently. This is especially true among NRAs in particular. To  obtain more information on the indicators used by both NRAs and providers for each individual  technology however, readers can refer to the following sections of the report.  Keeping this in mind, it is important to note that the above does not represent the exhaustive list of  indicators. Referring to the summary below, it is possible to also get more information on the  measurement methodologies of each indicator including the indicators benefits and challenges.  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 120%  Number of users impacted  Duration of an incident  Specific time at which an…  Time to recover from an…  Fluctuating timeperiod  Geographical area impacted  Services affected  Networks and assets impacted  Impact on emergency services  Impact on sensitive areas  Impact on interconnections  Number of base stations…  Impact to recoverability  Impact on confidentiality  Impact on integrity  Impact on availability  Average percentage of indicators used among NRAs and providers for all technologies  Providers NRAs  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  23   User/connection related indicators   Number of users affected (fixed telephony)   Number of users affected (mobile telephony)   Time/duration related indicators   Time duration of an incident   Specific time at which an incident occurred   Time to recover   Fluctuating time period of an incident   Geographic area related indicators   Impact based on location   Geographic area based on infrastructure coverage   Geographic area based on number of customers affected   Geographic area based on number of services affected   Indicators related to infrastructure and services affected   Network infrastructures and assets   Impact on emergency services   Root cause dependent indicators   Human error   System failures   Natural phenomena   Internal vs. Third party failure   Economic impact related indicators   Indicators related to cyberattacks   Sources/destination of “attacks” related indicators   Vulnerabilities related to networks and services   Impact on confidentiality, availability and integrity  User/connection related indicators  Calculating the number of users or connections affected was identified as a key indicator among NRAs  and providers. This indicator was being used by all respondents of the surveys, to measure the impact  of any given security incident.  During the interviews, it came to light however that the measurement method for assessing this  particular indicator was in fact, the most challenging one. To add to the difficulty, there are different  technologies that are offered to customers, such as fixed telephony and mobile telephony etc. which  complicate the measurement even further. A common measurement method for each service cannot be  applied. For this reason the measurements are grouped per technology.  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  24  Figure 13:  Measuring incidents based on number of users affected  3.1.1 Number of users affected (fixed telephony)  Identifying the number of users impacted for fixed line telephony is relatively easy to measure when  compared with mobile telephony. Fixed telephony service providers can use the number of customers  connected to a Switch to estimate the number of affected customers (usually 1 line = 1 subscriber).  Furthermore, as providers know the number of users connected to specific equipment, they are in a  position to better determine the impact of an incident. However, not all providers are able to apply this  method as sometimes 1 line can have many users and this is not always easy to know. The former is  often the case when the user is a company (not an individual customer) and unless the providers are  able to have access to information about the number of connections/subscribers in the company, the  measurement method is not so accurate.  When considering the number of users impacted by a security incident, providers can also approach this  by measuring both the provisioned number of customers impacted, as well as the actual usage. This  allows for a differentiation between the two because the number of users affected by an incident will  not be the same at 4PM than at 4AM. This information can be useful for a number of reasons including  for example, maintenance purposes. In addition to the former, the provider can also have in place a  detailed process for measuring “service usage”. By using a service usage curve, it is possible to examine  the number of users using a given service at a specific point in time as opposed to the number of  provisioned users for that particular service.  3.1.2 Number of users affected (mobile telephony)  For mobile services the guidelines are much more flexible. Therefore, providers can chose in which way  they want to perform the analysis to determine the impact on their customers. For example, providers  can chose to look at the number of people who are living in the affected area or to look at the market  share in the specific area and on how the network is dimensioned in this particular area, to find out how  many possible affected subscribers are included.  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  120%  Fixed telephony Mobile telephony Fîxed internet access Mobile internet access Other  Which indicators do you currently use to assess the impact of security incidents  affecting the electronic communications sector: Number of users impacted  NRAs Providers  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  25  As opposed to fixed telephony, mobile telephony is the provision of telephone services to phones which  may move around freely rather than stay fixed in one location, thus making it difficult to measure. An  approach taken by some NRAs to overcome the challenge in measuring the number of users affected for  mobile services, is to request providers to assess the traffic use of the previous week of the incident or  to compare the traffic of the previous week day with the traffic of the current day on the affected  equipment and multiply this number with the total number of SIMs they had before the incident took  place.  (Traffic last Thursday - Traffic this Thursday) x number of SIM cards = number of SIM cards affected  While calculating the number of SIM cards can be one way of determining the number of users affected  in a geographic area, not all the providers have the ability to obtain the exact number. Therefore most  of the operators have a rule that considers the average number of users per base station.  In the case of moving disturbances such as a storm, the NRA can request to receive a map from the  providers showing the area where the outage occurs at a particular point and the number of affected  based stations.  To summarize, even if NRAs have equipped their providers with guidelines on  measuring the number of users or lines that have been affected following an  incident, the choice of methodology has been left to the providers.  According to the study, 100% of the NRAs are asking for the number of users  affected for fixed and mobile telephony and internet services. When making the  same comparison at the provider level, the majority of providers were measuring  the number of users affected for fixed telephony and internet technologies, than  they were for mobile telephony and mobile internet technologies (74% for fixed  telephony and internet and 48% for mobile telephony and internet technologies).  It can be assumed that the reason for which there exists a difference in the figures  at the provider level is because some providers are not so sure on how to effectively  measure mobile telephony and internet access services than when compared to  fixed lines. As mentioned above, this is because it is easier to detect how many  users are connected to fixed line services and also to calculate how many users are impacted following  an incident than when calculating the number of mobile users as mobile services can be used for many  purposes (not only  for phone calls). Furthermore, mobile users are constantly “on the move”. Therefore  if for example one were to measure the number of mobile users impacted based on geographical area,  this would be different based on individual factors (the user may work in a different area to where he  lives). There are many other individual factors as such, making the process complicated. Similarly it is  difficult to make correlations between users who use fixed and mobile services simultaneously.  Time/duration related indicators  The gravity of the incident and the type of resources it affects will determine the amount of time and  resources needed to recover from that incident. An incident may require far more resources to recover  from than what the organization can handle. Those resolving an incident should consider the effort  necessary to actually recover from an incident and carefully weigh that against the value of the recovery  effort. As with number of users affected, this indicator can be measured in different ways. The commonly  identified methods for NRAs and providers were to assess the impact of the former based on the time  duration of an incident but also the time to recover from an incident.  74%  Of providers  measure  incidents for  fixed  technologies  48%  Of providers  measure  incidents for  mobile  technologies  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  26  For example, “time duration” and “time to recovery” were used as indicators by 100% of NRAs who took  part in the survey. Indicators such as “fluctuating time period”, was used on average by 31% and “specific  time” at which an incident occurred was only used by 15% of the NRAs.  Figure 14: Measuring incidents based on time – NRAs perspective  Figure 15: Measuring incidents based on time- Providers perspective  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  120%  Fixed telephony Mobile telephony Fixed internet access Mobile internet access Other  Time/Duration related indicators  Duration of an incident Specific time at which incident occured  Time to recovery Fluctuating time period of an incident  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  Fixed telephony Mobile telephony Fixed internet access Mobile internet access Other  Time/Duration related indicators  Duration of an incident Specific time at which incident occured  Time to recovery Fluctuating time period of an incident  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  27  Similarly providers were more commonly using the same two indicators (“time duration” and “time to  recovery”) in comparison to the other time related indicators too. 74% replied that they were measuring  the duration of an incident and time to recover from an incident for fixed telephony and internet  technologies. The same is also true for mobile technologies which were used by 48% for “duration of an  incident” and 52% for “time to recovery”.  3.2.1 Duration of an incident  The time duration of an incident can be assessed from the moment at which the incident is identified  until full recovery of the connections (i.e. up until the last connection is restored on the last based station  affected).  However, the challenges that some providers have expressed is that there is a lapse of time during which  service starts to degrade but is not reported by the providers. Therefore the incident may not fully reflect  the total duration of an incident interruption.  Another way to calculate duration of an incident is to break it down into several sections including when  the incident started, when it is estimated to be over, and when it is actually over. This helps in  determining how long the interruption lasted. Determining the time duration of an incident is a  beneficial approach as it is possible to see how long it took to recover from the incident and thus measure  how efficient the provider was in resolving it.  In some cases, duration of an incident is only measured after the incident has been resolved, not during  resolution.  3.2.2 Specific time at which an incident occurred  Incidents can also be measured based on the specific time at which they occurred. For example, an  incident that happened on the weekend can have a different impact from that which took place during  a weekday (and that too during working hours). This is because, the chances that more people were  making use of telecommunications services during that time are greater, and thus the impact of the  incident as well as its consequences, would have also been greater. So, this indicator would be addressed  if the number of affected users was calculated based on statistic usage curves (which vary throughout  the day) and not based on provisioned customers.  3.2.3 Time to recover  Time to recover can often be confused with duration of an incident. Therefore it is necessary to create a  distinction between the two. Where duration of an incident reflects the action taken from beginning to  end of an incident, time to recover is calculated from the moment the restoration work has started on  the incident and ends with full recovery. Time to recover from an incident (i.e. hours or minutes etc.),  often takes less time than the actual duration of the incident.  That being said, there are also some additional complexities with measuring this indicator. This is  because it is often hard to differentiate between when an incident actually occurred, in comparison to  when it was realized or acknowledged. Furthermore, in terms of calculating the time to recover from an  incident, NRAs and providers also expressed that they found it a bit challenging to know on what basis  to measure the recovery of an incident. For example, does this depend on the time it took for all services  and users to fully recover from an impact of an incident, or did this depend on when the number of users  and services affected, were within a certain range (i.e. below the defined threshold).  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  28  3.2.4 Fluctuating time period of an incident  Measuring the fluctuating time period of an incident might prove challenging because the quality of the  offered service usually will not degrade instantly. There may be some fluctuations in the services’  functionality which could still be rather volatile, for a certain amount of time, before the service  eventually results in total failure. Focus should be placed on service degradation.  That being said, when providers report on time/duration related indicators, they need to be specific on  what basis they are measuring “time”. This is because if one provider has calculated the impact based  on time to recover from the incident, whereas the other has done the same based on time duration of  the incident, the end information reported to the NRAs cannot be accurately measured nor compared  between one another.  Geographical area related indicators  Measuring security incidents which affect certain geographical areas, allows NRAs and providers to  identify which region is most affected by an incident.  The benefit of measuring security incidents using  this approach is that, through this, it is possible to determine whether or not the geographic landscape  of a location plays a role in the frequency at which an incident takes place and in determining the type  of incident that has occurred. Geographic impact, on both fixed line and mobile services, is calculated by  almost all respondents of the survey.  Figure 16:  Measuring incidents based on area impacted  Calculating the geographic spread of an incident is especially important to consider in countries with  diverse surroundings. For example, places that are urbanised and better connected would experience  less disruptions, but the disruptions would affect more people than when compared to areas that are  less urbanised. That being said, the impact of an incident affecting an island near the sea would be  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  Fixed telephony Mobile telephony Fîxed internet access Mobile internet access Other  Which indicators do you currently use to assess the impact of security incidents  affecting the electronic communications sector Geographic Impact  NRAs Providers  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  29  greater due to poor network coverage. Furthermore, the chance of an incident occurring in remote areas  is greater due to national hazards such as storms and bad weather.  3.3.1 Impact based on location  Security incidents can be measured as per the number of square km affected. For instance, in countries  where access to certain areas is rather remote (i.e. mountains, isolated islands, forests etc.), an outage  can impact either half the city, or nobody at all (which should be taken into consideration).  Furthermore, depending on the size of the geographic area and the impact which the incident caused,  the incident is either requested to be reported to the NRA, or not reported at all. Whether or not to  report an incident depends on the thresholds set by the NRA. In most cases, the NRAs were found to  have followed the guidelines provided by ENISA when defining such thresholds.  For some NRAs, it’s difficult to assess the location of an incident as one incident can affect several  locations. Furthermore, if there is an area with only one operator and this operator experienced an  interruption of services, there is an increased chance that the consequences of the incident will be more  severe.  3.3.2 Geographic area based on infrastructure coverage  Another way to measure incidents’ impact can be based on the geographical coverage of the networks.  Some NRAs did not use a specific geographic area to measure this indicator as one base station can cover  many areas. Instead, this indicator can be measured by calculating the number of base stations that are  affected. By identifying the number of base stations impacted, it is possible to identify each of the  different areas that are associated with that base station and hence, calculate the geographic spread.  3.3.3 Geographic area based on number of customers affected  Measuring the geographic impact of an incident can also be calculated by combining the geographic  spread with the number of customers affected. That being said, regardless of the area which was  impacted, the total number of customers can be measured first. Based on the total number of customers  that are impacted, it was later easy to identify the area in which the incident took place.  3.3.4 Geographic area based on number of services affected  Similarly, geographic impact can also be calculated based on the number of services affected and the  areas where they are provided. Services such fixed or mobile telephony, voice and internet access  services are included in this calculation. Taking the example of fixed line services, if 500 or more  customers are affected, then the incident is considered as significant (depending on the thresholds set  by the country), and as such should be reported to the NRA. Determining the number of services affected  ant the area where the services are provided, can help determine and locate the geographic spread of  the incident.  Indicators related to affected infrastructure and services  Providers are requested to assess the types of infrastructures and services that are affected following an  incident. Assessing the types of infrastructure and services affected can enable an overview of the ones  that are most vulnerable to threats. Precaution can therefore be taken on those assets and investment  in newer infrastructures can also be made if needed.  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  30  3.4.1 Network infrastructure and assets  Using indicators to measure security incidents on network infrastructure and assets is generally quite  straightforward. Providers are requested to give information to their NRAs on the types of  infrastructures that have been impacted. This includes information such as the providers’ internal  networks (core networks and active networks) that are affected as well as on the type of services that  were affected (TV services, voicemail services etc.).  However, it is not always clear on how to measure this aspect. The main question that needs to be asked  is does this calculation depend on the number of services and assets that have resulted in total shut  down, or does this instead refer to a percentage in the number of service that are impacted (20% of  services for example).  Figure 17: Measuring incidents based on services affected  Impact on emergency services  Ensuring that security incidents do not impact emergency services is highly important in the  telecommunications sector. In case of any emergency, people expect to be able to reach the right  services and on time. This includes dialling numbers such as 112, to report events such as accidents,  burglary, fires etc. Emergency functions should be working at all times in order to protect the general  safety of the public.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  Fixed telephony Mobile telephony Fîxed internet access Mobile internet access Other  Which indicators do you currently use to assess the impact of security incidents  affecting the electronic communications sector:  Services affected  NRAs Providers  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  31  Figure 18: Measuring incidents based on emergency services  Analysing the impact of incidents on the emergency services was measured for all technology types such  as fixed telephony, fixed internet access, mobile telephony and mobile internet access. This is especially  true for NRAs wherein 92% were measuring the former for fixed technologies and 85% for mobile.  That being said, measurement methods can be complicated because for example, if an incident affects  a phone service, it can potentially affect emergency service calls as well. In some cases, only the  emergency services are affected while other telecommunications services are still functioning. The  numbers of affected users are counted differently here as users may still have their services working  while being unable to reach the emergency services. In this situation, the number of users is the number  of users that cannot connect to an emergency number. As stated by most of the respondents, for  determining the impact on emergency services, it is often the case that NRAs and providers rely on  estimates (such as previous statistics etc.).  Root causes dependent indicators  Determining the impact of an incident based on the analysis of the root cause, can be a good approach.  Determining what went wrong, and what led to the incident to occur in the first place, can minimize or  monitor similar patterns of the incident should such an incident occur in the future.  However, some issues that providers can be faced with, is that although they were required to report  the root cause of the incident, the form which they had to complete, was structured in a way that made  it difficult to understand. The form was sometimes too technical and those completing it were not able  to provide enough precision on the specific reason for the incident. Without enough precision on the  root cause of the incident, it makes it difficult for NRAs and even providers to clearly analyse what went  wrong and assess the points of improvement.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  Fixed telephony Mobile telephony Fîxed internet access Mobile internet access Other  which indicators do you currently use to assess the impact of security incidents  affecting the electronic communications sector:  Impact on emergency services  NRAs Providers  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  32  Malicious attacks also falls under this category but has been explained more in detail in section 3.8 of  the report  3.6.1 Human errors  Using “human errors” as a measurement to assess security incidents can help to assess whether the  incidents have taken place due to negligence and/or lack of awareness of people. Human error incidents  are usually caused during the operation of equipment or facilities, the use of tools and the executions of  procedures, etc. In order to avoid this kind of error in the future, trainings can be conducted for the  relevant parties involved. That being said, human error also includes things such as misconfigurations. If  a system is not properly configured, it can lead to security incidents.  3.6.2 System failures  Measuring the impact of security incidents as a result of system failures, such as hardware and software  failure, can encourage the NRAs but mostly providers to put in place rigorous monitoring mechanisms  of their systems. Furthermore, in case there are a lot of incidents that have occurred due to system  failures, providers can look to invest in newer infrastructures. Nevertheless, this process can get quite  technical. Therefore, by analysing the reason for which the incident resulted in system failure and  thereafter providing high-level information on this can help the necessary people concerned to  determine whether or not to spend on new infrastructure.  3.6.3 Natural phenomena  The indicator “natural phenomena” includes measuring incidents that are caused by severe weather,  earthquakes, floods, wildfires, and so on. After measuring the probability of an incident occurring due  to natural hazards, providers can build stronger infrastructure or backup systems in order to ensure  continued availability. That being said, after identifying the areas which are most likely to be affected by  natural phenomenon and/or measuring the probability of natural phenomenon occurrence, means that  providers can be better prepared for such incidents and take the necessary precautions accordingly.  3.6.4 Internal vs. Third party failure  Third party failures are an important variable when measuring security incidents. If the incident was due  to an outside vendor technical issues, is an important thing to consider, as outsourcing some of the  services to outside parties is a common approach of providers nowadays. Determining if an incident is  internal or external can assist providers in the identification of whom the incident will impact and areas  to approach in order to mitigate the incident. 16% of all incidents reported in 20142 to ENISA, were third  party failures.  3.6.5 Malicious actions / cyberattacks  Incidents related to cyber-attacks can also have an impact on telecommunications services. As such NRAs  and providers should also consider measuring security incidents from this point of view. This is especially  true for internet services (both fixed and mobile). For example, denial of service attacks (DOS), or attacks  on the network (related to cyber-attacks) can result in downtime. As with the telecommunications  2 Annual Incident Report 2014  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2014  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  33  sector, cyber-security related incidents can affect a varied range of industries. There is plenty of  information on how to calculate the impact of an attack, detailing the use of algorithms etc.  Source/destination of “attacks”  Measuring the source or destination of an incident can help NRAs and providers to identify the cause of  an attack as well as its target. This also helps in identifying incident’s criticality as well as the severity of  its impact. Understanding the severity of the impact can be derived by studying who the former will  affect: the customers, the network or the whole country. Necessary measures to mitigate the risks  depending on the destination of the attack can thereafter be put in place. That being said, identifying  the source of an attack helps in determining if or not the incident was intentional. The need to identify  “attack” incident types is becoming more and more common as such incidents are being encountered  on an often basis. NRAs and providers should be prepared to handle such situations. Furthermore, there  are different types of cyber security attacks and the necessary measures to address them, may differ  from one another.  Vulnerabilities within networks and services  Taking into account network and services vulnerabilities can also be another approach to take. As a  provider, knowing and understanding vulnerabilities within the network can be an advantage when  addressing incidents. For example, if one segment of the network can be made unavailable due to a  serious vulnerability, that may be also present in other segments, knowing the situation and how to  address it can help the provider in preparing the response to the incident and can help him prevent  similar incidents in the future.  Economic impact related indicators  Though it was expressed by both the NRAs and providers that cost of damage was an indicator which  was not used commonly, assessing security related incidents from this viewpoint can lead to some  benefits. Providers were using cost to recover from an incident more frequently to measure the impact  of recovery of an incident (50%) than when compared with measuring the actual loss of revenue  following an incident (38%) or measuring the loss of market share (14%).  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  34  Figure 19: Economic related indicators to measure security incidents  Examining economic impact related indicators can be used by the providers to assess the overall damage  of an incident.  Impact on confidentiality, availability and integrity (CIA)  Evaluating the impact an incident has on availability, is the most pertinent factor in the  telecommunications sector and the majority of providers were measuring impact of an incident based  this metric (40% agreed). Nevertheless, security incidents can also negatively affect other areas too. If  information is disclosed to unauthorized individuals, or if, for example, the information is not accurately  available, businesses may suffer undesirable consequences. This could lead to a loss in customer  confidence, contractual damages and can even result in financial losses  13%  37%  50%  0%  Measuring the impact of an incident based on factors impacting the economy  Loss of market share  Actual loss of revenue  Cost to recover  No answer  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  35  Figure 20: CIA related indicators to measure security incidents – provider’s perspective  As a general remark, the CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity and availability) is designed to guide policies  for information security within an organization. The triad can be adapted to telecommunications without  only emphasising on availability. At the moment only 30% of providers are measuring incidents based  on confidentially and integrity.  Figure 20: CIA related indicators to measure security incidents – NRAs perspective  Similarly, availability was the most commonly assessed indicator among NRAs, with 55% using this indicator  to measure the impact of security incidents (mainly due to Art. 13a specific requirements). Integrity was  measured among 27% and 18% focused on the confidentiality aspect to measure security incidents.  30%  30%  40%  Measuring the impact of an incident based on confidentiality, integrity and  availability  Confidentiality  Integrity  Availability  18%  27% 55%  Measuring the impact of an incident based on confidentiality, integrity and  availability  Confidentiality  Integrity  Availability  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  36  Protecting sensitive information is becoming a key topic, not only in telecoms but in information security as  well and by measuring the impact an incident has on sensitive information and on the integrity of such  information can be another angle by which to assess security related repercussions.  Indicators used per technology  A point which needs to be highlighted is that for some of the questions in the survey, respondents were  allowed to select more than one technology when specifying the indicators used to measure security  incidents (as seen in sections 3.1 to 3.9). For example, for the indicator “number of users impacted”,  providers answered that they used this indicator to measure the impact of an incident for “fixed  telephony”, “mobile telephony” and “fixed internet”, “mobile internet” etc.  To identify the percentage of indicators used per each individual technology, the same data used in the  sections above can be presented in a different way. Using this method it is possible to identify why some  indicators were used a lot less or a lot more for some technologies than when compared to others.

To add to this point, it can be said that NRAs seem to be using the indicators more “effectively” than  providers. For example, indicators such as “number of users impacted” and “duration of incidents”, is used  by all NRAs who answered to the survey, for all technologies (100%).  Furthermore, at the NRA level, the  answers were very similar from one technology to the other. On the other hand, this was not the case at  the provider level. The extent to which each indicator was used, and that too for each technology  depended a lot on the provider’s level of maturity and also to a big extent on the provider’s relationship  with its NRA. On average, indicators were used quite well for fixed telephony technologies. However, the  percentage of providers who were using the indicators (mentioned above), to measure the impact on  mobile internet, was considerably less (almost half as less), for mobile technologies. The reason for this  relates once again to the fact that knowing how to evaluate the impact of a fixed technology is more  straightforward than that of mobile. As is described at the start of this section, there are many additional  complexities involved in mobile telephony and mobile internet services that both NRAs and providers  should consider.  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  120%  Number of users impacted  Duration of an incident  Time to recovery Geographical area impacted  Impact on emergency  services  Services affected Networks and assets impacted  Indicators used per technology: Mobile internet  NRAs Providers  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  39  4. Particularities regarding measuring the impact of incidents  Defining significance of an incident  Defining the significance of an incident is an important aspect for measuring its impact. That being said,  some indicators are definitely more pertinent than others. The Article 13a group along with ENISA have  established some informal indicators along with the corresponding thresholds, to be used by NRAs and  providers in the EU. These are not imposed, however they can be used to measure the significance or  severity of an incident and can also encourage NRAs and providers to use their own thresholds. Based  on those thresholds and indicators, they could be adopted as is by the involved stakeholders or modified  accordingly, based on their necessity. This was also the case of most NRAs that used the indicators and  thresholds as an inspirations, but followed a national approach based on their particularities.  According to the data gathered during this study, significance is mostly measured based on two key  indicators: the number of customers impacted, and the duration of an incident. An additional indicator  which is also commonly used is the number of services affected. To derive appropriate results, NRAs and  providers can use a combination of these indicators in their calculation methods. For example,  significance can either be calculated based on the number of users impacted vs. duration of an incident,  or the number of services affected vs. duration of an incident.  If an incident results in downtime, but the time taken to recover from the impact is below the threshold  defined by the NRA, or the number of users that were affected by the incident is below a certain  threshold, then providers are not obliged to report the incident to their NRAs, as the incident is not of a  significant impact. As per the informal guidelines of the Article 13a group, incidents should only be  reported if the incident reaches the red areas from the table below, as regards to the number of affected  users and the duration:  Figure 25: Example of thresholds used for the Art.13a annual summary reporting  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  40  Using scales of criticality for assessing the impact  Another approach to take when measuring the significance is to measure the criticality of the incident.  Using scales of criticality to assess a security incident, to a certain extent coincides with measuring the  significance of an incident. NRAs and/or providers can categorize indicators into criticality levels such as:  “red”, “amber” and “green”. If for example, several incidents took place within the same time frame,  making use of the criticality levels can help in prioritizing which incident to resolve first.  Figure 26: Scales of criticality– provider’s perspective  That being said, in cases where criticality levels were being considered, for the most part almost all relied  on the ENISA metrics. 83% of respondents revealed that they were using this to categorize the impact of  the incidents.  One provider mentioned that the number of resources required to solve an incident also  depended on its criticality. For them, the general rule they were using depending on the criticality of an  incident is that a serious incident would be addressed by a specific department within the organization,  a very serious incident, would require the help of several departments and finally, if the incident resulted  in a crisis, the incident would be taken care of at operator level.  Using combination of indicators  To assess the severity of an incident and to also be able to know the level of resources required to solve  the incident, the provider was relying on certain thresholds. The impact of an incident depended on the  time duration as well as the number of users affected for each service category. Measuring security  incidents using a combination of indicators is an interesting approach to take. Many providers and NRAs  are already using this method and the main advantage is that they can observe the impact of a security  incident from various perspectives.  Furthermore, combining indicators can help gather more precise information on the impact of an  incident. For example, it can allow NRAs and providers to understand the correlation between the  number of user vs. the number of services impacted, and the number of users vs. time duration etc.  That  being said, the indicators which can be use are countless, and it is up to the specific NRA and provider to  83%  17%  0% 0%  Do you use scale/categories for determining the criticality/significance of  an incident/situation  Yes  No  Other  No answer  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  41  decide how the want to use the indicators, and on what basis they want to calculate the impact of an  incident.  Figure 27: Using a combination of indicators – provider’s perspective  Among providers, the most commonly used indicators were the following: number of users affected  combined with duration of an incident (83%) and number of users affected combined with geographic  spread (74%). Furthermore, providers were also calculating number of users affected with geographic  spread (70%). The same is also true for NRAs wherein number of users impacted was often calculated in  combination with the duration of the incident (for 85%).  Assessing impact of incidents based on customer “importance”  Assessing the impact of an incident based on customer “importance” is another methodology which can  be used mostly by providers.  From the viewpoint of the NRA, measuring incidents based on customer importance can service to the  needs of high profile clients, or critical infrastructure clients who deal with sensitive information, such  as banks, special government institutions, hospitals etc.  Focusing on these clients can also help ensure  greater security overall.  From the viewpoint of the provider, measuring security incidents based on customer importance has  other merits, since this can help towards gaining customer loyalty and trust. Furthermore, doing so can  improve the customer’s perception of reliability with regards to the providers, thus resulting in  competitive advantage and customer retention.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  Number of users affected  Duration of an incident  Geographic spread  Infrastructures and services  affected  Impact on emergency  services  Root causes Other  Do you combine the following indicators among themselves?

All 100% of the NRAs stated that a distinction between important and standard users was not  made. Nevertheless, during interviews it was identified that most providers had a special group of  customers, with whom either they held extra SLAs or who they knew is critical for them. For those  customers, most providers, kept a more close watch and notified them should anything happen. This is  especially true for critical infrastructures (banks, hospitals, etc.)  Assessing impact of incidents based on quality and service degradation  There are quite a lot of differing opinions on how to measure the impact of an incident based on quality  and the degradation level of services. While at the moment, this indicator is not being used, the concept  of service degradation and assessing the quality of a service remains important. That being said,  clarification needs to be made surrounding the concept of what is considered “service degradation”. For  example, does this refer to the moment at which providers experience a loss in service to some of their  systems (while others are still functioning), or is this the moment at which all services are completely  unavailable. Furthermore, since service degradation can fluctuate, is this indicator calculated during the  time period at which systems are facing service degradation or will this be later measured after the  incident has occurred. Using the correct terminology can help providers and NRAs achieve more  accuracy when measuring the impact of a security incident based on this indicator. This includes knowing  how to differentiate between concepts such as “services failing”, “services going down”, “services  affected”, “total failure” and “services that are not working correctly” etc.  To summarize this point however, it is important to emphasise that technology is always changing,  meaning that measurement methods which could seem appropriate at one point in time may not  necessarily be so at another. The same is also true for service degradation in particular where in the  future due to more advanced technologies, it may be the case that systems would not face total or  complete loss of service, but rather periods of service degradation instead.  End-user requirements  End-users can play a vital role in the security incident reporting process as they are the ones who  essentially make use of these infrastructures and services.  Furthermore, bringing more transparency  13%  87%  0%  Do you use different indicators depending on whether the users are  \"standard\" or \"important\"?  Yes, we use extra indicators in case of incidents impacting important users  No, we always use the same indicators independently from the users  No answer  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  43  into the process by informing end-users of the indicators used for measuring security incidents and also  informing them of the incidents that have taken place, can be a beneficial approach. Empowering end- users with the necessary skills on incident identification and reporting could be an approach to be  adopted, as suggested by some respondents.  So far, almost all providers report incidents to their NRAs only, while end-users do not have access to  such information. To add to this point, end-users have to either specifically request for this information  if they need it, or wait for the yearly reports from the NRAs or ENISA. However, the information that  they receive will most likely be of past incidents that have occurred in the year, and therefore may not  be so relevant to them anymore. Similarly, end-users many only find out about the incidents through the  media.  Only one provider, who was interviewed, mentioned that apart from the yearly reports sent to the NRA,  they already had in place another reporting process which was being used in parallel to ensure that end- users were also made aware of the security incidents. The majority however, stated that they had no  direct interaction with their end-users whatsoever. Thus, the former can be seen as a potential area for  further improvement and/or development. Working more closely with end-users can lead to gaining the  trust of the customer and at the same time, further result in greater competitive advantage which is a  key priority from the view point of the providers. However, as a provider, going public with details  regarding incidents can be disadvantageous in certain situations (e.g. exposing a  service/technology/infrastructure vulnerability which increases the appetite for attacks).  That being said, some end-users require more attention than others. These end-users include  organizations such as banks that not only need to be informed immediately of the incidents but also  have to have a contractual agreement with the providers, such as an SLA with which they may rely on  the measurement of certain indicators like uptime etc. This is especially needed in the banking sector.  To summarize on this, further information has not been collected from the NRAs or from providers  regarding the requests/satisfaction of end users on the specific matter of indicators.  Security incidents indicators - measuring the impact of incidents affecting electronic communications  44  5. Conclusions  The overall purpose of this document is to provide guidelines to national regulatory authorities (NRAs)  and telecommunications providers within EU member states and to assist them in the process of  measuring the impact of security incidents affecting the availability of electronic communication  services. Therefore, interested stakeholders have at their disposal a catalogue of indicators to be used  to tailor impact assessment and design the corresponding solutions.  A milestone in measuring the significance of incidents within the telecommunications sector in EU was  set up along with the adoption of the Framework Directive (Directive 2009/140 EC) within the 2009  Telecom Package, which included Art. 13a. This article aims at ensuring the security and integrity of  electronic communication networks and services in EU. This is partially achieved through requiring  telecommunication service providers to take the appropriate technical and organizational measures to  manage the risks posed to security of networks and services, guarantee the integrity of their networks  (ensure the continuity of supply of services provided over those networks) and notify the competent  national regulatory authority (NRA) of a breach of security or loss of integrity that has had a significant  impact on the operation of networks or services.  Measuring the significance of telecommunications incidents became a necessity within the EU, and led  to numerous debates between involved stakeholders. A lot of work has been done in this area both by  ENISA, along with the Art. 13a expert group, and also by private or independent bodies, as some work is  publicly available online. This report comes as a practical approach, and contains the view of both NRAs  and providers within the EU, on real indicators used for measuring significance of incidents affecting the  availability of telecommunication network and services.  As the survey performed had also the objective of analysing the approached taken by NRAs and providers  in defining indicators and significance, the results indicated that while there are some discrepancies  between NRAs and providers in terms of why they measure security incidents, and for what purpose  they use certain indicators over others, it is still plausible to state that the approaches taken and  indicators used by both parties are more similar than they are different, as more than half of the  respondents have stated this. Further developments regarding harmonisations of the approaches taken  are still needed but overall the situation is running smoothly, the processes are in place, and the  reporting of significant incidents is being done at national and EU level. From the study, it was realized  that approaches taken by NRAs and providers varied depending on certain country-level factors. Some  were much more mature than others. Due to several advantageous circumstances, some NRAs  experienced strong cooperation with their providers when it came to implementing the necessary  changes.  Having said this, is it advised that making use of a standardized approach among NRAs and providers can  help derive more precise results in the incident reporting process. So, the key recommendation from the  study is that NRAs and providers should further increase the level of harmonisations in the approach  taken to measure security incidents.  ENISA will continue to support the community through the Art. 13a group, and continue to provide best  practices, guidelines and support for all stakeholders in members states.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vass.

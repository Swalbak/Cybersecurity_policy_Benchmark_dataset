The Agency works with European bodies and the EU Member States in  preparing to respond to challenges raised by Network and Information Security (NIS) threats. It does  so by bridging the gap between policy and operational requirements in the Member States and by  making available a European platform for information exchange and sharing - amongst Member  States and beyond. In particular, ENISA works together with operational communities to ensure that  EU NIS policy is implemented in an effective manner, enabling organisations to meet their business  goals whilst still benefiting from a high level of security. To meet its policy goals, ENISA acts at three  levels: supporting policy and governance, facilitating cross-border collaboration and contributing to  preparedness and knowledge.  The recently published Cybersecurity Strategy for the EU (EUCSS)1 and the associated NIS Directive2  have proposed a set of actions that will enable Member States to build on accomplishments in NIS to  date. They bring separate policy areas into a single coherent policy for the future. The Commission  calls upon ENISA to contribute directly to strategic objectives 1 and 4 of the EUCSS (‘achieving Cyber  resilience’ and ‘develop the industrial and technological resources for cybersecurity’ respectively),  whereas the Agency has an indirect role in objectives two and five (‘drastically reducing cybercrime’  and ‘Establish a coherent international cyberspace policy for the European Union and promote core  EU values’). ENISA welcomes this opportunity to increase the level of support it is providing to  Member States.  In 2013, the Agency also received a new mandate. 3  The new Regulation builds on ENISA’s  achievements in areas such as supporting Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) in Member  States and facilitating pan-European cybersecurity exercises. It provides ENISA with a strong  interface with Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) to enable the Agency to contribute to  the fight against cybercrime, focusing on prevention and detection. It also foresees a more proactive  role for the Agency in supporting the development of EU cybersecurity policy and legislation. This is  also true for the areas of research, development and standardisation, where EU standards for risk  management and the security of electronic products, networks and services are cited as key aspects.  Finally, ENISA is also given a stronger role in cooperating with third countries.  1  Joint communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the  Regions on a Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace,  Join (2013) 1 final.  2  Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to ensure a high common level of network  and information security across the Union, COM(2013) 48 final.  3  Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council of 21 May 2013 concerning the European Union Agency for  Network and Information Security (ENISA) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 460/2004  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  v  Contents  Executive summary iv  Introduction 1  The threat landscape 4  Figure 1: Overview of Trends assessed in 2012 vs. 2013 mid-year 5  The regulatory landscape 7  Cybersecurity Strategy 7  Draft Directive on Network and Information Security 8  ENISA’s new mandate 9  Other regulatory initiatives 9  Responding to policy challenges 11  Support for policy and governance 11  Supporting the CERT for the European Institutions (CERT-EU) 11  Support for Europol and the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) 12  Requests for advice and assistance 12  Cross-border collaboration 13  Cyber Incident Reporting in the EU 13  Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises 13  The European Cyber Security Month 14  Securing Smart Grids 14  EP3R and NIS Platform 15  Supporting the CERT community 15  CERT / Law Enforcement collaboration 16  Cooperation in the standardisation process 16  (Continued overleaf)  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  vi  Preparedness and knowledge 17  Cyber crisis cooperation in Europe 17  Industrial Control Systems Security 17  Cloud computing 17  Resilience of European network interconnections 18  Resilience of European mobile networks 18  ICT Security of inter-bank transactions 18  Baseline capabilities - harmonised approach towards incident response 19  CERT training and good practice 19  Good practice Guides for CERTS: Improving information sharing 19  Network and Information Security driving licence 19  Moving ahead with ENISA 20  References 22  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  1  Introduction  Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have become the backbone of our economy  and society. In today’s world, geographically separated societies are interconnected by information  technology – and are irreversibly dependent on it. As societies interconnect with the help of ICT, a  new set of opportunities opens up in terms of developing their economic capabilities. However, the  increased adoption of information technology has also triggered the development of a significant  new set of threats that could negate the promise that ICT holds in terms of economic and societal  development. These threats are global in nature and are constantly proliferating, shifting in focus  and intensity and exploiting opportunities presented by technology. Adopting mitigation measures is  a way to respond to these evolving threats, but it is often the case that technological means need to  be accompanied by cross-border collaboration to be effective. Digital boundaries do not coincide  with national frontiers, making international collaboration an essential part of the response  mechanism.  Furthermore, the propagation and implications of threats such as malware (and  botnets in particular) illustrate that they are no longer an issue for people to deal with individually,  but are increasingly a social and civic responsibility that affects all sectors of the digital society.  In this paper, a distinction is made between ‘cybersecurity’, ‘cybercrime’, ‘cyber espionage’ and  ‘cyber defence’ or ‘cyber warfare’. Cybersecurity is the collection of tools, policies, security concepts,  security safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches, actions, training, best practices,  assurance and technologies that can be used to protect the cyber environment and organization,  and users’ assets. Organization and users’ assets include connected computing devices, personnel,  infrastructure, applications, services, telecommunications systems, and the totality of transmitted  and/or stored information in the cyber environment4. Cybercrime is the collective term for criminal  activities carried out by means of computers or the Internet5. Cyber espionage is the act or practice  of obtaining secrets (sensitive, proprietary or classified information) from individuals, competitors,  rivals, groups, governments or enemies, for military, political, or economic advantage using illegal  exploitation methods on the Internet, networks, software and/or computers 6 . Finally, cyberwarfare  is a form of information warfare sometimes seen as analogous to conventional warfare7. It is  important to note that ENISA was established ‘with the purpose of contributing to the goals of  ensuring a high level of network and information security within the Union and developing a culture  of network and information security for the benefit of citizens, consumers, enterprises and public  administrations’8.  ENISA’s activities are therefore in the area of cybersecurity and the Agency plays  no role in the areas of cyber espionage and cyber warfare. ENISA does however support the  European Cybercrime Centre in its activities by facilitating communication with other communities  and exchanging relevant information related to cybersecurity.  In Europe the response framework contains numerous established policy initiatives in place from the  early days of ICT development. The European Commission’s Digital Agenda for Europe9 aims at  improving citizens’ quality of life through, for example, better healthcare, safer and more efficient  transport solutions, a cleaner environment, new media opportunities and easier access to public  services and cultural content. This is a major step towards the creation of the Digital Society.  However, cyber-attacks complicate the deployment of ICT solutions used by citizens in their day-to-  4 http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/Pages/cybersecurity.aspx  5  Oxford Dictionary  6  http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=cyber%20espionage  7  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare  8  REGULATION (EU) No 526/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 21 May 2013 concerning the European Union  Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 460/2004  9  A Digital Agenda for Europe, COM(2010)245, May, 2010.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_warfare http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_warfare http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/Pages/cybersecurity.aspx http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=cyber%20espionage http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  2  day lives, targeting areas such as online payment and e-government services. ICT is increasingly used  in crime and politically motivated attacks. According to the Eurobarometer on Cybersecurity,10 29%  of EU citizens do not feel confident in using the Internet for banking or purchases, and 12% said they  had been victim to online fraud.  Securing Europe’s ICT systems must be coherent across geographical borders and pursued with  consistency over time. This is work in progress, but it is clear that recent EU policy developments are  starting to bear fruit, as approaches that have varied across different Member States and  communities have started to converge. Indeed, much of ENISA’s work is aimed at facilitating this  convergence by encouraging exchange of information, methods and results so as to avoid  unnecessary duplication of work and to enable Member States to learn from each other in an  optimal fashion.  Initiatives such as the Pan-European Cybersecurity Exercises, the work done in implementing Article  13a of the Telecommunications Framework Directive and the establishing of national and  governmental Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) has shown that EU bodies are capable  of providing the support and the framework for Member States to achieve a coordinated global  approach, under the umbrella of a dependable network and information security policy. 11  ENISA continues to support the European Institutions and the Member States in preparing to  respond to challenges raised by network and information security threats. ENISA bridges the gap  between policy and operational requirements in the Member States by providing a European  platform for information exchange and sharing amongst EU Member States and beyond. To meet its  goals ENISA acts at three levels: supporting policy and governance, facilitating cross-border  collaboration and contributing to preparedness and knowledge sharing. ENISA’s main tangible  contributions are the following:   Identification and analysis of emerging trends and threats   Publishing network and information security risks and challenges   Early warning and response   Cybersecurity strategies and capacity building   Critical information infrastructure protection   Incident Reporting in the EU   Supporting adequate and consistent policy implementation   Supporting actors in other communities (for example, industry, law enforcement and  academia) in actions against cybercrime   Supporting the European Commission and the Member States in international cooperation   Encouraging structured information exchange   Building communities   Promoting private public partnerships (PPPs) in the area of cybersecurity  10 http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_390_en.pdf  11 Throughout in this document the terms cybersecurity and network and information security are used  interchangeably. While the latter is much more accurate to describe ENISA’s area of operation, which is the EU  Internal Market, the term cybersecurity is often used to describe situations that require the involvement of  law enforcement agencies, falling inter alia within the penal law domain.  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_390_en.pdf  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  3  This paper presents the current operational context for network and information security by  summarising the threat landscape. It then presents the recent developments in EU policy and the  regulatory framework on network and information security. Furthermore it presents ENISA’s  concrete contributions in assisting Member States in attaining increasingly higher levels of  cybersecurity preparedness.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  4  The threat landscape  The threats we encounter in cyber space evolve rapidly. New methods to compromise data, to gain  illegal access to valuable information, to obtain information about user behaviour or to achieve  similar objectives are constantly emerging. Such targets are - and will remain - a focus for malicious  individuals and organisations acting in cyberspace. In order to develop defences, it is necessary to  understand the cyber-threats and the methods used to deploy them.  In the race for primacy between attackers and defenders in cyber space the ability to respond to the  evolving cyber-threat environment appears less like a destination and more like a journey.  Understanding the components of the evolving cyber-threat landscape is a task that became a major  focus for ENISA in 2012 and has been developing rapidly since then. Painting the cyber-threat  landscape and keeping up with the dynamics behind it requires an on-going analysis of cyber- incidents reported. Priority lists of cyber threats, threat agents, attack methods and threat trends  are all elements that need to be taken into consideration. This information is useful for cybersecurity  experts assessing risks to various systems and developing cybersecurity policies for defending  valuable information, although care should always be taken when analysing such data – the fact that  an event has happened frequently in the past is not a guarantee that it will continue to happen. An  example of this is provided by the Stuxnet cyber-attack of 2010, which represented a paradigm shift  not so much because of the advanced methods it used to infect and damage industrial control  systems, but because it unexpectedly changed the target. There was a new realisation that critical  infrastructure, such as nuclear power systems, were susceptible to cyber-attack.  At the end of 2012 ENISA identified top cyber threats and trends for emerging areas of Information  Technology that are consolidated in the table, below, with the updated position for mid-year 2013:  Top Threats  Trends assessed  in 2012  Current trends  mid 2013  Drive-by exploits    Worms/Trojans     Code Injection    Exploit Kits    Botnets    Denial of Service    Phishing    Compromising  Confidential  Information     Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  5  Top Threats  Trends assessed  in 2012  Current trends  mid 2013  Rogueware/  Scareware    Spam    Targeted Attacks    Physical  Theft/Loss/Damage    Identity Theft    Abuse of Information  Leakage    Search Engine  Poisoning  Unable to assess trend!  Rogue Certificates    Legend:  Declining,  Stable,  Increasing,  Warning  Figure 1: Overview of Trends assessed in 2012 vs. 2013 mid-year  As long as the cyber-threat landscape continues to show this very dynamic development, the  challenge is to capture the trends as early as possible. The areas that ENISA has kept its main focus  on throughout 201312, are the following:  Drive-by-exploits: There is a shift from botnets to malicious URLs as the preferred means to  distribute malware. An advantage of URLs as a distribution mechanism lies in the fact that they are  not such an easy target for law enforcement takedowns.  Code Injection: A notable issue with regard to this threat is attacks against popular Content  Management Systems (CMSs). Due to their wide use, popular CMSs make up a considerable attack  surface that has drawn the attention of cyber-criminals.  Botnets: Although not new, an interesting aspect of botnet activity reported is the use of botnet  infrastructure to mine the “virtual currency” Bitcoins. Another important development is the  increased use of peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets that are difficult to locate and take down. Moreover, in  Internet Census 201213, it has been demonstrated how easy is to create botnet infrastructures by  misusing weaknesses in the security of massively deployed devices.  12 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat- landscape-mid-year-2013  13  http://internetcensus2012.bitbucket.org/paper.html  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-mid-year-2013 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-mid-year-2013 http://internetcensus2012.bitbucket.org/paper.html  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  6  Denial of Service: After the 2013 Spamhaus attack,14 Domain Name System (DNS) reflection attacks  have gained in popularity. Moreover, attack bandwidths achieved have reached impressive levels:  the rate of 2-10Gbps attacks has doubled, and the level of 300Gbps attack was reached in 2013.  Rogueware/Scareware: In 2013 there was an increase in rogueware/scareware reported. One  reason for the growth is the expansion of ransomware and fake Antivirus distribution to mobile  platforms, such as Android.  Targeted Attacks: In the first half of 2013, targeted attacks demonstrated their effectiveness in  achieving their objectives. In particular, cyber espionage attacks reached a dimension that went far  beyond expectations15.  Identity Theft: This threat led to some of the most successful attacks by abusing SMS-forwarders to  commit significant financial fraud. These attacks were based on known financial trojans (e.g. Zeus,  SpyEye, Citadel) that have been implemented on mobile platforms and attack two-factor  authentication. A significant source for applying this threat remains social media.  Search Engine Poisoning: Search Engine Poisoning has also gone mobile: some reports on malicious  mobile apps performing Search Engine Optimization poisoning have been found.  These developments lead to the conclusion that attackers remain one step ahead; quite often it  suffices to exploit simple and well known weaknesses to cause havoc. The key message of ENISA is  to transfer knowledge from the cybersecurity community to the user groups for the purpose of  strengthening cyber-defence.  14  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-can-recent-attacks-really-threaten-internet- availability/at_download/fullReport  15  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/cyber-attacks-2013-a-new-edge-for-old- weapons/at_download/fullReport  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-can-recent-attacks-really-threaten-internet-availability/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-can-recent-attacks-really-threaten-internet-availability/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/cyber-attacks-2013-a-new-edge-for-old-weapons/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/cyber-attacks-2013-a-new-edge-for-old-weapons/at_download/fullReport  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  7  The regulatory landscape  Since its inception in 2004, ENISA has contributed to a high level of Network and Information  Security “for the benefit of citizens, consumers, business and public sector organisations in the  European Union, thus contributing to the smooth functioning of the internal market,”16 as it was set  out in the then founding regulation of the Agency. The current mandate of ENISA in the area of  Network and Information security has been based on Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of  the European Union (TFEU) and it is in accordance with decision C-217/04 of the European Court of  Justice. 17  Under the Lisbon Treaty, Article 114 of the TFEU describes the internal market  responsibility and it continues being the applicable legal basis for adopting measures to improve  Network and Information Security.18  A significant part of the Agency’s work is concerned with supporting the protection of infrastructure  and applications, and ensuring preparedness to counter threats and reinforce incident response  capabilities across Europe. The focus of ENISA is on cross-border issues, helping Member States to  identify dependencies and to decide on the most appropriate way to deal with them. While the  focus of the Agency remains on the internal market, with ENISA’s new mandate, received in 2013, it  has the ability to collaborate in other relevant areas such as law enforcement, lending it support and  expertise. Following up on the policy priorities of the Digital Agenda, in 2013 the European Union  laid out a Cybersecurity Strategy, and proposed a Directive on Network and Information Security,  acknowledging the renewal and expansion of ENISA’s mandate.  Cybersecurity Strategy  A new comprehensive Cybersecurity Strategy for the European Union19 comprises the internal  market, justice and home affairs and foreign policy aspects of cyber space issues. The Cybersecurity  16 ENISA was founded by Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004  establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency. The mandate was firstly extended by Regulation (EC)  No 1007/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September 2008 amending Regulation (EC) No  460/2004 establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency as regards its duration and secondly by  Regulation 580/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8th June 2011 amending Regulation (EC) No  460/2004 establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency as regards its duration. The new and  current, basic ENISA Regulation is Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May  2013, concerning the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) and repealing Regulation (EC)  No 460/2004.  17 ECJ 02.05.2006, C-217/04, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v European Parliament and Council of  the European Union.  18 The Internal Market responsibility is a shared competence between the Union and the Member States (Article 4(2)(a)  TFEU), which allows the Union and the Member States to adopt binding measures. The Member States will act if the Union  has not exercised its competence or has decided not to act any more (Article 2(2) TFEU).  19 Joint communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the  Committee of the Regions on a Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace,  Join  (2013) 1 final  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  8  Strategy offers clear priorities for the EU’s international cyberspace policy, in terms of freedom and  openness, outlining the vision and principles of EU core values and fundamental rights in cyberspace.  This complements the role of the EU in the physical world. Furthermore, cybersecurity capacity  building means that the EU will engage with international partners, the private sector and civil  society to support capacity building in third countries. It will include improving access to information  and to an open Internet, and preventing cyber threats. Finally, there is the aim to foster  international cooperation in cyberspace issues, with the goal of preserving open, free and secure  cyberspace. This is a global challenge, which the EU will address together with relevant international  partners and organisations, including the private sector and civil society.  In the Cybersecurity Strategy the Commission has envisaged a key role for ENISA, with the Agency  supporting cyber resilience, i.e. ensuring that critical information infrastructure and network  structures in general are adequately protected.  Moreover ENISA supports the Commission in developing the industrial and technological resources  necessary for cybersecurity, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders. In this regard ENISA will  promulgate technical guidelines and recommendations for the adoption of network and information  security standards and good practices in the public and private sectors.  Additionally, ENISA will be directly involved in reducing cybercrime by developing its relationship  with Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) to identify emerging trends and needs in view of  evolving cybercrime and cybersecurity patterns, to develop appropriate digital forensic tools and  technologies.  In 2013, ENISA has been assessing the implementation of a roadmap for a \"Network and Information  Security driving licence\" and it supports the organisation of a yearly cyber-security month.  ENISA works to make sure that the implementation of policy and strategy is firmly based on  operational experience, that policy is aligned with industry expectations and that it is economically  viable. ENISA will seek to implement scenarios in close collaboration with industry and the public  sector to define good practices in an efficient and market-oriented way.  Draft Directive on Network and Information Security  The Draft Directive on Network and Information Security20 (hereafter, the proposed Directive on  NIS), aims at ensuring a high common level of network and information security, by improving the  security of the Internet and the private networks and information underpinning the functioning of  societies and economies in the EU. The proposed Directive on NIS requires Member States to  increase their preparedness and improve their cooperation with each other in the areas of critical  infrastructures e.g. energy, transport, information society services, public administrations etc.  Additionally it requires Members States to adopt appropriate measures to manage security risks and  incidents reporting.  The proposed Directive on NIS also aims at creating a collaboration framework, within which the  Member States and the European Commission can share early warnings on risks and incidents.  Sharing is facilitated by a secure infrastructure that can be managed by the European Commission.  20 Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to ensure a high  common level of network and information security across the Union, COM(2013) 48 final.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  9  Additionally, market operators and public administrations alike have to adopt a risk based approach  in reporting major security incidents in their core services.  The proposed Directive on NIS foresees a role for ENISA in terms of facilitating collaboration and  managing security risks and information with Member States. Additionally, the proposed Directive  helps to establish common minimum requirements for network and information security at national  level. It requires Member States to designate national competent authorities for NIS, and draw up  strategies on network and information security supported by the operation of CERTs’ risk mitigation  and response mechanisms. It is also expected that the private sector will develop its own cyber  resilience capacities and shares best practices across sectors.  ENISA’s new mandate  The new ENISA Regulation updating the Agency’s mandate21  enshrines ENISA’s achievements in key  areas of network and information security and it underscores the requirement to continue  implementing measures that further the ability of the EU and of the Member States to tackle cyber  threats to the internal market. The new Regulation provides a mandate for ENISA in terms of:   Providing ENISA with a strong interface with the fight against cybercrime - focusing on  prevention and detection - with Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)   Supporting the Member States on building capacity for CIIP and cybersecurity strategy   Supporting the development of EU cybersecurity policy and legislation   Supporting research, development and standardisation, with EU standards for risk  management and the security of electronic products, networks and services   Supporting the prevention and detection of, and response, to cross-border  cyber-threats   Supporting the European Commission in implementing certain aspects of the EU  Cybersecurity Strategy (e.g. NIS Platform). Aligning ENISA more closely to the EU Regulatory  process, providing EU countries and Institutions with assistance and advice (e.g. on incident  reporting, proposed NIS Directive).  ENISA seeks to become the catalyst that brings together existing groups to work on problems which  are important in today's policy agenda; once these groups start working together ENISA can then  focus on other areas of interest.  The new mandate gives ENISA a more proactive role in cyber security. This is illustrated in the area  of standards, where ENISA will facilitate the establishment of technical standards on network and  information security instead of passively tracking standards (as specified by the former mandate).  Other regulatory initiatives  Other regulatory proposals have provided fresh impetus for ENISA’s involvement in new policy  areas. ENISA has also been an active contributor to EU policy and support to Member States in  21 Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 concerning the  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) and repealing Regulation (EC) No  460/2004.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  10  implementing Article 13a of the telecoms Framework Directive.22 ENISA also assists Member States  in implementing Article 4 of the e-Privacy directive.23  In 2012, the European Commission made a proposal for a Regulation on electronic identification and  trusted services for electronic transactions in the internal market,24 and it addresses shortcomings of  Directive 1999/93/EC on a Community framework for electronic signatures, aiming at secure and  seamless electronic transactions.  22 Directive 2009/140/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 amending  Directives 2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and  services, 2002/19/EC on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and  associated facilities, and 2002/20/EC on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and  services.  23 Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 amending  Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks  and services, Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in  the electronic communications sector and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on cooperation between national  authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws.  24  COM(2012) 238/2Proposal for a Regulation of the European parliament and of the Council on electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  11  Responding to policy challenges  In response to its own policy goals emanating from the regulatory framework, ENISA aims at  providing:   Support for policy and governance: Supporting the EU bodies, ENISA contributes to specific  policy goals with designated Commission Services and Agencies, helping them meet their  goals.   Cross-border collaboration: the response to Network and Information Security challenges  depends on the ability of the respondents to act together in a coordinated manner. ENISA  seeks to identify the areas where collaboration is likely to bring about tangible results and  then it seeks to coordinate efforts and actuate the stakeholders involved to take measures  mitigating perceived risks.   Preparedness and knowledge: as a centre of expertise, ENISA develops its own content and  capabilities in a range of areas of broad policy interest, supporting its stakeholders with  analyses and recommendations on issues of concern.  Support for policy and governance  In terms of policy and governance ENISA has received a clear mandate to provide support to the  European Commission’s CERT for the European Institutions, as well as the European Cybercrime  Centre (EC3) at Europol. ENISA has also been actively supporting the Member States in  implementing Article 13a of the telecommunications Framework Directive25 and it assists Member  States in implementing Article 4 of the e-Privacy directive.26 Additionally, ENISA will support Member  States in implementing article 15a of the proposed EU eTrust Directive27. ENISA therefore has the  opportunity to contribute to concrete collaborative efforts at the level of the Member States as well  as with the EU bodies, supporting all with advice and assistance.  Supporting the CERT for the European Institutions (CERT-EU)  In 2012, a permanent Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-EU) for the EU bodies was set up.  CERT-EU brings together IT security experts from the European Commission, General Secretariat of  the Council, European Parliament and Committee of the Regions/Economic and Social Committee. It  cooperates with other CERTs in the Member States and beyond, as well as with specialised IT  security services. CERT-EU is likely to extend its services, on the basis of the requirements of its  constituency, and taking into account the available competencies, resources and partnerships. The  role of ENISA is to provide support to CERT-EU, building on its successful work with administrative  25 Directive 2009/140/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 amending  Directives 2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and  services, 2002/19/EC on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and  associated facilities, and 2002/20/EC on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and  services.  26 Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 amending  Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks  and services, Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in  the electronic communications sector and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on cooperation between national  authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws.  27  COM(2012) 238/2Proposal for a Regulation of the European parliament and of the Council on electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  12  and governmental CERTs. The Agency will pursue two different approaches - introducing and  integrating CERT-EU into existing CERT communities, and building up and extending CERT-EU  capabilities by means of providing appropriate training.  Support for Europol and the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)  ENISA’s new Regulation gives it the scope to closely cooperate with Europol in supporting the fight  against cybercrime. Europol hosts the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) that coordinates law- enforcement efforts in combating cybercrime. In 2013 ENISA collaborated with Europol in such areas  as the 8th Annual CERT workshop, co-organised with the European Cybercrime Centre, as well as  involving Europol and the EC3 in network and information security projects. While Europol and EC3  clearly serve the operational aspect of the fight against cybercrime, ENISA contributes by deepening  the cooperation capabilities between CERTs and law enforcement agencies, for example by  developing training for CERTs to support this cooperation further and by regularly bring people from  both sectors together to discuss operational issues and obstacles, e.g. how to handle evidence when  first entering a crime scene.  Requests for advice and assistance  In line with article 14 of the ENISA Regulation, the Agency stands ready to support the needs of the  Member States, the European Commission and the European Parliament with expertise on network  and information security. An area that ENISA sees gaining in importance and visibility is CERT  in-house training for designated stakeholders in the Member States and in EU Institutions. In 2013,  ENISA responded to the following requests:   The National Regulatory Authority of Cyprus (OCECPR) sought the support of ENISA in a  workshop organised with the participation of the Cypriot electronic communications  providers. ENISA’s role was to represent the European context and provide suitable advice.   A request from Estonia was responded to by organising and delivering training on “Incident  handling during an attack on Critical Information Infrastructure”.   Latvia’s Information Technology Security Incident Response Institution CERT.LV made a  request for ENISA to provide an on-site training course on “Social networks used as an attack  vector for targeted attacks”.  Additionally, ENISA contributed to the CERT.LV annual  conference “Information Security – Key for Success.”   The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), has been setting up an IT  system to collect and analyse data on wholesale market energy markets across the EU, and  asked for the support of ENISA to ensure operational reliability and protection of the  received data and prevent unauthorised access to that information.   A request of the European Commission (DG HOME) to provide input in the context of the  review of the EU legal framework for data retention has been dealt with. ENISA’s  contribution seeks to identify the benefits, main impacts and possible means of enforcement  of new data security measures in the reform. ENISA is also assessing the “good practice”  potential of current security measures for data retention in selected Member States.   At the request of the European Commission, ENISA organised a seminar on the organisation  and planning of cyber exercises. An outline of a “cyber-scenario” was developed and  adapted to the needs of the European Commission using as guidance input from the Cyber  Europe 2012 exercise which was facilitated by ENISA.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  13  Cross-border collaboration  The primary goal of ENISA is to be a catalyst where collaboration is essential to bring about tangible  results in the area of network and information security. The emerging regulatory framework  underscores this role. Collaboration and exchange of information are essential elements in the fight  against cybercrime. When the integrity of networks, infrastructures and control systems is at risk,  threatening millions of citizens and business, acting alone pays no dividends. ENISA has a successful  record of helping others to help themselves, by bringing together stakeholders involved in a policy  area in network and information security. ENISA is the organisation that helps stakeholders translate  policy into action.  Cyber Incident Reporting in the EU  Security incidents leading to large outages and data breaches still remain largely undetected as  information about them is collected mostly for the in-house use of those affected. This shortcoming  makes it difficult for regulatory authorities to improve on measures to take and serve public interest  by disclosing breaches that concern individuals and businesses alike. The Framework Directive on  electronic communications28 stipulates measures that have been supported by ENISA. ENISA has set  up a national regulators’ expert group that has developed a set or reporting procedures for  incidents. Additionally, in an annual incidents report, the Agency analysed 79 major incidents and  given an overview of their causes. Lastly, ENISA provided recommendations on national roaming as a  measure for mitigating mobile network outages, and power supply dependencies to reduce the  impact of power outages on electronic communications.  In 2013 the Agency started a new expert group of supervisory authorities (being, data protection  authorities and telecommunications regulators) for the implementation of Article 4 of the e-privacy  directive.29 The main goal is to provide a platform for exchanging experience between experts in  different countries. Where possible, ENISA seeks to build on synergies between expert groups on  Article 13a and Article 4, to develop a unified framework for security measures and incident  reporting. ENISA also assists Member States in the implementation of article 15 of the directive on  electronic identification and trusted services for electronic transactions in the internal market. The  Agency brings together competent regulatory bodies in the Member States, and supports debates  on the services concerned, the reporting scheme, and the parameters and thresholds.  Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises  ENISA has a strong track record of contributions in cyber crisis cooperation and exercises in the EU.  This is an area where ENISA has made major breakthroughs, such as its series of pan-European cyber  28 Directive 2009/140/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 amending  Directives 2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and  services, 2002/19/EC on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and  associated facilities, and 2002/20/EC on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and  services.  29 Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 amending  Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks  and services, Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in  the electronic communications sector and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on cooperation between national  authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  14  exercises, establishing strong relationships and gaining the commitment of European Union Member  States. In 2013, ENISA issupporting the cybercrisis management exercise of the Eurocontrol air traffic  control agency, with a large-scale cyber incidents scenario. ENISA builds successful exercises by  establishing the cyber exercises area, and building a high-level of expertise by bringing together  Member States, European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, and EU Institutions.  ENISA’s series of international conferences on cyber crisis cooperation and exercises offers a key  knowledge sharing platform to international cyber security experts and decision makers, highlighting  how to deal with cyber crises and applying appropriate contingency plans and escalation procedures.  The conferences aim to facilitate debate and information exchange and offer networking  opportunities to both technical experts and executive stakeholders.  In 2013, ENISA organised its second International Conference on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and  Exercises, with a focus on various topics in the area of cyber crisis cooperation. These include  information gathering and common situational awareness, escalation processes and procedures,  cybercrisis management in the general crisis management context, cross-border cyber exercises, and  tools and platforms for information exchange and communication.  As cyber exercises and European network and information security cyber cooperation plans and  procedures gradually come together, ENISA will continue to support an umbrella EU NIS cooperation  plan, in line with the EU Cybersecurity Strategy. Starting from 2014, the cyber exercises will aim to  cover all levels of escalation when cyber incidents lead to a cyber-crisis and will thus test technical  level, operational level and political level cooperation procedures and responses.  Similarly, international efforts, with conferences organised by ENISA and the cooperation of third  countries, are continuing, thus contributing to an enhanced level of preparedness to face cyber- crises on a global scale.  The European Cyber Security Month  In 2013, a fully-fledged European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) is taking place across Europe with  the support of DG CNECT and ENISA, bringing together over 40 public and private actors and  implementing more than 50 activities.30 As an instrument of collaboration among stakeholders in  network and information security, ENISA seeks to facilitate sharing good practices, and thereby  increase the results for the work of network and information security communities.  ECSM is an EU  campaign that takes place in October to promote cybersecurity awareness and training among  citizens. The campaign has the objective of changing the perceptions of cybersecurity threats at  work and in the private sphere. It also aims to provide updated security information through  education, good practice and competitions.  Securing Smart Grids  ENISA has launched a series of activities aiming to bring together stakeholders in the area of critical  information infrastructure protection and engaging them in an open discussion on smart grid  cybersecurity. The principal goal is to identify the main issues of concern regarding the security of  30 Network Information Security events are taking place in 26 countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, The Czech  Republic, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania,  Luxembourg, Moldova, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden and the  United Kingdom.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  15  smart grids in support of national, pan-European and international initiatives. ENISA supports the  efforts of the European Commission and of the Member States on smart grids by facilitating Expert  Group 2 on Regulatory Recommendations for Privacy, Data Protection and cyber-security in the  Smart Grid Environment.31 In an effort to advance collaboration in this field ENISA has been tasked  by Expert Group 2 to organise consultations on these minimum security requirements with national  cybersecurity authorities and the energy and ICT industries, and possibly also selected non-EU  partners. Based upon this process, recommendations to Member States on minimum cybersecurity  requirements for smart grids will be drafted.  EP3R and NIS Platform  The European Private Public Partnership for Resilience (EP3R) was established as a follow-up to the  policy initiative on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) adopted by the European  Commission on 30th March 2009.32 The scope of EP3R was to propose strategic and tactical solutions,  in the areas of: key assets, resources and functions; baseline requirements for security and  resilience; and coordination, cooperation and response to large-scale disruptions. ENISA chaired task  forces and work objectives groups, providing a flexible structure to allow the development of the  works, supplying secretariat support and technical expertise. After two years of operation, a  stocktaking exercise is under way to understand the impact of EP3R and propose improvements.  In 2013, EP3R is being followed by an initiative called the NIS Platform. The NIS platform is organised  in working groups that aim to provide a further dimension to Public-Private Partnerships in Europe.  ENISA plans to provide technical support to NIS Platform working groups, subject matter advice on  issues discussed in the working groups and background research on open issues raised.  Supporting the CERT community  Capacity building for CERTs in the EU has been central to ENISA throughout 2013. CERTs are key for  Critical Information Infrastructure Protection and are a primary security service provider for  governments and citizens.  The 8th annual CERT workshop was held in Bucharest, Romania, and was co-located with the 39th  TF-CSIRT meeting. The workshop focused on ENISA CERT exercises and fostered cross-sector  collaboration, in particular between CERTs with national and governmental responsibility and their  national law enforcement “counterparts”, emphasising “automated sharing of information”. In this  workshop ENISA experts provided technical training to attendees, focusing on “Incident handling  during an attack on Critical Information Infrastructure”, ”Mobile threats incident handling” and  “Honeypots”.  31 In 2009, the Smart Grids Task Force (SGTF) was set up by the European Commission (EC) to reach a  consensus on policy and regulatory directions for the deployment of Smart Grids. SGTF operates in five  discrete Expert Groups.  32 The Communication on Critical Information Infrastructure protection (CIIP) of the European Commission  focuses on the protection of Europe from cyber disruptions by enhancing security and resilience. The action  plan brings together Member States and the private sector and it is based on five pillars: preparedness and  prevention, detection and response, mitigation and recovery, international cooperation and criteria for  European Critical Infrastructures in the field of ICT.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  16  CERT / Law Enforcement collaboration  The fight against cybercrime is important to law enforcement agencies across Europe and  worldwide. ENISA aims at bringing CERTs to closer collaboration with law enforcement bodies in  order to make skills and expertise available to combat cybercrime. ENISA seeks to facilitate cross- sector community building, bringing together operational players, and actively supporting cross- sector training and education. The work aims to develop trust between these two sectors through  regular meetings and training. Additionally, alternative strategies include discussions and exchange  of good practices in operational areas (such as guidelines for first responders entering a crime  scene), or tackling legal issues with cross-border sharing of operational information (log files, IP  addresses, etc.). Ideally the outcomes of discussions result in further items to address in the future,  developing new material for common training with CERTs and law enforcement personnel.  Cooperation in the standardisation process  The cross-border nature of threats and the associated mitigation mechanisms make it essential to  focus on strong international cooperation. This requires major efforts at national level, at pan- European level and globally. There needs to be close cooperation with international partners to  prevent and to respond to cyber incidents. ENISA tracks the development of standards from a more  global perspective in Network and Information Security. The Agency monitors network and  information security standards in the EU and globally, including areas that are not specifically related  to the priorities of the ENISA work programme. This approach allows the Agency to keep its  stakeholders informed on new network and information security standardisation activities and to  flag opportunities and/or risks as they develop.  In 2013, ENISA is continuing to contribute to the joint ETSI CEN-CENELEC Cyber Security Coordination  Group (CSCG), an advisory and coordination body on political and strategic matters related to  cybersecurity standardisation. The role of ENISA is to assess whether there is a gap between these  standardisation activities and state-of-the-art developments in network and information security.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  17  Preparedness and knowledge  As a centre of expertise, ENISA has continued to develop its unique body of knowledge in network  and information security, aiming at informing policymakers, businesses and citizens alike. The areas  that ENISA undertakes to develop are influenced of course by regulatory developments, threats and  policy requests.  Cyber crisis cooperation in Europe  ENISA carried out a study on National Network and Information Security Contingency Plans by  analysing the national-level best practices, procedures, roles and responsibilities, for management  and cooperation during major cyber incidents, escalating to a cyber-crisis.  In the framework of the Cyber Europe series of exercises organised by ENISA, the EU Member States  have prepared procedures for cooperation at the operational level, including alerting, information  exchange and situational awareness. In 2013, a report of the working group of the EU Forum of  Member States (EFMS) on European Cyber Crisis Cooperation Framework (ECCCF) identified the  need for cooperation at all three levels: technical, operational/tactical and political. In response  ENISA drafted a report that took into account the above-mentioned considerations.  The operational procedures developed within the context of the Cyber Europe exercises, as well as  the existing national-level NIS Cooperation Plans in EU Member States, would play a central role in  establishing a European Union-level NIS Cooperation Plan, in line with the proposed Directive on NIS.  Industrial Control Systems Security  Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are command and control networks and systems designed to  support industrial processes in such industries as gas and electricity distribution, water treatment, oil  refining and railways. Industrial control systems constitute a strategic asset, with a rising potential  for catastrophic terrorist attacks affecting these critical infrastructures. These systems have often  been the target of malicious actors in cyber-attacks. While industrial control systems are sufficiently  robust the operation, management culture and appreciation of threats in these systems could be  improved. ENISA has carried out an analysis to facilitate agile and integrated responses to incidents  contributing to their analysis.  In industrial control security, independent evaluations and tests are missing, leading to the  ineffective operation of industrial environments. ENISA aims at assessing the need among the  Member States for a national ICS-SCADA testing framework, identifying the gaps in testing practices  and producing guidance for both the development of new and harmonization of current ICS-SCADA  test beds frameworks (if any) among Member States. Finally a good practice guide on a European  ICS-SCADA test bed programme/framework will be developed. Additionally ENISA provides advice on  assessing the challenges involved in developing ICS-SCADA patching good practices and it has  provided relevant recommendations.  Cloud computing  ENISA lends its support to the Member States in terms of incident reporting in Cloud computing  services (e.g. eHealth, transport etc.). In that respect ENISA is preparing a good practice guide on  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  18  how to report outages in cloud computing according to their impact and the criticality of the service  affected.  ENISA supports the European Commission on the implementation of their EU cloud strategy. The  report on Securing Governmental Cloud Computing infrastructures is a study on the cloud uptake  across the EU. It includes initiatives at national and regional level and provides a set of  recommendations on how to safely deploy cloud solution in the public sector. Also ENISA’s security  guidance for SMEs is an updated version of the 2009 risk assessment. It focuses on SMEs presenting  the highest risks and opportunities. Finally ENISA participates in the certification industry group of  the EU Commission that aims at establishing a list of certification schemes and support voluntary  certification schemes for cloud computing providers. In May 2013, ENISA launched the “Cloud  Security and Resilience Experts group” where experts from industry and the public sector  participate.  Resilience of European network interconnections  In 2013, ENISA is furthering its goals in the area of resilience of network infrastructures and the  mechanisms for emergency communications that have been in place in Member States by shifting  focus to the technical and the organisational component. ENISA seeks to provide insight to the  “structure of the Internet” at the physical and network layers in the Member States, which could be  used by governments or policymakers to develop a strategy to ensure that critical services remain  functional when there are interruptions in network performance or connectivity. An additional  policy and organisational component aims to collect information on the legal framework concerning  the relationship between telecommunications regulators and Internet Service Providers involved in  the Member States in order to improve collaboration.  Resilience of European mobile networks  To counter outages involving mobile network operators in the EU, ENISA analyses national roaming  frameworks which allow customers to use the network of other mobile operators. The main goal of  this work is to investigate how and if national roaming could be used to address the impact of  outages in terms of technical, legal, financial and administrative aspects.  The scope includes mobile  devices at large, including mobile communications between machines. The goal is to provide a set of  approaches that telecommunications’ Regulators could consider in mitigating mobile network  outages using national roaming. The impact of this activity is significant in civil protection, crisis  management and critical industries as improving resilience of mobile communications for critical  functions and critical services that rely on mobile networks can generally be improved.  ICT Security of inter-bank transactions  The challenges faced by financial sector ICT professionals in ensuring integrity, availability and  confidentiality of information in transit have been analysed by ENISA in terms of risk awareness, the  state of prevention of security risks, ways to detect incidents, policies and organisational aspects.  ENISA seeks to identify actual challenges faced by ICT professionals in the financial sector in terms of  ensuring the integrity, availability and confidentiality of information in transit.  A global stocktaking  activity on the matter would help ENISA inter alia to better understand:   The actual risk awareness among ICT professionals of the financial sector   The state of prevention of security risks  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  19   How incidents are detected, associated risks are mitigated and flaws are fixed on a  continuous basis   Whether global policies favour the response to incidents    Baseline capabilities - harmonised approach towards incident response  ENISA supports Member States in enhancing and strengthening cooperation among CERTs to  achieve powerful incident response when needed. Continuously working together with the CERT  community on improving a common “denominator”, called “CERT baseline capabilities” that allows  for better cross-border information sharing and cooperation. In 2013 ENISA is assessing the level of  compliance of CERT Baseline Capabilities in the Member States and is providing a report on  harmonisation in such areas as terminology, validation processes and requirements.  ENISA will  further examine a suitable certification (or similar) to assess the baseline capabilities of CERTs.  CERT training and good practice  In 2013 the ENISA CERT training programme is continuing by developing the curriculum further to  include new scenarios on cybercrime for CERT and Law Enforcement Agencies’ staff. The CERT  training material features a handbook for the tutor and a toolset for students, together with virtual  computer images to support hands-on training sessions on the students’ computers. Additionally  ENISA is re-releasing the TRANSITS program with training material for new CERT staff.  Good practice Guides for CERTS: Improving information sharing  Secure communication and information sharing on security threats can be shared among CERT  teams to improve security and efficiency, as well as to speed up incident response. In 2013, ENISA is  reviewing enablers and barriers for information sharing. Taking stock of the current communication  exchange practices of CERT teams and input from standards, this initiative aims at improving  information sharing practices. A good practice guide in the area of “Alerts, Warnings and  Announcements,” aims at addressing issues related to these areas, as well as increasing the security  awareness of stakeholders.  A good practice guide on the practical implementation of the “Directive on attacks against  information systems and repealing Council Framework Decision - 2010/0273(COD)”33  aims at  identifying the implications of the Directive on stakeholders such as (national/governmental) CERTs  and law enforcement bodies. This guide focuses on how to implement the Directive in the Member  States and makes relevant recommendations.  Network and Information Security driving licence  The EU Cybersecurity Strategy suggests the developing a roadmap for a Network and Information  Security driving licence as a voluntary certification programme to promote enhanced skills and  competence for IT professionals. In 2013, ENISA kicked off the consultation process with relevant  stakeholders to guide the process.  33  Directive 2013/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 August 2013 on attacks against  information systems and replacing Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  20  Moving ahead with ENISA  The Cybersecurity strategy of the EU has given new impetus to the response of the EU to  cybersecurity challenges. The high political visibility of this initiative was demonstrated by the joint  involvement of Commissioners Cécilia Malmström, Vice President Neelie Kroes and High  Representative Cathy Ashton. Political attention and support for this strategy is fundamental in  order to see a stable and safe progression in improving cybersecurity and curbing the impact of  cybercrime.  ENISA has provided much sought after expertise to guide policymakers with dependable opinion and  substantiated recommendations. Additionally, it has coordinated efforts of actors involved and  stakeholders at large in order to be more efficient, focused and effective in taking important  decisions in cybersecurity preparedness. The role of ENISA in implementing the EU policy and  regulatory framework might sometimes go unnoticed, as initiatives undertaken are often discreet by  nature and actions happen behind the scenes; ENISA however has proven its ability to act discreetly  as a catalyst, and to actuate stakeholders with a view to bringing about change in network and  information security. With the advent of the new mandate, ENISA looks forward to becoming further  involved in promulgating information security standards, which in the EU is a way to narrow the gap  between policy and operational performance.  ENISA supports the European Commission and Member States by providing them with information  on trends and emerging threats, and by providing guidance on risk management and appropriate  prevention and response measures.  The Agency also facilitates dialogue on Network and  Information Security across communities and with different international counterparts. This  dialogue is a critical precursor to any long-term action plan for protecting information services that  benefit EU citizens and it helps Member States to align their approaches to specific issues.  EU cyber cooperation is again at a crossroads as the regulatory framework has to be transposed and  implemented across the EU. Additionally the emerging regulatory framework in electronic  communications, privacy and trust is likely to lead to greater cooperation among stakeholders.  ENISA, with its newly defined role, remains in support of policy, coordination and expert knowledge.  ENISA is a key player supporting the alignment of public and private sector strategies to reach a level  of common policies and good practices that will give the EU an edge in mitigating cybersecurity risks.  ENISA with its unique mission has a clear role to play in helping the Commission and Member States  in turning high level policy into action items, and engaging with stakeholders to help them actuate  and eventually help themselves.  The success of the EU Internal Security Strategy “is dependent on the combined efforts of all EU  actors, but also on cooperation with the outside world. Only by joining forces and working together  to implement this strategy can Member States, EU institutions, bodies and agencies provide a truly  coordinated European response to the security threats of our time”34. Being proactive in building  cyber cooperation in cross-border communities will bring benefits both in terms of the effectiveness  of common strategies and efficiency in the use of evolving assets.  34  COM(2010) 673 final p. 16  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  21  Network and information security will always need to be built into future plans, as it is an issue that  is here to stay, with ICT leading growth. In the interdependent world that we live in, acting together  in a cohesive manner is essential. ENISA has undertaken the pivotal role to provide support and  expertise whilst responding to challenging digital changes. If the Internet fails to remain safe the  impact for modern societies will be too costly to bear. All efforts and strategies towards securing  Europe’s cyber cooperation must be coherent, consistent and united; and there is no better time to  respond and move ahead than now.

The Agency works with European bodies and the EU Member States in  preparing to respond to challenges raised by Network and Information Security (NIS) threats. It does  so by bridging the gap between policy and operational requirements in the Member States and by  making available a European platform for information exchange and sharing - amongst Member  States and beyond. In particular, ENISA works together with operational communities to ensure that  EU NIS policy is implemented in an effective manner, enabling organisations to meet their business  goals whilst still benefiting from a high level of security. To meet its policy goals, ENISA acts at three  levels: supporting policy and governance, facilitating cross-border collaboration and contributing to  preparedness and knowledge.  The recently published Cybersecurity Strategy for the EU (EUCSS)1 and the associated NIS Directive2  have proposed a set of actions that will enable Member States to build on accomplishments in NIS to  date. They bring separate policy areas into a single coherent policy for the future. The Commission  calls upon ENISA to contribute directly to strategic objectives 1 and 4 of the EUCSS (‘achieving Cyber  resilience’ and ‘develop the industrial and technological resources for cybersecurity’ respectively),  whereas the Agency has an indirect role in objectives two and five (‘drastically reducing cybercrime’  and ‘Establish a coherent international cyberspace policy for the European Union and promote core  EU values’). ENISA welcomes this opportunity to increase the level of support it is providing to  Member States.  In 2013, the Agency also received a new mandate. 3  The new Regulation builds on ENISA’s  achievements in areas such as supporting Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) in Member  States and facilitating pan-European cybersecurity exercises. It provides ENISA with a strong  interface with Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) to enable the Agency to contribute to  the fight against cybercrime, focusing on prevention and detection. It also foresees a more proactive  role for the Agency in supporting the development of EU cybersecurity policy and legislation. This is  also true for the areas of research, development and standardisation, where EU standards for risk  management and the security of electronic products, networks and services are cited as key aspects.  Finally, ENISA is also given a stronger role in cooperating with third countries.  1  Joint communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the  Regions on a Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace,  Join (2013) 1 final.  2  Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to ensure a high common level of network  and information security across the Union, COM(2013) 48 final.  3  Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council of 21 May 2013 concerning the European Union Agency for  Network and Information Security (ENISA) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 460/2004  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  v  Contents  Executive summary iv  Introduction 1  The threat landscape 4  Figure 1: Overview of Trends assessed in 2012 vs. 2013 mid-year 5  The regulatory landscape 7  Cybersecurity Strategy 7  Draft Directive on Network and Information Security 8  ENISA’s new mandate 9  Other regulatory initiatives 9  Responding to policy challenges 11  Support for policy and governance 11  Supporting the CERT for the European Institutions (CERT-EU) 11  Support for Europol and the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) 12  Requests for advice and assistance 12  Cross-border collaboration 13  Cyber Incident Reporting in the EU 13  Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises 13  The European Cyber Security Month 14  Securing Smart Grids 14  EP3R and NIS Platform 15  Supporting the CERT community 15  CERT / Law Enforcement collaboration 16  Cooperation in the standardisation process 16  (Continued overleaf)  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  vi  Preparedness and knowledge 17  Cyber crisis cooperation in Europe 17  Industrial Control Systems Security 17  Cloud computing 17  Resilience of European network interconnections 18  Resilience of European mobile networks 18  ICT Security of inter-bank transactions 18  Baseline capabilities - harmonised approach towards incident response 19  CERT training and good practice 19  Good practice Guides for CERTS: Improving information sharing 19  Network and Information Security driving licence 19  Moving ahead with ENISA 20  References 22  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  1  Introduction  Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have become the backbone of our economy  and society. In today’s world, geographically separated societies are interconnected by information  technology – and are irreversibly dependent on it. As societies interconnect with the help of ICT, a  new set of opportunities opens up in terms of developing their economic capabilities. However, the  increased adoption of information technology has also triggered the development of a significant  new set of threats that could negate the promise that ICT holds in terms of economic and societal  development. These threats are global in nature and are constantly proliferating, shifting in focus  and intensity and exploiting opportunities presented by technology. Adopting mitigation measures is  a way to respond to these evolving threats, but it is often the case that technological means need to  be accompanied by cross-border collaboration to be effective. Digital boundaries do not coincide  with national frontiers, making international collaboration an essential part of the response  mechanism.  Furthermore, the propagation and implications of threats such as malware (and  botnets in particular) illustrate that they are no longer an issue for people to deal with individually,  but are increasingly a social and civic responsibility that affects all sectors of the digital society.  In this paper, a distinction is made between ‘cybersecurity’, ‘cybercrime’, ‘cyber espionage’ and  ‘cyber defence’ or ‘cyber warfare’. Cybersecurity is the collection of tools, policies, security concepts,  security safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches, actions, training, best practices,  assurance and technologies that can be used to protect the cyber environment and organization,  and users’ assets. Organization and users’ assets include connected computing devices, personnel,  infrastructure, applications, services, telecommunications systems, and the totality of transmitted  and/or stored information in the cyber environment4. Cybercrime is the collective term for criminal  activities carried out by means of computers or the Internet5. Cyber espionage is the act or practice  of obtaining secrets (sensitive, proprietary or classified information) from individuals, competitors,  rivals, groups, governments or enemies, for military, political, or economic advantage using illegal  exploitation methods on the Internet, networks, software and/or computers 6 . Finally, cyberwarfare  is a form of information warfare sometimes seen as analogous to conventional warfare7. It is  important to note that ENISA was established ‘with the purpose of contributing to the goals of  ensuring a high level of network and information security within the Union and developing a culture  of network and information security for the benefit of citizens, consumers, enterprises and public  administrations’8.  ENISA’s activities are therefore in the area of cybersecurity and the Agency plays  no role in the areas of cyber espionage and cyber warfare. ENISA does however support the  European Cybercrime Centre in its activities by facilitating communication with other communities  and exchanging relevant information related to cybersecurity.  In Europe the response framework contains numerous established policy initiatives in place from the  early days of ICT development. The European Commission’s Digital Agenda for Europe9 aims at  improving citizens’ quality of life through, for example, better healthcare, safer and more efficient  transport solutions, a cleaner environment, new media opportunities and easier access to public  services and cultural content. This is a major step towards the creation of the Digital Society.  However, cyber-attacks complicate the deployment of ICT solutions used by citizens in their day-to-  4 http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/Pages/cybersecurity.aspx  5  Oxford Dictionary  6  http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=cyber%20espionage  7  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare  8  REGULATION (EU) No 526/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 21 May 2013 concerning the European Union  Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 460/2004  9  A Digital Agenda for Europe, COM(2010)245, May, 2010.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_warfare http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_warfare http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/Pages/cybersecurity.aspx http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=cyber%20espionage http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  2  day lives, targeting areas such as online payment and e-government services. ICT is increasingly used  in crime and politically motivated attacks. According to the Eurobarometer on Cybersecurity,10 29%  of EU citizens do not feel confident in using the Internet for banking or purchases, and 12% said they  had been victim to online fraud.  Securing Europe’s ICT systems must be coherent across geographical borders and pursued with  consistency over time. This is work in progress, but it is clear that recent EU policy developments are  starting to bear fruit, as approaches that have varied across different Member States and  communities have started to converge. Indeed, much of ENISA’s work is aimed at facilitating this  convergence by encouraging exchange of information, methods and results so as to avoid  unnecessary duplication of work and to enable Member States to learn from each other in an  optimal fashion.  Initiatives such as the Pan-European Cybersecurity Exercises, the work done in implementing Article  13a of the Telecommunications Framework Directive and the establishing of national and  governmental Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) has shown that EU bodies are capable  of providing the support and the framework for Member States to achieve a coordinated global  approach, under the umbrella of a dependable network and information security policy. 11  ENISA continues to support the European Institutions and the Member States in preparing to  respond to challenges raised by network and information security threats. ENISA bridges the gap  between policy and operational requirements in the Member States by providing a European  platform for information exchange and sharing amongst EU Member States and beyond. To meet its  goals ENISA acts at three levels: supporting policy and governance, facilitating cross-border  collaboration and contributing to preparedness and knowledge sharing. ENISA’s main tangible  contributions are the following:   Identification and analysis of emerging trends and threats   Publishing network and information security risks and challenges   Early warning and response   Cybersecurity strategies and capacity building   Critical information infrastructure protection   Incident Reporting in the EU   Supporting adequate and consistent policy implementation   Supporting actors in other communities (for example, industry, law enforcement and  academia) in actions against cybercrime   Supporting the European Commission and the Member States in international cooperation   Encouraging structured information exchange   Building communities   Promoting private public partnerships (PPPs) in the area of cybersecurity  10 http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_390_en.pdf  11 Throughout in this document the terms cybersecurity and network and information security are used  interchangeably. While the latter is much more accurate to describe ENISA’s area of operation, which is the EU  Internal Market, the term cybersecurity is often used to describe situations that require the involvement of  law enforcement agencies, falling inter alia within the penal law domain.  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_390_en.pdf  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  3  This paper presents the current operational context for network and information security by  summarising the threat landscape. It then presents the recent developments in EU policy and the  regulatory framework on network and information security. Furthermore it presents ENISA’s  concrete contributions in assisting Member States in attaining increasingly higher levels of  cybersecurity preparedness.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  4  The threat landscape  The threats we encounter in cyber space evolve rapidly. New methods to compromise data, to gain  illegal access to valuable information, to obtain information about user behaviour or to achieve  similar objectives are constantly emerging. Such targets are - and will remain - a focus for malicious  individuals and organisations acting in cyberspace. In order to develop defences, it is necessary to  understand the cyber-threats and the methods used to deploy them.  In the race for primacy between attackers and defenders in cyber space the ability to respond to the  evolving cyber-threat environment appears less like a destination and more like a journey.  Understanding the components of the evolving cyber-threat landscape is a task that became a major  focus for ENISA in 2012 and has been developing rapidly since then. Painting the cyber-threat  landscape and keeping up with the dynamics behind it requires an on-going analysis of cyber- incidents reported. Priority lists of cyber threats, threat agents, attack methods and threat trends  are all elements that need to be taken into consideration. This information is useful for cybersecurity  experts assessing risks to various systems and developing cybersecurity policies for defending  valuable information, although care should always be taken when analysing such data – the fact that  an event has happened frequently in the past is not a guarantee that it will continue to happen. An  example of this is provided by the Stuxnet cyber-attack of 2010, which represented a paradigm shift  not so much because of the advanced methods it used to infect and damage industrial control  systems, but because it unexpectedly changed the target. There was a new realisation that critical  infrastructure, such as nuclear power systems, were susceptible to cyber-attack.  At the end of 2012 ENISA identified top cyber threats and trends for emerging areas of Information  Technology that are consolidated in the table, below, with the updated position for mid-year 2013:  Top Threats  Trends assessed  in 2012  Current trends  mid 2013  Drive-by exploits    Worms/Trojans     Code Injection    Exploit Kits    Botnets    Denial of Service    Phishing    Compromising  Confidential  Information     Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  5  Top Threats  Trends assessed  in 2012  Current trends  mid 2013  Rogueware/  Scareware    Spam    Targeted Attacks    Physical  Theft/Loss/Damage    Identity Theft    Abuse of Information  Leakage    Search Engine  Poisoning  Unable to assess trend!  Rogue Certificates    Legend:  Declining,  Stable,  Increasing,  Warning  Figure 1: Overview of Trends assessed in 2012 vs. 2013 mid-year  As long as the cyber-threat landscape continues to show this very dynamic development, the  challenge is to capture the trends as early as possible. The areas that ENISA has kept its main focus  on throughout 201312, are the following:  Drive-by-exploits: There is a shift from botnets to malicious URLs as the preferred means to  distribute malware. An advantage of URLs as a distribution mechanism lies in the fact that they are  not such an easy target for law enforcement takedowns.  Code Injection: A notable issue with regard to this threat is attacks against popular Content  Management Systems (CMSs). Due to their wide use, popular CMSs make up a considerable attack  surface that has drawn the attention of cyber-criminals.  Botnets: Although not new, an interesting aspect of botnet activity reported is the use of botnet  infrastructure to mine the “virtual currency” Bitcoins. Another important development is the  increased use of peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets that are difficult to locate and take down. Moreover, in  Internet Census 201213, it has been demonstrated how easy is to create botnet infrastructures by  misusing weaknesses in the security of massively deployed devices.  12 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat- landscape-mid-year-2013  13  http://internetcensus2012.bitbucket.org/paper.html  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-mid-year-2013 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-mid-year-2013 http://internetcensus2012.bitbucket.org/paper.html  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  6  Denial of Service: After the 2013 Spamhaus attack,14 Domain Name System (DNS) reflection attacks  have gained in popularity. Moreover, attack bandwidths achieved have reached impressive levels:  the rate of 2-10Gbps attacks has doubled, and the level of 300Gbps attack was reached in 2013.  Rogueware/Scareware: In 2013 there was an increase in rogueware/scareware reported. One  reason for the growth is the expansion of ransomware and fake Antivirus distribution to mobile  platforms, such as Android.  Targeted Attacks: In the first half of 2013, targeted attacks demonstrated their effectiveness in  achieving their objectives. In particular, cyber espionage attacks reached a dimension that went far  beyond expectations15.  Identity Theft: This threat led to some of the most successful attacks by abusing SMS-forwarders to  commit significant financial fraud. These attacks were based on known financial trojans (e.g. Zeus,  SpyEye, Citadel) that have been implemented on mobile platforms and attack two-factor  authentication. A significant source for applying this threat remains social media.  Search Engine Poisoning: Search Engine Poisoning has also gone mobile: some reports on malicious  mobile apps performing Search Engine Optimization poisoning have been found.  These developments lead to the conclusion that attackers remain one step ahead; quite often it  suffices to exploit simple and well known weaknesses to cause havoc. The key message of ENISA is  to transfer knowledge from the cybersecurity community to the user groups for the purpose of  strengthening cyber-defence.  14  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-can-recent-attacks-really-threaten-internet- availability/at_download/fullReport  15  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/cyber-attacks-2013-a-new-edge-for-old- weapons/at_download/fullReport  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-can-recent-attacks-really-threaten-internet-availability/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-can-recent-attacks-really-threaten-internet-availability/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/cyber-attacks-2013-a-new-edge-for-old-weapons/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/cyber-attacks-2013-a-new-edge-for-old-weapons/at_download/fullReport  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  7  The regulatory landscape  Since its inception in 2004, ENISA has contributed to a high level of Network and Information  Security “for the benefit of citizens, consumers, business and public sector organisations in the  European Union, thus contributing to the smooth functioning of the internal market,”16 as it was set  out in the then founding regulation of the Agency. The current mandate of ENISA in the area of  Network and Information security has been based on Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of  the European Union (TFEU) and it is in accordance with decision C-217/04 of the European Court of  Justice. 17  Under the Lisbon Treaty, Article 114 of the TFEU describes the internal market  responsibility and it continues being the applicable legal basis for adopting measures to improve  Network and Information Security.18  A significant part of the Agency’s work is concerned with supporting the protection of infrastructure  and applications, and ensuring preparedness to counter threats and reinforce incident response  capabilities across Europe. The focus of ENISA is on cross-border issues, helping Member States to  identify dependencies and to decide on the most appropriate way to deal with them. While the  focus of the Agency remains on the internal market, with ENISA’s new mandate, received in 2013, it  has the ability to collaborate in other relevant areas such as law enforcement, lending it support and  expertise. Following up on the policy priorities of the Digital Agenda, in 2013 the European Union  laid out a Cybersecurity Strategy, and proposed a Directive on Network and Information Security,  acknowledging the renewal and expansion of ENISA’s mandate.  Cybersecurity Strategy  A new comprehensive Cybersecurity Strategy for the European Union19 comprises the internal  market, justice and home affairs and foreign policy aspects of cyber space issues. The Cybersecurity  16 ENISA was founded by Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004  establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency. The mandate was firstly extended by Regulation (EC)  No 1007/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September 2008 amending Regulation (EC) No  460/2004 establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency as regards its duration and secondly by  Regulation 580/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8th June 2011 amending Regulation (EC) No  460/2004 establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency as regards its duration. The new and  current, basic ENISA Regulation is Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May  2013, concerning the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) and repealing Regulation (EC)  No 460/2004.  17 ECJ 02.05.2006, C-217/04, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v European Parliament and Council of  the European Union.  18 The Internal Market responsibility is a shared competence between the Union and the Member States (Article 4(2)(a)  TFEU), which allows the Union and the Member States to adopt binding measures. The Member States will act if the Union  has not exercised its competence or has decided not to act any more (Article 2(2) TFEU).  19 Joint communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the  Committee of the Regions on a Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace,  Join  (2013) 1 final  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  8  Strategy offers clear priorities for the EU’s international cyberspace policy, in terms of freedom and  openness, outlining the vision and principles of EU core values and fundamental rights in cyberspace.  This complements the role of the EU in the physical world. Furthermore, cybersecurity capacity  building means that the EU will engage with international partners, the private sector and civil  society to support capacity building in third countries. It will include improving access to information  and to an open Internet, and preventing cyber threats. Finally, there is the aim to foster  international cooperation in cyberspace issues, with the goal of preserving open, free and secure  cyberspace. This is a global challenge, which the EU will address together with relevant international  partners and organisations, including the private sector and civil society.  In the Cybersecurity Strategy the Commission has envisaged a key role for ENISA, with the Agency  supporting cyber resilience, i.e. ensuring that critical information infrastructure and network  structures in general are adequately protected.  Moreover ENISA supports the Commission in developing the industrial and technological resources  necessary for cybersecurity, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders. In this regard ENISA will  promulgate technical guidelines and recommendations for the adoption of network and information  security standards and good practices in the public and private sectors.  Additionally, ENISA will be directly involved in reducing cybercrime by developing its relationship  with Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) to identify emerging trends and needs in view of  evolving cybercrime and cybersecurity patterns, to develop appropriate digital forensic tools and  technologies.  In 2013, ENISA has been assessing the implementation of a roadmap for a \"Network and Information  Security driving licence\" and it supports the organisation of a yearly cyber-security month.  ENISA works to make sure that the implementation of policy and strategy is firmly based on  operational experience, that policy is aligned with industry expectations and that it is economically  viable. ENISA will seek to implement scenarios in close collaboration with industry and the public  sector to define good practices in an efficient and market-oriented way.  Draft Directive on Network and Information Security  The Draft Directive on Network and Information Security20 (hereafter, the proposed Directive on  NIS), aims at ensuring a high common level of network and information security, by improving the  security of the Internet and the private networks and information underpinning the functioning of  societies and economies in the EU. The proposed Directive on NIS requires Member States to  increase their preparedness and improve their cooperation with each other in the areas of critical  infrastructures e.g. energy, transport, information society services, public administrations etc.  Additionally it requires Members States to adopt appropriate measures to manage security risks and  incidents reporting.  The proposed Directive on NIS also aims at creating a collaboration framework, within which the  Member States and the European Commission can share early warnings on risks and incidents.  Sharing is facilitated by a secure infrastructure that can be managed by the European Commission.  20 Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to ensure a high  common level of network and information security across the Union, COM(2013) 48 final.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  9  Additionally, market operators and public administrations alike have to adopt a risk based approach  in reporting major security incidents in their core services.  The proposed Directive on NIS foresees a role for ENISA in terms of facilitating collaboration and  managing security risks and information with Member States. Additionally, the proposed Directive  helps to establish common minimum requirements for network and information security at national  level. It requires Member States to designate national competent authorities for NIS, and draw up  strategies on network and information security supported by the operation of CERTs’ risk mitigation  and response mechanisms. It is also expected that the private sector will develop its own cyber  resilience capacities and shares best practices across sectors.  ENISA’s new mandate  The new ENISA Regulation updating the Agency’s mandate21  enshrines ENISA’s achievements in key  areas of network and information security and it underscores the requirement to continue  implementing measures that further the ability of the EU and of the Member States to tackle cyber  threats to the internal market. The new Regulation provides a mandate for ENISA in terms of:   Providing ENISA with a strong interface with the fight against cybercrime - focusing on  prevention and detection - with Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)   Supporting the Member States on building capacity for CIIP and cybersecurity strategy   Supporting the development of EU cybersecurity policy and legislation   Supporting research, development and standardisation, with EU standards for risk  management and the security of electronic products, networks and services   Supporting the prevention and detection of, and response, to cross-border  cyber-threats   Supporting the European Commission in implementing certain aspects of the EU  Cybersecurity Strategy (e.g. NIS Platform). Aligning ENISA more closely to the EU Regulatory  process, providing EU countries and Institutions with assistance and advice (e.g. on incident  reporting, proposed NIS Directive).  ENISA seeks to become the catalyst that brings together existing groups to work on problems which  are important in today's policy agenda; once these groups start working together ENISA can then  focus on other areas of interest.  The new mandate gives ENISA a more proactive role in cyber security. This is illustrated in the area  of standards, where ENISA will facilitate the establishment of technical standards on network and  information security instead of passively tracking standards (as specified by the former mandate).  Other regulatory initiatives  Other regulatory proposals have provided fresh impetus for ENISA’s involvement in new policy  areas. ENISA has also been an active contributor to EU policy and support to Member States in  21 Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 concerning the  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) and repealing Regulation (EC) No  460/2004.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  10  implementing Article 13a of the telecoms Framework Directive.22 ENISA also assists Member States  in implementing Article 4 of the e-Privacy directive.23  In 2012, the European Commission made a proposal for a Regulation on electronic identification and  trusted services for electronic transactions in the internal market,24 and it addresses shortcomings of  Directive 1999/93/EC on a Community framework for electronic signatures, aiming at secure and  seamless electronic transactions.  22 Directive 2009/140/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 amending  Directives 2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and  services, 2002/19/EC on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and  associated facilities, and 2002/20/EC on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and  services.  23 Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 amending  Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks  and services, Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in  the electronic communications sector and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on cooperation between national  authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws.  24  COM(2012) 238/2Proposal for a Regulation of the European parliament and of the Council on electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  11  Responding to policy challenges  In response to its own policy goals emanating from the regulatory framework, ENISA aims at  providing:   Support for policy and governance: Supporting the EU bodies, ENISA contributes to specific  policy goals with designated Commission Services and Agencies, helping them meet their  goals.   Cross-border collaboration: the response to Network and Information Security challenges  depends on the ability of the respondents to act together in a coordinated manner. ENISA  seeks to identify the areas where collaboration is likely to bring about tangible results and  then it seeks to coordinate efforts and actuate the stakeholders involved to take measures  mitigating perceived risks.   Preparedness and knowledge: as a centre of expertise, ENISA develops its own content and  capabilities in a range of areas of broad policy interest, supporting its stakeholders with  analyses and recommendations on issues of concern.  Support for policy and governance  In terms of policy and governance ENISA has received a clear mandate to provide support to the  European Commission’s CERT for the European Institutions, as well as the European Cybercrime  Centre (EC3) at Europol. ENISA has also been actively supporting the Member States in  implementing Article 13a of the telecommunications Framework Directive25 and it assists Member  States in implementing Article 4 of the e-Privacy directive.26 Additionally, ENISA will support Member  States in implementing article 15a of the proposed EU eTrust Directive27. ENISA therefore has the  opportunity to contribute to concrete collaborative efforts at the level of the Member States as well  as with the EU bodies, supporting all with advice and assistance.  Supporting the CERT for the European Institutions (CERT-EU)  In 2012, a permanent Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-EU) for the EU bodies was set up.  CERT-EU brings together IT security experts from the European Commission, General Secretariat of  the Council, European Parliament and Committee of the Regions/Economic and Social Committee. It  cooperates with other CERTs in the Member States and beyond, as well as with specialised IT  security services. CERT-EU is likely to extend its services, on the basis of the requirements of its  constituency, and taking into account the available competencies, resources and partnerships. The  role of ENISA is to provide support to CERT-EU, building on its successful work with administrative  25 Directive 2009/140/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 amending  Directives 2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and  services, 2002/19/EC on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and  associated facilities, and 2002/20/EC on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and  services.  26 Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 amending  Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks  and services, Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in  the electronic communications sector and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on cooperation between national  authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws.  27  COM(2012) 238/2Proposal for a Regulation of the European parliament and of the Council on electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  12  and governmental CERTs. The Agency will pursue two different approaches - introducing and  integrating CERT-EU into existing CERT communities, and building up and extending CERT-EU  capabilities by means of providing appropriate training.  Support for Europol and the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)  ENISA’s new Regulation gives it the scope to closely cooperate with Europol in supporting the fight  against cybercrime. Europol hosts the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) that coordinates law- enforcement efforts in combating cybercrime. In 2013 ENISA collaborated with Europol in such areas  as the 8th Annual CERT workshop, co-organised with the European Cybercrime Centre, as well as  involving Europol and the EC3 in network and information security projects. While Europol and EC3  clearly serve the operational aspect of the fight against cybercrime, ENISA contributes by deepening  the cooperation capabilities between CERTs and law enforcement agencies, for example by  developing training for CERTs to support this cooperation further and by regularly bring people from  both sectors together to discuss operational issues and obstacles, e.g. how to handle evidence when  first entering a crime scene.  Requests for advice and assistance  In line with article 14 of the ENISA Regulation, the Agency stands ready to support the needs of the  Member States, the European Commission and the European Parliament with expertise on network  and information security. An area that ENISA sees gaining in importance and visibility is CERT  in-house training for designated stakeholders in the Member States and in EU Institutions. In 2013,  ENISA responded to the following requests:   The National Regulatory Authority of Cyprus (OCECPR) sought the support of ENISA in a  workshop organised with the participation of the Cypriot electronic communications  providers. ENISA’s role was to represent the European context and provide suitable advice.   A request from Estonia was responded to by organising and delivering training on “Incident  handling during an attack on Critical Information Infrastructure”.   Latvia’s Information Technology Security Incident Response Institution CERT.LV made a  request for ENISA to provide an on-site training course on “Social networks used as an attack  vector for targeted attacks”.  Additionally, ENISA contributed to the CERT.LV annual  conference “Information Security – Key for Success.”   The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), has been setting up an IT  system to collect and analyse data on wholesale market energy markets across the EU, and  asked for the support of ENISA to ensure operational reliability and protection of the  received data and prevent unauthorised access to that information.   A request of the European Commission (DG HOME) to provide input in the context of the  review of the EU legal framework for data retention has been dealt with. ENISA’s  contribution seeks to identify the benefits, main impacts and possible means of enforcement  of new data security measures in the reform. ENISA is also assessing the “good practice”  potential of current security measures for data retention in selected Member States.   At the request of the European Commission, ENISA organised a seminar on the organisation  and planning of cyber exercises. An outline of a “cyber-scenario” was developed and  adapted to the needs of the European Commission using as guidance input from the Cyber  Europe 2012 exercise which was facilitated by ENISA.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  13  Cross-border collaboration  The primary goal of ENISA is to be a catalyst where collaboration is essential to bring about tangible  results in the area of network and information security. The emerging regulatory framework  underscores this role. Collaboration and exchange of information are essential elements in the fight  against cybercrime. When the integrity of networks, infrastructures and control systems is at risk,  threatening millions of citizens and business, acting alone pays no dividends. ENISA has a successful  record of helping others to help themselves, by bringing together stakeholders involved in a policy  area in network and information security. ENISA is the organisation that helps stakeholders translate  policy into action.  Cyber Incident Reporting in the EU  Security incidents leading to large outages and data breaches still remain largely undetected as  information about them is collected mostly for the in-house use of those affected. This shortcoming  makes it difficult for regulatory authorities to improve on measures to take and serve public interest  by disclosing breaches that concern individuals and businesses alike. The Framework Directive on  electronic communications28 stipulates measures that have been supported by ENISA. ENISA has set  up a national regulators’ expert group that has developed a set or reporting procedures for  incidents. Additionally, in an annual incidents report, the Agency analysed 79 major incidents and  given an overview of their causes. Lastly, ENISA provided recommendations on national roaming as a  measure for mitigating mobile network outages, and power supply dependencies to reduce the  impact of power outages on electronic communications.  In 2013 the Agency started a new expert group of supervisory authorities (being, data protection  authorities and telecommunications regulators) for the implementation of Article 4 of the e-privacy  directive.29 The main goal is to provide a platform for exchanging experience between experts in  different countries. Where possible, ENISA seeks to build on synergies between expert groups on  Article 13a and Article 4, to develop a unified framework for security measures and incident  reporting. ENISA also assists Member States in the implementation of article 15 of the directive on  electronic identification and trusted services for electronic transactions in the internal market. The  Agency brings together competent regulatory bodies in the Member States, and supports debates  on the services concerned, the reporting scheme, and the parameters and thresholds.  Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises  ENISA has a strong track record of contributions in cyber crisis cooperation and exercises in the EU.  This is an area where ENISA has made major breakthroughs, such as its series of pan-European cyber  28 Directive 2009/140/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 amending  Directives 2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and  services, 2002/19/EC on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and  associated facilities, and 2002/20/EC on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and  services.  29 Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 amending  Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks  and services, Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in  the electronic communications sector and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on cooperation between national  authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  14  exercises, establishing strong relationships and gaining the commitment of European Union Member  States. In 2013, ENISA issupporting the cybercrisis management exercise of the Eurocontrol air traffic  control agency, with a large-scale cyber incidents scenario. ENISA builds successful exercises by  establishing the cyber exercises area, and building a high-level of expertise by bringing together  Member States, European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, and EU Institutions.  ENISA’s series of international conferences on cyber crisis cooperation and exercises offers a key  knowledge sharing platform to international cyber security experts and decision makers, highlighting  how to deal with cyber crises and applying appropriate contingency plans and escalation procedures.  The conferences aim to facilitate debate and information exchange and offer networking  opportunities to both technical experts and executive stakeholders.  In 2013, ENISA organised its second International Conference on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and  Exercises, with a focus on various topics in the area of cyber crisis cooperation. These include  information gathering and common situational awareness, escalation processes and procedures,  cybercrisis management in the general crisis management context, cross-border cyber exercises, and  tools and platforms for information exchange and communication.  As cyber exercises and European network and information security cyber cooperation plans and  procedures gradually come together, ENISA will continue to support an umbrella EU NIS cooperation  plan, in line with the EU Cybersecurity Strategy. Starting from 2014, the cyber exercises will aim to  cover all levels of escalation when cyber incidents lead to a cyber-crisis and will thus test technical  level, operational level and political level cooperation procedures and responses.  Similarly, international efforts, with conferences organised by ENISA and the cooperation of third  countries, are continuing, thus contributing to an enhanced level of preparedness to face cyber- crises on a global scale.  The European Cyber Security Month  In 2013, a fully-fledged European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) is taking place across Europe with  the support of DG CNECT and ENISA, bringing together over 40 public and private actors and  implementing more than 50 activities.30 As an instrument of collaboration among stakeholders in  network and information security, ENISA seeks to facilitate sharing good practices, and thereby  increase the results for the work of network and information security communities.  ECSM is an EU  campaign that takes place in October to promote cybersecurity awareness and training among  citizens. The campaign has the objective of changing the perceptions of cybersecurity threats at  work and in the private sphere. It also aims to provide updated security information through  education, good practice and competitions.  Securing Smart Grids  ENISA has launched a series of activities aiming to bring together stakeholders in the area of critical  information infrastructure protection and engaging them in an open discussion on smart grid  cybersecurity. The principal goal is to identify the main issues of concern regarding the security of  30 Network Information Security events are taking place in 26 countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, The Czech  Republic, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania,  Luxembourg, Moldova, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden and the  United Kingdom.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  15  smart grids in support of national, pan-European and international initiatives. ENISA supports the  efforts of the European Commission and of the Member States on smart grids by facilitating Expert  Group 2 on Regulatory Recommendations for Privacy, Data Protection and cyber-security in the  Smart Grid Environment.31 In an effort to advance collaboration in this field ENISA has been tasked  by Expert Group 2 to organise consultations on these minimum security requirements with national  cybersecurity authorities and the energy and ICT industries, and possibly also selected non-EU  partners. Based upon this process, recommendations to Member States on minimum cybersecurity  requirements for smart grids will be drafted.  EP3R and NIS Platform  The European Private Public Partnership for Resilience (EP3R) was established as a follow-up to the  policy initiative on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) adopted by the European  Commission on 30th March 2009.32 The scope of EP3R was to propose strategic and tactical solutions,  in the areas of: key assets, resources and functions; baseline requirements for security and  resilience; and coordination, cooperation and response to large-scale disruptions. ENISA chaired task  forces and work objectives groups, providing a flexible structure to allow the development of the  works, supplying secretariat support and technical expertise. After two years of operation, a  stocktaking exercise is under way to understand the impact of EP3R and propose improvements.  In 2013, EP3R is being followed by an initiative called the NIS Platform. The NIS platform is organised  in working groups that aim to provide a further dimension to Public-Private Partnerships in Europe.  ENISA plans to provide technical support to NIS Platform working groups, subject matter advice on  issues discussed in the working groups and background research on open issues raised.  Supporting the CERT community  Capacity building for CERTs in the EU has been central to ENISA throughout 2013. CERTs are key for  Critical Information Infrastructure Protection and are a primary security service provider for  governments and citizens.  The 8th annual CERT workshop was held in Bucharest, Romania, and was co-located with the 39th  TF-CSIRT meeting. The workshop focused on ENISA CERT exercises and fostered cross-sector  collaboration, in particular between CERTs with national and governmental responsibility and their  national law enforcement “counterparts”, emphasising “automated sharing of information”. In this  workshop ENISA experts provided technical training to attendees, focusing on “Incident handling  during an attack on Critical Information Infrastructure”, ”Mobile threats incident handling” and  “Honeypots”.  31 In 2009, the Smart Grids Task Force (SGTF) was set up by the European Commission (EC) to reach a  consensus on policy and regulatory directions for the deployment of Smart Grids. SGTF operates in five  discrete Expert Groups.  32 The Communication on Critical Information Infrastructure protection (CIIP) of the European Commission  focuses on the protection of Europe from cyber disruptions by enhancing security and resilience. The action  plan brings together Member States and the private sector and it is based on five pillars: preparedness and  prevention, detection and response, mitigation and recovery, international cooperation and criteria for  European Critical Infrastructures in the field of ICT.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  16  CERT / Law Enforcement collaboration  The fight against cybercrime is important to law enforcement agencies across Europe and  worldwide. ENISA aims at bringing CERTs to closer collaboration with law enforcement bodies in  order to make skills and expertise available to combat cybercrime. ENISA seeks to facilitate cross- sector community building, bringing together operational players, and actively supporting cross- sector training and education. The work aims to develop trust between these two sectors through  regular meetings and training. Additionally, alternative strategies include discussions and exchange  of good practices in operational areas (such as guidelines for first responders entering a crime  scene), or tackling legal issues with cross-border sharing of operational information (log files, IP  addresses, etc.). Ideally the outcomes of discussions result in further items to address in the future,  developing new material for common training with CERTs and law enforcement personnel.  Cooperation in the standardisation process  The cross-border nature of threats and the associated mitigation mechanisms make it essential to  focus on strong international cooperation. This requires major efforts at national level, at pan- European level and globally. There needs to be close cooperation with international partners to  prevent and to respond to cyber incidents. ENISA tracks the development of standards from a more  global perspective in Network and Information Security. The Agency monitors network and  information security standards in the EU and globally, including areas that are not specifically related  to the priorities of the ENISA work programme. This approach allows the Agency to keep its  stakeholders informed on new network and information security standardisation activities and to  flag opportunities and/or risks as they develop.  In 2013, ENISA is continuing to contribute to the joint ETSI CEN-CENELEC Cyber Security Coordination  Group (CSCG), an advisory and coordination body on political and strategic matters related to  cybersecurity standardisation. The role of ENISA is to assess whether there is a gap between these  standardisation activities and state-of-the-art developments in network and information security.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  17  Preparedness and knowledge  As a centre of expertise, ENISA has continued to develop its unique body of knowledge in network  and information security, aiming at informing policymakers, businesses and citizens alike. The areas  that ENISA undertakes to develop are influenced of course by regulatory developments, threats and  policy requests.  Cyber crisis cooperation in Europe  ENISA carried out a study on National Network and Information Security Contingency Plans by  analysing the national-level best practices, procedures, roles and responsibilities, for management  and cooperation during major cyber incidents, escalating to a cyber-crisis.  In the framework of the Cyber Europe series of exercises organised by ENISA, the EU Member States  have prepared procedures for cooperation at the operational level, including alerting, information  exchange and situational awareness. In 2013, a report of the working group of the EU Forum of  Member States (EFMS) on European Cyber Crisis Cooperation Framework (ECCCF) identified the  need for cooperation at all three levels: technical, operational/tactical and political. In response  ENISA drafted a report that took into account the above-mentioned considerations.  The operational procedures developed within the context of the Cyber Europe exercises, as well as  the existing national-level NIS Cooperation Plans in EU Member States, would play a central role in  establishing a European Union-level NIS Cooperation Plan, in line with the proposed Directive on NIS.  Industrial Control Systems Security  Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are command and control networks and systems designed to  support industrial processes in such industries as gas and electricity distribution, water treatment, oil  refining and railways. Industrial control systems constitute a strategic asset, with a rising potential  for catastrophic terrorist attacks affecting these critical infrastructures. These systems have often  been the target of malicious actors in cyber-attacks. While industrial control systems are sufficiently  robust the operation, management culture and appreciation of threats in these systems could be  improved. ENISA has carried out an analysis to facilitate agile and integrated responses to incidents  contributing to their analysis.  In industrial control security, independent evaluations and tests are missing, leading to the  ineffective operation of industrial environments. ENISA aims at assessing the need among the  Member States for a national ICS-SCADA testing framework, identifying the gaps in testing practices  and producing guidance for both the development of new and harmonization of current ICS-SCADA  test beds frameworks (if any) among Member States. Finally a good practice guide on a European  ICS-SCADA test bed programme/framework will be developed. Additionally ENISA provides advice on  assessing the challenges involved in developing ICS-SCADA patching good practices and it has  provided relevant recommendations.  Cloud computing  ENISA lends its support to the Member States in terms of incident reporting in Cloud computing  services (e.g. eHealth, transport etc.). In that respect ENISA is preparing a good practice guide on  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  18  how to report outages in cloud computing according to their impact and the criticality of the service  affected.  ENISA supports the European Commission on the implementation of their EU cloud strategy. The  report on Securing Governmental Cloud Computing infrastructures is a study on the cloud uptake  across the EU. It includes initiatives at national and regional level and provides a set of  recommendations on how to safely deploy cloud solution in the public sector. Also ENISA’s security  guidance for SMEs is an updated version of the 2009 risk assessment. It focuses on SMEs presenting  the highest risks and opportunities. Finally ENISA participates in the certification industry group of  the EU Commission that aims at establishing a list of certification schemes and support voluntary  certification schemes for cloud computing providers. In May 2013, ENISA launched the “Cloud  Security and Resilience Experts group” where experts from industry and the public sector  participate.  Resilience of European network interconnections  In 2013, ENISA is furthering its goals in the area of resilience of network infrastructures and the  mechanisms for emergency communications that have been in place in Member States by shifting  focus to the technical and the organisational component. ENISA seeks to provide insight to the  “structure of the Internet” at the physical and network layers in the Member States, which could be  used by governments or policymakers to develop a strategy to ensure that critical services remain  functional when there are interruptions in network performance or connectivity. An additional  policy and organisational component aims to collect information on the legal framework concerning  the relationship between telecommunications regulators and Internet Service Providers involved in  the Member States in order to improve collaboration.  Resilience of European mobile networks  To counter outages involving mobile network operators in the EU, ENISA analyses national roaming  frameworks which allow customers to use the network of other mobile operators. The main goal of  this work is to investigate how and if national roaming could be used to address the impact of  outages in terms of technical, legal, financial and administrative aspects.  The scope includes mobile  devices at large, including mobile communications between machines. The goal is to provide a set of  approaches that telecommunications’ Regulators could consider in mitigating mobile network  outages using national roaming. The impact of this activity is significant in civil protection, crisis  management and critical industries as improving resilience of mobile communications for critical  functions and critical services that rely on mobile networks can generally be improved.  ICT Security of inter-bank transactions  The challenges faced by financial sector ICT professionals in ensuring integrity, availability and  confidentiality of information in transit have been analysed by ENISA in terms of risk awareness, the  state of prevention of security risks, ways to detect incidents, policies and organisational aspects.  ENISA seeks to identify actual challenges faced by ICT professionals in the financial sector in terms of  ensuring the integrity, availability and confidentiality of information in transit.  A global stocktaking  activity on the matter would help ENISA inter alia to better understand:   The actual risk awareness among ICT professionals of the financial sector   The state of prevention of security risks  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  19   How incidents are detected, associated risks are mitigated and flaws are fixed on a  continuous basis   Whether global policies favour the response to incidents    Baseline capabilities - harmonised approach towards incident response  ENISA supports Member States in enhancing and strengthening cooperation among CERTs to  achieve powerful incident response when needed. Continuously working together with the CERT  community on improving a common “denominator”, called “CERT baseline capabilities” that allows  for better cross-border information sharing and cooperation. In 2013 ENISA is assessing the level of  compliance of CERT Baseline Capabilities in the Member States and is providing a report on  harmonisation in such areas as terminology, validation processes and requirements.  ENISA will  further examine a suitable certification (or similar) to assess the baseline capabilities of CERTs.  CERT training and good practice  In 2013 the ENISA CERT training programme is continuing by developing the curriculum further to  include new scenarios on cybercrime for CERT and Law Enforcement Agencies’ staff. The CERT  training material features a handbook for the tutor and a toolset for students, together with virtual  computer images to support hands-on training sessions on the students’ computers. Additionally  ENISA is re-releasing the TRANSITS program with training material for new CERT staff.  Good practice Guides for CERTS: Improving information sharing  Secure communication and information sharing on security threats can be shared among CERT  teams to improve security and efficiency, as well as to speed up incident response. In 2013, ENISA is  reviewing enablers and barriers for information sharing. Taking stock of the current communication  exchange practices of CERT teams and input from standards, this initiative aims at improving  information sharing practices. A good practice guide in the area of “Alerts, Warnings and  Announcements,” aims at addressing issues related to these areas, as well as increasing the security  awareness of stakeholders.  A good practice guide on the practical implementation of the “Directive on attacks against  information systems and repealing Council Framework Decision - 2010/0273(COD)”33  aims at  identifying the implications of the Directive on stakeholders such as (national/governmental) CERTs  and law enforcement bodies. This guide focuses on how to implement the Directive in the Member  States and makes relevant recommendations.  Network and Information Security driving licence  The EU Cybersecurity Strategy suggests the developing a roadmap for a Network and Information  Security driving licence as a voluntary certification programme to promote enhanced skills and  competence for IT professionals. In 2013, ENISA kicked off the consultation process with relevant  stakeholders to guide the process.  33  Directive 2013/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 August 2013 on attacks against  information systems and replacing Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA.  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  20  Moving ahead with ENISA  The Cybersecurity strategy of the EU has given new impetus to the response of the EU to  cybersecurity challenges. The high political visibility of this initiative was demonstrated by the joint  involvement of Commissioners Cécilia Malmström, Vice President Neelie Kroes and High  Representative Cathy Ashton. Political attention and support for this strategy is fundamental in  order to see a stable and safe progression in improving cybersecurity and curbing the impact of  cybercrime.  ENISA has provided much sought after expertise to guide policymakers with dependable opinion and  substantiated recommendations. Additionally, it has coordinated efforts of actors involved and  stakeholders at large in order to be more efficient, focused and effective in taking important  decisions in cybersecurity preparedness. The role of ENISA in implementing the EU policy and  regulatory framework might sometimes go unnoticed, as initiatives undertaken are often discreet by  nature and actions happen behind the scenes; ENISA however has proven its ability to act discreetly  as a catalyst, and to actuate stakeholders with a view to bringing about change in network and  information security. With the advent of the new mandate, ENISA looks forward to becoming further  involved in promulgating information security standards, which in the EU is a way to narrow the gap  between policy and operational performance.  ENISA supports the European Commission and Member States by providing them with information  on trends and emerging threats, and by providing guidance on risk management and appropriate  prevention and response measures.  The Agency also facilitates dialogue on Network and  Information Security across communities and with different international counterparts. This  dialogue is a critical precursor to any long-term action plan for protecting information services that  benefit EU citizens and it helps Member States to align their approaches to specific issues.  EU cyber cooperation is again at a crossroads as the regulatory framework has to be transposed and  implemented across the EU. Additionally the emerging regulatory framework in electronic  communications, privacy and trust is likely to lead to greater cooperation among stakeholders.  ENISA, with its newly defined role, remains in support of policy, coordination and expert knowledge.  ENISA is a key player supporting the alignment of public and private sector strategies to reach a level  of common policies and good practices that will give the EU an edge in mitigating cybersecurity risks.  ENISA with its unique mission has a clear role to play in helping the Commission and Member States  in turning high level policy into action items, and engaging with stakeholders to help them actuate  and eventually help themselves.  The success of the EU Internal Security Strategy “is dependent on the combined efforts of all EU  actors, but also on cooperation with the outside world. Only by joining forces and working together  to implement this strategy can Member States, EU institutions, bodies and agencies provide a truly  coordinated European response to the security threats of our time”34. Being proactive in building  cyber cooperation in cross-border communities will bring benefits both in terms of the effectiveness  of common strategies and efficiency in the use of evolving assets.  34  COM(2010) 673 final p. 16  Cybersecurity cooperation  Defending the digital frontline  October 2013  Page  21  Network and information security will always need to be built into future plans, as it is an issue that  is here to stay, with ICT leading growth. In the interdependent world that we live in, acting together  in a cohesive manner is essential. ENISA has undertaken the pivotal role to provide support and  expertise whilst responding to challenging digital changes. If the Internet fails to remain safe the  impact for modern societies will be too costly to bear. All efforts and strategies towards securing  Europe’s cyber cooperation must be coherent, consistent and united; and there is no better time to  respond and move ahead than now.

The main purpose of the survey has  been to collect information about the electronic IDentity and Authentication (eIDA) Systems used in  e-Finance and e-Payment systems, to analyse the risks associated to each eIDA method, and produce  a Guidelines report with the best practices recommended to the main actors of this sector: Financial  institutions, Merchants and Payment Service providers.  An important role of ENISA is to provide its stakeholders with guidelines on topics that are related to  Network & Information Security (NIS) – this particular report deals with those topics associated with  the e-Identity of citizens and concentrates on e-identity management risks in financial sector:  phishing, id-theft, session and identity hijacking, etc. Some financial institutions are still not  considering the risk associated with the use of inadequate authentication mechanisms, and this  report has collected information about the amount of fraud detected in financial institutions. Then it  correlates that fraud with the different types of authentication mechanisms implemented by them.  With this information, financial institutions could evaluate the cost/benefit associated to the  implementation of additional authentication mechanisms in their particular environment, which is  highly recommended here.  This information has been collected in a survey replied by more than 100 professionals, which has  allowed also to Identify Authentication mechanisms used in financial and payment services, and  the associated risks. The analysis of the survey results has allowed ENISA to produce 4 groups of  recommendations about the best eIDA method to be used in the authorisation of ePayment  operations, depending on the risk associated with them:  1. Promote adequacy of eIDA method to Context: i.e. Proportionality of method and risk, but  encouraging also the use of 2 factor authentication even in low risk operations.  2. Improve the knowledge and the behaviour of customers and professionals: Professionals  have to take into consideration the evolving risks associated with each authentication  method, and customers have to be aware of the need to use strong authentication methods  and protect their credentials.  3. Improve the security of the e-Finance environment, through: Risk Analysis of the Specific  environment (customers profile and size of institution), improvement of customers’  awareness and skills, implementation of context based authentication of transactions, and  early detection of customer’s device compromise through registration, testing and  evaluation of the device security.  4. Improve the security of e-Finance application development and distribution: encouraging  the traditional security by design, taking account of the new personal data protection  Directive, and also using trusted distribution channels to install applications in the  customers’ device.  To summarise, there are many risks that current eIDA practices in the sector don’t cover, ECB and EC  are developing recommendations and regulations that are aligned with the recommendations of this  report of ENISA, trying to identify and set up the tools to improve fraud statistics.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page iv  Table of Contents  Executive summary iii  1 Introduction 1  1.1 Summary of legislative work regarding e-Payment systems in EU 1  1.2 Inputs from Stakeholders 1  1.2.1 Methodology 1  1.2.2 Partners for the project: 2  1.2.3 APWG.EU chapter 2  1.2.4 MRC (Merchant Risk Council) 3  1.2.5 Financial Services User Group (FSUG) 3  1.2.6 European Central Bank and Forum on the Security of Retail Payments (SecuRe Pay) 4  1.2.7 Payment Services Directive 4  1.3 Motivation 4  1.4 Survey Objectives 6  2 Types of operations and transactions in eFinance and ePayment services 7  3 Authentication mechanisms used in eFinance and ePayment services 9  3.1 eIDA methods used in e-financial and e-banking systems 9  3.1.1 Password/PIN 9  3.1.2 Biometrics 9  3.1.3 One Time Password (OTP) 10  3.1.4 e-Signature Certificate 12  3.1.5 Device Authentication 13  3.2 Context authentication mechanisms used in eFinance and ePayment services 13  3.2.1 User behaviour analysis parameters 13  3.2.2 Sessions analysis parameters 14  3.2.3 Network analysis parameters 14  3.2.4 Device Authentication 15  3.2.5 User Profiling 15  3.3 eIDA method Evaluation and selection Factors 16  3.4 Survey questions 17  4 Threat analysis 18  4.1 Threat Categorization 18  4.1.1 Threats against end-users 18  4.1.2 Threats against end-users’ devices 18  4.1.3 Threats against communication networks 19  4.1.4 Threats against remote banking services. 19  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page v  4.2 Attack patterns 19  4.2.1 Attack scenarios 19  4.2.2 Real attack incidents 20  5 Survey analysis 23  5.1 Current practices 23  5.2 Applicability of identified Threats to eIDA methods 24  5.3 Perceived strength, usability and cost 25  5.4 Adequacy of eIDA methods selection criteria 25  5.5 eIDA methods Risk Reduction benefits 28  6 Risk analysis guidelines 30  6.1 Biometrics adoption related risks 31  6.2 Mobile phones related risks 32  7 Recommendations / Best practices guidelines 34  7.1 Challenge: Promote Adequacy of eIDA method to Context 34  7.1.1 Rec.1: eIDA method Selection proportionality 34  7.1.2 Rec.2.

Will be reviewed soon.  - The Payment Services Directive (PSD2) (Directive 2007/64/EC). For which a new proposal (PSD23 ,  Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on payment services in the internal  market and amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2013/36/EU and 2009/110/EC and repealing  Directive 2007/64/EC), has been submitted by the European Commission to the European  Parliament and the European Council on July 24th.  - The e-Invoicing4 directive states that invoices must include authentication of origin.  - The new Regulation about personal data Protection (General Data Protection Regulation,  GDPR5), which is expected to be applicable to all sectors, is expected to be approved by the  European Parliament in 2014 or Q1 2014.  - The review of the EU electronic communications regulatory framework and, in particular, the  new provisions of articles 13a and 13b of the Framework Directive and the amended article 4 of  the Protection of Personal Data or e-Privacy Directive6, aim at strengthening obligations for  operators; to ensure security and integrity of their networks and services, to notify breaches of  security, integrity and personal data to competent national authorities and assign to ENISA  specific tasks. In June 2013, the Commission has put in place new specific rules to ensure that  personal data breaches in the EU telecoms sector are notified in the same way in each Member  State7. The new GDPR includes a requirement to notify about personal data breaches to all  sectors, just like in the current telecommunication directive8 requires telecom operators to  notify any relevant security incident to their regulator.  1.2 Inputs from Stakeholders  1.2.1 Methodology  The project was developed according to the following steps:  1  http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/emoney/index_en.htm  2  http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/framework/index_en.htm  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32007L0064:EN:NOT  3  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52013PC0547:EN:NOT (COM/2013/0547 final -  2013/0264 (COD))  4  http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/einvoicing/index_en.htm  5  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  6  Old PPDD:  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:HTML  7  Commission Regulation on the measures applicable to the notification of personal data breaches under  Directive 2002/58/EC on privacy and electronic communications” online: https://ec.europa.eu/digital- agenda/en/eprivacy-directive-data-breach-notifications  8  Telecommunications Regulatory Package (article 13a. amended Directive 2002/21/EC Framework Directive)  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0110:EN:NOT http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/emoney/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/framework/index_en.htm http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52013PC0547:EN:NOT http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/einvoicing/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:HTML https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/eprivacy-directive-data-breach-notifications https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/eprivacy-directive-data-breach-notifications  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 2   The objectives of the eIDA project were discussed in a meeting organized by the APWG.eu in  Dublin (e-Crime Researchers Sync-Up), March 2013. The attendants to the workshop  validated the objectives.   Once the main objectives were delimited, a questionnaire was elaborated by ENISA, with  contributions from the APWG.EU and BDigital, the questionnaire was then validated by  FSUG, MRC and SecuRe Pay forums.   We received important comments, which allowed us to produce a final version of the Survey  that was launched by ENISA and distributed by the above-mentioned groups as well as EU FI- ISAC and EPC, through which the European Member States central banks were reached.   The Survey was available for participants during a period of 6 weeks; we received 54  responses from representatives of end users groups, and 112 from the professionals, once  merged the responses collected through different sessions, and removed those invalid, e.g.  coming from IP addresses outside EU.   A results analysis was performed with the conclusions summarised in this report, as well as  identifying a set of recommendations for improvement.   Those draft recommendations have been distributed for comments to FSUG, MRC and  SecuRe Pay forum. They have been presented also in several workshops and conferences, to  get feedback from industry, which was positive in all cases. In the World-eID conference it  was possible to interchange ideas with STORK2.0 partners, and in ISSE2013 we had the  opportunity to chair a whole session, with contributions from the Commission, Merchant  and financial sectors.   The received comments have been integrated in the document, and finally aligned with the  recommendations made by ECB on its report “Recommendations for the security of  Internet payments”9 (the “Recommendations”).   Finally, an internal evaluation has also been carried out by ENISA in order to produce the  final version of this report.  1.2.2 Partners for the project:  This research was carried out by ENISA in conjunction with, BDigital and Anti-Phishing WG (APWG)  European chapter.  Also contributed to the launching and the analysis of the survey results:  - Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG.EU) EU chapter  - European Central Bank (ECB) and Forum on the Security of Retail Payments (SecuRe Pay)  - Merchant Risk Council (MRC)  - Financial Services User Group (FSUG)10  - Payment Services Directive (PSD2) preparation team: DG Market H3  - Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center European Chapter (EU FI-ISAC)  - European Payment Council (EPC)  1.2.3 APWG.EU chapter  Some members of the APWG.EU chapter, mainly from the financial sector, made the following  contributions to the project:  - Identified eID practices used in the e-Banking and e-Payment systems:  9  Published on 31 January 2013 on the ECB’s website  http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/recommendationssecurityinternetpaymentsoutcomeofpcfinalversi onafterpc201301en.pdf  10  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:199:SOM:EN:HTML  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 3  o In the e-Banking applications, the application of eID mechanisms to different types of  operations, e.g. read data, modify credentials, money transfer, etc.  o In e-Payment services, they suggested to use indirect methods of assessment of fraud, to  avoid having to provide absolute data.  - Analysed the Robustness of each eID method and the associated Risks, based on the known  Phishing and other Attack Patterns that have been successfully threating each eID method.  - Defined some best practice guidelines recommending the use of adequate eID methods  depending on the risk associated to the transaction or payment.  1.2.4 MRC (Merchant Risk Council)  On top of the known problems with mafia and organised criminals, MRC11 is highly concerned about  “account takeover”: the criminal / hacker uses directly the payment data stored by the merchant,  logging in as a real user of the merchant. Then, they may “exchange” the goods purchased  electronically in the physical store, if the merchant has multiple channels, which allows “monetizing”  the fraud. MRC is interested in analysing how this kind of identity /account spoofing, that allows to  get into the merchant website with a fake identity, can be avoided.  MRC is willing to contribute to improving the security of the user identification, and the related data  storage security. Meaning that, the merchants tend not to store any personal or financial data, but  only a randomly generated token to launch new purchase orders without having to introduce again  the payment details through the merchant site. However, they still handle personal data, because  the token identifies the user between the merchant and the payment service, and it has to be  considered also for data storage security controls.  MRC also contributed with a presentation about “Incident management”, that informs merchants  about how to react in case of incident. MRC is interested in getting information about the skills that  merchant infrastructure managers should have in order to protect their assets from attacks and  incidents, as well as about data breach notifications that they will need to make, when the EU  Directive will be applicable.  1.2.5 Financial Services User Group (FSUG)12  The Commission set up a Financial Services User Group (FSUG). In its White Paper on Financial  Services Policy 2005–201013, the Commission stated that it attaches great importance to ensuring  proportionate user representation in the policy-making. In the Communication for the European  Council – Driving European Recovery14, the Commission put the interests of European investors,  consumers and SMEs at the centre of the financial market reform.  11 The MRC organises webinars and writes reports to raise the awareness of their members, which  are mostly merchants and payment service providers. They also collaborate with public security  agencies, which membership fee is free and have a Committee to manage the collaboration with the  LEA. ECB wants to force the use of safer communication means between payment services and  merchants. Their European Congress takes place at London from the 17th to the 19th of April  (expected 500 participants).  12  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:199:0012:0014:EN:PDF  http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/finservices-retail/fsug/fsug_en.htm  13  White Paper on Financial Services Policy 2005–2010  14  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52009DC0114:EN:NOT  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:199:SOM:EN:HTML http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005DC0629:EN:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005DC0629:EN:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52009DC0114:EN:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52009DC0114:EN:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:199:0012:0014:EN:PDF http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/finservices-retail/fsug/fsug_en.htm http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005DC0629:EN:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52009DC0114:EN:NOT  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 4  1.2.6 European Central Bank and Forum on the Security of Retail Payments (SecuRe Pay)  SecuRe Pay was established by the European Central Bank as a voluntary cooperation between  overseers and supervisors of Payment Services Providers (PSPs) aiming at:  - Facilitating common knowledge and understanding with regard to electronic retail payment  services, instruments and PSPs.  - Addressing major security weaknesses and vulnerabilities.  - Issuing harmonized recommendations.  The security recommendations made by SecuRe Pay, as well as the different contributions on  security-related topics received in the different public consultations launched by the Commission  last year will be a valuable input for the Commission in the review of the Payments Services Directive  foreseen for the second half of 2013.  The ECB is also interested in working on security requirements together with the Secure Payment  forum. The SecuRe Pay has issued recommendations for the security of Internet payments, which,  have been published on 31 January 2013 and can be accessed on the ECB’s website15. As future  directions, ECB planned working on secure payments with mobile phones16.  1.2.7 Payment Services Directive  The PSD17 is currently proposing to implement high-level security requirements for the payment  institutions. The new directive is intended to enforce the usage of strong used authentication for  remote payment transactions. As it is stipulated in the Article 87 of the proposed regulation:  \"Member States shall ensure that a payment service provider applies strong customer  authentication when the payer initiates an electronic payment transaction unless EBA guidelines  allow specific exemptions based on the risk involved in the provided payment service.\"  1.3 Motivation  In July 2013 the European Central Bank published its \"Second Report on Card Fraud\"18. This report  contains interesting information regarding the so-called \"Card not Present-Fraud (CNP-Fraud)\",  which, is by far the predominant type of fraud within card payments. Whereas remote transactions  known as \"card not present-transactions\" represent only a share of around 10 % of all card  payments, the share of CNP-Fraud of the total card payments fraud has increased from 47 % in 2007  to 56 % in 2011. Accordingly, the ECB concludes that Internet payments result in higher rates of  fraud. Therefore, in 2011 the European Forum on the Security of Retail Payments, where relevant  public authorities overseeing and supervising payment service providers cooperate voluntarily,  focused its work on developing “recommendations to improve the security of Internet payments\".  These findings have been enforced by further country-specific statistics. The 2012 Annual Report of  the French Observatory for Card Payment Security19 stipulates \"the fraud rate for CNP payments fell  15  http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/recommendationssecurityinternetpaymentsoutcomeofpcfinalversi onafterpc201301en.pdf  16  http://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/cons/pdf/131120/recommendationsforthesecurityofmobilepaymentsdraftp c201311en.pdf  17  Edited by: DG Market H3  18  http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/cardfraudreport201307en.pdf  19  http://www.banque-france.fr/observatoire/telechar/gb/2012/rapport-annuel-OSCP-2012-gb-fraud- statistics-for-2012.pdf  http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/cardfraudreport201307en.pdf http://www.banque-france.fr/observatoire/telechar/gb/2012/rapport-annuel-OSCP-2012-gb-fraud-statistics-for-2012.pdf http://www.banque-france.fr/observatoire/telechar/gb/2012/rapport-annuel-OSCP-2012-gb-fraud-statistics-for-2012.pdf  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 5  to 0.299%, but was still 20 times higher than the rate for face-to-face payments. The fraud rate for  Internet payments, in particular, declined to 0.290% from 0.341% in 2011. A mid sustained growth in  electronic commerce, CNP payments accounted for just 9.2% of the value of domestic transactions  but for 61% of the total amount of fraud (the same as in 2011)\". Similar information can be found for  the UK market, where Financial Fraud Action UK publishes regularly information on fraud in  payments20. CNP fraud is responsible for 63 % of the total fraud in the UK as well. A calculation of  the loss over volume for all payments fraud in UK the ratio is at 7.1 basis points21, whereas the ratio  only for e-commerce fraud is at 20.6 basis points. Total e-commerce fraud losses only in the UK  accounted 2012 already for 140.2 M GBP.  The blooming of Internet technologies has revolutionized the way people transact with their  financial institutions. Nowadays, it is estimated that globally 25% of Internet users, access e-banking  services [1]. Given the surge of mobile technology, and according to a recent report published by  Juniper [2], the number of people that use their mobile device for e-banking and e-financial services  has drastically increased over the past years, i.e. over 590 million mobile users have used their  mobile devices for banking purposes. Meaning that, e-banking users have considerably benefited  from using e-banking services without time and location constraints (‘whenever you want’ and  ‘wherever you are’), which is a compelling proposition to most banking customers. However, due to  the sensitive nature of financial information, security has become a main concern [3], especially  where ciber-fraud estimations range from 300MUSD to 1 billion USD per year22, only in USA. The lack  of proper security measures results in an barrier for the wider adoption of e-banking services.  Current e-banking systems are exposed not only to the set of known threats (now migrating from  traditional PC-based e-banking to the mobile-based scenario), but, to emerging threats, specifically  targeting mobile devices. Cybercrime is increasingly targeting e-banking systems (‘criminals go  where the money is’), and being more and more organised. Nowadays, cybercriminals have the  capabilities to target new technologies and launch attacks of increased sophistication, as in the two  high impact attacks that took place during 2012, and shocked the e-banking sector (the High Roller23  incident and the Eurograbber24 attack). In the High Roller incident [4], 60 million euros were stolen,  while in the Eurograbber attack 36 million euros were stolen and more than 30,000 bank customers  were targeted [5]. Security is, therefore, a major issue, and must be considered, where, the security  level of an e-Banking system is strongly influenced by the customer authentication methods, just as  in the aforementioned incidents, attackers were able to hijack two-factor authentication (e.g. mTAN)  and commit fraud.  Therefore, to be able to provide payment transaction security, and minimize the potential threats, e- banking systems must implement robust identification and authentication (eIDA) mechanisms when  accessing sensitive information or performing risky operations. As a result, e-Banking authentication  continues to draw important attention not only to security professionals, but also to security  20  http://www.financialfraudaction.org.uk/publications/  21  1 basis point = one one-hundredth percent  22  https://www.jpmorgan.com/cm/BlobServer/13th_Annual_2012_Online_Fraud_Report.pdf?blobkey=id&blob where=1320571432216&blobheader=application/pdf&blobheadername1=Cache- Control&blobheadervalue1=private&blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-04/hackers-take-1-billion-a-year-from-company-accounts-banks- won-t-indemnify.html  23  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa-201chigh-roller201d- online-bank-robberies-reveal-security-gaps  24  https://www.checkpoint.com/products/downloads/whitepapers/Eurograbber_White_Paper.pdf  http://www.financialfraudaction.org.uk/publications/ https://www.jpmorgan.com/cm/BlobServer/13th_Annual_2012_Online_Fraud_Report.pdf?blobkey=id&blobwhere=1320571432216&blobheader=application/pdf&blobheadername1=Cache-Control&blobheadervalue1=private&blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs https://www.jpmorgan.com/cm/BlobServer/13th_Annual_2012_Online_Fraud_Report.pdf?blobkey=id&blobwhere=1320571432216&blobheader=application/pdf&blobheadername1=Cache-Control&blobheadervalue1=private&blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs https://www.jpmorgan.com/cm/BlobServer/13th_Annual_2012_Online_Fraud_Report.pdf?blobkey=id&blobwhere=1320571432216&blobheader=application/pdf&blobheadername1=Cache-Control&blobheadervalue1=private&blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-04/hackers-take-1-billion-a-year-from-company-accounts-banks-won-t-indemnify.html http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-04/hackers-take-1-billion-a-year-from-company-accounts-banks-won-t-indemnify.html http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa-201chigh-roller201d-online-bank-robberies-reveal-security-gaps http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa-201chigh-roller201d-online-bank-robberies-reveal-security-gaps https://www.checkpoint.com/products/downloads/whitepapers/Eurograbber_White_Paper.pdf  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 6  managers, decision makers and moreover, security researchers. In [6] authors discussed about  general challenges and issues identified in e-banking systems. Authors of [7] and [8] have presented  an extensive study on e-banking security and introduced a formal definition of e-banking threats and  security models. In [9], the author presents a study on security threats towards proposing the use of  biometrics for strong authentication in e-banking scenarios.  A taxonomy of attacks to e-banking authentication was introduced by authors of [10]. Additionally, a  challenge/response authentication solution was proposed. An assessment of authentication  methods for e-banking was presented by authors of [11], however, the presented study was focused  only on the PC-based scenarios. Although, there are many interesting approaches, the evolution and  sophistication of Internet and mobile attacks require the continuous study of emerging threats,  issues and challenges in e-banking scenarios.  Similar to our study, authors of [12] analysed the eIDA methods used by major banks in English  speaking countries. Nonetheless, their research was limited to data collected by mere observation  (publicly available), contrary to our approach, which analyses these factors, taking into account  current implemented e-banking systems, with information provided by the security professionals of  major European banks.  Finally, our study provides an eIDA methods assessment and a set of recommendations taking into  account the security professionals’ perspective.  1.4 Survey Objectives  The main objective of the survey is to identify electronic Identification & Authentication (eIDA)  mechanisms used in e-Finance and e-Payment services:  - Most relevant One-step mechanisms  - In the e-Banking applications, the application of eID mechanisms to different types of  operations, e.g. read data, modify credentials, money transfer, etc.  - e-Finance professionals are asked to provide additional information about:  o Internal authentication mechanisms, hidden to the customers.  o Rough estimations about the improvements achieved in the fight against identity theft  and cyber-fraud, thanks to the introduction of the authentication mechanisms.  The questions about the estimations of improvements achieved are of two kinds:   Qualitative, i.e. comparing the current situation with respect to the previous one (without  the authentication mechanism)   Quantitative, i.e. providing a range of values of economic losses per user, number and time  of take down of incidents.  In order to get the maximum number of contributions to the survey, the questions do not permit  knowledge of the total loss of the institution, and the identity of the participant in the survey is  completely anonymous, so a disclaimer will recall that the requested information should not be  considered confidential. In addition, ENISA has the mandate of the Commission to collect  information about data breaches and network and information security incidents in critical  infrastructures, with the commitment to keep this information fully confidential, and not to publish  the information in a way that could be associated to any particular stakeholder, industry or  organisation.  The disclaimer concluded saying that: “Nonetheless, if there is any internal policy that prevents to  disclose some information of the organisation related to the quantitative questions, it is always  possible to skip those questions of the survey.”  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 7  2 Types of operations and transactions in eFinance and ePayment services  e-Finance and e-Payment applications allow users to perform different kinds of transactions that can  be categorized according to different factors. In this work, ENISA recognises four types of operations,  each corresponding to a different risk level, partly following eID federation practices, and Data  Protection Authority (DPA) recommendations for data breach criticality evaluation, which should be  considered when assessing the suitability of an eIDA method to authorize an operation.  Thus, one of the aims of this project is to identify:  - How many levels of risk, i.e. types of operation are implemented in the e-Finance applications,  and  - Which authentication mechanisms are used for each type of operation.  The four types of operations identified are the following, sorted from the lower to the highest risk:  1. General customer Information (not financial), low risk operation, which, allows only read access  to basic account information, i.e. personal data of medium sensitivity level, like:  a. Personal data of the customer.  b. Account number(s) only.  2. Account Information (read only), low risk operation, which, allows only read access to personal  and financial data, i.e. personal data of high sensitivity level, like:  a. Personal data of the customer.  b. Account number(s) only.  c. Balance.  d. Transaction History.  e. Account statements.  3. ePayments to known destinations, medium risk operations are those that fulfil the  requirements expressed in KC 7.1 of the ECB report “Recommendations for security of Internet  Payments”: i) outgoing payments to trusted beneficiaries included in previously established  white lists for that customer; ii)  transactions between two accounts of the same customer held  at the same PSP (Payment Service Provider); iii)  transfers within the same PSP justified by a  transaction risk analysis; iv) low-value payments, as referred to in the Payment Services  Directive.  Examples of known destinations could be:  a. Utility / Supplier payments.  b. Some Card Payments.  c. e-Government payments.  d. e-Merchant payments (some well-known ones).  4. Transactions (modify data), high risk operation, which, allows payments to “untrusted”  destinations.  a. Transfers to any destination  b. Card payments / Access credit  c. Insurance polices  d. Managing personal data  e. Investment instruments  f. e-Merchant payments (not-registered ones)  Participants were asked to indicate the operation and transaction type of higher risk that is  authorised by the authentication mechanism that is used. It is assumed that:  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 8  - Mechanisms allowing type 2 are assumed to allow also type 1, and to be a pre-requisite of the  methods required for the other operations (1st step of authentication chain).  - Mechanisms allowing to launch operations of type 4 are assumed to allow also all the lower  levels of risk types (last step of the authentication chain), i.e. all kinds of transactions.  As mentioned above (see 1.1), the new PSD25  doesn’t recognise so many types of operations, and  requires strong authentication for any kind of transaction. As a result, the new directive will force  the usage of so-called \"strong customer authentication\" for any remote payment transaction. Article  4 defines \"strong customer authentication\" in the following way: \"‘strong customer authentication’  means a procedure for the validation of the identification of a natural or legal person based on the  use of two or more elements categorised as knowledge, possession and inherence that are  independent, in that the breach of one does not compromise the reliability of the others and is  designed in such a way as to protect the confidentiality of the authentication data.\".  25  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52013PC0547:EN:NOT  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 9  3 Authentication mechanisms used in eFinance and ePayment services  The process that allows an entity to establish the identity of another entity is known as  authentication. Current eIDA methods are based on some combination of something that you know,  something that you have, and something that you are. When two or more of the aforementioned  elements are combined, this procedure is known as strong authentication (two-factor or multi-factor  authentication).  In the following section, the initial set of the eIDA methods used in this work is introduced, towards  analysing the most common and strong customer authentication implementations used in current e- banking systems.  3.1 eIDA methods used in e-financial and e-banking systems  In the following sections a short description of each authentication mechanism suitable for e- banking and e-financial systems are introduced. These eIDA methods have been included in the  survey, and are categorized according to their type of credentials, as they were shown in the survey.  3.1.1 Password/PIN  An eIDA method based on what you know, and consisting of a combination of a valid and unique  identifier (username) and a secret pass-phrase (password/PIN), where end-users are requested to  enter a private pass-phrase in order to be authenticated. Additionally, two important security  enhancements might be implemented:  - Virtual Keyboard -  consists of a software based keyboard displayed on the screen (to prevent  keyloggers), and  - Partial password (Figure 1), the user is asked to enter only some of the digits or characters from  the PIN/password, a common partial password approach requests different positions for each  session.  Figure 1 Partial password: the user is asked to introduce only 2 of the 6 digits of the PIN (Virtual Keyboard)  3.1.2 Biometrics  An eIDA method based on what you are, i.e. end-users are authenticated through their  characteristics such as body biometry or behavioural biometry (recognition of fingerprint, voice,  face, hand geometry) or behavioural biometry (keystroke dynamics, handwritten signature). Herein  follow some explanations of the most commonly used techniques:  3.1.2.1 Behavioural biometry  Analyses how the user behaves, interacting with the computer:  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 10  3.1.2.1.1 Keystroke dynamics  Also known as typing biometrics, this authentication mechanism uses typing patterns (elapsed time  between pairs of keystrokes) in order to authenticate a user.  3.1.2.1.2 Handwritten Signature  A graphical image of a handwritten signature, or the analysis of the speed of the strokes used to  generate it, is used to authenticate the user.  3.1.2.2 Body biometry  Analyses how the user “is”, i.e. some characteristics of his/her body, that can’t be changed easily:  3.1.2.2.1 Fingerprint recognition  The user’s fingerprint is scanned for the authentication process.  3.1.2.2.2 Voice recognition  This mechanism processes (spectral analysis) the user’s voice in order to verify the identity of the  speaking user.  3.1.2.2.3 Facial recognition  The biometric system scans user’s face and analyses specific facial features/pattern in order to  authenticate her.  3.1.2.2.4 Hand geometry  The geometric shape of the user’s hand is used for verifying his/her identity.  3.1.3 One Time Password (OTP)  This eIDA method is usually based on what you have, and it consists of generating a different, and  essentially random password, known as a One Time Password or OTP that is only valid for one  session or transaction, and it is also referred as dynamic authentication. A typical OTP  implementation is based on one of the following algorithms: event-based OTP, time-based OTP, or  challenge-response OTP. Additionally, OTPs can be delivered in several ways, providing different  benefits in terms of usability, security and costs. Static OTP approaches are commonly based on  TAN26 code lists, while Dynamic OTP approaches include SMS-based OTP, Hardware Token, Software  Token and QR-codes (Quick Response two-dimensional bar code, see section 3.1.3.3.4).  3.1.3.1 TAN code list or coordinates card  The user has a physical document with the list of codes (OTPs) s/he has to use to reply the challenge  from the web banking application, just as shown in Figure 2. The challenges are generated randomly,  and so the corresponding reply looks also random.  26  Transaction Authentication Number  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 11  Figure 2 TAN Code List & Coordinates Card  3.1.3.2 Mobile SMS based  A different random OTP is sent to the user via SMS message to the registered phone number of the  user, each time a transaction requires authentication.  3.1.3.3 Specific Token device  The user has a physical electronic device, which generates a specific Password (OTP) each time the  user requests it. There are different types of devices that may be used for this purpose:  3.1.3.3.1 Hardware (special Token – time based OTP)  The user has a dedicated/special physical electronic device that generates a specific Password (OTP)  each time the user requests it. The generated OTP in this case is a unique value, e.g. a six-digit  number that changes at fixed intervals (for example every minute).  Figure 3 Hardware Token (time based OTP).  In this example the OTP is based only on the calendar time and a private key stored in the device.  3.1.3.3.2 Hardware (special Token – challenge/response OTP)  The user has a dedicated/special physical electronic device that generates a specific Password (OTP)  each time the user requests it. In this case, a challenge-response protocol is used: at first, the web  banking application generates a challenge (e.g. a random number); this challenge has to be typed in  the token, in order to get the correct response for that time; finally, the response is sent back to the  web banking application that will authenticate the user based on the response.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 12  3.1.3.3.3 Mobile OTP Application (Token)  The user has a software application installed on his/her mobile telephone handset that generates a  specific password (OTP) each time the user requests it. The user may need to type in a challenge  code displayed on the computer by the e-Banking application website. Note that, in mobile-based  solutions the registration of the mobile device is highly recommended in order to reduce the  associated security risks that are inherent in mobile devices.  3.1.3.3.4 QR codes  The user scans a two-dimensional bar code of the challenge that is displayed on the screen of the e- Banking application (as shown in Figure 4 ), with the mobile phone handset application, which  generates a specific Password (OTP) based on that challenge. This avoids the user having to re-type  the challenge. It is worth mentioning that the security strength of the token highly depends on the  way it is implemented. In QR codes, the mobile app/mobile device should be authenticated (i.e.  registration to link it to a specific user) to avoid the QR code to be scanned from any malicious  mobile app/device.  Figure 4 QR Code scanner application  3.1.4 e-Signature Certificate  This eIDA method is based on what you have, where end-users are authenticated through e- Signatures. The user’s private key can be stored in: Computer stored key, Mobile phone, USB  memory card, and Crypto-card  3.1.4.1 Local / Computer store of Key  The e-Signature is made using the private key of the user that is stored at his/her computer Hard  Disk.  3.1.4.2 Device stored key  3.1.4.2.1 Memory Token (USB, memory card)  The e-Signature is made using the private key of the user that is stored in a USB or a memory card  (removable memory storage).  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 13  3.1.4.2.2 Chip card token (e-Identity card)  The e-Signature is made using the private key of the user stored in the chip of his/er e-Identity card  or specific smart card (with cryptographic embedded functions).  3.1.4.2.3 Mobile phone  The e-Signature is made using the mobile phone of the user, where the user’s private key is stored.  3.1.5 Device Authentication  If the user accesses the e-Banking service through previously registered/used devices and platforms  or through a specific mobile application for that service, then some authentication steps may be  avoided.  3.1.5.1 Device Registration  The user identity is reinforced through registration of the device(s) that user has used before.  Attempting to access the e-Banking application from a new device, platform or browser will cause a  warming and/or require additional authentication mechanism.  3.1.5.2 Mobile e-Banking Application  The user accesses the e-Banking service from an application, specific for that Service, running on the  mobile telephone handset.  3.2 Context authentication mechanisms used in eFinance and ePayment  services  In this section we provide short explanations for the additional context authentication mechanisms  which are hidden to the customer. They improve the level of confidence of the service provider on  the identity of the customer independently of the user credentials that the customer may have or  know. These mechanisms are normally implemented on the server side, in order to check the  authenticity of the customer, based on the behaviour, location or device used and other parameters  of the operations performed by the user during the interactive session with the service. The users do  not easily recognise these mechanisms during the interaction with the service, so they normally are  not aware that those authentication mechanisms are protecting them from being victims of fraud or  from being impersonated.  The new proposed regulation on data protection (GDPR27) imposes some restrictions on the profiling  of the users. It includes also a \"ban on profiling\", i.e. monitoring of customer transactions may be  only possible with the prior consent of the customer - something which at least theoretically could  affect the possibilities to monitor transaction on potential fraud, that may have an impact on the  right to use these techniques. For this reason, maybe it will be necessary to set up legal notices  advising the user about their implementation.  3.2.1 User behaviour analysis parameters  These parameters are used by the financial services to authenticate users by tracking their overall e- banking operation and transaction history when using/interacting with the service. Thus, through  27  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 14  deviations from expected online behaviour, fraudulent activity can be detected and prevented. This  category of authentication parameters includes:  3.2.1.1 Time between sessions  User’s account/transaction operations may be rejected based on their frequency of access to the  service within a time window.  3.2.1.2 Destination account filter  Based on the user’s transaction history, transactions to account numbers other than those preferred  or most used money transfer destinations for the current user are restricted.  3.2.1.3 Total amount in operations  Based on a user’s profile, if the total amount in operations of this user within a period of time is  above the threshold for that profile, the transaction is rejected.  3.2.1.4 Time of day  Each user interacts with ePayment services and makes transactions in a personalized way, e.g. some  specific times during the day. Thus, the transactions and operations that do not take place within  his/her usual times of the day may be rejected.  3.2.1.5 Keystroke dynamics  This authentication parameter uses typing patterns (elapsed time between pairs of keystrokes) in  order to identify and authenticate a user.  3.2.2 Sessions analysis parameters  These parameters are used to authenticate the user by separately monitoring each of his/her  session. This category of authentication parameters includes:  3.2.2.1 Amount filter  Amount transaction thresholds (bigger than, usual) are derived from the user’s profile. The user’s  transactions that do not comply with these thresholds are rejected/restricted.  3.2.2.2 Blacklisted bank accounts  The financial institution may have a blacklist of bank accounts know to be associated with fraudulent  activities.  3.2.2.3 Time between operations within one session  An average time between user’s operations is compared with the normal value for his/her profile,  which is used to detect abnormal or fraudulent activity. If a malicious program hijacks the identity of  the user then the time between operations could be shorter.  3.2.3 Network analysis parameters  These parameters are used to authenticate users by analysing networking characteristics. This  category of authentication parameters includes:  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 15  3.2.3.1 Whitelisted IP addresses  Current customer IP address is checked against whitelisted IP addresses.  3.2.3.2 Blacklisted IP addresses  The user’s transactions/operations may be rejected because his/her IP address is blacklisted  (commercial blacklists, lists with compromised computer, blacklisted IP addresses due to previous  fraudulent activity, etc.).  3.2.3.3 Anonymous proxy  Transactions from anonymous proxies are rejected since their IP addresses are blacklisted.  3.2.3.4 High risk country classification  A transaction may be rejected if it is carried out from an IP address block that is allocated to a high  risk country.  3.2.3.5 Time between sessions from one source IP address  The transaction/operation activity from a single IP address may be marked as fraudulent or  suspicious if its frequency is high, or if it is used to access several customer accounts.  3.2.3.6 Geographical distance between operations  Current customer IP address geolocation is checked against the last recently used by that customer.  Customer’s transactions and operations may be rejected based on the geographical distance  between them.  3.2.4 Device Authentication  If the user accesses the e-Payment service through a previously registered/used device, or platform,  or browser, then some authentication steps may be avoided.  3.2.4.1 Platform identification  The user identity is reinforced through registration of the platform (mobile device, browser,  operating systems, etc.) that the user has used before. Attempting to access the e-Banking  application from a new device, platform or browser will cause a warning and/or require additional  authentication mechanisms.  3.2.4.2 Storage of user key in a device  The device of the user (e.g. mobile or tablet) is authenticated in order to allow the user to make  transactions and operations storing a security key in the device or mobile phone SIM card.  3.2.5 User Profiling  In this category of contextual analysis mechanisms, some parameters that characterise the  interaction of the users with the service are profiled, and the user behaviour is analysed and  compared against specific patterns of behaviour, i.e. profiles of user. We may have several  approaches, depending on the type and amount of information stored by the server.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 16  3.2.5.1 Single behaviour pattern  User behaviour is analysed only during the current session and it is compared against only one user  profile in the whole system, resulting in users being profiled with a single pattern.  3.2.5.2 Multiple behaviour patterns  User behaviour is analysed only during the current session and it is compared against one of the  several standard user profiles defined in the whole system. Thus, users are associated to one of  those patterns or segments (e.g. company profile, end user profile, investor profile). If the behaviour  of the user in the current session does not match with the profile associated to this user, then the  operations are restricted.  3.2.5.3 Individual behaviour pattern  Users are profiled (their behaviour is analysed) in all sessions, in order to create an individual pattern  for each customer. Thus, an individual user profile (history) is stored in the system and the user’s  current and historical sessions are compared.  3.3  eIDA method Evaluation and selection Factors  This section introduces the list of the proposed selection criteria based on real implementations,  i.e. considered by security professionals, managers and decision makers in e-banking:   Strength, Covered risk and Efficiency to resist potential attacks and the risk they represent  and its sophistication.   Implementation difficulty in terms of technical requirements to be fully deployed and  functional.   Absolute loss and Reduction of Loss per involved customer   Yearly Frequency and Reduction of the number of security incidents, successful attacks per  year, regardless of the number of customers affected by each of them.   Usability: the authentication mechanism’s quality of being user-friendly and closer to user  needs and requirements.   Implementation cost: the cost impact of the eIDA methods implementation effort.   Adequacy to user segment: The eIDA method quality of being able to meet a user segment’s  needs and expectations. Categorizing user segments is an important task when assessing the  suitability of an eIDA method implementation. Thus, in this section we propose a generic  categorization that identifies different user segments. Note, that not all financial institutions  might include all of the propose user segments; there exist those institutions aimed at only  one of them.  o Retail: personal banking or consumer banking, aimed at regular customers making  low amount transactions.  o Private: personal banking with special needs, i.e. customers making large amount  transactions.  o Corporate/Business: aimed at companies/enterprises.  o Investor: aimed at users managing investment tools.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 17  3.4 Survey questions  The survey was intended to be used on-line28, where the participants were asked to select the  authentication mechanisms that they use. The survey was addressed to two communities:  - End user associations’ representatives and e-commerce Merchants, who were asked to  answer questions only about the first set of authentication mechanisms described above.  - e-Finance institutions IT security professionals, who were asked to answer the survey split in  two parts, one for the Transparent authentication mechanisms described above, and a  second one for the Context authentication mechanisms, also described above. Then, for  every one of the selected mechanisms, the participants were asked to reply some questions  in order to provide their view about the strength, usability, efficiency and improvements  achieved using those mechanisms.  Concerning the questions about the estimations of improvements achieved, they were of two kinds  as stated in Section 1.4: Qualitative and quantitative.  The Annex II collects the screenshots of the survey, which show all the authentications mechanisms  (Part I of the survey), as well as the additional context authentication mechanisms (Part II of the  survey) for which, participants were asked to provide input. Participants should answer a set of  related questions for each of the selected mechanisms.  28 Survey Web site: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/surveys/professionals-survey  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/surveys/professionals-survey  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 18  4 Threat analysis  This section introduces the Threat Landscape of the identified threats relevant to eIDA method as  shown in Figure 5. The most relevant threats and attack scenarios concerning online banking  authentication, especially those regarding its ICT infrastructure are then introduced in the following  sections.  The report ETL29 (ENISA Threat Landscape) collects a more complete analysis of cyber-threats, risks  and threat agents, including general threats (e.g. botnets, IP spoofing) not described here to avoid  duplications. This section collects only those threats directly related to authentication methods used  by citizen in e-Finance applications.  4.1 Threat Categorization  A categorization of threats based on the component/asset attacked has been adopted from the  approach that has been proposed by C. Dimitriadis [7].  4.1.1 Threats against end-users  a. Physical observation/surveillance: End-users may be subjected to shoulder surfing, filming  of their keyboard or recording of keyboard acoustic and electromagnetic emanations. Thus,  by being surveyed, the credentials of the end users can be captured or even stolen (e.g. theft  of written down passwords).  b. Social engineering: through non-technical means, the user’s credentials can be  compromised, e.g. knowledge of personal details of the user, user impersonation and  claimed identity during registration, phone calls, etc.  c. Phishing: end-users may be victims of traditional phishing email campaigns or highly  targeted spear-phishing ones. Furthermore, given mostly the proliferation of mobile devices  and social networks, phishing has evolved and heterogeneous phishing campaigns (text  messages-SMiShing (SMS phishing), malicious links from online social networks, fake mobile  applications - app-based phishing, voice phishing (vishing) have arisen.  4.1.2 Threats against end-users’ devices  The below mentioned threats primarily target the devices of end users (e.g. PC, mobile device,  tokens, etc.):  a. Physical theft of token or device: End-users may be victims of theft of their token device  and their mobile device (or even the piece of paper with their passwords written down).  b. Tampering (or replication) of token or device: PIN brute force attacks, side channel attacks  and hardware keyloggers are some attack examples of this threat.  c. Malicious software (malware): Malware authors increasingly target online banking.  Malicious code with rootkit features, i.e. as Man-in-the-Browser (MitB), and mobile banking  trojans which can hijack two-factor authentication, i.e. Man-in-the-Mobile (MitMo), are the  most prominent threats for e-banking identity theft and fraud  29  ETL 2013: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa- threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 19  4.1.3 Threats against communication networks  These threats target the communication channel between end users and the remote banking server.  a. Pharming30: Attackers may target the network infrastructure (specifically routers and DNS  servers) and redirect end users to illegitimate websites, i.e. users are redirected to a  malicious URL while having entered the correct one in the address bar.  b. Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking31: This threat category includes network-based and  server-based man-in-the-middle attacks. Banking credentials, transaction data, OTPs and  other sensitive data can be captured through erroneously trusted fake SSL certificates,  passive traffic monitoring (sniffing), replay attacks, as well as active man-in-the-middle  attacks.  4.1.4 Threats against remote banking services.  These threats target the ICT infrastructure of the bank that hosts the web banking service and the  respective data stored.  a. Web code injections against banking servers: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities of the web- banking server through SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery,  redirection to a malicious URL and other web exploitation techniques. The adversaries  placing such attacks try to extract data such as credentials.  b. Denial of service attacks (DoS): Brute force DoS attacks against online banking server do not  pose a direct threat to the components of the end users’ authentication process.  Nevertheless, DoS attacks can be launched as a diversion as part of a larger attacks and can  be reinforced by the misuse of open DNS resolvers.  c. Bank data breaches: bank internal or external threat agents as well as third parties can  compromise sensitive information (e.g. end users’ credentials, account information, social  security numbers etc.)  4.2 Attack patterns  This section presents common attack scenarios implemented in real world attacks.  4.2.1 Attack scenarios  Typical attack scenarios and methodologies based on current malware trends for e-banking are  introduced next.  4.2.1.1 Phishing attack scenario  As stated by Kaspersky32, in 2012-2013, 37.3 million users suffered from phishing attacks, 20% of  which targeted the banking and financial sector. Concerning the mobile platforms, Trend Micro  reports that 75% of mobile phishing URLs were rogue versions of banking and financial services.  Thus, given the large use of mobile devices and the growing threat of mobile e-banking phishing, we  present below such an attack scenario:  30  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharming  31  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Network_Eavesdropping - -  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_hijacking_attack  32  http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/press/2013/Kaspersky_Lab_report_37_3_million_users_experienced _phishing_attacks_in_the_last_year  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharming https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Network_Eavesdropping https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_hijacking_attack  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 20  - First, the user receives the phishing email and since he has 24/7 connectivity with their  mobile he opens his mailbox.  - The message sender is spoofed and pretends to be the e-banking service requesting the user  to update his account information by providing a malicious link.  - Upon clicking the malicious link, the user accesses the legitimate-looking e-banking service  and is lured to give his/her e-banking credentials and in some cases other sensitive  information (e.g. email credentials, government-issued identity card, passport, etc.).  4.2.1.2 Man-in-the-Browser attack scenario  MitB attacks are of increasing sophistication, hard to detect and can be highly customized for a  specific target financial institution. As stated by RSA33, MitB attacks are conducted by many financial  Trojan families (personified by Zeus and SpyEye, which are also available for mobile devices) and  their prevalence is widespread. The latter is being reinforced by the existence of many infection  vectors: malicious email attachments, drive-by downloads, online social networks, infected  removable media, etc. In a Man-in-the-Browser attack:  - The malware is hosted in user’s PC or mobile device and is waiting for the user to access the  online banking server.  - When the user successfully logs in his online banking service, the malware exits stealth  mode and hijacks the online session of the user.  - At this time, the malware can:  a) simply log user’s submitted credentials  b) modify in real time transaction content (i.e. amount and destination account) or  c) insert additional transactions to mule accounts.  - Finally, malware modified or added transactions are made invisible to the user and the  online banking application.  a) On the one hand, the user is deceived by means of social engineering techniques: by  pretending unavailability of the e-banking service and by displaying the legitimate  transaction (instead of the fraudulent one) or a fake account balance, etc.  b) On the other hand, the online banking service cannot detect the aforementioned  fraudulent transactions due to the fact that any activity seems to have been  performed by the user’s browser.  4.2.1.3 Man-in-the-Mobile attack scenario  Man-in-the-Mobile attacks are the natural evolution of Man-in-the-Browser ones, specifically  targeting mobile devices browsers.  4.2.2 Real attack incidents  In this subsection, we present the attack methodology of two high impact real attack incidents  targeting e-banking services that took place during 2012.  4.2.2.1 The High Roller attack scenario  The first stage of High Roller attack34 [4] is a combination of phishing and man-in-the-browser  scenarios.  33  http://viewer.media.bitpipe.com/1039183786_34/1295277188_16/MITB_WP_0510-RSA.pdf  34  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa-201chigh-roller201d- online-bank-robberies-reveal-security-gaps  http://viewer.media.bitpipe.com/1039183786_34/1295277188_16/MITB_WP_0510-RSA.pdf  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 21   Attackers used online reconnaissance in order to gather information and send specifically  crafted and highly targeted emails to bank customers with high balance accounts.   Then, using spear phishing as the attack vector, attackers managed to install their malicious  code in victims’ PCs.   The malware was triggered when the user started an e-banking session and injected  requests for additional authentication information (e.g. TAN used in two factor  authentication schemes).   While the user was waiting to be authenticated, the malware had already initiated a silent  fraudulent transaction to a mule account35.   Finally, the malware had the ability to hide the fraudulent transactions (e.g. false account  balance) from the logged-in user.  4.2.2.2 The Eurograbber attack scenario  A high impact attack of this kind was the Eurograbber incident which was made public during  December 2012. As reported36, 36 million Euros were stolen from more than 30,000 bank victim  customers in Netherlands, Spain and Germany. The attackers targeted both PC and mobile devices  of the users in order to hijack two-factor authentication (SMS-based OTP is commonly used in  Europe) and make fraudulent transactions. The anatomy of the Eurograbber attack was the  following [5]:  - Firstly, the user’s PC is infected with a variation of Zeus Trojan malware through malicious  email attachment or through a drive-by download.  - The malware hosted by the infected PC remains in stealth mode until the user accesses his  banking website.  - Using social engineering techniques (i.e. bank security upgrade), the malware lures the user  to give his/her mobile phone number.  - As soon as attackers receive the customer’s mobile phone number, they send a SMS  including a malicious link for downloading a mobile banking security application.  - Upon installation of this application, attackers have infected both PC and mobile device of  the user.  - Thus, when the user logs in to his banking account, the PC-malware component initiates a  fraudulent transaction to a mule account while the mobile-malware component receives the  SMS authentication code and sends it to the attacker.  35  An account to which fraudsters transfer funds from the compromised account  36  https://www.checkpoint.com/products/downloads/whitepapers/Eurograbber_White_Paper.pdf  https://www.checkpoint.com/products/downloads/whitepapers/Eurograbber_White_Paper.pdf  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 22  Figure 5 Threat Landscape  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 23  5 Survey analysis  The categorization of Operations, Authentication methods and Threats, described in Section 2,  Section 1.1 and Section 4 respectively, has been proposed mainly to support the survey addressed to  security professionals in the e-financial sector. The survey objectives were to identify the eIDA  methods currently used in online banking services and identify: usability and costs for operation  types and customer segments, perceived strength and qualitative information about measured risk  parameters, and improvement achieved. As it has been previously remarked, the survey was  distributed and conducted by ENISA, with participation of members of the APWG.EU, CaixaBank, and  Merchant Risk Council (MRC), and distributed to security professionals of the financial sector  through SecuRe Pay, EU FI-ISAC, ECB, and EPC, and users’ representatives through the MRC and the  FSUG.  5.1 Current practices  Amongst the above mentioned eIDA methods (Section3.1), only those shown in Figure 6 have been  widely adopted. Figure 6, presents the most common eIDA methods implemented in e-banking and  the type of operation (according to categories described in Section 2) associated with each method.  As can be observed, the weakest methods on the left are mostly used for non-risk operations, and  the safest ones to authorize risky transfers. Survey results show that in many cases the professionals  that answered it, did not make considerable differences between operations types 1&2, and  something similar happened with operation types 3&4.  Figure 6 eIDA methods implementation for each operation type  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 24  5.2 Applicability of identified Threats to eIDA methods  Table 1 presents the applicability of the identified threats (according to categories described in  Section 4.1) to the different eIDA methods. It has been assessed taking into account common  practices in e-banking, recent literature [7], [11], and real world attack scenarios.

Threats are described in section 4.1 above  37 . Applicability ranges from 1:  Not Applicable to 5: Highly Applicable  The most noticeable points arising from Table 1 are:   Most of the identified threats are highly applicable to the Username/password eIDA  method.   Moreover, only malicious code (i.e. threat 2c) and bank data breach (i.e. threat 4c) are  applicable to all eIDA methods.   Physical attacks against devices or tokens (i.e. threat 2a) are mostly applicable to the OTP  and eSignature eIDA methods categories.   Tampering of devices, (i.e. threat 2b) applicability depends on the robustness of the device.   Finally, phishing (i.e. threat 1c) apart from being applicable to Username/password and TAN  code list is also applicable to the OTP eIDA method category.  37  Summary of Threat Categories described in 4.1:  1 Threats against end-users.  a) Physical observation. b) Social engineering:. c) Phishing:  2 Threats against end-users’ devices.  a) Physical theft of token or device. b) Tampering (or replication) of token or device. c) Malicious  software (malware)  3 Threats against communication networks.  a) Pharming. b)Eavesdropping, Interception and Hijacking.  4 Threats against remote banking services.  a) Web Code injections against banking server. b).

This perception of security  professionals is summarised in Figure 7 Professional’s perceived strength, usability and cost.  The comparison of Figure 6 and Figure 7 confirms the well-known feeling that a common practice in  the financial sector consists of giving priority to usability over other criteria. The eIDA methods  considered more usable are also those financial institutions do implement more. The exception is  the Mob. Phone e-Signature, because there were few responses of professionals reporting having  used it, and for this reason, the statistical accuracy of that data is not very good. Nevertheless, we  have kept it because it’s an emerging authentication system well evaluated by the professionals that  already have implemented it. Figure 7 also shows the tendency lines of implementation factors  cheapness and strength, green and blue respectively. In general the weaker the eIDA methods are,  the cheaper to implement, except in the e-signature based eIDA methods, which, being the stronger  ones, are perceived as cheaper to implement than other weaker methods.  The usability restriction for implementing stronger eIDA method should be avoided through  adequate training and awareness of customers. The adoption strategy and the “user experience”  through adequate developments should also be improved.  Figure 7 Professional’s perceived strength, usability and cost  5.4 Adequacy of eIDA methods selection criteria  The survey asked the participants to indicate the criteria (several) that made them choose the  implementation of one eIDA method in preference to others. The identified selection criteria were:  - Adequacy to one or several customer segment.  - Usability from the point of view of the customer, provided their skills and professional  profile.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 26  - Covered Risk, i.e. the capability of the eIDA method to prevent the success of known threats  to the e-Banking authentication system.  - Efficiency of the investment, it is a more abstract concept, because combines both Risk  reduction achieved by the eIDA method and the implementation Cost.  - Implementation cost, the answers reflect that the participants have taken into consideration  the number of customers in the segment or profile to which the eIDA method is addressed.  - Implementation easiness, the survey shows that this is not a criterion to implement a eIDA  method.  According to the set of criteria used to select the implementation of one eIDA method in a given  environment, three groups of patterns have been identified. Figure 8 shows the relative relevance of  the different selection criteria for implementing eIDA methods for the low, medium and high  strength groups of operations respectively. In each group, the specific selection criteria for that  group have been encircled in blue. In the group of medium strength, the criteria that show the  difference with the low strength group of eIDA methods have been encircled in yellow, and those  criteria become the most important to select the stronger eIDA methods. The user segment whose  preferences attract more the attention for the selection of most of the authentication mechanisms is  the “retail customers”.  For the authentication mechanisms most suitable for low and medium risk operations the adequacy  to the retail customers and the usability are the dominant criteria. This means that the professionals  participating in the survey declared that they implemented the authentication (eIDA) mechanism  due to their feeling that it was more adequate to one or several customer segments, being the  “retail” segment the one reported more times, as well as other parameters of the eIDA methods.  Most of the participants indicated that several criteria were used to justify the implementation of  one authentication mechanism, being the usability the parameter selected most times, but not the  single one, e.g. the cost is also important in the selection of the eIDA method for the low risk  operations (see Figure 8 below).  The mechanisms suitable for intermediate risk operations are implemented due to its usability and  adequacy to the requirements of most of the users, and also by its efficiency and covered risk.  For the authentication mechanisms that look more adequate for riskier operations the covered risk  replaces the usability as top selection criteria, and more attention is paid to the corporate and  private bank customers.  All eIDA methods involving the use of hardware tokens are more suitable for corporate, private and  investor customer segments (Section 3.3). Distribution costs and usability (another device to be  carried) drawbacks are less relevant for those customer segments, because the number of  customers is significantly lower (<1% of retail users), and they are more conscious of their  transactional risk, thus, accepting stronger eIDA methods to be applied. New kinds of token devices  are now emerging, able to improve usability, e.g. token in credit card format; however, the  associated costs, are even higher, reducing the profile of the customers to which they could be  offered.  Circled in blue, are the most relevant criteria for each strength group, and in yellow the criteria that  show more changes, comparing the responses given to eIDA methods of each of the 3 groups. The  fact that the eIDA methods with lower strength are selected principally because of their usability,  and the stronger ones because of the covered risk, confirms the quality of the responses stating the  perceived strength.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 27  Figure 8 Comparison of criteria used to Select eIDA methods of Low (up), Medium (left) and High (right) Strength  The relationship between selection criteria and perceived strength is shown in Figure 9 below. This  figure shows some aspects of the responses that are worthy of comment, highlighted with yellow  ellipses:  - Mobile banking Application and Mobile OTP are selected for their Efficiency rather than for  the covered Risk.  - TAN code list is considered quite well in terms of covered risk, whilst it gets the worst  estimation of Efficiency.  - The discrepancy is even larger in all OTP eIDA methods, they are selected for the covered  Risk and not for their efficiency, probably because of the relative high cost of adopting them.  Those methods, together with the USB e-Signature, are considered the methods covering  more Risks, and are selected for this reason.  - The e-Signature eIDA methods are those considered more efficient than any other did.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 28  Figure 9 eIDA methods Selection criteria vs Perceived strength  5.5 eIDA methods Risk Reduction benefits  Figure 10 shows the summary of the survey participants reported loss and loss reduction per user  and incident, and the number of incidents associated with each eIDA method.  The most frequently used eIDA methods have also the higher risk, because they attract the interest  of criminals to research and develop more sophisticated attack patterns and tools, since they will be  applicable to more customers.  It is worth highlighting that the absolute loss reduction figures are per user involved in an incident.  The methods that show higher reduction of loss are also those that have been identified as having  higher loss per incident and user. This is because in general they are also considered stronger (OTP  based methods) and for this reason used to authorise operations of high value, so if they are faked  the loss for the user is high, but the graphic also shows that the number of incidents for the  strongest eIDA methods is very low. A special case are the Username/Password and Virtual  Keyboard, which are considered to introduce a surprisingly relative large loss reduction, but with  relative high Loss per user and incident, and large number of incidents per year (12 and 17).  The opposite case is the Token (USB, memory card) e-Signature, with relatively large number of  incidents and very low loss for each, because of the difficulty to use the token by other person rather  than the owner, and because this method is also used for low risk operations, in many cases as first  authentication method to log into the service.  In general, the results of the survey show that the lower number of incidents corresponds also to the  less implemented methods; mostly those based on mobile handset token OTP or e-signature.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 29  Figure 10 Reported incidents, loss and loss reduction  One factor that is not considered in this analysis is the customer skill. This is probably the reason  why the TAN code method is the one with more incidents reported per year, which, added to the  fact that, in some institutions it is used to grant access to riskiest transactions, it makes the actual  loss per incident relatively large also, resulting in the large Risk already mentioned.  Another perspective of the answers given in the survey is shown in Figure 11, where it is possible to  confirm that the riskiest eIDA methods are those used by a larger number of customers. They are  also those providing a larger reduction of loss, about 10% (notice that the pre-authentication Risk is  10 times larger than shown in the bars, to make uniform the ranges of values of both data sets). The  eIDA methods that provide more than 10% of loss reduction are:   e-Signature (mainly phone and chip stored key)   OTP (Challenge/Resp. token and SMS based)   Username/Password, probably because of the estimation of potential loss that could be  reached if the unsuccessful attempts to break the password would be successful.  Figure 11 Risk reduction  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 30  6 Risk analysis guidelines  The threats introduced in Section 4.1 have a different impact on the target environment, also  depending on the actor involved, e.g. a threat to the communication channel of a e-Banking service  represents a greater impact than what can be achieved if the victim is a retail customer. Thus, an ad- hoc Risk Analysis of the target environment is recommended. Moreover, in terms of  implementation, a definition of security aims - in accordance with the identified risk categories and  the access rights granted to the customer- should be taken into consideration within the Risk  Analysis. Considering that, when it comes to securing e-payments, there might be a difference  concerning security aims depending on the perspective of the stakeholder. Whereas an individual  bank would judge its security investments based on some business case considerations (i.e.  comparing the cost of payment for damages with the cost of preventing fraud), while a payment  system or a central bank, which is responsible for trust and security of the overall payment system  may have a different view.  Therefore, in accordance with the current regulatory proposals38 and with the aim to increase  efficiency of payment systems, additional considerations on the security aims for the various  transaction types should be taken into account. To give some examples:   for account information services relevant security aims could be to safeguard personal customer  information from unauthorized access;   for payments the security aim from a societal perspective would most likely be to support the  ‘finality of payment’ (i.e. the payment is irrevocable and legally enforceable) and ‘non- repudiation’ (i.e. the payment cannot successfully be disputed afterwards by the originator) in  order to withstand legal dispute.  The result of the survey shows that the most frequently used selection criteria for the authentication  mechanisms are the strength and the usability of a mechanism, with different weights depending on  the number and profile of the users, and the risk associated to the operations normally performed  by those users. However, given the above-mentioned regulation, which is coming into effect in the  coming years, some financial institutions may shift the criteria to merely: “comply with regulation”,  therefore an analysis with a detailed judgement on what will comply and what will not can be of  great benefit.  For this reason financial institutions should be encouraged to perform a quantitative risk analysis,  based on the actual data of number of incidents, customers involved and average loss per customer  in the organisation. Those fraud costs should be introduced in the calculation of the cost of non- implementing the authentication mechanisms, and compare that cost with the cost of implementing  them. The results of the survey show that most of the security experts of the financial institutions  have that information, but it is not taken into consideration in the decision process for the selection  of eIDA methods.  One good practice to improve and guarantee the ROSI (Return of Security Investment) could be to  make the risk analysis tailored to different customer profiles in the institution. This is important for  two reasons:  1. Some threats like spear phishing are targeting customers with large balances on their  accounts, so the impact of those attacks will be high on them. But application of  countermeasures to customers with other profiles, not targeted by them, would be useless.  38  European Directive on Payment Services , PSD: http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/framework/  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 31  2. The loss reduction and the number of incidents associated to an authentication mechanism  are also linked to the profile of the customer using it. The most qualified customers are  more likely to take care and appreciate the robustness of more sophisticated and stronger  authentication mechanisms, whilst customers perceiving less risk of being victims of an  attack or having losses in their accounts, would not take adequate care and may easily be  victims of credential steal or replication. The cost of introducing those kinds of measures to  unaware customers will be more expensive than introducing it to aware ones, because it  should include the cost of launching adequate awareness campaigns. Moreover, the loss  reduction will also be different, because the number of incidents per user and the loss per  user and incident will be linked to the consciousness of the customers and the kind of  operations they perform regularly through e-Banking applications.  All those considerations will result on different ROSI depending on the profile of the user  (awareness, kind of transactions, account balance, etc.), and the number of customers of that profile  in the financial institution. Another important aspect mentioned by some reviewers of this report is  the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). So far, the policy of many institutions has been to recover  customers’ losses, at least partially. But the new regulation of Data Protection will oblige them to  disclose threats if the number of victims or the impact on them is high, so it will not be so easy to  avoid damages to the public image of the institution, and the benefit of covering the losses of the  customers will not be so evident. Then the single way to preserve the image of the institution will be  to prevent the success of the attacks, introducing the potential loss of qualified customers if the  security mechanisms offered by the financial institution prove to be weak to protect the interests  and assets of the customers. In addition, the national central banks are appealing to the CSR of the  banks to protect the citizens and keep the fraud statistics in the country within “acceptable”  boundaries, compared with other countries.  In the next two sections there are some analysis to specific emerging authentication mechanisms.  6.1 Biometrics adoption related risks  The results of the survey show that very few professionals incorporate biometrics as an eIDA  method solution for e-banking. The rationale behind this phenomenon is that institutions must be  able to comply with the GDPR. There exist legal issues when dealing with personal information  (different legislation for every country). In Europe, a specific authorization from customers is  required, which is a difficult task, since the majority of people do not feel comfortable with granting  permission on the storage of their biometric information (i.e. personal body patterns). This, in  general, is only manageable if a strong juridical base exists and the use is adequate, relevant and not  abusive in correspondence with the goals and reasons for biometric data to be collected, used or  saved, resulting in an important challenge to be addressed.  Moreover, there exist high associated risks, mainly due to the potential attacks to a centralised data  base storage of biometrics parameters. The risk of compromise of the biometric information DB  (even if it’s encrypted, hashed, etc.) is real and non-acceptable for CISOs and directors of the e- banking sector. The sensitive nature of biometric information: data is compromised forever (i.e. it’s  not possible to change the hand print, Iris, fingerprints, etc.), resulting in both high risk, and great  responsibility to be accepted, especially if other eIDA methods are suitable.  Another important factor is the usability, since current technologies do not provide 100% of  accuracy at the first try. There are still open issues related to the False Rejection Rate (FRR) and the  False Acceptance Rate (FAR), which remain open even in scientific experiments or proof of concepts.  In summary, because of the associated risks, the financial sector is still not prepared to use biometry  neither as a unique authentication factor nor a second authentication factor.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 32  Biometry is used in emerging countries, where there are no other means of unique identification of  the persons, due to lack of governmentally supported credentials, and also in countries where  Personal Data protection is not a priority, like it is in EU.  Specialists are working in finding a solution to the high risk associated to using the biometry, and  one solution that is being analysed and starting to be implemented is the local storage of biometric  identification profiles. This has three advantages: 1) the responsibility of the storage is transferred to  the end user, 2) the chances of a successful threat to steal large amount of biometric information is  low, because the threat should be successful on many devices and stores, 3) the biometric  identification vector doesn’t have to travel over the network.  6.2 Mobile phones related risks  Advances in mobile technology, currently allow the use of mobile devices in a wide range of services  and applications. An important reason for involving mobile phones in authentication systems such as  OTP systems, is that, most users already have one, and therefore, no extra hardware needs to be  bought, deployed or supported. Moreover, since a mobile phone is considered a highly personal  device, the number of incidents due to losing it are relatively low, especially compared with the  hardware token devices.  The most common authentication solution involving mobile devices is the SMS-based OTP. A user  willing to make an online transaction will receive an OTP from the server. The OTP will be delivered  to the mobile device on an SMS. As it can be observed from this study the SMS-based OTP is one of  the most implemented authentication methods by the financial sector, nevertheless, SMS-based  OTP also convey clear disadvantages, which include, the associated costs, roaming, latency and more  importantly the associated security risks, SMS-based OTPs are vulnerable to a different attacks, such  as, the Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. The “Eurograbber” incident (see 4.2.2.2) showed how  two factor authentication based on SMS-OTP was circumvented, resulting in a 36 Million Euros loss.  To avoid this threat customers and e-Banking applications should avoid displaying phone numbers  associated to the bank account through Internet, whether displayed or modified, even with assumed  secure communication channel. Adequate training on this sense has to be launched to both of them.  An alternative to the SMS-OTP is the Mobile phone e-Signature, which greatly reduces the possibility  of a successful MITM attack since credentials are protected in the secure element (SE) of the mobile  phone. However, the majority of SE implementations rely on a third party, which does not provide a  suitable solution to stakeholders such as the financial institutions, as they would certainly like to  have more autonomous and cost effective solutions for their mobile payments implementations.  Moreover, the limited size of physical SE dramatically affects the number of applications that could  be placed in those SE. Financial institutions should promote joint ventures with the organisations  that manage the content of those SE, in order to improve the trustworthiness between them.  Another currently implemented solution is the mobile e-banking application, which is able to provide  enhanced security if a private key is installed. However due to the nature of mobile devices,  important security risks are also present, such as malware hosted on fake applications. Moreover,  the development of applications is not always aligned with current security best practices. Best  practices like “security by design”, secure storage and all actors involved in the process must  guarantee delivery and integrity of applications: software developers, financial institutions and  customers.  Following the same direction, an emerging solution is the mobileOTP, which consists on iinstalling  the software tokens on the mobile phone. A key advantage of the mobile software token is that  there are no new devices for customers, since customers already own the device, which they already  carry everywhere. Another advantage regarding the mOTP solution is the ability for the software  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 33  tokens to be distributed and updated immediately, and without logistical planning, since the mOTP  token consists of an application that only need to be loaded on the mobile device. Thus, mOTP have  become a more reliable deployment method than hardware tokens, nevertheless, as in mobile e- banking application, the software tokens also inherit the same security vulnerabilities from the  mobile phone. In fact mOTP could be considered a particular case of mobile e-Banking application.  Many organisations use mobile phones as support for the second authentication factor. Mobile  phones may be considered “something the user possesses” for the purpose of implementation of  two-factor authentication, from the technical perspective. However, from the legal perspective,  mobile devices cannot necessarily be acceptable for attributing a specific transaction to its  originator. For that purpose, e-signature tools have to be used, and they can be implemented in  mobile devices or PCs. The mobile device on its own is not able to deliver evidence that a specific  transaction could only have occurred with the approval of the legitimate owner of the mobile, it  requires specific software and adequately installed private key to do so.  In summary, mobile device is an emerging authentication solution that can be seen as “something  the user has”, when using it for identification purposes. Nevertheless, for attributing a specific  operation to its originator, it’s not able to provide enough non-repudiation evidence that a specific  operation has been performed by the owner of the device.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 34  7 Recommendations / Best practices guidelines  This section introduces the main challenges found in our research, and, to overcome these  challenges, a set of recommendations are proposed. The recommendations are grouped in  Challenges, which express the main objectives to be achieved by the recommendations grouped  there.  Those recommendations have been  7.1 Challenge: Promote Adequacy of eIDA method to Context  The selection of an eIDA method should be done considering the full context of the operation and,  users segments.  7.1.1 Rec.1: eIDA method Selection proportionality  e-Finance Authentication mechanisms strength have to be proportional to the Risk associated to  the operations they grant access.  When customers interact with the e-Banking service, they may perform operations of different level  of risk (Section 2 above):  1. General information,  2. Read account balance,  3. E-Payments: Low-risk or low-value Transfers, as defined in the PSD.  4. Transactions: Transfers of funds not matching level 3 requirements.  Figure 6 shows the current practices in the sector.  7.1.2 Rec.2. Use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) for medium to high-risk transactions.  For medium and high risk operations, a strategy of using at least two authentication mechanisms  that are mutually independent, where one is non-replicable and other non-reusable, exchanging  credentials through different communication channels or devices should be implemented. Non-re- usability may be implemented by linking the authentication (e.g. OTP challenge) to the amount  and payee of every transaction.  Many organisations use mobile phones as support for the second authentication factor. The  adequacy of the authentication mechanisms for low, medium or high risky operations is described in  section 5.4 above. It shows that the selection criteria used by the financial institutions already takes  into consideration the different profiles of customers as well as the efficiency and strength of the  eIDA method proposed. The aim of this recommendation is to shift the criteria to select the eIDA  method used for medium level of strength: from its usability, to its covered risk and efficiency in  protecting customers’ assets.  Most banks already apply more than one authentication mechanism to grant access to different  types of operations. Currently most used combinations are PWD, sometimes with additional security  improvement methods like Virtual Keyboard, complemented with: SMS OTP (29%), TAN (25%), Hw.  OTP (18%), MeBA (11%), Mob. OTP (9%), Chall.Hw OTP (8%), whilst other combinations are also  reported. Figure 12  shows the relative weight of the different combinations of authentication  mechanisms reported in the survey through the size of the circles.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 35  Figure 12 Combination of eIDA methods in authentication chains  1. From these observations, it’s worth to highlight that: Accepted common practice for Read  Access operations (not access to sensitive data39) is to use at least Password, Improved with  some additional mechanism(s), e.g. virtual keyboard or Mobile e-Banking App (MeBA),  depending on which kind of device is used by the customer for main (first) access.  2. The Recommendation for medium and high Risky Operations/Transactions is to Involve a 2nd  device or something the user has40, e.g.: mobile phone handset41, TAN code list42, eSign  private key, hardware token OTP. The actual implemented method on each environment  takes into consideration the perceived usability, mainly for the eIDA methods implemented  for retail customer segment, but the stronger methods should have priority in the selection  39  DPA have defined what is sensitive financial data  40 This recommendation is shared with the ECB SecuRe Pay forum, which in their “Recommendations for the  security of internet payments” (published on 31 January 2013 on  http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/recommendationssecurityinternetpaymentsoutcomeofpcfinalv ersionafterpc201301en.pdf) states: “Strong customer authentication is a procedure based on the use of  two or more of the following elements – categorised as knowledge, ownership and inherence: i) something  only the user knows, e.g. static password, code, personal identification number; ii) something only the user  possesses (Strong authentication element), e.g. token, smart card, mobile phone; iii) something the user is,  e.g. biometric characteristic, such as a fingerprint. In addition, the elements selected must be mutually  independent, i.e. the breach of one does not compromise the other(s). At least one of the elements should  be non-reusable and non-replicable (except for inherence), and not capable of being surreptitiously stolen  via the internet. The strong authentication procedure should be designed in such a way as to protect the  confidentiality of the authentication data”.  41  It is considered a common feeling amongst experts that mobile devices are “something the customer has”.  Some people consider the mobile handset an object of more ownership than even a credit card, because it  is less frequently left “unattended”. Security of mobile phone devices has been analysed in section 6.2.  42  Some experts consider questionable to qualify TAN code lists as ownership, because of its easiness to be  replicated. The impact of this threat can be minimised with complementary security measures, like  adequate user training against phishing, awareness about risks of replicating and leaving unattended the  TAN code list, “secure delivery” to the customer, etc.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 36  process. On top of this, the actual risk in the environment of the financial institution should  be measured (see justification in section 6 Risk analysis guidelines and Recommendation in  7.3.1 Rec5. Environment risk analysis).  7.2 Challenge: Improve the knowledge and the behaviour of customers and  professionals  7.2.1 Rec3. Professionals’ training and awareness  Continuous training of professionals, to improve their perception of the actual risk associated to  the e-Finance transactions, and the authentication mechanisms, keeping in mind the last threat  patterns discovered by criminals. Professionals should also share their awareness with customers,  to keep them continuously informed about incidents caused by common threats such as phishing or  social engineering.  From the result of the survey, comparing the perceived strength, the reported number of incidents  and average loss per incident, it looks like the professionals had a “feeling” that does not correspond  with the data they report. E.g., Figure 9 shows that TAN code strength perception is at the same  level as mobile phone signature or OTP, whilst TAN code is selected because of its covered Risk twice  than the mobile-based methods. If professionals were aware of those figures of risk, awareness,  costs, the eIDA method would be selected consequently with them. Therefore, it is worth to  recommend the dissemination of actual Incident data amongst professionals of e-Banking  applications, to improve the matching between their perception of strength and the actual reality.  7.2.2 Rec4. Enforcement of customer’s eIDA method security & usability perception  The professionals of the e-Financial institutions should inform their customers about the usability  and need of the safer authentication mechanisms required to have an adequate protection to  their assets, in order to make them to feel comfortable enough using them.  The perceived strength of the authentication mechanisms by users and professionals is quite similar,  but in most of the cases, the perception of usability by the professionals is much larger than for the  users (see Figure 13).  Figure 13: Perceived usability by users and professionals  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 37  Since usability is one of the most popular criteria for selecting authentication mechanisms in most of  the e-banking applications, this difference of perception needs important attention and analysis.  One extreme example worth mentioning is the virtual keyboard, perceived as easy to use by  professionals (8/10) and un-usable by users (5.4/10), probably because nobody has explained them  how to use it, its advantages to protect from keyloggers, or because the method is required to users  accessing through devices un-suitable for it, like mobile handsets without touch-screen.  7.3 Challenge: Improve the security of the e-Finance environment  7.3.1 Rec5. Environment risk analysis  Financial organisations and e-commerce merchants must perform specific risk analysis for their  environments, taking into consideration the actual loss, number of incidents, number and skills of  customers involved, and actual vulnerabilities of the authentication methods available, in order to  be able to choose the ones that most effectively reduce the number of incidents and loss, i.e. the  risk to lose money.  The reduction of the risk (analysed in section 5.5) and the number of incidents should be one of the  selection criteria, mainly for the secondary authentication mechanism (used to complement the first  one for all operations, or to grant access to the most risky operations). The average figures of risk  reduction in euros are shown in Figure 11 . But each organisation has to perform its own analysis,  based on their number of customers of each segment, their readiness to accept some authentication  mechanisms, the economic value (risk) of the transactions they perform, etc. (See section 5.5  above).  7.3.2 Rec6. Context based or continuous authentication  Customer authentication should be complemented with the implementation of a context-based  authentication strategy, tailored to customer behaviour profile (e.g. transfer destination account),  segment (e.g. total amount in operations) and the operation risk (e.g. destination country, black  lists).  A more complete list of most commonly used context authentication and user behaviour parameters  is as described in Section 3.2.  7.3.3 Rec7. User device security testing and evaluation  The security testing and evaluation of the device used to access the service has to be validated  directly or indirectly by the PSP.  Mobile devices are becoming vulnerable to several security threats such as malware attacks (see  section 6.2. Mobile phones related risks), where attackers abuse them for transactions without any  interaction of the legitimate owner of the mobile phone, just as it has been possible in normal PCs  since years ago. In June 2012, ENISA recommended financial institutions to “Assume all PCs are  infected”43. Therefore, static security analysis of any device used by the customers to access e- Banking services should be performed, in order to estimate the degree of compromise of user’s  device. Some kind of analysis can be done remotely by the server accessed by the customer (e.g.  browser version), but only customers can install and run anti-malware software on their devices, and  43  High Roller ENISA’s flash note: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/eu-cyber-security-agency- enisa-201chigh-roller201d-online-bank-robberies-reveal-security-gaps  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 38  for this purpose have to be trained and convinced about their own interest on having their devices  protected against infection.  7.3.4 Rec8. Device registration  The concept of “something the user has” can be extended to the platform used to access the  service, and thus it is recommended to register any Device, Browser, or Mobile Application used  by the customer. A real time validation of the authenticity of the device would be required.  This registration will prevent customers from being impersonated by somebody that has been able  to replicate some credentials of the customer, using specific different credentials and process to  authorise new devices for the user.  7.4 Challenge: Improve the security of e-Finance application development  and distribution  7.4.1 Rec9. Secure e-banking application development  Technology providers must guarantee secure e-banking application development, taking into  consideration actual threats to Operating Systems (e.g. mobile attack vectors).  Special emphasis has to be given to managing personal data, for which purpose specific data security  analysis (persistency, access control) have to be implemented during the development phases.  Another security issue that may have strong impact on the adoption of strong eIDA methods is the  implementation process and tools, for two reasons:  - eIDA method incorrectly implemented may have security back doors or vulnerabilities  - eIDA method with inadequate or too complex implementation tools will not be accepted  by customers.  In the case of mobile phone applications, it is also recommended to develop applications to be  executed within Secure Execution Environment, using available secure elements that will make them  more robust against emerging threats, before those threats become reality.  7.4.2 Rec10. E-Banking applications distribution  Distribution of e-Banking applications has to be made through trusted channels, reputable sites  that guarantee that applications have been tested for security.  It is very difficult for customers to validate the authenticity of e-Banking applications on their own,  because criminals have demonstrated their ability to sign fake applications with trustworthy  software signing certificates that can overcome the normal installation filters in many devices.  For this reason the use of software distribution platforms (software marketplaces or e-Banking  websites) that guarantee that they have performed security tests on the applications is very  important for the security of the device on which the application is installed and to guarantee that  the application will be executed as expected by the developers.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 39  8 Conclusions  Those recommendations are intended to improve the security of eIDA methods in the landscape of  the eFinance sector shown up by the results of the survey launched by ENISA and replied by users  and professionals. Their implementation will be responsibility of the e-Finance and e-Payment  institutions, in some cases because they are guidelines to achieve their responsibility to preserve the  security of the assets of their customers, and in others, because they are mandatory to fulfil security  requirements expressed in the PSD.  The recommendations also: a) reinforce those made by ECB to implement Internet payments and  customer authentication44, and b) help financial institutions and payment service providers to  implement the new Payment Service Directive (PSD2).  44  “Recommendations for the security of internet payments” published on 31 January 2013 on the ECB’s  website  http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/recommendationssecurityinternetpaymentsoutcomeofpcfinalversi onafterpc201301en.pdf  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 40  9 References  [1]  comScore Data Gem, \"http://ww.comscoredatamine.com/,\" 2012.

The main purpose of the survey has  been to collect information about the electronic IDentity and Authentication (eIDA) Systems used in  e-Finance and e-Payment systems, to analyse the risks associated to each eIDA method, and produce  a Guidelines report with the best practices recommended to the main actors of this sector: Financial  institutions, Merchants and Payment Service providers.  An important role of ENISA is to provide its stakeholders with guidelines on topics that are related to  Network & Information Security (NIS) – this particular report deals with those topics associated with  the e-Identity of citizens and concentrates on e-identity management risks in financial sector:  phishing, id-theft, session and identity hijacking, etc. Some financial institutions are still not  considering the risk associated with the use of inadequate authentication mechanisms, and this  report has collected information about the amount of fraud detected in financial institutions. Then it  correlates that fraud with the different types of authentication mechanisms implemented by them.  With this information, financial institutions could evaluate the cost/benefit associated to the  implementation of additional authentication mechanisms in their particular environment, which is  highly recommended here.  This information has been collected in a survey replied by more than 100 professionals, which has  allowed also to Identify Authentication mechanisms used in financial and payment services, and  the associated risks. The analysis of the survey results has allowed ENISA to produce 4 groups of  recommendations about the best eIDA method to be used in the authorisation of ePayment  operations, depending on the risk associated with them:  1. Promote adequacy of eIDA method to Context: i.e. Proportionality of method and risk, but  encouraging also the use of 2 factor authentication even in low risk operations.  2. Improve the knowledge and the behaviour of customers and professionals: Professionals  have to take into consideration the evolving risks associated with each authentication  method, and customers have to be aware of the need to use strong authentication methods  and protect their credentials.  3. Improve the security of the e-Finance environment, through: Risk Analysis of the Specific  environment (customers profile and size of institution), improvement of customers’  awareness and skills, implementation of context based authentication of transactions, and  early detection of customer’s device compromise through registration, testing and  evaluation of the device security.  4. Improve the security of e-Finance application development and distribution: encouraging  the traditional security by design, taking account of the new personal data protection  Directive, and also using trusted distribution channels to install applications in the  customers’ device.  To summarise, there are many risks that current eIDA practices in the sector don’t cover, ECB and EC  are developing recommendations and regulations that are aligned with the recommendations of this  report of ENISA, trying to identify and set up the tools to improve fraud statistics.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page iv  Table of Contents  Executive summary iii  1 Introduction 1  1.1 Summary of legislative work regarding e-Payment systems in EU 1  1.2 Inputs from Stakeholders 1  1.2.1 Methodology 1  1.2.2 Partners for the project: 2  1.2.3 APWG.EU chapter 2  1.2.4 MRC (Merchant Risk Council) 3  1.2.5 Financial Services User Group (FSUG) 3  1.2.6 European Central Bank and Forum on the Security of Retail Payments (SecuRe Pay) 4  1.2.7 Payment Services Directive 4  1.3 Motivation 4  1.4 Survey Objectives 6  2 Types of operations and transactions in eFinance and ePayment services 7  3 Authentication mechanisms used in eFinance and ePayment services 9  3.1 eIDA methods used in e-financial and e-banking systems 9  3.1.1 Password/PIN 9  3.1.2 Biometrics 9  3.1.3 One Time Password (OTP) 10  3.1.4 e-Signature Certificate 12  3.1.5 Device Authentication 13  3.2 Context authentication mechanisms used in eFinance and ePayment services 13  3.2.1 User behaviour analysis parameters 13  3.2.2 Sessions analysis parameters 14  3.2.3 Network analysis parameters 14  3.2.4 Device Authentication 15  3.2.5 User Profiling 15  3.3 eIDA method Evaluation and selection Factors 16  3.4 Survey questions 17  4 Threat analysis 18  4.1 Threat Categorization 18  4.1.1 Threats against end-users 18  4.1.2 Threats against end-users’ devices 18  4.1.3 Threats against communication networks 19  4.1.4 Threats against remote banking services. 19  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page v  4.2 Attack patterns 19  4.2.1 Attack scenarios 19  4.2.2 Real attack incidents 20  5 Survey analysis 23  5.1 Current practices 23  5.2 Applicability of identified Threats to eIDA methods 24  5.3 Perceived strength, usability and cost 25  5.4 Adequacy of eIDA methods selection criteria 25  5.5 eIDA methods Risk Reduction benefits 28  6 Risk analysis guidelines 30  6.1 Biometrics adoption related risks 31  6.2 Mobile phones related risks 32  7 Recommendations / Best practices guidelines 34  7.1 Challenge: Promote Adequacy of eIDA method to Context 34  7.1.1 Rec.1: eIDA method Selection proportionality 34  7.1.2 Rec.2.

Will be reviewed soon.  - The Payment Services Directive (PSD2) (Directive 2007/64/EC). For which a new proposal (PSD23 ,  Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on payment services in the internal  market and amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2013/36/EU and 2009/110/EC and repealing  Directive 2007/64/EC), has been submitted by the European Commission to the European  Parliament and the European Council on July 24th.  - The e-Invoicing4 directive states that invoices must include authentication of origin.  - The new Regulation about personal data Protection (General Data Protection Regulation,  GDPR5), which is expected to be applicable to all sectors, is expected to be approved by the  European Parliament in 2014 or Q1 2014.  - The review of the EU electronic communications regulatory framework and, in particular, the  new provisions of articles 13a and 13b of the Framework Directive and the amended article 4 of  the Protection of Personal Data or e-Privacy Directive6, aim at strengthening obligations for  operators; to ensure security and integrity of their networks and services, to notify breaches of  security, integrity and personal data to competent national authorities and assign to ENISA  specific tasks. In June 2013, the Commission has put in place new specific rules to ensure that  personal data breaches in the EU telecoms sector are notified in the same way in each Member  State7. The new GDPR includes a requirement to notify about personal data breaches to all  sectors, just like in the current telecommunication directive8 requires telecom operators to  notify any relevant security incident to their regulator.  1.2 Inputs from Stakeholders  1.2.1 Methodology  The project was developed according to the following steps:  1  http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/emoney/index_en.htm  2  http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/framework/index_en.htm  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32007L0064:EN:NOT  3  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52013PC0547:EN:NOT (COM/2013/0547 final -  2013/0264 (COD))  4  http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/einvoicing/index_en.htm  5  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  6  Old PPDD:  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:HTML  7  Commission Regulation on the measures applicable to the notification of personal data breaches under  Directive 2002/58/EC on privacy and electronic communications” online: https://ec.europa.eu/digital- agenda/en/eprivacy-directive-data-breach-notifications  8  Telecommunications Regulatory Package (article 13a. amended Directive 2002/21/EC Framework Directive)  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0110:EN:NOT http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/emoney/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/framework/index_en.htm http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52013PC0547:EN:NOT http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/einvoicing/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:HTML https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/eprivacy-directive-data-breach-notifications https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/eprivacy-directive-data-breach-notifications  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 2   The objectives of the eIDA project were discussed in a meeting organized by the APWG.eu in  Dublin (e-Crime Researchers Sync-Up), March 2013. The attendants to the workshop  validated the objectives.   Once the main objectives were delimited, a questionnaire was elaborated by ENISA, with  contributions from the APWG.EU and BDigital, the questionnaire was then validated by  FSUG, MRC and SecuRe Pay forums.   We received important comments, which allowed us to produce a final version of the Survey  that was launched by ENISA and distributed by the above-mentioned groups as well as EU FI- ISAC and EPC, through which the European Member States central banks were reached.   The Survey was available for participants during a period of 6 weeks; we received 54  responses from representatives of end users groups, and 112 from the professionals, once  merged the responses collected through different sessions, and removed those invalid, e.g.  coming from IP addresses outside EU.   A results analysis was performed with the conclusions summarised in this report, as well as  identifying a set of recommendations for improvement.   Those draft recommendations have been distributed for comments to FSUG, MRC and  SecuRe Pay forum. They have been presented also in several workshops and conferences, to  get feedback from industry, which was positive in all cases. In the World-eID conference it  was possible to interchange ideas with STORK2.0 partners, and in ISSE2013 we had the  opportunity to chair a whole session, with contributions from the Commission, Merchant  and financial sectors.   The received comments have been integrated in the document, and finally aligned with the  recommendations made by ECB on its report “Recommendations for the security of  Internet payments”9 (the “Recommendations”).   Finally, an internal evaluation has also been carried out by ENISA in order to produce the  final version of this report.  1.2.2 Partners for the project:  This research was carried out by ENISA in conjunction with, BDigital and Anti-Phishing WG (APWG)  European chapter.  Also contributed to the launching and the analysis of the survey results:  - Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG.EU) EU chapter  - European Central Bank (ECB) and Forum on the Security of Retail Payments (SecuRe Pay)  - Merchant Risk Council (MRC)  - Financial Services User Group (FSUG)10  - Payment Services Directive (PSD2) preparation team: DG Market H3  - Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center European Chapter (EU FI-ISAC)  - European Payment Council (EPC)  1.2.3 APWG.EU chapter  Some members of the APWG.EU chapter, mainly from the financial sector, made the following  contributions to the project:  - Identified eID practices used in the e-Banking and e-Payment systems:  9  Published on 31 January 2013 on the ECB’s website  http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/recommendationssecurityinternetpaymentsoutcomeofpcfinalversi onafterpc201301en.pdf  10  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:199:SOM:EN:HTML  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 3  o In the e-Banking applications, the application of eID mechanisms to different types of  operations, e.g. read data, modify credentials, money transfer, etc.  o In e-Payment services, they suggested to use indirect methods of assessment of fraud, to  avoid having to provide absolute data.  - Analysed the Robustness of each eID method and the associated Risks, based on the known  Phishing and other Attack Patterns that have been successfully threating each eID method.  - Defined some best practice guidelines recommending the use of adequate eID methods  depending on the risk associated to the transaction or payment.  1.2.4 MRC (Merchant Risk Council)  On top of the known problems with mafia and organised criminals, MRC11 is highly concerned about  “account takeover”: the criminal / hacker uses directly the payment data stored by the merchant,  logging in as a real user of the merchant. Then, they may “exchange” the goods purchased  electronically in the physical store, if the merchant has multiple channels, which allows “monetizing”  the fraud. MRC is interested in analysing how this kind of identity /account spoofing, that allows to  get into the merchant website with a fake identity, can be avoided.  MRC is willing to contribute to improving the security of the user identification, and the related data  storage security. Meaning that, the merchants tend not to store any personal or financial data, but  only a randomly generated token to launch new purchase orders without having to introduce again  the payment details through the merchant site. However, they still handle personal data, because  the token identifies the user between the merchant and the payment service, and it has to be  considered also for data storage security controls.  MRC also contributed with a presentation about “Incident management”, that informs merchants  about how to react in case of incident. MRC is interested in getting information about the skills that  merchant infrastructure managers should have in order to protect their assets from attacks and  incidents, as well as about data breach notifications that they will need to make, when the EU  Directive will be applicable.  1.2.5 Financial Services User Group (FSUG)12  The Commission set up a Financial Services User Group (FSUG). In its White Paper on Financial  Services Policy 2005–201013, the Commission stated that it attaches great importance to ensuring  proportionate user representation in the policy-making. In the Communication for the European  Council – Driving European Recovery14, the Commission put the interests of European investors,  consumers and SMEs at the centre of the financial market reform.  11 The MRC organises webinars and writes reports to raise the awareness of their members, which  are mostly merchants and payment service providers. They also collaborate with public security  agencies, which membership fee is free and have a Committee to manage the collaboration with the  LEA. ECB wants to force the use of safer communication means between payment services and  merchants. Their European Congress takes place at London from the 17th to the 19th of April  (expected 500 participants).  12  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:199:0012:0014:EN:PDF  http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/finservices-retail/fsug/fsug_en.htm  13  White Paper on Financial Services Policy 2005–2010  14  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52009DC0114:EN:NOT  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:199:SOM:EN:HTML http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005DC0629:EN:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005DC0629:EN:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52009DC0114:EN:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52009DC0114:EN:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:199:0012:0014:EN:PDF http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/finservices-retail/fsug/fsug_en.htm http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005DC0629:EN:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52009DC0114:EN:NOT  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 4  1.2.6 European Central Bank and Forum on the Security of Retail Payments (SecuRe Pay)  SecuRe Pay was established by the European Central Bank as a voluntary cooperation between  overseers and supervisors of Payment Services Providers (PSPs) aiming at:  - Facilitating common knowledge and understanding with regard to electronic retail payment  services, instruments and PSPs.  - Addressing major security weaknesses and vulnerabilities.  - Issuing harmonized recommendations.  The security recommendations made by SecuRe Pay, as well as the different contributions on  security-related topics received in the different public consultations launched by the Commission  last year will be a valuable input for the Commission in the review of the Payments Services Directive  foreseen for the second half of 2013.  The ECB is also interested in working on security requirements together with the Secure Payment  forum. The SecuRe Pay has issued recommendations for the security of Internet payments, which,  have been published on 31 January 2013 and can be accessed on the ECB’s website15. As future  directions, ECB planned working on secure payments with mobile phones16.  1.2.7 Payment Services Directive  The PSD17 is currently proposing to implement high-level security requirements for the payment  institutions. The new directive is intended to enforce the usage of strong used authentication for  remote payment transactions. As it is stipulated in the Article 87 of the proposed regulation:  \"Member States shall ensure that a payment service provider applies strong customer  authentication when the payer initiates an electronic payment transaction unless EBA guidelines  allow specific exemptions based on the risk involved in the provided payment service.\"  1.3 Motivation  In July 2013 the European Central Bank published its \"Second Report on Card Fraud\"18. This report  contains interesting information regarding the so-called \"Card not Present-Fraud (CNP-Fraud)\",  which, is by far the predominant type of fraud within card payments. Whereas remote transactions  known as \"card not present-transactions\" represent only a share of around 10 % of all card  payments, the share of CNP-Fraud of the total card payments fraud has increased from 47 % in 2007  to 56 % in 2011. Accordingly, the ECB concludes that Internet payments result in higher rates of  fraud. Therefore, in 2011 the European Forum on the Security of Retail Payments, where relevant  public authorities overseeing and supervising payment service providers cooperate voluntarily,  focused its work on developing “recommendations to improve the security of Internet payments\".  These findings have been enforced by further country-specific statistics. The 2012 Annual Report of  the French Observatory for Card Payment Security19 stipulates \"the fraud rate for CNP payments fell  15  http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/recommendationssecurityinternetpaymentsoutcomeofpcfinalversi onafterpc201301en.pdf  16  http://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/cons/pdf/131120/recommendationsforthesecurityofmobilepaymentsdraftp c201311en.pdf  17  Edited by: DG Market H3  18  http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/cardfraudreport201307en.pdf  19  http://www.banque-france.fr/observatoire/telechar/gb/2012/rapport-annuel-OSCP-2012-gb-fraud- statistics-for-2012.pdf  http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/cardfraudreport201307en.pdf http://www.banque-france.fr/observatoire/telechar/gb/2012/rapport-annuel-OSCP-2012-gb-fraud-statistics-for-2012.pdf http://www.banque-france.fr/observatoire/telechar/gb/2012/rapport-annuel-OSCP-2012-gb-fraud-statistics-for-2012.pdf  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 5  to 0.299%, but was still 20 times higher than the rate for face-to-face payments. The fraud rate for  Internet payments, in particular, declined to 0.290% from 0.341% in 2011. A mid sustained growth in  electronic commerce, CNP payments accounted for just 9.2% of the value of domestic transactions  but for 61% of the total amount of fraud (the same as in 2011)\". Similar information can be found for  the UK market, where Financial Fraud Action UK publishes regularly information on fraud in  payments20. CNP fraud is responsible for 63 % of the total fraud in the UK as well. A calculation of  the loss over volume for all payments fraud in UK the ratio is at 7.1 basis points21, whereas the ratio  only for e-commerce fraud is at 20.6 basis points. Total e-commerce fraud losses only in the UK  accounted 2012 already for 140.2 M GBP.  The blooming of Internet technologies has revolutionized the way people transact with their  financial institutions. Nowadays, it is estimated that globally 25% of Internet users, access e-banking  services [1]. Given the surge of mobile technology, and according to a recent report published by  Juniper [2], the number of people that use their mobile device for e-banking and e-financial services  has drastically increased over the past years, i.e. over 590 million mobile users have used their  mobile devices for banking purposes. Meaning that, e-banking users have considerably benefited  from using e-banking services without time and location constraints (‘whenever you want’ and  ‘wherever you are’), which is a compelling proposition to most banking customers. However, due to  the sensitive nature of financial information, security has become a main concern [3], especially  where ciber-fraud estimations range from 300MUSD to 1 billion USD per year22, only in USA. The lack  of proper security measures results in an barrier for the wider adoption of e-banking services.  Current e-banking systems are exposed not only to the set of known threats (now migrating from  traditional PC-based e-banking to the mobile-based scenario), but, to emerging threats, specifically  targeting mobile devices. Cybercrime is increasingly targeting e-banking systems (‘criminals go  where the money is’), and being more and more organised. Nowadays, cybercriminals have the  capabilities to target new technologies and launch attacks of increased sophistication, as in the two  high impact attacks that took place during 2012, and shocked the e-banking sector (the High Roller23  incident and the Eurograbber24 attack). In the High Roller incident [4], 60 million euros were stolen,  while in the Eurograbber attack 36 million euros were stolen and more than 30,000 bank customers  were targeted [5]. Security is, therefore, a major issue, and must be considered, where, the security  level of an e-Banking system is strongly influenced by the customer authentication methods, just as  in the aforementioned incidents, attackers were able to hijack two-factor authentication (e.g. mTAN)  and commit fraud.  Therefore, to be able to provide payment transaction security, and minimize the potential threats, e- banking systems must implement robust identification and authentication (eIDA) mechanisms when  accessing sensitive information or performing risky operations. As a result, e-Banking authentication  continues to draw important attention not only to security professionals, but also to security  20  http://www.financialfraudaction.org.uk/publications/  21  1 basis point = one one-hundredth percent  22  https://www.jpmorgan.com/cm/BlobServer/13th_Annual_2012_Online_Fraud_Report.pdf?blobkey=id&blob where=1320571432216&blobheader=application/pdf&blobheadername1=Cache- Control&blobheadervalue1=private&blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-04/hackers-take-1-billion-a-year-from-company-accounts-banks- won-t-indemnify.html  23  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa-201chigh-roller201d- online-bank-robberies-reveal-security-gaps  24  https://www.checkpoint.com/products/downloads/whitepapers/Eurograbber_White_Paper.pdf  http://www.financialfraudaction.org.uk/publications/ https://www.jpmorgan.com/cm/BlobServer/13th_Annual_2012_Online_Fraud_Report.pdf?blobkey=id&blobwhere=1320571432216&blobheader=application/pdf&blobheadername1=Cache-Control&blobheadervalue1=private&blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs https://www.jpmorgan.com/cm/BlobServer/13th_Annual_2012_Online_Fraud_Report.pdf?blobkey=id&blobwhere=1320571432216&blobheader=application/pdf&blobheadername1=Cache-Control&blobheadervalue1=private&blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs https://www.jpmorgan.com/cm/BlobServer/13th_Annual_2012_Online_Fraud_Report.pdf?blobkey=id&blobwhere=1320571432216&blobheader=application/pdf&blobheadername1=Cache-Control&blobheadervalue1=private&blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-04/hackers-take-1-billion-a-year-from-company-accounts-banks-won-t-indemnify.html http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-04/hackers-take-1-billion-a-year-from-company-accounts-banks-won-t-indemnify.html http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa-201chigh-roller201d-online-bank-robberies-reveal-security-gaps http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa-201chigh-roller201d-online-bank-robberies-reveal-security-gaps https://www.checkpoint.com/products/downloads/whitepapers/Eurograbber_White_Paper.pdf  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 6  managers, decision makers and moreover, security researchers. In [6] authors discussed about  general challenges and issues identified in e-banking systems. Authors of [7] and [8] have presented  an extensive study on e-banking security and introduced a formal definition of e-banking threats and  security models. In [9], the author presents a study on security threats towards proposing the use of  biometrics for strong authentication in e-banking scenarios.  A taxonomy of attacks to e-banking authentication was introduced by authors of [10]. Additionally, a  challenge/response authentication solution was proposed. An assessment of authentication  methods for e-banking was presented by authors of [11], however, the presented study was focused  only on the PC-based scenarios. Although, there are many interesting approaches, the evolution and  sophistication of Internet and mobile attacks require the continuous study of emerging threats,  issues and challenges in e-banking scenarios.  Similar to our study, authors of [12] analysed the eIDA methods used by major banks in English  speaking countries. Nonetheless, their research was limited to data collected by mere observation  (publicly available), contrary to our approach, which analyses these factors, taking into account  current implemented e-banking systems, with information provided by the security professionals of  major European banks.  Finally, our study provides an eIDA methods assessment and a set of recommendations taking into  account the security professionals’ perspective.  1.4 Survey Objectives  The main objective of the survey is to identify electronic Identification & Authentication (eIDA)  mechanisms used in e-Finance and e-Payment services:  - Most relevant One-step mechanisms  - In the e-Banking applications, the application of eID mechanisms to different types of  operations, e.g. read data, modify credentials, money transfer, etc.  - e-Finance professionals are asked to provide additional information about:  o Internal authentication mechanisms, hidden to the customers.  o Rough estimations about the improvements achieved in the fight against identity theft  and cyber-fraud, thanks to the introduction of the authentication mechanisms.  The questions about the estimations of improvements achieved are of two kinds:   Qualitative, i.e. comparing the current situation with respect to the previous one (without  the authentication mechanism)   Quantitative, i.e. providing a range of values of economic losses per user, number and time  of take down of incidents.  In order to get the maximum number of contributions to the survey, the questions do not permit  knowledge of the total loss of the institution, and the identity of the participant in the survey is  completely anonymous, so a disclaimer will recall that the requested information should not be  considered confidential. In addition, ENISA has the mandate of the Commission to collect  information about data breaches and network and information security incidents in critical  infrastructures, with the commitment to keep this information fully confidential, and not to publish  the information in a way that could be associated to any particular stakeholder, industry or  organisation.  The disclaimer concluded saying that: “Nonetheless, if there is any internal policy that prevents to  disclose some information of the organisation related to the quantitative questions, it is always  possible to skip those questions of the survey.”  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 7  2 Types of operations and transactions in eFinance and ePayment services  e-Finance and e-Payment applications allow users to perform different kinds of transactions that can  be categorized according to different factors. In this work, ENISA recognises four types of operations,  each corresponding to a different risk level, partly following eID federation practices, and Data  Protection Authority (DPA) recommendations for data breach criticality evaluation, which should be  considered when assessing the suitability of an eIDA method to authorize an operation.  Thus, one of the aims of this project is to identify:  - How many levels of risk, i.e. types of operation are implemented in the e-Finance applications,  and  - Which authentication mechanisms are used for each type of operation.  The four types of operations identified are the following, sorted from the lower to the highest risk:  1. General customer Information (not financial), low risk operation, which, allows only read access  to basic account information, i.e. personal data of medium sensitivity level, like:  a. Personal data of the customer.  b. Account number(s) only.  2. Account Information (read only), low risk operation, which, allows only read access to personal  and financial data, i.e. personal data of high sensitivity level, like:  a. Personal data of the customer.  b. Account number(s) only.  c. Balance.  d. Transaction History.  e. Account statements.  3. ePayments to known destinations, medium risk operations are those that fulfil the  requirements expressed in KC 7.1 of the ECB report “Recommendations for security of Internet  Payments”: i) outgoing payments to trusted beneficiaries included in previously established  white lists for that customer; ii)  transactions between two accounts of the same customer held  at the same PSP (Payment Service Provider); iii)  transfers within the same PSP justified by a  transaction risk analysis; iv) low-value payments, as referred to in the Payment Services  Directive.  Examples of known destinations could be:  a. Utility / Supplier payments.  b. Some Card Payments.  c. e-Government payments.  d. e-Merchant payments (some well-known ones).  4. Transactions (modify data), high risk operation, which, allows payments to “untrusted”  destinations.  a. Transfers to any destination  b. Card payments / Access credit  c. Insurance polices  d. Managing personal data  e. Investment instruments  f. e-Merchant payments (not-registered ones)  Participants were asked to indicate the operation and transaction type of higher risk that is  authorised by the authentication mechanism that is used. It is assumed that:  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 8  - Mechanisms allowing type 2 are assumed to allow also type 1, and to be a pre-requisite of the  methods required for the other operations (1st step of authentication chain).  - Mechanisms allowing to launch operations of type 4 are assumed to allow also all the lower  levels of risk types (last step of the authentication chain), i.e. all kinds of transactions.  As mentioned above (see 1.1), the new PSD25  doesn’t recognise so many types of operations, and  requires strong authentication for any kind of transaction. As a result, the new directive will force  the usage of so-called \"strong customer authentication\" for any remote payment transaction. Article  4 defines \"strong customer authentication\" in the following way: \"‘strong customer authentication’  means a procedure for the validation of the identification of a natural or legal person based on the  use of two or more elements categorised as knowledge, possession and inherence that are  independent, in that the breach of one does not compromise the reliability of the others and is  designed in such a way as to protect the confidentiality of the authentication data.\".  25  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52013PC0547:EN:NOT  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 9  3 Authentication mechanisms used in eFinance and ePayment services  The process that allows an entity to establish the identity of another entity is known as  authentication. Current eIDA methods are based on some combination of something that you know,  something that you have, and something that you are. When two or more of the aforementioned  elements are combined, this procedure is known as strong authentication (two-factor or multi-factor  authentication).  In the following section, the initial set of the eIDA methods used in this work is introduced, towards  analysing the most common and strong customer authentication implementations used in current e- banking systems.  3.1 eIDA methods used in e-financial and e-banking systems  In the following sections a short description of each authentication mechanism suitable for e- banking and e-financial systems are introduced. These eIDA methods have been included in the  survey, and are categorized according to their type of credentials, as they were shown in the survey.  3.1.1 Password/PIN  An eIDA method based on what you know, and consisting of a combination of a valid and unique  identifier (username) and a secret pass-phrase (password/PIN), where end-users are requested to  enter a private pass-phrase in order to be authenticated. Additionally, two important security  enhancements might be implemented:  - Virtual Keyboard -  consists of a software based keyboard displayed on the screen (to prevent  keyloggers), and  - Partial password (Figure 1), the user is asked to enter only some of the digits or characters from  the PIN/password, a common partial password approach requests different positions for each  session.  Figure 1 Partial password: the user is asked to introduce only 2 of the 6 digits of the PIN (Virtual Keyboard)  3.1.2 Biometrics  An eIDA method based on what you are, i.e. end-users are authenticated through their  characteristics such as body biometry or behavioural biometry (recognition of fingerprint, voice,  face, hand geometry) or behavioural biometry (keystroke dynamics, handwritten signature). Herein  follow some explanations of the most commonly used techniques:  3.1.2.1 Behavioural biometry  Analyses how the user behaves, interacting with the computer:  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 10  3.1.2.1.1 Keystroke dynamics  Also known as typing biometrics, this authentication mechanism uses typing patterns (elapsed time  between pairs of keystrokes) in order to authenticate a user.  3.1.2.1.2 Handwritten Signature  A graphical image of a handwritten signature, or the analysis of the speed of the strokes used to  generate it, is used to authenticate the user.  3.1.2.2 Body biometry  Analyses how the user “is”, i.e. some characteristics of his/her body, that can’t be changed easily:  3.1.2.2.1 Fingerprint recognition  The user’s fingerprint is scanned for the authentication process.  3.1.2.2.2 Voice recognition  This mechanism processes (spectral analysis) the user’s voice in order to verify the identity of the  speaking user.  3.1.2.2.3 Facial recognition  The biometric system scans user’s face and analyses specific facial features/pattern in order to  authenticate her.  3.1.2.2.4 Hand geometry  The geometric shape of the user’s hand is used for verifying his/her identity.  3.1.3 One Time Password (OTP)  This eIDA method is usually based on what you have, and it consists of generating a different, and  essentially random password, known as a One Time Password or OTP that is only valid for one  session or transaction, and it is also referred as dynamic authentication. A typical OTP  implementation is based on one of the following algorithms: event-based OTP, time-based OTP, or  challenge-response OTP. Additionally, OTPs can be delivered in several ways, providing different  benefits in terms of usability, security and costs. Static OTP approaches are commonly based on  TAN26 code lists, while Dynamic OTP approaches include SMS-based OTP, Hardware Token, Software  Token and QR-codes (Quick Response two-dimensional bar code, see section 3.1.3.3.4).  3.1.3.1 TAN code list or coordinates card  The user has a physical document with the list of codes (OTPs) s/he has to use to reply the challenge  from the web banking application, just as shown in Figure 2. The challenges are generated randomly,  and so the corresponding reply looks also random.  26  Transaction Authentication Number  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 11  Figure 2 TAN Code List & Coordinates Card  3.1.3.2 Mobile SMS based  A different random OTP is sent to the user via SMS message to the registered phone number of the  user, each time a transaction requires authentication.  3.1.3.3 Specific Token device  The user has a physical electronic device, which generates a specific Password (OTP) each time the  user requests it. There are different types of devices that may be used for this purpose:  3.1.3.3.1 Hardware (special Token – time based OTP)  The user has a dedicated/special physical electronic device that generates a specific Password (OTP)  each time the user requests it. The generated OTP in this case is a unique value, e.g. a six-digit  number that changes at fixed intervals (for example every minute).  Figure 3 Hardware Token (time based OTP).  In this example the OTP is based only on the calendar time and a private key stored in the device.  3.1.3.3.2 Hardware (special Token – challenge/response OTP)  The user has a dedicated/special physical electronic device that generates a specific Password (OTP)  each time the user requests it. In this case, a challenge-response protocol is used: at first, the web  banking application generates a challenge (e.g. a random number); this challenge has to be typed in  the token, in order to get the correct response for that time; finally, the response is sent back to the  web banking application that will authenticate the user based on the response.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 12  3.1.3.3.3 Mobile OTP Application (Token)  The user has a software application installed on his/her mobile telephone handset that generates a  specific password (OTP) each time the user requests it. The user may need to type in a challenge  code displayed on the computer by the e-Banking application website. Note that, in mobile-based  solutions the registration of the mobile device is highly recommended in order to reduce the  associated security risks that are inherent in mobile devices.  3.1.3.3.4 QR codes  The user scans a two-dimensional bar code of the challenge that is displayed on the screen of the e- Banking application (as shown in Figure 4 ), with the mobile phone handset application, which  generates a specific Password (OTP) based on that challenge. This avoids the user having to re-type  the challenge. It is worth mentioning that the security strength of the token highly depends on the  way it is implemented. In QR codes, the mobile app/mobile device should be authenticated (i.e.  registration to link it to a specific user) to avoid the QR code to be scanned from any malicious  mobile app/device.  Figure 4 QR Code scanner application  3.1.4 e-Signature Certificate  This eIDA method is based on what you have, where end-users are authenticated through e- Signatures. The user’s private key can be stored in: Computer stored key, Mobile phone, USB  memory card, and Crypto-card  3.1.4.1 Local / Computer store of Key  The e-Signature is made using the private key of the user that is stored at his/her computer Hard  Disk.  3.1.4.2 Device stored key  3.1.4.2.1 Memory Token (USB, memory card)  The e-Signature is made using the private key of the user that is stored in a USB or a memory card  (removable memory storage).  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 13  3.1.4.2.2 Chip card token (e-Identity card)  The e-Signature is made using the private key of the user stored in the chip of his/er e-Identity card  or specific smart card (with cryptographic embedded functions).  3.1.4.2.3 Mobile phone  The e-Signature is made using the mobile phone of the user, where the user’s private key is stored.  3.1.5 Device Authentication  If the user accesses the e-Banking service through previously registered/used devices and platforms  or through a specific mobile application for that service, then some authentication steps may be  avoided.  3.1.5.1 Device Registration  The user identity is reinforced through registration of the device(s) that user has used before.  Attempting to access the e-Banking application from a new device, platform or browser will cause a  warming and/or require additional authentication mechanism.  3.1.5.2 Mobile e-Banking Application  The user accesses the e-Banking service from an application, specific for that Service, running on the  mobile telephone handset.  3.2 Context authentication mechanisms used in eFinance and ePayment  services  In this section we provide short explanations for the additional context authentication mechanisms  which are hidden to the customer. They improve the level of confidence of the service provider on  the identity of the customer independently of the user credentials that the customer may have or  know. These mechanisms are normally implemented on the server side, in order to check the  authenticity of the customer, based on the behaviour, location or device used and other parameters  of the operations performed by the user during the interactive session with the service. The users do  not easily recognise these mechanisms during the interaction with the service, so they normally are  not aware that those authentication mechanisms are protecting them from being victims of fraud or  from being impersonated.  The new proposed regulation on data protection (GDPR27) imposes some restrictions on the profiling  of the users. It includes also a \"ban on profiling\", i.e. monitoring of customer transactions may be  only possible with the prior consent of the customer - something which at least theoretically could  affect the possibilities to monitor transaction on potential fraud, that may have an impact on the  right to use these techniques. For this reason, maybe it will be necessary to set up legal notices  advising the user about their implementation.  3.2.1 User behaviour analysis parameters  These parameters are used by the financial services to authenticate users by tracking their overall e- banking operation and transaction history when using/interacting with the service. Thus, through  27  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 14  deviations from expected online behaviour, fraudulent activity can be detected and prevented. This  category of authentication parameters includes:  3.2.1.1 Time between sessions  User’s account/transaction operations may be rejected based on their frequency of access to the  service within a time window.  3.2.1.2 Destination account filter  Based on the user’s transaction history, transactions to account numbers other than those preferred  or most used money transfer destinations for the current user are restricted.  3.2.1.3 Total amount in operations  Based on a user’s profile, if the total amount in operations of this user within a period of time is  above the threshold for that profile, the transaction is rejected.  3.2.1.4 Time of day  Each user interacts with ePayment services and makes transactions in a personalized way, e.g. some  specific times during the day. Thus, the transactions and operations that do not take place within  his/her usual times of the day may be rejected.  3.2.1.5 Keystroke dynamics  This authentication parameter uses typing patterns (elapsed time between pairs of keystrokes) in  order to identify and authenticate a user.  3.2.2 Sessions analysis parameters  These parameters are used to authenticate the user by separately monitoring each of his/her  session. This category of authentication parameters includes:  3.2.2.1 Amount filter  Amount transaction thresholds (bigger than, usual) are derived from the user’s profile. The user’s  transactions that do not comply with these thresholds are rejected/restricted.  3.2.2.2 Blacklisted bank accounts  The financial institution may have a blacklist of bank accounts know to be associated with fraudulent  activities.  3.2.2.3 Time between operations within one session  An average time between user’s operations is compared with the normal value for his/her profile,  which is used to detect abnormal or fraudulent activity. If a malicious program hijacks the identity of  the user then the time between operations could be shorter.  3.2.3 Network analysis parameters  These parameters are used to authenticate users by analysing networking characteristics. This  category of authentication parameters includes:  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 15  3.2.3.1 Whitelisted IP addresses  Current customer IP address is checked against whitelisted IP addresses.  3.2.3.2 Blacklisted IP addresses  The user’s transactions/operations may be rejected because his/her IP address is blacklisted  (commercial blacklists, lists with compromised computer, blacklisted IP addresses due to previous  fraudulent activity, etc.).  3.2.3.3 Anonymous proxy  Transactions from anonymous proxies are rejected since their IP addresses are blacklisted.  3.2.3.4 High risk country classification  A transaction may be rejected if it is carried out from an IP address block that is allocated to a high  risk country.  3.2.3.5 Time between sessions from one source IP address  The transaction/operation activity from a single IP address may be marked as fraudulent or  suspicious if its frequency is high, or if it is used to access several customer accounts.  3.2.3.6 Geographical distance between operations  Current customer IP address geolocation is checked against the last recently used by that customer.  Customer’s transactions and operations may be rejected based on the geographical distance  between them.  3.2.4 Device Authentication  If the user accesses the e-Payment service through a previously registered/used device, or platform,  or browser, then some authentication steps may be avoided.  3.2.4.1 Platform identification  The user identity is reinforced through registration of the platform (mobile device, browser,  operating systems, etc.) that the user has used before. Attempting to access the e-Banking  application from a new device, platform or browser will cause a warning and/or require additional  authentication mechanisms.  3.2.4.2 Storage of user key in a device  The device of the user (e.g. mobile or tablet) is authenticated in order to allow the user to make  transactions and operations storing a security key in the device or mobile phone SIM card.  3.2.5 User Profiling  In this category of contextual analysis mechanisms, some parameters that characterise the  interaction of the users with the service are profiled, and the user behaviour is analysed and  compared against specific patterns of behaviour, i.e. profiles of user. We may have several  approaches, depending on the type and amount of information stored by the server.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 16  3.2.5.1 Single behaviour pattern  User behaviour is analysed only during the current session and it is compared against only one user  profile in the whole system, resulting in users being profiled with a single pattern.  3.2.5.2 Multiple behaviour patterns  User behaviour is analysed only during the current session and it is compared against one of the  several standard user profiles defined in the whole system. Thus, users are associated to one of  those patterns or segments (e.g. company profile, end user profile, investor profile). If the behaviour  of the user in the current session does not match with the profile associated to this user, then the  operations are restricted.  3.2.5.3 Individual behaviour pattern  Users are profiled (their behaviour is analysed) in all sessions, in order to create an individual pattern  for each customer. Thus, an individual user profile (history) is stored in the system and the user’s  current and historical sessions are compared.  3.3  eIDA method Evaluation and selection Factors  This section introduces the list of the proposed selection criteria based on real implementations,  i.e. considered by security professionals, managers and decision makers in e-banking:   Strength, Covered risk and Efficiency to resist potential attacks and the risk they represent  and its sophistication.   Implementation difficulty in terms of technical requirements to be fully deployed and  functional.   Absolute loss and Reduction of Loss per involved customer   Yearly Frequency and Reduction of the number of security incidents, successful attacks per  year, regardless of the number of customers affected by each of them.   Usability: the authentication mechanism’s quality of being user-friendly and closer to user  needs and requirements.   Implementation cost: the cost impact of the eIDA methods implementation effort.   Adequacy to user segment: The eIDA method quality of being able to meet a user segment’s  needs and expectations. Categorizing user segments is an important task when assessing the  suitability of an eIDA method implementation. Thus, in this section we propose a generic  categorization that identifies different user segments. Note, that not all financial institutions  might include all of the propose user segments; there exist those institutions aimed at only  one of them.  o Retail: personal banking or consumer banking, aimed at regular customers making  low amount transactions.  o Private: personal banking with special needs, i.e. customers making large amount  transactions.  o Corporate/Business: aimed at companies/enterprises.  o Investor: aimed at users managing investment tools.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 17  3.4 Survey questions  The survey was intended to be used on-line28, where the participants were asked to select the  authentication mechanisms that they use. The survey was addressed to two communities:  - End user associations’ representatives and e-commerce Merchants, who were asked to  answer questions only about the first set of authentication mechanisms described above.  - e-Finance institutions IT security professionals, who were asked to answer the survey split in  two parts, one for the Transparent authentication mechanisms described above, and a  second one for the Context authentication mechanisms, also described above. Then, for  every one of the selected mechanisms, the participants were asked to reply some questions  in order to provide their view about the strength, usability, efficiency and improvements  achieved using those mechanisms.  Concerning the questions about the estimations of improvements achieved, they were of two kinds  as stated in Section 1.4: Qualitative and quantitative.  The Annex II collects the screenshots of the survey, which show all the authentications mechanisms  (Part I of the survey), as well as the additional context authentication mechanisms (Part II of the  survey) for which, participants were asked to provide input. Participants should answer a set of  related questions for each of the selected mechanisms.  28 Survey Web site: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/surveys/professionals-survey  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/surveys/professionals-survey  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 18  4 Threat analysis  This section introduces the Threat Landscape of the identified threats relevant to eIDA method as  shown in Figure 5. The most relevant threats and attack scenarios concerning online banking  authentication, especially those regarding its ICT infrastructure are then introduced in the following  sections.  The report ETL29 (ENISA Threat Landscape) collects a more complete analysis of cyber-threats, risks  and threat agents, including general threats (e.g. botnets, IP spoofing) not described here to avoid  duplications. This section collects only those threats directly related to authentication methods used  by citizen in e-Finance applications.  4.1 Threat Categorization  A categorization of threats based on the component/asset attacked has been adopted from the  approach that has been proposed by C. Dimitriadis [7].  4.1.1 Threats against end-users  a. Physical observation/surveillance: End-users may be subjected to shoulder surfing, filming  of their keyboard or recording of keyboard acoustic and electromagnetic emanations. Thus,  by being surveyed, the credentials of the end users can be captured or even stolen (e.g. theft  of written down passwords).  b. Social engineering: through non-technical means, the user’s credentials can be  compromised, e.g. knowledge of personal details of the user, user impersonation and  claimed identity during registration, phone calls, etc.  c. Phishing: end-users may be victims of traditional phishing email campaigns or highly  targeted spear-phishing ones. Furthermore, given mostly the proliferation of mobile devices  and social networks, phishing has evolved and heterogeneous phishing campaigns (text  messages-SMiShing (SMS phishing), malicious links from online social networks, fake mobile  applications - app-based phishing, voice phishing (vishing) have arisen.  4.1.2 Threats against end-users’ devices  The below mentioned threats primarily target the devices of end users (e.g. PC, mobile device,  tokens, etc.):  a. Physical theft of token or device: End-users may be victims of theft of their token device  and their mobile device (or even the piece of paper with their passwords written down).  b. Tampering (or replication) of token or device: PIN brute force attacks, side channel attacks  and hardware keyloggers are some attack examples of this threat.  c. Malicious software (malware): Malware authors increasingly target online banking.  Malicious code with rootkit features, i.e. as Man-in-the-Browser (MitB), and mobile banking  trojans which can hijack two-factor authentication, i.e. Man-in-the-Mobile (MitMo), are the  most prominent threats for e-banking identity theft and fraud  29  ETL 2013: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa- threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 19  4.1.3 Threats against communication networks  These threats target the communication channel between end users and the remote banking server.  a. Pharming30: Attackers may target the network infrastructure (specifically routers and DNS  servers) and redirect end users to illegitimate websites, i.e. users are redirected to a  malicious URL while having entered the correct one in the address bar.  b. Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking31: This threat category includes network-based and  server-based man-in-the-middle attacks. Banking credentials, transaction data, OTPs and  other sensitive data can be captured through erroneously trusted fake SSL certificates,  passive traffic monitoring (sniffing), replay attacks, as well as active man-in-the-middle  attacks.  4.1.4 Threats against remote banking services.  These threats target the ICT infrastructure of the bank that hosts the web banking service and the  respective data stored.  a. Web code injections against banking servers: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities of the web- banking server through SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery,  redirection to a malicious URL and other web exploitation techniques. The adversaries  placing such attacks try to extract data such as credentials.  b. Denial of service attacks (DoS): Brute force DoS attacks against online banking server do not  pose a direct threat to the components of the end users’ authentication process.  Nevertheless, DoS attacks can be launched as a diversion as part of a larger attacks and can  be reinforced by the misuse of open DNS resolvers.  c. Bank data breaches: bank internal or external threat agents as well as third parties can  compromise sensitive information (e.g. end users’ credentials, account information, social  security numbers etc.)  4.2 Attack patterns  This section presents common attack scenarios implemented in real world attacks.  4.2.1 Attack scenarios  Typical attack scenarios and methodologies based on current malware trends for e-banking are  introduced next.  4.2.1.1 Phishing attack scenario  As stated by Kaspersky32, in 2012-2013, 37.3 million users suffered from phishing attacks, 20% of  which targeted the banking and financial sector. Concerning the mobile platforms, Trend Micro  reports that 75% of mobile phishing URLs were rogue versions of banking and financial services.  Thus, given the large use of mobile devices and the growing threat of mobile e-banking phishing, we  present below such an attack scenario:  30  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharming  31  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Network_Eavesdropping - -  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_hijacking_attack  32  http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/press/2013/Kaspersky_Lab_report_37_3_million_users_experienced _phishing_attacks_in_the_last_year  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharming https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Network_Eavesdropping https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_hijacking_attack  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 20  - First, the user receives the phishing email and since he has 24/7 connectivity with their  mobile he opens his mailbox.  - The message sender is spoofed and pretends to be the e-banking service requesting the user  to update his account information by providing a malicious link.  - Upon clicking the malicious link, the user accesses the legitimate-looking e-banking service  and is lured to give his/her e-banking credentials and in some cases other sensitive  information (e.g. email credentials, government-issued identity card, passport, etc.).  4.2.1.2 Man-in-the-Browser attack scenario  MitB attacks are of increasing sophistication, hard to detect and can be highly customized for a  specific target financial institution. As stated by RSA33, MitB attacks are conducted by many financial  Trojan families (personified by Zeus and SpyEye, which are also available for mobile devices) and  their prevalence is widespread. The latter is being reinforced by the existence of many infection  vectors: malicious email attachments, drive-by downloads, online social networks, infected  removable media, etc. In a Man-in-the-Browser attack:  - The malware is hosted in user’s PC or mobile device and is waiting for the user to access the  online banking server.  - When the user successfully logs in his online banking service, the malware exits stealth  mode and hijacks the online session of the user.  - At this time, the malware can:  a) simply log user’s submitted credentials  b) modify in real time transaction content (i.e. amount and destination account) or  c) insert additional transactions to mule accounts.  - Finally, malware modified or added transactions are made invisible to the user and the  online banking application.  a) On the one hand, the user is deceived by means of social engineering techniques: by  pretending unavailability of the e-banking service and by displaying the legitimate  transaction (instead of the fraudulent one) or a fake account balance, etc.  b) On the other hand, the online banking service cannot detect the aforementioned  fraudulent transactions due to the fact that any activity seems to have been  performed by the user’s browser.  4.2.1.3 Man-in-the-Mobile attack scenario  Man-in-the-Mobile attacks are the natural evolution of Man-in-the-Browser ones, specifically  targeting mobile devices browsers.  4.2.2 Real attack incidents  In this subsection, we present the attack methodology of two high impact real attack incidents  targeting e-banking services that took place during 2012.  4.2.2.1 The High Roller attack scenario  The first stage of High Roller attack34 [4] is a combination of phishing and man-in-the-browser  scenarios.  33  http://viewer.media.bitpipe.com/1039183786_34/1295277188_16/MITB_WP_0510-RSA.pdf  34  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa-201chigh-roller201d- online-bank-robberies-reveal-security-gaps  http://viewer.media.bitpipe.com/1039183786_34/1295277188_16/MITB_WP_0510-RSA.pdf  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 21   Attackers used online reconnaissance in order to gather information and send specifically  crafted and highly targeted emails to bank customers with high balance accounts.   Then, using spear phishing as the attack vector, attackers managed to install their malicious  code in victims’ PCs.   The malware was triggered when the user started an e-banking session and injected  requests for additional authentication information (e.g. TAN used in two factor  authentication schemes).   While the user was waiting to be authenticated, the malware had already initiated a silent  fraudulent transaction to a mule account35.   Finally, the malware had the ability to hide the fraudulent transactions (e.g. false account  balance) from the logged-in user.  4.2.2.2 The Eurograbber attack scenario  A high impact attack of this kind was the Eurograbber incident which was made public during  December 2012. As reported36, 36 million Euros were stolen from more than 30,000 bank victim  customers in Netherlands, Spain and Germany. The attackers targeted both PC and mobile devices  of the users in order to hijack two-factor authentication (SMS-based OTP is commonly used in  Europe) and make fraudulent transactions. The anatomy of the Eurograbber attack was the  following [5]:  - Firstly, the user’s PC is infected with a variation of Zeus Trojan malware through malicious  email attachment or through a drive-by download.  - The malware hosted by the infected PC remains in stealth mode until the user accesses his  banking website.  - Using social engineering techniques (i.e. bank security upgrade), the malware lures the user  to give his/her mobile phone number.  - As soon as attackers receive the customer’s mobile phone number, they send a SMS  including a malicious link for downloading a mobile banking security application.  - Upon installation of this application, attackers have infected both PC and mobile device of  the user.  - Thus, when the user logs in to his banking account, the PC-malware component initiates a  fraudulent transaction to a mule account while the mobile-malware component receives the  SMS authentication code and sends it to the attacker.  35  An account to which fraudsters transfer funds from the compromised account  36  https://www.checkpoint.com/products/downloads/whitepapers/Eurograbber_White_Paper.pdf  https://www.checkpoint.com/products/downloads/whitepapers/Eurograbber_White_Paper.pdf  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 22  Figure 5 Threat Landscape  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 23  5 Survey analysis  The categorization of Operations, Authentication methods and Threats, described in Section 2,  Section 1.1 and Section 4 respectively, has been proposed mainly to support the survey addressed to  security professionals in the e-financial sector. The survey objectives were to identify the eIDA  methods currently used in online banking services and identify: usability and costs for operation  types and customer segments, perceived strength and qualitative information about measured risk  parameters, and improvement achieved. As it has been previously remarked, the survey was  distributed and conducted by ENISA, with participation of members of the APWG.EU, CaixaBank, and  Merchant Risk Council (MRC), and distributed to security professionals of the financial sector  through SecuRe Pay, EU FI-ISAC, ECB, and EPC, and users’ representatives through the MRC and the  FSUG.  5.1 Current practices  Amongst the above mentioned eIDA methods (Section3.1), only those shown in Figure 6 have been  widely adopted. Figure 6, presents the most common eIDA methods implemented in e-banking and  the type of operation (according to categories described in Section 2) associated with each method.  As can be observed, the weakest methods on the left are mostly used for non-risk operations, and  the safest ones to authorize risky transfers. Survey results show that in many cases the professionals  that answered it, did not make considerable differences between operations types 1&2, and  something similar happened with operation types 3&4.

Applicability ranges from 1:  Not Applicable to 5: Highly Applicable  The most noticeable points arising from Table 1 are:   Most of the identified threats are highly applicable to the Username/password eIDA  method.   Moreover, only malicious code (i.e. threat 2c) and bank data breach (i.e. threat 4c) are  applicable to all eIDA methods.   Physical attacks against devices or tokens (i.e. threat 2a) are mostly applicable to the OTP  and eSignature eIDA methods categories.   Tampering of devices, (i.e. threat 2b) applicability depends on the robustness of the device.   Finally, phishing (i.e. threat 1c) apart from being applicable to Username/password and TAN  code list is also applicable to the OTP eIDA method category.  37  Summary of Threat Categories described in 4.1:  1 Threats against end-users.  a) Physical observation. b) Social engineering:. c) Phishing:  2 Threats against end-users’ devices.  a) Physical theft of token or device. b) Tampering (or replication) of token or device. c) Malicious  software (malware)  3 Threats against communication networks.  a) Pharming. b)Eavesdropping, Interception and Hijacking.  4 Threats against remote banking services.  a) Web Code injections against banking server. b).

This perception of security  professionals is summarised in Figure 7 Professional’s perceived strength, usability and cost.  The comparison of Figure 6 and Figure 7 confirms the well-known feeling that a common practice in  the financial sector consists of giving priority to usability over other criteria. The eIDA methods  considered more usable are also those financial institutions do implement more. The exception is  the Mob. Phone e-Signature, because there were few responses of professionals reporting having  used it, and for this reason, the statistical accuracy of that data is not very good. Nevertheless, we  have kept it because it’s an emerging authentication system well evaluated by the professionals that  already have implemented it. Figure 7 also shows the tendency lines of implementation factors  cheapness and strength, green and blue respectively. In general the weaker the eIDA methods are,  the cheaper to implement, except in the e-signature based eIDA methods, which, being the stronger  ones, are perceived as cheaper to implement than other weaker methods.  The usability restriction for implementing stronger eIDA method should be avoided through  adequate training and awareness of customers. The adoption strategy and the “user experience”  through adequate developments should also be improved.  Figure 7 Professional’s perceived strength, usability and cost  5.4 Adequacy of eIDA methods selection criteria  The survey asked the participants to indicate the criteria (several) that made them choose the  implementation of one eIDA method in preference to others. The identified selection criteria were:  - Adequacy to one or several customer segment.  - Usability from the point of view of the customer, provided their skills and professional  profile.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 26  - Covered Risk, i.e. the capability of the eIDA method to prevent the success of known threats  to the e-Banking authentication system.  - Efficiency of the investment, it is a more abstract concept, because combines both Risk  reduction achieved by the eIDA method and the implementation Cost.  - Implementation cost, the answers reflect that the participants have taken into consideration  the number of customers in the segment or profile to which the eIDA method is addressed.  - Implementation easiness, the survey shows that this is not a criterion to implement a eIDA  method.  According to the set of criteria used to select the implementation of one eIDA method in a given  environment, three groups of patterns have been identified. Figure 8 shows the relative relevance of  the different selection criteria for implementing eIDA methods for the low, medium and high  strength groups of operations respectively. In each group, the specific selection criteria for that  group have been encircled in blue. In the group of medium strength, the criteria that show the  difference with the low strength group of eIDA methods have been encircled in yellow, and those  criteria become the most important to select the stronger eIDA methods. The user segment whose  preferences attract more the attention for the selection of most of the authentication mechanisms is  the “retail customers”.  For the authentication mechanisms most suitable for low and medium risk operations the adequacy  to the retail customers and the usability are the dominant criteria. This means that the professionals  participating in the survey declared that they implemented the authentication (eIDA) mechanism  due to their feeling that it was more adequate to one or several customer segments, being the  “retail” segment the one reported more times, as well as other parameters of the eIDA methods.  Most of the participants indicated that several criteria were used to justify the implementation of  one authentication mechanism, being the usability the parameter selected most times, but not the  single one, e.g. the cost is also important in the selection of the eIDA method for the low risk  operations (see Figure 8 below).  The mechanisms suitable for intermediate risk operations are implemented due to its usability and  adequacy to the requirements of most of the users, and also by its efficiency and covered risk.  For the authentication mechanisms that look more adequate for riskier operations the covered risk  replaces the usability as top selection criteria, and more attention is paid to the corporate and  private bank customers.  All eIDA methods involving the use of hardware tokens are more suitable for corporate, private and  investor customer segments (Section 3.3). Distribution costs and usability (another device to be  carried) drawbacks are less relevant for those customer segments, because the number of  customers is significantly lower (<1% of retail users), and they are more conscious of their  transactional risk, thus, accepting stronger eIDA methods to be applied. New kinds of token devices  are now emerging, able to improve usability, e.g. token in credit card format; however, the  associated costs, are even higher, reducing the profile of the customers to which they could be  offered.  Circled in blue, are the most relevant criteria for each strength group, and in yellow the criteria that  show more changes, comparing the responses given to eIDA methods of each of the 3 groups. The  fact that the eIDA methods with lower strength are selected principally because of their usability,  and the stronger ones because of the covered risk, confirms the quality of the responses stating the  perceived strength.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 27  Figure 8 Comparison of criteria used to Select eIDA methods of Low (up), Medium (left) and High (right) Strength  The relationship between selection criteria and perceived strength is shown in Figure 9 below. This  figure shows some aspects of the responses that are worthy of comment, highlighted with yellow  ellipses:  - Mobile banking Application and Mobile OTP are selected for their Efficiency rather than for  the covered Risk.  - TAN code list is considered quite well in terms of covered risk, whilst it gets the worst  estimation of Efficiency.  - The discrepancy is even larger in all OTP eIDA methods, they are selected for the covered  Risk and not for their efficiency, probably because of the relative high cost of adopting them.  Those methods, together with the USB e-Signature, are considered the methods covering  more Risks, and are selected for this reason.  - The e-Signature eIDA methods are those considered more efficient than any other did.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 28  Figure 9 eIDA methods Selection criteria vs Perceived strength  5.5 eIDA methods Risk Reduction benefits  Figure 10 shows the summary of the survey participants reported loss and loss reduction per user  and incident, and the number of incidents associated with each eIDA method.  The most frequently used eIDA methods have also the higher risk, because they attract the interest  of criminals to research and develop more sophisticated attack patterns and tools, since they will be  applicable to more customers.  It is worth highlighting that the absolute loss reduction figures are per user involved in an incident.  The methods that show higher reduction of loss are also those that have been identified as having  higher loss per incident and user. This is because in general they are also considered stronger (OTP  based methods) and for this reason used to authorise operations of high value, so if they are faked  the loss for the user is high, but the graphic also shows that the number of incidents for the  strongest eIDA methods is very low. A special case are the Username/Password and Virtual  Keyboard, which are considered to introduce a surprisingly relative large loss reduction, but with  relative high Loss per user and incident, and large number of incidents per year (12 and 17).  The opposite case is the Token (USB, memory card) e-Signature, with relatively large number of  incidents and very low loss for each, because of the difficulty to use the token by other person rather  than the owner, and because this method is also used for low risk operations, in many cases as first  authentication method to log into the service.  In general, the results of the survey show that the lower number of incidents corresponds also to the  less implemented methods; mostly those based on mobile handset token OTP or e-signature.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 29  Figure 10 Reported incidents, loss and loss reduction  One factor that is not considered in this analysis is the customer skill. This is probably the reason  why the TAN code method is the one with more incidents reported per year, which, added to the  fact that, in some institutions it is used to grant access to riskiest transactions, it makes the actual  loss per incident relatively large also, resulting in the large Risk already mentioned.  Another perspective of the answers given in the survey is shown in Figure 11, where it is possible to  confirm that the riskiest eIDA methods are those used by a larger number of customers. They are  also those providing a larger reduction of loss, about 10% (notice that the pre-authentication Risk is  10 times larger than shown in the bars, to make uniform the ranges of values of both data sets). The  eIDA methods that provide more than 10% of loss reduction are:   e-Signature (mainly phone and chip stored key)   OTP (Challenge/Resp. token and SMS based)   Username/Password, probably because of the estimation of potential loss that could be  reached if the unsuccessful attempts to break the password would be successful.  Figure 11 Risk reduction  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 30  6 Risk analysis guidelines  The threats introduced in Section 4.1 have a different impact on the target environment, also  depending on the actor involved, e.g. a threat to the communication channel of a e-Banking service  represents a greater impact than what can be achieved if the victim is a retail customer. Thus, an ad- hoc Risk Analysis of the target environment is recommended. Moreover, in terms of  implementation, a definition of security aims - in accordance with the identified risk categories and  the access rights granted to the customer- should be taken into consideration within the Risk  Analysis. Considering that, when it comes to securing e-payments, there might be a difference  concerning security aims depending on the perspective of the stakeholder. Whereas an individual  bank would judge its security investments based on some business case considerations (i.e.  comparing the cost of payment for damages with the cost of preventing fraud), while a payment  system or a central bank, which is responsible for trust and security of the overall payment system  may have a different view.  Therefore, in accordance with the current regulatory proposals38 and with the aim to increase  efficiency of payment systems, additional considerations on the security aims for the various  transaction types should be taken into account. To give some examples:   for account information services relevant security aims could be to safeguard personal customer  information from unauthorized access;   for payments the security aim from a societal perspective would most likely be to support the  ‘finality of payment’ (i.e. the payment is irrevocable and legally enforceable) and ‘non- repudiation’ (i.e. the payment cannot successfully be disputed afterwards by the originator) in  order to withstand legal dispute.  The result of the survey shows that the most frequently used selection criteria for the authentication  mechanisms are the strength and the usability of a mechanism, with different weights depending on  the number and profile of the users, and the risk associated to the operations normally performed  by those users. However, given the above-mentioned regulation, which is coming into effect in the  coming years, some financial institutions may shift the criteria to merely: “comply with regulation”,  therefore an analysis with a detailed judgement on what will comply and what will not can be of  great benefit.  For this reason financial institutions should be encouraged to perform a quantitative risk analysis,  based on the actual data of number of incidents, customers involved and average loss per customer  in the organisation. Those fraud costs should be introduced in the calculation of the cost of non- implementing the authentication mechanisms, and compare that cost with the cost of implementing  them. The results of the survey show that most of the security experts of the financial institutions  have that information, but it is not taken into consideration in the decision process for the selection  of eIDA methods.  One good practice to improve and guarantee the ROSI (Return of Security Investment) could be to  make the risk analysis tailored to different customer profiles in the institution. This is important for  two reasons:  1. Some threats like spear phishing are targeting customers with large balances on their  accounts, so the impact of those attacks will be high on them. But application of  countermeasures to customers with other profiles, not targeted by them, would be useless.  38  European Directive on Payment Services , PSD: http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/framework/  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 31  2. The loss reduction and the number of incidents associated to an authentication mechanism  are also linked to the profile of the customer using it. The most qualified customers are  more likely to take care and appreciate the robustness of more sophisticated and stronger  authentication mechanisms, whilst customers perceiving less risk of being victims of an  attack or having losses in their accounts, would not take adequate care and may easily be  victims of credential steal or replication. The cost of introducing those kinds of measures to  unaware customers will be more expensive than introducing it to aware ones, because it  should include the cost of launching adequate awareness campaigns. Moreover, the loss  reduction will also be different, because the number of incidents per user and the loss per  user and incident will be linked to the consciousness of the customers and the kind of  operations they perform regularly through e-Banking applications.  All those considerations will result on different ROSI depending on the profile of the user  (awareness, kind of transactions, account balance, etc.), and the number of customers of that profile  in the financial institution. Another important aspect mentioned by some reviewers of this report is  the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). So far, the policy of many institutions has been to recover  customers’ losses, at least partially. But the new regulation of Data Protection will oblige them to  disclose threats if the number of victims or the impact on them is high, so it will not be so easy to  avoid damages to the public image of the institution, and the benefit of covering the losses of the  customers will not be so evident. Then the single way to preserve the image of the institution will be  to prevent the success of the attacks, introducing the potential loss of qualified customers if the  security mechanisms offered by the financial institution prove to be weak to protect the interests  and assets of the customers. In addition, the national central banks are appealing to the CSR of the  banks to protect the citizens and keep the fraud statistics in the country within “acceptable”  boundaries, compared with other countries.  In the next two sections there are some analysis to specific emerging authentication mechanisms.  6.1 Biometrics adoption related risks  The results of the survey show that very few professionals incorporate biometrics as an eIDA  method solution for e-banking. The rationale behind this phenomenon is that institutions must be  able to comply with the GDPR. There exist legal issues when dealing with personal information  (different legislation for every country). In Europe, a specific authorization from customers is  required, which is a difficult task, since the majority of people do not feel comfortable with granting  permission on the storage of their biometric information (i.e. personal body patterns). This, in  general, is only manageable if a strong juridical base exists and the use is adequate, relevant and not  abusive in correspondence with the goals and reasons for biometric data to be collected, used or  saved, resulting in an important challenge to be addressed.  Moreover, there exist high associated risks, mainly due to the potential attacks to a centralised data  base storage of biometrics parameters. The risk of compromise of the biometric information DB  (even if it’s encrypted, hashed, etc.) is real and non-acceptable for CISOs and directors of the e- banking sector. The sensitive nature of biometric information: data is compromised forever (i.e. it’s  not possible to change the hand print, Iris, fingerprints, etc.), resulting in both high risk, and great  responsibility to be accepted, especially if other eIDA methods are suitable.  Another important factor is the usability, since current technologies do not provide 100% of  accuracy at the first try. There are still open issues related to the False Rejection Rate (FRR) and the  False Acceptance Rate (FAR), which remain open even in scientific experiments or proof of concepts.  In summary, because of the associated risks, the financial sector is still not prepared to use biometry  neither as a unique authentication factor nor a second authentication factor.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 32  Biometry is used in emerging countries, where there are no other means of unique identification of  the persons, due to lack of governmentally supported credentials, and also in countries where  Personal Data protection is not a priority, like it is in EU.  Specialists are working in finding a solution to the high risk associated to using the biometry, and  one solution that is being analysed and starting to be implemented is the local storage of biometric  identification profiles. This has three advantages: 1) the responsibility of the storage is transferred to  the end user, 2) the chances of a successful threat to steal large amount of biometric information is  low, because the threat should be successful on many devices and stores, 3) the biometric  identification vector doesn’t have to travel over the network.  6.2 Mobile phones related risks  Advances in mobile technology, currently allow the use of mobile devices in a wide range of services  and applications. An important reason for involving mobile phones in authentication systems such as  OTP systems, is that, most users already have one, and therefore, no extra hardware needs to be  bought, deployed or supported. Moreover, since a mobile phone is considered a highly personal  device, the number of incidents due to losing it are relatively low, especially compared with the  hardware token devices.  The most common authentication solution involving mobile devices is the SMS-based OTP. A user  willing to make an online transaction will receive an OTP from the server. The OTP will be delivered  to the mobile device on an SMS. As it can be observed from this study the SMS-based OTP is one of  the most implemented authentication methods by the financial sector, nevertheless, SMS-based  OTP also convey clear disadvantages, which include, the associated costs, roaming, latency and more  importantly the associated security risks, SMS-based OTPs are vulnerable to a different attacks, such  as, the Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. The “Eurograbber” incident (see 4.2.2.2) showed how  two factor authentication based on SMS-OTP was circumvented, resulting in a 36 Million Euros loss.  To avoid this threat customers and e-Banking applications should avoid displaying phone numbers  associated to the bank account through Internet, whether displayed or modified, even with assumed  secure communication channel. Adequate training on this sense has to be launched to both of them.  An alternative to the SMS-OTP is the Mobile phone e-Signature, which greatly reduces the possibility  of a successful MITM attack since credentials are protected in the secure element (SE) of the mobile  phone. However, the majority of SE implementations rely on a third party, which does not provide a  suitable solution to stakeholders such as the financial institutions, as they would certainly like to  have more autonomous and cost effective solutions for their mobile payments implementations.  Moreover, the limited size of physical SE dramatically affects the number of applications that could  be placed in those SE. Financial institutions should promote joint ventures with the organisations  that manage the content of those SE, in order to improve the trustworthiness between them.  Another currently implemented solution is the mobile e-banking application, which is able to provide  enhanced security if a private key is installed. However due to the nature of mobile devices,  important security risks are also present, such as malware hosted on fake applications. Moreover,  the development of applications is not always aligned with current security best practices. Best  practices like “security by design”, secure storage and all actors involved in the process must  guarantee delivery and integrity of applications: software developers, financial institutions and  customers.  Following the same direction, an emerging solution is the mobileOTP, which consists on iinstalling  the software tokens on the mobile phone. A key advantage of the mobile software token is that  there are no new devices for customers, since customers already own the device, which they already  carry everywhere. Another advantage regarding the mOTP solution is the ability for the software  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 33  tokens to be distributed and updated immediately, and without logistical planning, since the mOTP  token consists of an application that only need to be loaded on the mobile device. Thus, mOTP have  become a more reliable deployment method than hardware tokens, nevertheless, as in mobile e- banking application, the software tokens also inherit the same security vulnerabilities from the  mobile phone. In fact mOTP could be considered a particular case of mobile e-Banking application.  Many organisations use mobile phones as support for the second authentication factor. Mobile  phones may be considered “something the user possesses” for the purpose of implementation of  two-factor authentication, from the technical perspective. However, from the legal perspective,  mobile devices cannot necessarily be acceptable for attributing a specific transaction to its  originator. For that purpose, e-signature tools have to be used, and they can be implemented in  mobile devices or PCs. The mobile device on its own is not able to deliver evidence that a specific  transaction could only have occurred with the approval of the legitimate owner of the mobile, it  requires specific software and adequately installed private key to do so.  In summary, mobile device is an emerging authentication solution that can be seen as “something  the user has”, when using it for identification purposes. Nevertheless, for attributing a specific  operation to its originator, it’s not able to provide enough non-repudiation evidence that a specific  operation has been performed by the owner of the device.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 34  7 Recommendations / Best practices guidelines  This section introduces the main challenges found in our research, and, to overcome these  challenges, a set of recommendations are proposed. The recommendations are grouped in  Challenges, which express the main objectives to be achieved by the recommendations grouped  there.  Those recommendations have been  7.1 Challenge: Promote Adequacy of eIDA method to Context  The selection of an eIDA method should be done considering the full context of the operation and,  users segments.  7.1.1 Rec.1: eIDA method Selection proportionality  e-Finance Authentication mechanisms strength have to be proportional to the Risk associated to  the operations they grant access.  When customers interact with the e-Banking service, they may perform operations of different level  of risk (Section 2 above):  1. General information,  2. Read account balance,  3. E-Payments: Low-risk or low-value Transfers, as defined in the PSD.  4. Transactions: Transfers of funds not matching level 3 requirements.  Figure 6 shows the current practices in the sector.  7.1.2 Rec.2. Use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) for medium to high-risk transactions.  For medium and high risk operations, a strategy of using at least two authentication mechanisms  that are mutually independent, where one is non-replicable and other non-reusable, exchanging  credentials through different communication channels or devices should be implemented. Non-re- usability may be implemented by linking the authentication (e.g. OTP challenge) to the amount  and payee of every transaction.  Many organisations use mobile phones as support for the second authentication factor. The  adequacy of the authentication mechanisms for low, medium or high risky operations is described in  section 5.4 above. It shows that the selection criteria used by the financial institutions already takes  into consideration the different profiles of customers as well as the efficiency and strength of the  eIDA method proposed. The aim of this recommendation is to shift the criteria to select the eIDA  method used for medium level of strength: from its usability, to its covered risk and efficiency in  protecting customers’ assets.  Most banks already apply more than one authentication mechanism to grant access to different  types of operations. Currently most used combinations are PWD, sometimes with additional security  improvement methods like Virtual Keyboard, complemented with: SMS OTP (29%), TAN (25%), Hw.  OTP (18%), MeBA (11%), Mob. OTP (9%), Chall.Hw OTP (8%), whilst other combinations are also  reported. Figure 12  shows the relative weight of the different combinations of authentication  mechanisms reported in the survey through the size of the circles.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 35  Figure 12 Combination of eIDA methods in authentication chains  1. From these observations, it’s worth to highlight that: Accepted common practice for Read  Access operations (not access to sensitive data39) is to use at least Password, Improved with  some additional mechanism(s), e.g. virtual keyboard or Mobile e-Banking App (MeBA),  depending on which kind of device is used by the customer for main (first) access.  2. The Recommendation for medium and high Risky Operations/Transactions is to Involve a 2nd  device or something the user has40, e.g.: mobile phone handset41, TAN code list42, eSign  private key, hardware token OTP. The actual implemented method on each environment  takes into consideration the perceived usability, mainly for the eIDA methods implemented  for retail customer segment, but the stronger methods should have priority in the selection  39  DPA have defined what is sensitive financial data  40 This recommendation is shared with the ECB SecuRe Pay forum, which in their “Recommendations for the  security of internet payments” (published on 31 January 2013 on  http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/recommendationssecurityinternetpaymentsoutcomeofpcfinalv ersionafterpc201301en.pdf) states: “Strong customer authentication is a procedure based on the use of  two or more of the following elements – categorised as knowledge, ownership and inherence: i) something  only the user knows, e.g. static password, code, personal identification number; ii) something only the user  possesses (Strong authentication element), e.g. token, smart card, mobile phone; iii) something the user is,  e.g. biometric characteristic, such as a fingerprint. In addition, the elements selected must be mutually  independent, i.e. the breach of one does not compromise the other(s). At least one of the elements should  be non-reusable and non-replicable (except for inherence), and not capable of being surreptitiously stolen  via the internet. The strong authentication procedure should be designed in such a way as to protect the  confidentiality of the authentication data”.  41  It is considered a common feeling amongst experts that mobile devices are “something the customer has”.  Some people consider the mobile handset an object of more ownership than even a credit card, because it  is less frequently left “unattended”. Security of mobile phone devices has been analysed in section 6.2.  42  Some experts consider questionable to qualify TAN code lists as ownership, because of its easiness to be  replicated. The impact of this threat can be minimised with complementary security measures, like  adequate user training against phishing, awareness about risks of replicating and leaving unattended the  TAN code list, “secure delivery” to the customer, etc.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 36  process. On top of this, the actual risk in the environment of the financial institution should  be measured (see justification in section 6 Risk analysis guidelines and Recommendation in  7.3.1 Rec5. Environment risk analysis).  7.2 Challenge: Improve the knowledge and the behaviour of customers and  professionals  7.2.1 Rec3. Professionals’ training and awareness  Continuous training of professionals, to improve their perception of the actual risk associated to  the e-Finance transactions, and the authentication mechanisms, keeping in mind the last threat  patterns discovered by criminals. Professionals should also share their awareness with customers,  to keep them continuously informed about incidents caused by common threats such as phishing or  social engineering.  From the result of the survey, comparing the perceived strength, the reported number of incidents  and average loss per incident, it looks like the professionals had a “feeling” that does not correspond  with the data they report. E.g., Figure 9 shows that TAN code strength perception is at the same  level as mobile phone signature or OTP, whilst TAN code is selected because of its covered Risk twice  than the mobile-based methods. If professionals were aware of those figures of risk, awareness,  costs, the eIDA method would be selected consequently with them. Therefore, it is worth to  recommend the dissemination of actual Incident data amongst professionals of e-Banking  applications, to improve the matching between their perception of strength and the actual reality.  7.2.2 Rec4. Enforcement of customer’s eIDA method security & usability perception  The professionals of the e-Financial institutions should inform their customers about the usability  and need of the safer authentication mechanisms required to have an adequate protection to  their assets, in order to make them to feel comfortable enough using them.  The perceived strength of the authentication mechanisms by users and professionals is quite similar,  but in most of the cases, the perception of usability by the professionals is much larger than for the  users (see Figure 13).  Figure 13: Perceived usability by users and professionals  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 37  Since usability is one of the most popular criteria for selecting authentication mechanisms in most of  the e-banking applications, this difference of perception needs important attention and analysis.  One extreme example worth mentioning is the virtual keyboard, perceived as easy to use by  professionals (8/10) and un-usable by users (5.4/10), probably because nobody has explained them  how to use it, its advantages to protect from keyloggers, or because the method is required to users  accessing through devices un-suitable for it, like mobile handsets without touch-screen.  7.3 Challenge: Improve the security of the e-Finance environment  7.3.1 Rec5. Environment risk analysis  Financial organisations and e-commerce merchants must perform specific risk analysis for their  environments, taking into consideration the actual loss, number of incidents, number and skills of  customers involved, and actual vulnerabilities of the authentication methods available, in order to  be able to choose the ones that most effectively reduce the number of incidents and loss, i.e. the  risk to lose money.  The reduction of the risk (analysed in section 5.5) and the number of incidents should be one of the  selection criteria, mainly for the secondary authentication mechanism (used to complement the first  one for all operations, or to grant access to the most risky operations). The average figures of risk  reduction in euros are shown in Figure 11 . But each organisation has to perform its own analysis,  based on their number of customers of each segment, their readiness to accept some authentication  mechanisms, the economic value (risk) of the transactions they perform, etc. (See section 5.5  above).  7.3.2 Rec6. Context based or continuous authentication  Customer authentication should be complemented with the implementation of a context-based  authentication strategy, tailored to customer behaviour profile (e.g. transfer destination account),  segment (e.g. total amount in operations) and the operation risk (e.g. destination country, black  lists).  A more complete list of most commonly used context authentication and user behaviour parameters  is as described in Section 3.2.  7.3.3 Rec7. User device security testing and evaluation  The security testing and evaluation of the device used to access the service has to be validated  directly or indirectly by the PSP.  Mobile devices are becoming vulnerable to several security threats such as malware attacks (see  section 6.2. Mobile phones related risks), where attackers abuse them for transactions without any  interaction of the legitimate owner of the mobile phone, just as it has been possible in normal PCs  since years ago. In June 2012, ENISA recommended financial institutions to “Assume all PCs are  infected”43. Therefore, static security analysis of any device used by the customers to access e- Banking services should be performed, in order to estimate the degree of compromise of user’s  device. Some kind of analysis can be done remotely by the server accessed by the customer (e.g.  browser version), but only customers can install and run anti-malware software on their devices, and  43  High Roller ENISA’s flash note: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/eu-cyber-security-agency- enisa-201chigh-roller201d-online-bank-robberies-reveal-security-gaps  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 38  for this purpose have to be trained and convinced about their own interest on having their devices  protected against infection.  7.3.4 Rec8. Device registration  The concept of “something the user has” can be extended to the platform used to access the  service, and thus it is recommended to register any Device, Browser, or Mobile Application used  by the customer. A real time validation of the authenticity of the device would be required.  This registration will prevent customers from being impersonated by somebody that has been able  to replicate some credentials of the customer, using specific different credentials and process to  authorise new devices for the user.  7.4 Challenge: Improve the security of e-Finance application development  and distribution  7.4.1 Rec9. Secure e-banking application development  Technology providers must guarantee secure e-banking application development, taking into  consideration actual threats to Operating Systems (e.g. mobile attack vectors).  Special emphasis has to be given to managing personal data, for which purpose specific data security  analysis (persistency, access control) have to be implemented during the development phases.  Another security issue that may have strong impact on the adoption of strong eIDA methods is the  implementation process and tools, for two reasons:  - eIDA method incorrectly implemented may have security back doors or vulnerabilities  - eIDA method with inadequate or too complex implementation tools will not be accepted  by customers.  In the case of mobile phone applications, it is also recommended to develop applications to be  executed within Secure Execution Environment, using available secure elements that will make them  more robust against emerging threats, before those threats become reality.  7.4.2 Rec10. E-Banking applications distribution  Distribution of e-Banking applications has to be made through trusted channels, reputable sites  that guarantee that applications have been tested for security.  It is very difficult for customers to validate the authenticity of e-Banking applications on their own,  because criminals have demonstrated their ability to sign fake applications with trustworthy  software signing certificates that can overcome the normal installation filters in many devices.  For this reason the use of software distribution platforms (software marketplaces or e-Banking  websites) that guarantee that they have performed security tests on the applications is very  important for the security of the device on which the application is installed and to guarantee that  the application will be executed as expected by the developers.  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 39  8 Conclusions  Those recommendations are intended to improve the security of eIDA methods in the landscape of  the eFinance sector shown up by the results of the survey launched by ENISA and replied by users  and professionals. Their implementation will be responsibility of the e-Finance and e-Payment  institutions, in some cases because they are guidelines to achieve their responsibility to preserve the  security of the assets of their customers, and in others, because they are mandatory to fulfil security  requirements expressed in the PSD.  The recommendations also: a) reinforce those made by ECB to implement Internet payments and  customer authentication44, and b) help financial institutions and payment service providers to  implement the new Payment Service Directive (PSD2).  44  “Recommendations for the security of internet payments” published on 31 January 2013 on the ECB’s  website  http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/recommendationssecurityinternetpaymentsoutcomeofpcfinalversi onafterpc201301en.pdf  eID  Authentication  methods  in  e-Finance and  e-Payment services  Current practices and Recommendations  Report, December 2013  Page 40  9 References  [1]  comScore Data Gem, \"http://ww.comscoredatamine.com/,\" 2012.

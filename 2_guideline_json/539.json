These networks represent the fabric of the future information society and provide the means for the  single digital market. Some parts of these communication networks are also vital for the operations  of Critical Infrastructures which are fundamental for the function of modern society.  An attack or a large scale outage affecting the communication networks assets supporting Critical  Infrastructure can have cascading effects and affect large part of the population or vital functions of  society. But which are exactly those network assets that can be identified as Critical Information  Infrastructure and how we can make sure they are secure and resilient?  This study aims to tackle the problem of identification of Critical Information Infrastructures in  communication networks. The goal is to provide an overview of the current state of play in Europe  and depict possible improvements in order to be ready for future threat landscapes and challenges.  As it was possible to underline, currently a significant number of Member States present a low level  of maturity and lack a structured approach regarding identification of Critical Information  Infrastructure in communication networks and this can pose severe risks regarding the everyday  increasing dependency of the vital functions of the society on these networks.  Moreover, based on the findings of the survey, the discussion with stakeholders and the analysis of  the different approaches already in place, it was possible to highlight the following challenges in  identifying CIIs assets and services:   detailed list of critical services is not always present and should be tailored per Member State   criticality criteria for the identification of critical assets is a challenging process especially  regarding internal and external interdependencies   effective collaboration between public sector and the private sector is fundamental in  identifying and protecting CII assets and services and should start from asset identification.  Considering this multi-layered and complex environment and raising threat scenarios, the following  recommendations emerged for Member State  and operators of critical infrastructures to foster  security and resilience of CIIs over communication networks in Europe:  Member States should clearly identify Critical Information Infrastructures if not already covered in  their Critical Infrastructure activities. Not all MS have clearly defined the asset perimeter of Critical  Information Infrastructures. For this reason, if not already covered by the Critical Infrastructure  definition, Member states should clearly define which specific network assets are covered and should  be secure and resilient.  Member States who are starting to work on the identification of CII assets should cooperate with  stakeholders involved in the operations of Critical Information Infrastructures.  Effective  collaboration between public sector (Government & mandated Agencies) and the private sector is  fundamental in protecting CII assets and services. For the identification of Critical Information  Infrastructures in communication networks, the involvement of two categories of stakeholders should  be pursued:  • operators of Critical Infrastructures  • network operators  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  v  given the complementarity of their perspectives, responsibilities and expertise.  Member States who are starting to work on the identification of CIIs should adopt a methodology  for the identification of critical network assets and services, using one or a mix of the proposed  solutions in this study that better fits the need of the MS. It is worth-noting that the purpose here is  to present the Member States with a portfolio of methodological approaches – rather than a one size  ‘fits-all’ methodology – so that each Member State may choose the approach or a combination of  approaches that suits better to its own specific characteristics and needs.  Member States who base their identification of CIIs on critical services should develop a list of these  services and assess internal and external interdependencies. While assessing the criticality of  services, infrastructures and supporting network assets, MS should define criticality criteria in order to  identify the critical assets and examine the system in its entirety rather than per constituent. At least  four types of dependencies should be taken into consideration:  • Interdependencies within a critical sector (intra-sector)  • Interdependencies between critical sectors (cross-sector).  • Interdependencies among data network assets.  Moreover dependencies can be found at the national and international level (cross-border), further  complicating the task to have a complete overview.  Member States should foster baseline security guidelines for communication networks used for  critical services. To ensure the resilience of critical networks, the Critical Infrastructure operator or  asset owner should adopt security guidelines to be used also at procurement stage. For this reason a  checklist with baseline security guidelines for communication networks used for critical services should  be made available to align practices across the EU.  Member States should foster the adoption of automated procedures for CIIs tagging in order to be  prepared to face future challenges.  To foster the security of critical networks, MS should work  together with CIIs asset owners in developing a common approach to the ‘Tagging’ of CII assets. This  could allow automated-prioritized handling of incidents affecting Critical Information infrastructures.

These networks represent the fabric of the future information society and provide the means for the  single digital market. Some parts of these communication networks are also vital for the operations  of Critical Infrastructures (CIs) which are fundamental for the function of modern society.  Every day, the majority of Critical Infrastructures such as water management, heating supply chains  and public transport systems among others, depend on the correct function of communication  networks that support their operations. These supportive systems and networks, commonly referred  to as Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs), are core pillars for the function of the economy and  society and a cyber-attack or an outage affecting these assets and services could have cascading  effects on large part of the population1.  In order to properly identify and secure these critical network assets, ENISA focuses this year on how  Member States (MS) identify CIIs in communication networks in Europe.  Scope of the document  Identification of Critical information infrastructure is the first step in the process to secure and protect  the availability of critical assets. Several Member States have launched different initiatives regarding  this topic while others are starting now to develop their own approaches. This study analyses how  Member States have developed methodologies to identify CIIs in communication networks.  The definition of CII is taken from the Council Directive 2008/114/EC on the identification and  designation of European Critical Infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their  protection2.‘’ICT systems that are Critical Infrastructures for themselves or that are essential for the  operation of Critical Infrastructures (telecommunications, computers/software, Internet, satellites,  etc.) “  Figure 1: Perimeter of the study - Data and IP networks  1 Buldyrev, S.

Official Journal L, 345(23), 12.  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  2  In this report the centre of interest is communication networks, including the Internet, public data  communication networks and relevant assets in private data communication networks. The perimeter  of public versus private network infrastructure is depicted in the following table. Private networks can  be deployed within the private perimeter (e.g. LAN, Wi-Fi), as well as connecting private networks to  each other and to the external world.  The separation between public and private is not necessarily  spatial (e.g. for wireless connectivity). Long distance (WAN) private networks are commonly available  to companies that operate transmission/transportation infrastructures, which can in parallel be used  for private communication network (e.g. fibre optic cable) deployment.  Figure 2: Perimeter of the study - Private and Public IP and data communication networks  Target audience  This document is aimed at Member States that are interested in identifying CIIs assets and services in  the area of communication networks. The target community consists of decision makers in mandated  agencies/functions or National Regulatory Authorities for communication networks (NRAs) in charge  of the definition of methodologies to identify Critical Information Infrastructures.  Due the multi-layered interdependencies involved in Critical Information infrastructure protection,  this study covers also the perspective of critical infrastructure assets owners and operators that should  be involved in any related initiative in the security and resilience of these assets.  Goal  The goal of this study is to provide an overview of existing approaches in identification of CIIs across  Europe and understand the dynamics of this complex multi-layered environment which involves not  only operators of critical infrastructures but also network operators and mandated agencies. In doing  so, also gaps and future challenges will be underlined and recommendations will be proposed to foster  security and resilience of these critical communication networks. Specifically, this study investigates  how to  1. define Critical sectors and Critical services supported by electronic communication networks  2. identify CIIs assets and services which support these critical services  3. strengthen & protect the identified CII in concert with the asset owners.  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  3  From the point of view of CI/CII assets owners and operators, the objective is to support them in the  identification of their CIIs assets and ensure the protection of their critical assets in concert with the  mandated agency of the MS. The aim is to identify the network assets that needs to be secure, and in  case of outages, ensure resilient interconnections. In absence or with minimal availability, services  essential to Critical Infrastructures can severely hamper the functioning of society.  Methodology  The methodology for this study is organized in three steps:  1. Information gathering:  o Desktop research of 760 documents regarding MS legislation and initiatives in the  area of infrastructure security and resilience including identification of public and  private stakeholders being responsible for managing these initiatives, frameworks for  categorization of assets in electronic communication networks, with special focus on  CIIs and relevant research  o 35 online surveys  answered by NRAs, Cyber Security Agencies, Contingency Agencies,  CERTs, network operators and operators of Critical Infrastructures  o 11 focused interviews performed with NRA, Cyber security Agencies, network  operators and operators of Critical Infrastructures.  2. Analysis: based on the result of the desktop research, an analysis was performed to identify  current maturity levels in identification of critical sectors, assets and services, good practises  and possible challenges.  3. Validation session: to validate the findings and propose a portfolio of solutions that would fit  all needs:  o Validation session workshop http://europa.eu/!qU87Rd with cyber security agencies,  network operators, operators of Critical Infrastructure and academia.  o Extensive online feedback via NRAs, Cyber Security Agencies, Network operators and  operators of Critical Infrastructures who participated at each part of the study, EU  Critical Infrastructure point of contacts in each MS and ENISA Internet Infrastructure  Security and Resilience Reference Group.  Structure of this document  This document is structured as follows:   Introduction - Introduction and general overview   Chapter 2 - Outline of the MS status regarding the identification of critical sectors, assets and  services and definition of critical information infrastructures   Chapter 3 - Summary of the perspective of the different stakeholders involved   Chapter 4 - Overview of methodologies of identification of critical information infrastructures   Chapter 5 - Possible improvement to fill existing gaps and be prepared for future challenges   Chapter 6 - Recommendations  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  4  2 Overview of the Member States’ approaches to CIIs identification  During the information collection period, an effort was made to depict the current status in the 28 EU  Members States regarding the definition of CIIs and the methodologies to identify specific network  assets and services.  Thanks to desktop research analysis, the 35 online survey responses and 11  interviews with the relevant stakeholders, it was possible to collect information to have an overview  of the current definition in 23 Member States and related research. The goal was to depict in which  country a clear definition of CII is present and which is the level of CII identification methodologies  and related activities.  Starting from the European definition3, the goal was to recognise how MS identify CIIs at national level  and develop their own definition and methodologies to translate it in actual network assets and  services that need to be secured and resilient. For this, all relevant and available legislation in each  MS, with focus on communication networks, was analysed. For reference please refer to Annex I –  Legislation in EU and MS.  The following key findings and conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of the information that has  been collected regarding legal, regulatory and strategic initiatives undertaken in 23 Member States  concerning the identification of critical sectors, assets and services.  The main starting point for identifying CII assets and services are the CI depending on them, given that  critical infrastructures (e.g. transportation, finance, electric power and water) are increasingly  dependent on the evolving information infrastructure for a variety of information management,  communications and control functions4. In turn, CIs are defined on the basis of critical sectors /  services.  Figure 3: Critical sectors and infrastructures identification flow  In the Green Paper on a European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection5, the European  Commission provides an indicative list of 11 critical sectors:  i. Energy  ii. Information, Communication Technologies (ICT)  iii. Water  iv. Food  v. Health  vi. Financial  3 Council Directive 2008/114/EC on the identification and designation of European Critical Infrastructures and  the assessment of the need to improve their protection :‘’ICT systems that are Critical Infrastructures for  themselves or that are essential for the operation of Critical Infrastructures (telecommunications,  computers/software, Internet, satellites, etc.) “  4  Centre for European Policy Studies (2010), “Protecting Critical Infrastructure in the EU”, CEPS Task Force  Report, 2010  5  Commission of the European Communities (2005), “Green Paper on a European Programme for Critical  Infrastructure Protection”, COM (2005) 576 final  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  5  vii. Public & Legal Order and Safety  viii. Civil Administration  ix. Transport  x. Chemical and Nuclear Industry  xi. Space and Research  This list is not used as such across all MS; rather, countries have put in place their own list of critical  sectors since not all sectors are relevant for all countries. Furthermore, based on the special  characteristics and peculiarities of each country, the list may need to be enriched with new sectors.  For example, the nuclear industry is only relevant for countries that have nuclear plants, whereas a  few countries have identified as critical the emergency and / or rescue services, which are not included  in the list proposed by the European Commission.  It is also important to underline how some countries may use different terms as it is the case of France  where the term “point d’importance vitale” is used or Estonia which defines vital services instead of  critical sectors.  The table below gives an overview of the mapping of the critical sectors identified by each country6.  Sectors Energy ICT Water Food Health Financial  Public  &  Legal  Order  Civil  Admin.

Firstly, it was understood that the significance of CII Protection has been acknowledged by the  majority of the Member States. This has been dealt with either in the framework of their CI Protection  programmes and initiatives or as part of the development of their cybersecurity strategies.  This means  that usually there are no dedicated strategies for the protection of CII but rather refinements and  adjustments are made to existing strategies and concepts on CI protection in order to accommodate  issues related to the protection of information infrastructure.  Secondly, based on the information gathered, it was possible to note that that there are different  maturity levels with regards to CII activities across the MS. On the basis of the collected information,  four different maturity levels could be defined as presented in the following table:  Table 2: Maturity levels in identification of CIIs  These maturity levels range from the absence of activities related to the identification of CII to the  establishment of specific measures for the identification and protection of CII assets. Based on the  information gathered, it was possible to place the analysed MS on the following continuum that  represents their indicative state of the art.  Level 1  Absence of activities related to the protection of critical information  infrastructures. Under this category fall MS that have just transposed the EC  Directive 114/2008 and have identified only transport and energy as critical  sectors.  Level 2  Identification of the ICT sector as one of the critical sectors that should be  addressed. Under this category may fall MS that have acknowledged the  Information and Communication Technologies sector as one of the critical sectors  for the maintenance of the vital societal functions.  Level 3  Development of a general methodological framework for the identification of CI  assets. Member States that have in place a detailed methodological approach for  the identification of CI assets and services, with specific steps and responsibilities  assigned to involved stakeholders, may be classified into this category. Since the  focus is on CII, It is a prerequisite that MS have acknowledged ICT as one of the  critical sectors.  Level 4  Development of a definition for CII and establishment of specific criteria for the  identification of CII assets. Under this category fall the Member States that are  mostly advanced in the area of CIIP and have taken specific measures for the  identification and protection of CII assets.  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  7  Figure 4: CI identification maturity continuum and MS positioning  As presented in this section, 17 Member States of the 23 covered in this study have addressed the  issue of identification of critical sectors.  In these MS there is a list of critical sectors and in certain  cases also subsectors and related critical services. The lists have been prepared taking into account  national priorities, related EC Directives and specific country characteristics. A structured  methodology is present only in 5 MS while the other MS are either at the early stage of CII  identification or are defining the legislative decrees for the definition of the methodology in this  moment.  When focusing on identification of CIIs in the area of communication networks, from the online survey  and the follow-up interviews it was possible to identify that:   a significant number of Member States present a low level of maturity and lack a structured  approach   challenges are posed by the identification of critical services and the complexity of the  definition of criticality criteria in order to identify the critical assets.   there is the need for effective collaboration between public sector (Government &  mandated Agencies) and the private sector, which often controls numerous critical  infrastructures  The major considerations can be summarized as follows:   The differences observed in the CIIP maturity level across the various MS seem to be aligned with  the variance observed in the overall MS maturity concerning ICT as illustrated by the Network  Readiness Index (see table below). The World Economic Forum's Networked Readiness Index (NRI)7  measures the propensity for countries to exploit the opportunities offered by information and  communications technology (ICT) taking into consideration ten factors. An analysis of the NRI  results shows that while many European countries are leading in the rankings, many others lag  behind.  Figure 5: The Network readiness index (2014) in EU8  7  The World Economic Forum's Networked Readiness Index (NRI) http://www.weforum.org/issues/global- information-technology/the-great-transformation/network-readiness-index  8 World Economic Forum (2014), The Global Information Technology Report 2014, p.19  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  8   A comparison of the implementation level with the NRI of the individual MS suggests that MS with  lower NRI rankings exhibit also a lower regulatory maturity level regarding CIIP. This can be justified  by the lower degree of ICT adoption for the support of critical services. This  pushes down in the  scale of priorities the need to focus on the identification and protection of critical information  infrastructures.  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  9  3 Stakeholders involved in the identification of CII assets and services  As underlined in the previous chapter, an issue that emerged from the online survey and the follow- up interviews is the fundamental need for effective collaboration between public sector  (Government & mandated Agencies) and the private sector, which often controls numerous critical  infrastructures. This is due to the complexity of interdependencies, the role of the asset owners and  efforts to make these assets secure and resilient.  When it comes to CIIs, given the criticality of certain services offered to the public, the population and  the geographic scope supported, a business risk may become national risk, and in such a case, the  service providers are defined by the mandated agency as operators of CIs.  The operators of CIs need to identify and classify the communication network infrastructures  supporting critical applications, according to their criticality. They are responsible for determining the  core processes, the respective applications and, as a last step, the network assets and services  (connectivity solutions) which are used to operate the respective applications. An asset can be critical  related to (a) the business value, (b) the scope of the population served or (c) the technical  dependence of critical applications and this classification depends on the sector and the role of the CI.  For these reasons, parallel to the mapping of different approaches on identification in the different  MS, an effort was made to investigate the views of the stakeholders that could be involved in the  identification of critical assets and service used in communication networks, namely:   Operators of Critical Infrastructure,   Electronic Communication Providers,   National Telecommunications Regulatory Authorities   Cybersecurity Agencies.  In the following paragraphs, the main points that were highlighted in the framework of the online  survey and the follow-up interviews are summarized per stakeholder category.  3.1 Operators of Critical Infrastructures 9  Operators of CIs are the asset owners and commonly face major risks which may have a detrimental  effect on society and the depending vital societal functions. These risks may be directly linked to the  critical service provided or emerging from activities that are not related to the core business of the  operator of CIs. During the discussion with this type of stakeholder it was underlined that:   Operators of CIs are in charge of operating and securing their infrastructures, whereas in  several Member States they are legally obliged to carry out a risk assessment analysis and  submit business continuity plans to the responsible Government authorities.   In certain industry sectors they are also obliged to comply with certain regulations which may  have impact on the operation, infrastructures and data networks used, an example would be  the Finance sector.   In order to comply with regulations, operators of CIs classify their infrastructures and  processes as well as the respective supporting applications/information.   In certain cases, operators of CIs have a highly diversified portfolio of services and respective  infrastructures. Such operators need to apply a diversified approach according to service  criticality.  9 The terms ‘Critical Service Provider’ and ‘Critical Infrastructure Operator’ reflect highly complementary roles  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  10  3.2 Electronic Communications Operators  Several network operators participated in the study, providing useful insights regarding their role in  securing and protecting CIIs and the level of maturity of the market, in general. Network operators  are not responsible for classifying infrastructures as CIIs. Usually the designated operator of CI is  required to identify their relevant CII assets and services and prepare a plan to better protect them.  This also means that contracts and relevant Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are renewed, based on  the operator of CIs demands.  Network operators expect to see an increasing demand for secure and resilient connectivity solutions,  based on evolving technology, and need to prepare for this. Thus the network operators, active in a  competitive market and complex evolving technological landscape, have to continuously improve, in  order to be able to provide increasingly resilient and secure CII, connectivity solutions and  interconnection services, based on more demanding SLAs.  Specifically:   Network operators are not responsible for classifying infrastructures as CIIs. Currently there  is no such legal obligation in any Member States, and such a responsibility is not foreseen to  date. Τhis may be a MS responsibility, in certain cases legislated but, as it was possible to note  above, this varies in maturity and efforts. Therefore the designated operator of CI is commonly  required to identify their relevant CII assets and services and prepare a plan to better protect  them. This may involve enhancing security and resilience features of the connectivity solutions  which support their CI(s). This also means that contracts and relevant SLA are renewed, based  on the requirements of the operator of CIs and specific procurement requirements are  defined for those assets and services which are defined as critical and which will be covered  in the chapter ad-hoc.   The process to strengthen and/or enhance security and resilience of CII is usually business- driven in order to fulfil the CI operator’s requirements. In certain cases, CI operators are driven  by the need to comply with regulations, with implications on network security and resilience.  In other words, the network operators receive service requests from the CI operator or asset  owner to render their connectivity services more secure and resilient, to guarantee the  operations of the CIIs enabling their critical services.   In order to ensure the resilience of critical external networks, the CI operator or asset owner  set related requirements at the procurement stage and uses multiple and physically separated  network paths. In addition, they put in place SLAs. Regarding the security of external  networks, CI operators or asset owners follow different strategies. All CI operators or asset  owners set requirements at the procurement phase for business data protection on the  external network. Sometimes the network operator is constrained by external factors when  deploying resilient connectivity, such as administrative permissions, delays introduced by  other service providers of the same operator of CIs. Thus SLAs should take into account such  situations, to protect the NOs.   Network operators expect to see an increasing demand for secure and resilient connectivity  solutions, based on evolving technology, and need to prepare for this. Thus the network  operators, active in a competitive market and a complex evolving technological landscape,  have to continuously improve, in order to be able to provide increasingly resilient and secure  CII (connectivity solutions and interconnection services), based on more demanding SLAs.  Therefore, they have to be able to offer connectivity solutions with higher redundancy &  increased capacity exploiting all access technologies available (wired & wireless). Moreover,  they have to be able to offer complex SLAs related to connection  availability/performance/security.  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  11   Regarding the network operators’ Business/Operations Support Systems (BSS/OSS)  functionality to support internal processes related to CIIs, the overall impression is that  currently there is no particular deployment of functionality to support a differentiated  provisioning & assurance process for CII related solutions. The sophisticated OSS approach  involves the deployment of an SLA management platform which may auto- interact with the  network assets ‘linked’ to the ‘customer facing service’, in order to support a complex and  demanding SLA.   The evolution of CII related SLAs, requested by the CI operators, to assure the provision of  increasingly resilient and secure CII, will apply pressure for the deployment of more  sophisticated BSS/OSS; this in return shall allow for automated-systematic handling of  complex SLAs, while containing the operation cost.   Automation of provisioning and assurance processes is the key to effective and efficient CII  operation. The achievement of a high degree of automation is a challenging task for each NO  in a complex & evolving network infrastructure landscape.  3.3 National Cyber Security Agencies  National Cybersecurity agencies may have a leading role in all activities related to the identification  and protection of CIIs, one example is ANSSI in France. Depending on their mandate, they can be  involved in the:   Development of legislation (laws and implementing decrees) related to identification and  protection of CIIs   Supervision of the implementation of the relevant legislation by the involved parties   Review and audit of the CII-related parts of the security plans developed by the CI operators.   Continuous consultation with critical asset owners in the framework of established public- private partnerships   Cooperation with asset owners on asset loss.  Cybersecurity agencies that participated in the survey underlined that:   Collaboration among organizations is an important factor (if not a prerequisite) for the  successful implementation of CIIP-related initiatives and programmes.  This collaboration  involves both the collaboration between industry and state as well as cross-sector  cooperation. In some cases, Public-Private Partnerships have been established in order to  foster the cooperation on the basis of mutual trust (e.g. the UP KRITIS initiative in Germany10).   Business-risk management is not sufficient when vital societal functions are at stake; rather,  society-based risk management is required given that the implications of the potential  failure of a critical service exceeds the boundaries of a specific provider and affects the  entire society11.  3.4 National Regulatory Authorities  As for cybersecurity agencies, National Regulatory Authorities for communication networks may have  the mandate for CIIs depending on the national legislation. From the information gathered during the  online survey and interviews, it was possible to understand their role and challenges such as:  10  German Internet platform on Critical Infrastructure Protection  http://www.kritis.bund.de/SubSites/Kritis/EN/Home/home_node.html  11  Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, A first step towards a national risk assessment  https://www.msb.se/en/Products/Publications/Publications-from-the-MSB/  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  12   The pronouncing of a specific infrastructure as critical may depend on the size of the  affected population, the cross-sector dependency and the geographical impact. Moreover,  personal safety and impact on privacy were also mentioned as important parameters in one  case.   Responding National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) publish guidelines for issues ranging  from CII vulnerabilities and CII procurement to Internet infrastructure resilience. The  majority of them have a formal or informal participation in security related info exchange  platforms.   Audits of operators of CIs and network operators regarding CIIs security/resilience are  performed annually by most of the responding NRAs and are partially based on specific  standard requirements. In case of non-conformities, usually there is a recommendation and  / or order to rectify the error and if not rectified a fine may be imposed. These are performed  on an ad-hoc basis and ISO-27001 is taken as a basis for specific points of the audit.   Public-private partnerships for resilience are already in place or planned in several countries,  whereas the responding agencies take part in cross-border collaboration activities for the  enhancement of CII resilience in their own country.  As part of the survey the NRAs were also asked which actions would be interesting to meet the needs  of securing CII in the future. While not exhaustive, these should be seen as directions for areas of  research. Some ideas that emerged among others are:   Deploy information systems, which would support automated-prioritized handling of  incidents affecting CII so that incidents that involve CIIs’ networks assets are notified  automatically and the handling is prioritized.   Maintain a database which includes the following information entities:  o CIs and the relevant critical service(s) they provide  o CIs and relevant data (location) and potential dependencies  o CIIs and the communication operator which operate those CII  o Role/person responsible for the CII  Based on this database, agencies mandated on CIIs should consider implementing/deploying an  Information Security Management System (ISMS), related to CIIs incident handling. This ISMS should  support classified/diversified CIIs incident handling.   The above CIIs database could be linked to an incident alert system, in order to auto-identify  CII and handle CII alerts in a diversified mode.   Given an incident outbreak:  o a preliminary damage assessment procedure followed could be  prioritised/diversified for CII  o the rules are stricter for CIIs in the \"chain of custody\" documented for the evidence  collected   Statistics on security incidents could be kept with distinct reference to CII.   Conduct root cause analysis in case of an incident, in a diversified mode for CIIs (e.g. all cases  involving CIIs are handled, higher priority given, more effort made, analysed in more depth).  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  13  4 Overview of methodologies in the identification of CIIs assets and services  In this section, an overview of different methodological approaches is given. Those approaches were  identified either during the desktop research or are already being implemented by some MS in the  framework of their overall strategy for the identification and protection of CI.  The goal is to evaluate the critical network assets on which MS depend, and ensure that they are  sufficiently resilient. Operators of CI/CIIs commonly operate applications which are used to  manage/control the critical services offered and/or the CI which support the provisioning of those  critical services. For these reasons it must be possible to identify these specific assets.  As it emerged during the study, two broad categories of approaches can be identified:   A non Critical service dependent approach that does not involve an analysis of the supported  critical services; instead it only looks at the network infrastructure. For the time being, no MS  is using this approach but it is a wide known practice in the private sector to map networks.   Critical Service (CS) dependent approaches that start with the identification of critical  services and then, based on the services, tries to identify which assets are belonging to these  services and therefore can be considered as CII assets and services. This methodology is  based on the impact that the disruption of a service can have on the vital functions of the  society and  mainly two different approaches are used by different Member States: the state- driven and the operator-driven.  Figure 6: Methodological approaches for Critical Information Infrastructure identification  4.1 Non Critical Service (CS)-dependent approach: Network architecture  analysis  The “Network Architecture Analysis” approach involves the analysis of the national network as a  whole, so that the Member State develops a national overview of the data network Infrastructure.  More specifically, it involves:   The analysis of the IP and data network, the traffic load patterns, and failure patterns.   The identification of components, which are critical to the operation of the overall  network or a major part of the network (e.g. core network, links that serve a significant  percentage load or a significant share of international traffic).  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  14  This approach constitutes the traditional commonly applied approach in mapping, analysing and  protecting the network components. It is based on the fact that the core network and certain  additional components serve the majority of the traffic; therefore they should be designed in a  resilient manner. It is expected that all network operators review, analyse and take actions to assure  & gradually enhance the resilience of the critical network components. Therefore, public private  collaboration should be developed to have a holistic view of the network architecture.  The main drawback of this approach is that it ignores critical services, served by the connectivity  solutions since it looks directly at the network infrastructure as a whole. Furthermore, it does not  identify access network components which architecture-wise may seem insignificant, but may be  critical to a critical service’s connectivity. Moreover, due to the overall infrastructure point of view,  it involves a high degree of complexity, which increases significantly when dealing with the lower  network hierarchy levels (transport and access network) and the relevant components / assets.  4.2 Critical service (CS)-dependent approaches  Critical service-dependent approaches follow a three-step procedure as depicted in the following  table. In this case, some MS first identify the critical sectors and then for each one of the critical  sectors they proceed with the identification of critical services, critical applications and finally  critical information infrastructure assets. In the following paragraphs, we detail each individual step  and then we present two MS that use this approach.  Figure 7: Steps of Critical Information Infrastructure identification in a CS-dependent approach  4.3 Steps in critical services based methodologies  In this section we detail each individual step in the identification of CIIs and regarding the identification  of critical services, we also provided an overview of the two different approaches used by different  member states, the state-driven approach and the operator-driven approach.  Step 1: Identification of critical sectors  As presented in Section 2, Member States have addressed the issue of identification of critical sectors  to a greater or lesser extent and all have a longer or shorter list of critical sectors, which has been  prepared taking into account national priorities, related EC Directives and specific country  characteristics.  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  15  Step 2: Identification of critical services  Once the critical sectors are defined, the next step is to define the critical services such as for example  water management, heating supply chains and public transport systems. At this point, we may  differentiate between two approaches based on who assumes the leading role for the identification  of the critical services:  a) the state-driven approach where the leading role is assumed by the government agencies  that have the mandate to identify and protect CI - in most of the cases the responsible  ministries.  b) the operator-driven approach where the leading role is assumed by the Critical Infrastructure  Operators.  The State-driven approach  In the case of the State-driven approach (in this report also called ‘critical service-driven’), the whole  process is guided by the governmental agencies that have the mandate to identify and protect CIs.  Having decided on the critical sectors, they apply a method to systematically identify critical services.  Next, they identify the operators of CI involved in these services. The identification of specific assets  may be performed in collaboration, aiming at assuring effectiveness, aligned with societal needs.  This approach and its steps are presented in the following table. Basically the CII/CIIP mandated  organizations define the list of actual critical services and notify the operators of these services. The  operator of CIIs is therefore in charge to define the specific network assets and appropriate measures  to ensure security and availability of the connectivity. The mandated agencies then review the plan  and periodically update the list of critical services due to continually changing threat landscape.  Figure 8: State-driven approach – Steps followed and parties involved  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  16  The operator-driven approach  In the case of the operator-driven approach, the leading role is assigned to the operators of CIs. The  Member State identifies a list of operators (called also ‘vital operators’), who are responsible to  identify the individual critical services and assets that comply with a number of risk analyses and risk  management directives. Then, the responsible ministries review the selected services and assets along  with the drafted CI protection plans.  Figure 9: Operator-driven approach – Parties involved and steps followed  The ministries identify the “vital operators” or the “vital service providers” within their own area of  responsibility and these operators are then legally bound to perform a risk assessment analysis,  identify a list of individual critical assets and develop CIIP structured plans. In this approach the  identification of the critical services is the responsibility of the operators. A typical example can be  found in France (instruction 6600/2014). This is a pragmatic approach given the current state of the  art of CII identification since operators have a better knowledge of their infrastructures. It also  represents a shift of the effort needed to the operator to which is delegated the accountability.  Step 3: Identification of critical information infrastructure network assets and  services supporting critical services  Following the identification of critical services, the final step is to identify and classify the CII network  assets and services supporting those critical services. This step represents the final phase of the  translation of high level legislation into actual critical network assets and services that need to be  secured, resilient and monitored.  These assets and services are part of a business supply chain. And as it was underlined at the  beginning, due to their criticality, the associated business risk become national risks where the  perimeter is now the business operations in provisioning that specific service.  The criticality of each business process supporting the operation of a critical service can be assessed  based on the impact it has on the predetermined service operation frame. Such impact factors may  be:  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  17   Service Consumer (Citizen /Customer) experience with reference to service consumption (e.g.  electric power cuts due to power transmission process malfunction)   Process malfunction leading to service malfunction or outage (e.g. fault handling process  malfunction and degradation lead to significant delay in fault resolution prolonging a service  outage)  Similar analysis approaches based on the ‘supply-chain and value-chain perspective’, have been  proposed 12 in order to assess dependencies and cyber-asset criticality.  An overview of core processes and relevant indicative applications for a utility service (e.g. power,  water, and telecom), is presented in the following table. The picture tries to depict all the processes  involved when providing a critical service and the components that should be taken into consideration  in assessing and protecting critical assets and services. Moreover, the provision of critical services  consists of several business processes, which in their turn are supported by business applications that  need to be served by a communication network. Therefore, communication networks are of  paramount importance for all stages involved in the provision of critical services, i.e. service fulfilment,  service operation and service assurance.  The operation of many critical applications supporting critical service processes may be fully  dependent on communication networks. This is commonly the case when data (e.g.  measurement/status data, transaction data) are captured at various geographic locations and  transferred via the data network to a central point for processing by the critical applications, which is  the case in all ICTs applications.  Figure 10: Indicative core processes and applications supporting a critical service  Since communication networks are sector agnostic and the asset groups are usually the same,13  independently of the critical service supported, an indicative list of potential CII assets, identified using  the presented methodology and located at the access network,  could look like this:   Fiber ring supporting a critical link (e.g. a datacentre  physical connection)  12 Multinational Experiment 7 Outcome 3 – Cyber Domain Objective 3.1, Threats and Vulnerability Methodology  , 2.2.1 Analysis of supply chain and value chain  13  ENISA Technical Guideline on Threats and Assets https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article- 13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  18   Fiber cable from local exchange to local cabinet as for Fibre-to-the-Cabinet (FTTC) solutions   Customer Premises Equipment(CPE), e.g. Fiber termination equipment, router, DSL  modem/router, switch supporting a carrier ethernet connection at an operator of critical  infrastructure   Microwave equipment supporting a point-to-point access link   Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)  equipment  It must be underlined that this is only an example and the actual list depends on the critical service  supported, the different characteristics of the MS and of the operator. The goal here is to give an  example of the actual network assets that should be identified using this methodology.  Regional/area network components supporting the CII could also be critical assets. These may be:   Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM) at the local exchange   Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS) connected to the DSLAM   Router used to connect to the Internet   GigaEthernet for backhauling (e.g. DSLAM to BRAS)  Core and transit network components are critical to CII, since they support a bigger part of the  network. These may be:   Backbone and (Border Gateway Protocol) BGP routers handling a significant percentage of  the internet traffic   Gigabit Ethernet switches used for the Carrier Ethernet (CE) service   Backbone links handling a significant percentage of the traffic  The higher a network component is in the network hierarchy, the higher the probability that it serves  one or more critical services.  Moreover vulnerabilities which are affecting CII are not specific but they  are commonly affecting all types of communication networks. Below follows an abstraction of the  typical attack surfaces regarding physical and logical infrastructure that should be considered and it is  valid for CII and also for all types of data and IP networks:  Figure 11:  Typical network attack surfaces  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  19  Examples of MS using the service driven approach  Estonia  Estonia is one of the very few European countries that has developed a definition for the term of  “Critical Information Infrastructure” and has assigned to a specific body the responsibility for the  protection of Critical Information Infrastructures, RIA - the Estonian Information System Authority14.  Estonian definition of Critical Information Infrastructure  Information and communications systems whose maintenance, reliability and safety are essential for  the proper functioning of a country. The critical information infrastructure is a part of the critical  infrastructure.15  The basis for Critical Infrastructure Protection in Estonia is the Emergency Act that was issued in  2009 16 , which defines an extended list of vital services, i.e. services that are essential for the  maintenance of society, and the health, safety, security, economic or social well-being of people.  Currently, this list consists of 43 services.  Furthermore, Estonia has developed a methodological approach for the identification of Critical  Information Infrastructure assets, which comprises the following steps:  a) For each one of the vital services identified, a Ministry is appointed as ‘service organizer’ and  this Ministry is responsible to propose the criteria and the criteria thresholds in order to identify  the vital service providers. For example, for the IT sector one of the used criteria is the number of  customers served by a specific company.  b) Then, the vital service providers carry out a risk assessment analysis and draft a business  continuity plan, which they submit to the responsible Ministry (‘service organizer’).  c) One of the outputs of the risk assessment analysis is the list of critical IT resources, which RIA is  responsible to check and provide feedback on how this list could be improved.  d) Based on the outputs of the risk analysis assessments of all vital service providers, a national list  of critical information infrastructure is compiled. Furthermore, a national interdependencies  analysis is carried out based on the input provided by the vital service providers.  Czech Republic  In the Czech Republic CIIs are identified through a specific process in accordance with Act no.  240/2000, on Crisis Management. A CII is defined as an element of CI in the cyber security sector.  Every CI element (and every CII element) needs to fulfil two sets of criteria, which are cross-cutting  criteria and sectorial criteria.  Cross-cutting criteria define the gravity of malfunction or disruption of the system, i.e. if it causes  death to more than 250 people, or the economy of the state is damaged of more than 0,5% GDP, or it  has serious impact on providing necessary services to more than 125,000 people, etc. Sectorial criteria  determine five areas within the cyber security sector where CII might be identified. One of the most  important sectorial criteria is that the information or communication system significantly or  completely affects the operations of other already identified element of CI, e.g. a communication  system upon which the operation and security of a power plant is dependent. CII can also be  identified in the area of information systems administrated by public authority containing personal  information about 300,000, and others.  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  20  A CII is identified and determined by legal act. If the CII is administered by a governmental  department, the governmental resolution is issued. If the CII is administered by other (mostly private)  bodies, the NSA CZE issues a specific general measure decision.  Comparison of the different approaches  After the presentation of the different approaches and some MS examples, below the different  advantages and disadvantages of each approach are listed. It is important to underline that the  purpose of this study is to present the MS with a portfolio of methodological approaches – rather than  a single ‘fits-all’ methodology – so that the MS can tailor the approach that suits better its own specific  characteristics and needs.  Advantages Disadvantages  Network  Architecture  Analysis  The traditional commonly applied  approach in mapping, analysing and  protecting the network  components. This is usually  employed in the private sector.  It is based on the fact that the core  network and certain additional  components serve the majority of  the traffic, therefore they should be  designed resilient. It is expected  that all network operators review,  analyse and take actions to assure  & gradually enhance resilience of  the critical network components.  Given that the ICT sector is  commonly considered critical, its  core infrastructures are CII.  Ignores critical services, served by the  connectivity solutions (CII).  Requires an analysis of the overall national  network (which means having an overview of  the whole network infrastructure formed by  the various network operators).  Cost-benefit criteria, used in network design  & deployment decisions, may be analysed in  financial terms only.  It does not identify access network  components which architecture-wise may  seem insignificant, but may be critical to a  critical service’s connectivity.  Complexity in mapping internet  infrastructures, has been stressed in previous  reports 17.  Complexity is extremely high when dealing  with the lower network hierarchy levels  (transport & access network) and the  relevant components/assets.  14 https://www.ria.ee/en/  15 https://www.ria.ee/CIIP/  16 EMERGENCY ACT, passed 15 June 2009  17 ENISA, Guidelines for enhancing the Resilience of eCommunication Networks  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  21  State-driven  approach /  Critical  services  driven  approach  More systematic. If designed  properly, it could be better aligned  to the actual societal needs.  Better assessment of the critical  services, the relevant value chain  and involved parties. May involve a  process spanning multiple CI/CIIs  operators. Since relationships have a  ‘many to ’many’ nature (e.g. critical  service to operates), the service  value chain complexity should be  analysed early-on.  Done prior to the selection of the  operator of CI/CIIs.  Better MS control of the process.  Detailed list of critical services is not always  present in each MS approach  Define criticality criteria for the identification  of critical assets is a challenging process  especially regarding interdependencies  aspects  The complexity can be significant (including  cross-sector dependencies, cross-border CI  issues). Requires a higher level of  sophistication, in the initial analysis of  services.  State-driven investment in the  development/application of the method is  needed.  Any such approach has not been  identified.  Operator  Driven  approach  Pragmatic approach given the  current state of the art of CII  identification since operators have a  better knowledge of their  infrastructures.  It also represents a shift of the effort  needed to the operator to which is  delegated the accountability.  Need for a strict rule set which has not been  identified. Lack of rules (e.g. a uniform  criticality level applied) may lead to a non- homogeneous deployment of protection  measures (which would not assure alignment  to societal needs).  The concept of critical service maybe under- examined (going directly from operator to  critical assets).  Cross-sector or cross-operators critical  service dependencies may be inadequately  assessed.  Need for strict audit on the identified CI  assets.  Relevant cost for the operator of CI/CIIs (to  apply strict CIP) may provide incentive to  minimize the CI, CII and assets identified.  Effective collaboration between public sector  (Government & mandated Agencies) and the  private sector is fundamental in protecting CII  assets and services.  Table 3: Comparison of methodological approaches in identification of CIIs  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  22  5 Challenges in identification of CIIs assets and services  Based on the findings of the survey presented in chapter 2, the feedback from stakeholders and the  analysis of the different approaches, it was possible to underline the following challenges:   detailed list of critical services is not always present and it is difficult to develop from scratch.   defining criticality criteria for the identification of critical assets is a challenging process   effective collaboration between public sector (Government & mandated Agencies) and the  private sector is fundamental in identifying and protecting CII assets and services.  For these reasons, some improvements for addressing the above issues are presented here. In the  improvements we will focus on critical services dependent approaches. As presented, the network  architecture approach does not scale to a size of a MS due to its complexity and also doesn’t take into  consideration access network components which architecture-wise may seem insignificant, but may  be critical to a critical service’s connectivity.  5.1 Identification of critical sector and services  During the stocktaking process, it became clear that a significant number of Member States present a  low level of maturity and lack a structured approach. Therefore, it was considered useful to have a  reference list of critical sectors / services that they could consult in order to define their own list  depending on their specific geographical characteristics, culture and history.  In that direction, having reviewed several national definitions, an indicative list of critical sectors and  associated sub-sectors and services, is provided in the following table. While compiling the list, an  effort was made to consider the complete value chain of each critical sector.  It is suggested that this  list be used as a reference list by MS (as a starting point), in order to evaluate the sectors and the  services to be classified as critical.

This was underlined by stakeholders as particularly difficult and for this reason an initial outline is here  presented.  Usually, this process consists of the following activities:  a) Application of sector specific criteria, in order to come up with a short-list of potential critical  services  b) Assessment of criticality level of short-listed services. Criticality is the: (I) level of contribution  of an infrastructure to society in maintaining a minimum level of national and international  law and order, public safety, economy, public health and environment, or (ii) impact level to  citizens or to the government from the loss or disruption of the infrastructure.19  Impact is usually evaluated with respect to three primary characteristics:  i. scope or spatial distribution – the geographic area that could be affected by the loss or  unavailability of a critical infrastructure;  ii. severity or intensity or magnitude – the consequences of the disruption or destruction of a  particular critical infrastructure;  iii. Effects of time or temporal distribution – the point that the loss of an element could have a  serious impact (immediate, one to two days, one week).  Several Countries have issued criticality criteria in order to identify the critical assets. A table of  indicative impact criteria is presented below, which could be used as a reference list by Member States  that have not defined yet their own criticality criteria.  Criterion title Explanation  Population affected The percentage of the population of the MS affected from  the disruption of the service  Concentration The density of the population on the geographic  area  affecting the service  Economic Impact The cost of service disruption in terms of GDP percentage.  Public confidence The effect that the proper operation of this service has on  the public confidence towards the government  19  E. Luiijf, H. Burger and M.

Public order The effect that a service interruption may cause to the  public order  Public operations hindered The daily operations of the public, such as going to work  via public transportation, are stopped or thwarted  3rd party MS services are affected Inter-dependencies with critical services of other MS  should be accounted for.  Table 5: List of critical sectors and related critical services  c) Assessment of dependencies. An important dimension to be taken into consideration during  the identification of critical services is the dependencies among the different sectors and  subsectors as well as cross-border dependencies. Dependencies may cause a service and /or  infrastructure to be identified as critical, not because of the first order of disruptions, but due  to the cascading effects that their disruption may have on other services / infrastructures.  Furthermore, disruption of a service in one MS may cause serious effects in other countries.  While assessing the criticality of services, infrastructures and supporting network assets, it is crucial  to examine the system in its entirety rather than per constituent, given that there are at least four  types of dependencies that should be taken into consideration:   Interdependencies within a critical sector (intra-sector): In the telecommunications sector  strong intra-sector dependencies exist. A significant example is the fact that a single Network  Operator owns the fixed network ‘last mile’ and offers wholesale services to the other Network  operators (the so-called Local-loop-unbundling (LLU)). Therefore the business processes of all  NOs depend on the process of the NO which owns the ‘last mile’.   Interdependencies between critical sectors (cross-sector): Interdependencies or dependencies  between critical sectors have been documented in previous studies. In terms of criticality  analysis, the fact that interdependencies between infrastructures exist should be taken into  consideration, as suggested in literature, both at the logical and at the physical level.   Interdependencies among communication network assets: Data networks are built by linking  components/nodes.  Component interdependency is an inherent property of a data network:  each network node depends on other nodes to exchange and forward data packets in order to  provide communication services.  Apart from the ‘physical connectivity interdependency’  clearly reflected in the network architecture, many ‘logical connectivity interdependency’ types  exist in the modern data networking landscape.  Moreover dependencies can be found at the national and international level (cross-border), further  complicating the task to assess risk.  5.3 Effective collaboration: tagging of CIIs assets and centralized views  For the identification of Critical Information Infrastructures in communication networks, the  involvement of two categories of stakeholders should be pursued, i.e. operators of CIs and Network  operators, given the complementarity of their perspectives, responsibilities and expertise.  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  26  Operators of CIs set the requirements for connectivity solutions that they need to procure from the  network operators. In other words, operators of CIs place the order (which may be characterized by a  high degree of complexity) and network operators fulfil the order. The operators of CIs need to identify  and classify the access & private network infrastructures supporting critical applications, according to  their criticality. They are responsible to determine the core processes, the respective applications and,  as a last step, the network assets and services (connectivity solutions) which are used to operate the  respective applications.  Network operators, on the other hand, are responsible to determine the network assets & services,  enabling the connectivity solutions needed by the operators of CIs.  Cybersecurity agencies/ NRAs with mandate on CIIs may have a leading role in all activities related  to the identification and protection of CIIs and as presented in the stock taking aim in the future to  have:   Information systems which would support automated-prioritized handling of incidents affecting  Critical Information Infrastructure.   Maintain a CI/CIIs assets and services database which should include relevant critical services  details, location, dependencies, role/person responsible and point of contacts.  To foster the security of CII and develop effective cooperation, MS should work together with CIIs  asset owners in developing a common approach to the ‘Tagging’ of CII assets  and have a holistic  overview of their status:   Operators of CII should identify the detailed network assets and tag them using a common  taxonomy that can be used to federate the different views.   Mandated agencies could develop the ability to have a centralized view of the CII network  assets and related information in order to react timely in case of incident.  This could allow automated-prioritized handling of incidents affecting CIIs and lead to a prompt and  coordinated response in case of incident or outage.  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  27  6 Recommendations  Recommendation 1: Member States should clearly identify Critical Information Infrastructures if not  already covered in their Critical Infrastructure activities. As underlined during the stock taking, not  all Member States have clearly defined the asset perimeter of Critical Information Infrastructures. For  this reason, if not already covered by the Critical Infrastructure definition, Member States should  clearly define which specific network assets are covered and should be secure and resilient.  Recommendation 2:  Member States who are starting to work on the identification of CII assets  should work together with the stakeholders involved in the operations of Critical Information  Infrastructures.  Effective collaboration between public sector (Government & mandated Agencies)  and the private sector is fundamental in protecting CII assets and services. For the identification of CIIs  in communication networks, the involvement of two categories of stakeholders should be pursued:   operators of Critical Infrastructures   Network operators  given the complementarity of their perspectives, responsibilities and expertise.  Recommendation 3: Member States who are starting to work on the identification of CII should  adopt a methodology for identification of critical network assets and services, using one or a mix of  the proposed solutions in this study that better fits the need of the MS. It is worth-noting that the  purpose here is to present the Member States with a portfolio of methodological approaches – rather  than a single ‘fits-all’ methodology –that each Member State may choose the approach or a  combination of approaches that suits better to its own specific characteristics and needs.  Recommendation 4: Member States who base their identification of CIIs on critical services should  develop a list of these services and assess internal and external interdependencies. While assessing  the criticality of services, infrastructures and supporting network assets, Member States should define  criticality criteria in order to identify the critical assets and examine the system in its entirety rather  than per constituent. At least four types of dependencies should be taken into consideration:   Interdependencies within a critical sector (intra-sector)   Interdependencies between critical sectors (cross-sector).   Interdependencies among communication network assets.  Moreover dependencies can be found at the national and international level (cross-border), further  complicating the task to have a complete overview.  Recommendation 5: Member States should foster baseline security guidelines for communication  networks used for critical services. To ensure the resilience of critical networks, the Critical  Infrastructure operator or asset owner should adopt security guidelines to be used also at  procurement stage. For this reason a checklist with baseline security  guidelines for communication  networks used for critical services should be made available to align practices across the EU.  Recommendation 6: Member States should foster the adoption of automated procedures for CIIs  tagging in order to be prepared to face future challenges.  To foster the security of critical networks,  Member States should work together with CIIs asset owners in developing a common approach to the  ‘Tagging’ of CII assets.

These networks represent the fabric of the future information society and provide the means for the  single digital market. Some parts of these communication networks are also vital for the operations  of Critical Infrastructures which are fundamental for the function of modern society.  An attack or a large scale outage affecting the communication networks assets supporting Critical  Infrastructure can have cascading effects and affect large part of the population or vital functions of  society. But which are exactly those network assets that can be identified as Critical Information  Infrastructure and how we can make sure they are secure and resilient?  This study aims to tackle the problem of identification of Critical Information Infrastructures in  communication networks. The goal is to provide an overview of the current state of play in Europe  and depict possible improvements in order to be ready for future threat landscapes and challenges.  As it was possible to underline, currently a significant number of Member States present a low level  of maturity and lack a structured approach regarding identification of Critical Information  Infrastructure in communication networks and this can pose severe risks regarding the everyday  increasing dependency of the vital functions of the society on these networks.  Moreover, based on the findings of the survey, the discussion with stakeholders and the analysis of  the different approaches already in place, it was possible to highlight the following challenges in  identifying CIIs assets and services:   detailed list of critical services is not always present and should be tailored per Member State   criticality criteria for the identification of critical assets is a challenging process especially  regarding internal and external interdependencies   effective collaboration between public sector and the private sector is fundamental in  identifying and protecting CII assets and services and should start from asset identification.  Considering this multi-layered and complex environment and raising threat scenarios, the following  recommendations emerged for Member State  and operators of critical infrastructures to foster  security and resilience of CIIs over communication networks in Europe:  Member States should clearly identify Critical Information Infrastructures if not already covered in  their Critical Infrastructure activities. Not all MS have clearly defined the asset perimeter of Critical  Information Infrastructures. For this reason, if not already covered by the Critical Infrastructure  definition, Member states should clearly define which specific network assets are covered and should  be secure and resilient.  Member States who are starting to work on the identification of CII assets should cooperate with  stakeholders involved in the operations of Critical Information Infrastructures.  Effective  collaboration between public sector (Government & mandated Agencies) and the private sector is  fundamental in protecting CII assets and services. For the identification of Critical Information  Infrastructures in communication networks, the involvement of two categories of stakeholders should  be pursued:  • operators of Critical Infrastructures  • network operators  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  v  given the complementarity of their perspectives, responsibilities and expertise.  Member States who are starting to work on the identification of CIIs should adopt a methodology  for the identification of critical network assets and services, using one or a mix of the proposed  solutions in this study that better fits the need of the MS. It is worth-noting that the purpose here is  to present the Member States with a portfolio of methodological approaches – rather than a one size  ‘fits-all’ methodology – so that each Member State may choose the approach or a combination of  approaches that suits better to its own specific characteristics and needs.  Member States who base their identification of CIIs on critical services should develop a list of these  services and assess internal and external interdependencies. While assessing the criticality of  services, infrastructures and supporting network assets, MS should define criticality criteria in order to  identify the critical assets and examine the system in its entirety rather than per constituent. At least  four types of dependencies should be taken into consideration:  • Interdependencies within a critical sector (intra-sector)  • Interdependencies between critical sectors (cross-sector).  • Interdependencies among data network assets.  Moreover dependencies can be found at the national and international level (cross-border), further  complicating the task to have a complete overview.  Member States should foster baseline security guidelines for communication networks used for  critical services. To ensure the resilience of critical networks, the Critical Infrastructure operator or  asset owner should adopt security guidelines to be used also at procurement stage. For this reason a  checklist with baseline security guidelines for communication networks used for critical services should  be made available to align practices across the EU.  Member States should foster the adoption of automated procedures for CIIs tagging in order to be  prepared to face future challenges.  To foster the security of critical networks, MS should work  together with CIIs asset owners in developing a common approach to the ‘Tagging’ of CII assets. This  could allow automated-prioritized handling of incidents affecting Critical Information infrastructures.

These networks represent the fabric of the future information society and provide the means for the  single digital market. Some parts of these communication networks are also vital for the operations  of Critical Infrastructures (CIs) which are fundamental for the function of modern society.  Every day, the majority of Critical Infrastructures such as water management, heating supply chains  and public transport systems among others, depend on the correct function of communication  networks that support their operations. These supportive systems and networks, commonly referred  to as Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs), are core pillars for the function of the economy and  society and a cyber-attack or an outage affecting these assets and services could have cascading  effects on large part of the population1.  In order to properly identify and secure these critical network assets, ENISA focuses this year on how  Member States (MS) identify CIIs in communication networks in Europe.  Scope of the document  Identification of Critical information infrastructure is the first step in the process to secure and protect  the availability of critical assets. Several Member States have launched different initiatives regarding  this topic while others are starting now to develop their own approaches. This study analyses how  Member States have developed methodologies to identify CIIs in communication networks.  The definition of CII is taken from the Council Directive 2008/114/EC on the identification and  designation of European Critical Infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their  protection2.‘’ICT systems that are Critical Infrastructures for themselves or that are essential for the  operation of Critical Infrastructures (telecommunications, computers/software, Internet, satellites,  etc.) “  Figure 1: Perimeter of the study - Data and IP networks  1 Buldyrev, S.

Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  2  In this report the centre of interest is communication networks, including the Internet, public data  communication networks and relevant assets in private data communication networks. The perimeter  of public versus private network infrastructure is depicted in the following table. Private networks can  be deployed within the private perimeter (e.g. LAN, Wi-Fi), as well as connecting private networks to  each other and to the external world.  The separation between public and private is not necessarily  spatial (e.g. for wireless connectivity). Long distance (WAN) private networks are commonly available  to companies that operate transmission/transportation infrastructures, which can in parallel be used  for private communication network (e.g. fibre optic cable) deployment.  Figure 2: Perimeter of the study - Private and Public IP and data communication networks  Target audience  This document is aimed at Member States that are interested in identifying CIIs assets and services in  the area of communication networks. The target community consists of decision makers in mandated  agencies/functions or National Regulatory Authorities for communication networks (NRAs) in charge  of the definition of methodologies to identify Critical Information Infrastructures.  Due the multi-layered interdependencies involved in Critical Information infrastructure protection,  this study covers also the perspective of critical infrastructure assets owners and operators that should  be involved in any related initiative in the security and resilience of these assets.  Goal  The goal of this study is to provide an overview of existing approaches in identification of CIIs across  Europe and understand the dynamics of this complex multi-layered environment which involves not  only operators of critical infrastructures but also network operators and mandated agencies. In doing  so, also gaps and future challenges will be underlined and recommendations will be proposed to foster  security and resilience of these critical communication networks. Specifically, this study investigates  how to  1. define Critical sectors and Critical services supported by electronic communication networks  2. identify CIIs assets and services which support these critical services  3. strengthen & protect the identified CII in concert with the asset owners.  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  3  From the point of view of CI/CII assets owners and operators, the objective is to support them in the  identification of their CIIs assets and ensure the protection of their critical assets in concert with the  mandated agency of the MS. The aim is to identify the network assets that needs to be secure, and in  case of outages, ensure resilient interconnections. In absence or with minimal availability, services  essential to Critical Infrastructures can severely hamper the functioning of society.  Methodology  The methodology for this study is organized in three steps:  1. Information gathering:  o Desktop research of 760 documents regarding MS legislation and initiatives in the  area of infrastructure security and resilience including identification of public and  private stakeholders being responsible for managing these initiatives, frameworks for  categorization of assets in electronic communication networks, with special focus on  CIIs and relevant research  o 35 online surveys  answered by NRAs, Cyber Security Agencies, Contingency Agencies,  CERTs, network operators and operators of Critical Infrastructures  o 11 focused interviews performed with NRA, Cyber security Agencies, network  operators and operators of Critical Infrastructures.  2. Analysis: based on the result of the desktop research, an analysis was performed to identify  current maturity levels in identification of critical sectors, assets and services, good practises  and possible challenges.  3. Validation session: to validate the findings and propose a portfolio of solutions that would fit  all needs:  o Validation session workshop http://europa.eu/!qU87Rd with cyber security agencies,  network operators, operators of Critical Infrastructure and academia.  o Extensive online feedback via NRAs, Cyber Security Agencies, Network operators and  operators of Critical Infrastructures who participated at each part of the study, EU  Critical Infrastructure point of contacts in each MS and ENISA Internet Infrastructure  Security and Resilience Reference Group.  Structure of this document  This document is structured as follows:   Introduction - Introduction and general overview   Chapter 2 - Outline of the MS status regarding the identification of critical sectors, assets and  services and definition of critical information infrastructures   Chapter 3 - Summary of the perspective of the different stakeholders involved   Chapter 4 - Overview of methodologies of identification of critical information infrastructures   Chapter 5 - Possible improvement to fill existing gaps and be prepared for future challenges   Chapter 6 - Recommendations  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  4  2 Overview of the Member States’ approaches to CIIs identification  During the information collection period, an effort was made to depict the current status in the 28 EU  Members States regarding the definition of CIIs and the methodologies to identify specific network  assets and services.  Thanks to desktop research analysis, the 35 online survey responses and 11  interviews with the relevant stakeholders, it was possible to collect information to have an overview  of the current definition in 23 Member States and related research. The goal was to depict in which  country a clear definition of CII is present and which is the level of CII identification methodologies  and related activities.  Starting from the European definition3, the goal was to recognise how MS identify CIIs at national level  and develop their own definition and methodologies to translate it in actual network assets and  services that need to be secured and resilient. For this, all relevant and available legislation in each  MS, with focus on communication networks, was analysed. For reference please refer to Annex I –  Legislation in EU and MS.  The following key findings and conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of the information that has  been collected regarding legal, regulatory and strategic initiatives undertaken in 23 Member States  concerning the identification of critical sectors, assets and services.  The main starting point for identifying CII assets and services are the CI depending on them, given that  critical infrastructures (e.g. transportation, finance, electric power and water) are increasingly  dependent on the evolving information infrastructure for a variety of information management,  communications and control functions4. In turn, CIs are defined on the basis of critical sectors /  services.  Figure 3: Critical sectors and infrastructures identification flow  In the Green Paper on a European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection5, the European  Commission provides an indicative list of 11 critical sectors:  i. Energy  ii. Information, Communication Technologies (ICT)  iii. Water  iv. Food  v. Health  vi.

Public & Legal Order and Safety  viii. Civil Administration  ix. Transport  x. Chemical and Nuclear Industry  xi. Space and Research  This list is not used as such across all MS; rather, countries have put in place their own list of critical  sectors since not all sectors are relevant for all countries. Furthermore, based on the special  characteristics and peculiarities of each country, the list may need to be enriched with new sectors.  For example, the nuclear industry is only relevant for countries that have nuclear plants, whereas a  few countries have identified as critical the emergency and / or rescue services, which are not included  in the list proposed by the European Commission.  It is also important to underline how some countries may use different terms as it is the case of France  where the term “point d’importance vitale” is used or Estonia which defines vital services instead of  critical sectors.  The table below gives an overview of the mapping of the critical sectors identified by each country6.  Sectors Energy ICT Water Food Health Financial  Public  &  Legal  Order  Civil  Admin.

Firstly, it was understood that the significance of CII Protection has been acknowledged by the  majority of the Member States. This has been dealt with either in the framework of their CI Protection  programmes and initiatives or as part of the development of their cybersecurity strategies.  This means  that usually there are no dedicated strategies for the protection of CII but rather refinements and  adjustments are made to existing strategies and concepts on CI protection in order to accommodate  issues related to the protection of information infrastructure.  Secondly, based on the information gathered, it was possible to note that that there are different  maturity levels with regards to CII activities across the MS. On the basis of the collected information,  four different maturity levels could be defined as presented in the following table:  Table 2: Maturity levels in identification of CIIs  These maturity levels range from the absence of activities related to the identification of CII to the  establishment of specific measures for the identification and protection of CII assets. Based on the  information gathered, it was possible to place the analysed MS on the following continuum that  represents their indicative state of the art.  Level 1  Absence of activities related to the protection of critical information  infrastructures. Under this category fall MS that have just transposed the EC  Directive 114/2008 and have identified only transport and energy as critical  sectors.  Level 2  Identification of the ICT sector as one of the critical sectors that should be  addressed. Under this category may fall MS that have acknowledged the  Information and Communication Technologies sector as one of the critical sectors  for the maintenance of the vital societal functions.  Level 3  Development of a general methodological framework for the identification of CI  assets. Member States that have in place a detailed methodological approach for  the identification of CI assets and services, with specific steps and responsibilities  assigned to involved stakeholders, may be classified into this category. Since the  focus is on CII, It is a prerequisite that MS have acknowledged ICT as one of the  critical sectors.  Level 4  Development of a definition for CII and establishment of specific criteria for the  identification of CII assets. Under this category fall the Member States that are  mostly advanced in the area of CIIP and have taken specific measures for the  identification and protection of CII assets.  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  7  Figure 4: CI identification maturity continuum and MS positioning  As presented in this section, 17 Member States of the 23 covered in this study have addressed the  issue of identification of critical sectors.  In these MS there is a list of critical sectors and in certain  cases also subsectors and related critical services. The lists have been prepared taking into account  national priorities, related EC Directives and specific country characteristics. A structured  methodology is present only in 5 MS while the other MS are either at the early stage of CII  identification or are defining the legislative decrees for the definition of the methodology in this  moment.  When focusing on identification of CIIs in the area of communication networks, from the online survey  and the follow-up interviews it was possible to identify that:   a significant number of Member States present a low level of maturity and lack a structured  approach   challenges are posed by the identification of critical services and the complexity of the  definition of criticality criteria in order to identify the critical assets.   there is the need for effective collaboration between public sector (Government &  mandated Agencies) and the private sector, which often controls numerous critical  infrastructures  The major considerations can be summarized as follows:   The differences observed in the CIIP maturity level across the various MS seem to be aligned with  the variance observed in the overall MS maturity concerning ICT as illustrated by the Network  Readiness Index (see table below). The World Economic Forum's Networked Readiness Index (NRI)7  measures the propensity for countries to exploit the opportunities offered by information and  communications technology (ICT) taking into consideration ten factors. An analysis of the NRI  results shows that while many European countries are leading in the rankings, many others lag  behind.  Figure 5: The Network readiness index (2014) in EU8  7  The World Economic Forum's Networked Readiness Index (NRI) http://www.weforum.org/issues/global- information-technology/the-great-transformation/network-readiness-index  8 World Economic Forum (2014), The Global Information Technology Report 2014, p.19  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  8   A comparison of the implementation level with the NRI of the individual MS suggests that MS with  lower NRI rankings exhibit also a lower regulatory maturity level regarding CIIP. This can be justified  by the lower degree of ICT adoption for the support of critical services. This  pushes down in the  scale of priorities the need to focus on the identification and protection of critical information  infrastructures.  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  9  3 Stakeholders involved in the identification of CII assets and services  As underlined in the previous chapter, an issue that emerged from the online survey and the follow- up interviews is the fundamental need for effective collaboration between public sector  (Government & mandated Agencies) and the private sector, which often controls numerous critical  infrastructures. This is due to the complexity of interdependencies, the role of the asset owners and  efforts to make these assets secure and resilient.  When it comes to CIIs, given the criticality of certain services offered to the public, the population and  the geographic scope supported, a business risk may become national risk, and in such a case, the  service providers are defined by the mandated agency as operators of CIs.  The operators of CIs need to identify and classify the communication network infrastructures  supporting critical applications, according to their criticality. They are responsible for determining the  core processes, the respective applications and, as a last step, the network assets and services  (connectivity solutions) which are used to operate the respective applications. An asset can be critical  related to (a) the business value, (b) the scope of the population served or (c) the technical  dependence of critical applications and this classification depends on the sector and the role of the CI.  For these reasons, parallel to the mapping of different approaches on identification in the different  MS, an effort was made to investigate the views of the stakeholders that could be involved in the  identification of critical assets and service used in communication networks, namely:   Operators of Critical Infrastructure,   Electronic Communication Providers,   National Telecommunications Regulatory Authorities   Cybersecurity Agencies.  In the following paragraphs, the main points that were highlighted in the framework of the online  survey and the follow-up interviews are summarized per stakeholder category.  3.1 Operators of Critical Infrastructures 9  Operators of CIs are the asset owners and commonly face major risks which may have a detrimental  effect on society and the depending vital societal functions. These risks may be directly linked to the  critical service provided or emerging from activities that are not related to the core business of the  operator of CIs. During the discussion with this type of stakeholder it was underlined that:   Operators of CIs are in charge of operating and securing their infrastructures, whereas in  several Member States they are legally obliged to carry out a risk assessment analysis and  submit business continuity plans to the responsible Government authorities.   In certain industry sectors they are also obliged to comply with certain regulations which may  have impact on the operation, infrastructures and data networks used, an example would be  the Finance sector.   In order to comply with regulations, operators of CIs classify their infrastructures and  processes as well as the respective supporting applications/information.   In certain cases, operators of CIs have a highly diversified portfolio of services and respective  infrastructures. Such operators need to apply a diversified approach according to service  criticality.  9 The terms ‘Critical Service Provider’ and ‘Critical Infrastructure Operator’ reflect highly complementary roles  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  10  3.2 Electronic Communications Operators  Several network operators participated in the study, providing useful insights regarding their role in  securing and protecting CIIs and the level of maturity of the market, in general. Network operators  are not responsible for classifying infrastructures as CIIs. Usually the designated operator of CI is  required to identify their relevant CII assets and services and prepare a plan to better protect them.  This also means that contracts and relevant Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are renewed, based on  the operator of CIs demands.  Network operators expect to see an increasing demand for secure and resilient connectivity solutions,  based on evolving technology, and need to prepare for this. Thus the network operators, active in a  competitive market and complex evolving technological landscape, have to continuously improve, in  order to be able to provide increasingly resilient and secure CII, connectivity solutions and  interconnection services, based on more demanding SLAs.  Specifically:   Network operators are not responsible for classifying infrastructures as CIIs. Currently there  is no such legal obligation in any Member States, and such a responsibility is not foreseen to  date. Τhis may be a MS responsibility, in certain cases legislated but, as it was possible to note  above, this varies in maturity and efforts. Therefore the designated operator of CI is commonly  required to identify their relevant CII assets and services and prepare a plan to better protect  them. This may involve enhancing security and resilience features of the connectivity solutions  which support their CI(s). This also means that contracts and relevant SLA are renewed, based  on the requirements of the operator of CIs and specific procurement requirements are  defined for those assets and services which are defined as critical and which will be covered  in the chapter ad-hoc.   The process to strengthen and/or enhance security and resilience of CII is usually business- driven in order to fulfil the CI operator’s requirements. In certain cases, CI operators are driven  by the need to comply with regulations, with implications on network security and resilience.  In other words, the network operators receive service requests from the CI operator or asset  owner to render their connectivity services more secure and resilient, to guarantee the  operations of the CIIs enabling their critical services.   In order to ensure the resilience of critical external networks, the CI operator or asset owner  set related requirements at the procurement stage and uses multiple and physically separated  network paths. In addition, they put in place SLAs. Regarding the security of external  networks, CI operators or asset owners follow different strategies. All CI operators or asset  owners set requirements at the procurement phase for business data protection on the  external network. Sometimes the network operator is constrained by external factors when  deploying resilient connectivity, such as administrative permissions, delays introduced by  other service providers of the same operator of CIs. Thus SLAs should take into account such  situations, to protect the NOs.   Network operators expect to see an increasing demand for secure and resilient connectivity  solutions, based on evolving technology, and need to prepare for this. Thus the network  operators, active in a competitive market and a complex evolving technological landscape,  have to continuously improve, in order to be able to provide increasingly resilient and secure  CII (connectivity solutions and interconnection services), based on more demanding SLAs.  Therefore, they have to be able to offer connectivity solutions with higher redundancy &  increased capacity exploiting all access technologies available (wired & wireless). Moreover,  they have to be able to offer complex SLAs related to connection  availability/performance/security.  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  11   Regarding the network operators’ Business/Operations Support Systems (BSS/OSS)  functionality to support internal processes related to CIIs, the overall impression is that  currently there is no particular deployment of functionality to support a differentiated  provisioning & assurance process for CII related solutions. The sophisticated OSS approach  involves the deployment of an SLA management platform which may auto- interact with the  network assets ‘linked’ to the ‘customer facing service’, in order to support a complex and  demanding SLA.   The evolution of CII related SLAs, requested by the CI operators, to assure the provision of  increasingly resilient and secure CII, will apply pressure for the deployment of more  sophisticated BSS/OSS; this in return shall allow for automated-systematic handling of  complex SLAs, while containing the operation cost.   Automation of provisioning and assurance processes is the key to effective and efficient CII  operation. The achievement of a high degree of automation is a challenging task for each NO  in a complex & evolving network infrastructure landscape.  3.3 National Cyber Security Agencies  National Cybersecurity agencies may have a leading role in all activities related to the identification  and protection of CIIs, one example is ANSSI in France. Depending on their mandate, they can be  involved in the:   Development of legislation (laws and implementing decrees) related to identification and  protection of CIIs   Supervision of the implementation of the relevant legislation by the involved parties   Review and audit of the CII-related parts of the security plans developed by the CI operators.   Continuous consultation with critical asset owners in the framework of established public- private partnerships   Cooperation with asset owners on asset loss.  Cybersecurity agencies that participated in the survey underlined that:   Collaboration among organizations is an important factor (if not a prerequisite) for the  successful implementation of CIIP-related initiatives and programmes.  This collaboration  involves both the collaboration between industry and state as well as cross-sector  cooperation. In some cases, Public-Private Partnerships have been established in order to  foster the cooperation on the basis of mutual trust (e.g. the UP KRITIS initiative in Germany10).   Business-risk management is not sufficient when vital societal functions are at stake; rather,  society-based risk management is required given that the implications of the potential  failure of a critical service exceeds the boundaries of a specific provider and affects the  entire society11.  3.4 National Regulatory Authorities  As for cybersecurity agencies, National Regulatory Authorities for communication networks may have  the mandate for CIIs depending on the national legislation. From the information gathered during the  online survey and interviews, it was possible to understand their role and challenges such as:  10  German Internet platform on Critical Infrastructure Protection  http://www.kritis.bund.de/SubSites/Kritis/EN/Home/home_node.html  11  Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, A first step towards a national risk assessment  https://www.msb.se/en/Products/Publications/Publications-from-the-MSB/  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  12   The pronouncing of a specific infrastructure as critical may depend on the size of the  affected population, the cross-sector dependency and the geographical impact. Moreover,  personal safety and impact on privacy were also mentioned as important parameters in one  case.   Responding National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) publish guidelines for issues ranging  from CII vulnerabilities and CII procurement to Internet infrastructure resilience. The  majority of them have a formal or informal participation in security related info exchange  platforms.   Audits of operators of CIs and network operators regarding CIIs security/resilience are  performed annually by most of the responding NRAs and are partially based on specific  standard requirements. In case of non-conformities, usually there is a recommendation and  / or order to rectify the error and if not rectified a fine may be imposed. These are performed  on an ad-hoc basis and ISO-27001 is taken as a basis for specific points of the audit.   Public-private partnerships for resilience are already in place or planned in several countries,  whereas the responding agencies take part in cross-border collaboration activities for the  enhancement of CII resilience in their own country.  As part of the survey the NRAs were also asked which actions would be interesting to meet the needs  of securing CII in the future. While not exhaustive, these should be seen as directions for areas of  research. Some ideas that emerged among others are:   Deploy information systems, which would support automated-prioritized handling of  incidents affecting CII so that incidents that involve CIIs’ networks assets are notified  automatically and the handling is prioritized.   Maintain a database which includes the following information entities:  o CIs and the relevant critical service(s) they provide  o CIs and relevant data (location) and potential dependencies  o CIIs and the communication operator which operate those CII  o Role/person responsible for the CII  Based on this database, agencies mandated on CIIs should consider implementing/deploying an  Information Security Management System (ISMS), related to CIIs incident handling. This ISMS should  support classified/diversified CIIs incident handling.   The above CIIs database could be linked to an incident alert system, in order to auto-identify  CII and handle CII alerts in a diversified mode.   Given an incident outbreak:  o a preliminary damage assessment procedure followed could be  prioritised/diversified for CII  o the rules are stricter for CIIs in the \"chain of custody\" documented for the evidence  collected   Statistics on security incidents could be kept with distinct reference to CII.   Conduct root cause analysis in case of an incident, in a diversified mode for CIIs (e.g. all cases  involving CIIs are handled, higher priority given, more effort made, analysed in more depth).  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  13  4 Overview of methodologies in the identification of CIIs assets and services  In this section, an overview of different methodological approaches is given. Those approaches were  identified either during the desktop research or are already being implemented by some MS in the  framework of their overall strategy for the identification and protection of CI.  The goal is to evaluate the critical network assets on which MS depend, and ensure that they are  sufficiently resilient. Operators of CI/CIIs commonly operate applications which are used to  manage/control the critical services offered and/or the CI which support the provisioning of those  critical services. For these reasons it must be possible to identify these specific assets.  As it emerged during the study, two broad categories of approaches can be identified:   A non Critical service dependent approach that does not involve an analysis of the supported  critical services; instead it only looks at the network infrastructure. For the time being, no MS  is using this approach but it is a wide known practice in the private sector to map networks.   Critical Service (CS) dependent approaches that start with the identification of critical  services and then, based on the services, tries to identify which assets are belonging to these  services and therefore can be considered as CII assets and services. This methodology is  based on the impact that the disruption of a service can have on the vital functions of the  society and  mainly two different approaches are used by different Member States: the state- driven and the operator-driven.  Figure 6: Methodological approaches for Critical Information Infrastructure identification  4.1 Non Critical Service (CS)-dependent approach: Network architecture  analysis  The “Network Architecture Analysis” approach involves the analysis of the national network as a  whole, so that the Member State develops a national overview of the data network Infrastructure.  More specifically, it involves:   The analysis of the IP and data network, the traffic load patterns, and failure patterns.   The identification of components, which are critical to the operation of the overall  network or a major part of the network (e.g. core network, links that serve a significant  percentage load or a significant share of international traffic).  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  14  This approach constitutes the traditional commonly applied approach in mapping, analysing and  protecting the network components. It is based on the fact that the core network and certain  additional components serve the majority of the traffic; therefore they should be designed in a  resilient manner. It is expected that all network operators review, analyse and take actions to assure  & gradually enhance the resilience of the critical network components. Therefore, public private  collaboration should be developed to have a holistic view of the network architecture.  The main drawback of this approach is that it ignores critical services, served by the connectivity  solutions since it looks directly at the network infrastructure as a whole. Furthermore, it does not  identify access network components which architecture-wise may seem insignificant, but may be  critical to a critical service’s connectivity. Moreover, due to the overall infrastructure point of view,  it involves a high degree of complexity, which increases significantly when dealing with the lower  network hierarchy levels (transport and access network) and the relevant components / assets.  4.2 Critical service (CS)-dependent approaches  Critical service-dependent approaches follow a three-step procedure as depicted in the following  table. In this case, some MS first identify the critical sectors and then for each one of the critical  sectors they proceed with the identification of critical services, critical applications and finally  critical information infrastructure assets. In the following paragraphs, we detail each individual step  and then we present two MS that use this approach.  Figure 7: Steps of Critical Information Infrastructure identification in a CS-dependent approach  4.3 Steps in critical services based methodologies  In this section we detail each individual step in the identification of CIIs and regarding the identification  of critical services, we also provided an overview of the two different approaches used by different  member states, the state-driven approach and the operator-driven approach.  Step 1: Identification of critical sectors  As presented in Section 2, Member States have addressed the issue of identification of critical sectors  to a greater or lesser extent and all have a longer or shorter list of critical sectors, which has been  prepared taking into account national priorities, related EC Directives and specific country  characteristics.  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  15  Step 2: Identification of critical services  Once the critical sectors are defined, the next step is to define the critical services such as for example  water management, heating supply chains and public transport systems. At this point, we may  differentiate between two approaches based on who assumes the leading role for the identification  of the critical services:  a) the state-driven approach where the leading role is assumed by the government agencies  that have the mandate to identify and protect CI - in most of the cases the responsible  ministries.  b) the operator-driven approach where the leading role is assumed by the Critical Infrastructure  Operators.  The State-driven approach  In the case of the State-driven approach (in this report also called ‘critical service-driven’), the whole  process is guided by the governmental agencies that have the mandate to identify and protect CIs.  Having decided on the critical sectors, they apply a method to systematically identify critical services.  Next, they identify the operators of CI involved in these services. The identification of specific assets  may be performed in collaboration, aiming at assuring effectiveness, aligned with societal needs.  This approach and its steps are presented in the following table. Basically the CII/CIIP mandated  organizations define the list of actual critical services and notify the operators of these services. The  operator of CIIs is therefore in charge to define the specific network assets and appropriate measures  to ensure security and availability of the connectivity. The mandated agencies then review the plan  and periodically update the list of critical services due to continually changing threat landscape.  Figure 8: State-driven approach – Steps followed and parties involved  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  16  The operator-driven approach  In the case of the operator-driven approach, the leading role is assigned to the operators of CIs. The  Member State identifies a list of operators (called also ‘vital operators’), who are responsible to  identify the individual critical services and assets that comply with a number of risk analyses and risk  management directives. Then, the responsible ministries review the selected services and assets along  with the drafted CI protection plans.  Figure 9: Operator-driven approach – Parties involved and steps followed  The ministries identify the “vital operators” or the “vital service providers” within their own area of  responsibility and these operators are then legally bound to perform a risk assessment analysis,  identify a list of individual critical assets and develop CIIP structured plans. In this approach the  identification of the critical services is the responsibility of the operators. A typical example can be  found in France (instruction 6600/2014). This is a pragmatic approach given the current state of the  art of CII identification since operators have a better knowledge of their infrastructures. It also  represents a shift of the effort needed to the operator to which is delegated the accountability.  Step 3: Identification of critical information infrastructure network assets and  services supporting critical services  Following the identification of critical services, the final step is to identify and classify the CII network  assets and services supporting those critical services. This step represents the final phase of the  translation of high level legislation into actual critical network assets and services that need to be  secured, resilient and monitored.  These assets and services are part of a business supply chain. And as it was underlined at the  beginning, due to their criticality, the associated business risk become national risks where the  perimeter is now the business operations in provisioning that specific service.  The criticality of each business process supporting the operation of a critical service can be assessed  based on the impact it has on the predetermined service operation frame. Such impact factors may  be:  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  17   Service Consumer (Citizen /Customer) experience with reference to service consumption (e.g.  electric power cuts due to power transmission process malfunction)   Process malfunction leading to service malfunction or outage (e.g. fault handling process  malfunction and degradation lead to significant delay in fault resolution prolonging a service  outage)  Similar analysis approaches based on the ‘supply-chain and value-chain perspective’, have been  proposed 12 in order to assess dependencies and cyber-asset criticality.  An overview of core processes and relevant indicative applications for a utility service (e.g. power,  water, and telecom), is presented in the following table. The picture tries to depict all the processes  involved when providing a critical service and the components that should be taken into consideration  in assessing and protecting critical assets and services. Moreover, the provision of critical services  consists of several business processes, which in their turn are supported by business applications that  need to be served by a communication network. Therefore, communication networks are of  paramount importance for all stages involved in the provision of critical services, i.e. service fulfilment,  service operation and service assurance.  The operation of many critical applications supporting critical service processes may be fully  dependent on communication networks. This is commonly the case when data (e.g.  measurement/status data, transaction data) are captured at various geographic locations and  transferred via the data network to a central point for processing by the critical applications, which is  the case in all ICTs applications.  Figure 10: Indicative core processes and applications supporting a critical service  Since communication networks are sector agnostic and the asset groups are usually the same,13  independently of the critical service supported, an indicative list of potential CII assets, identified using  the presented methodology and located at the access network,  could look like this:   Fiber ring supporting a critical link (e.g. a datacentre  physical connection)  12 Multinational Experiment 7 Outcome 3 – Cyber Domain Objective 3.1, Threats and Vulnerability Methodology  , 2.2.1 Analysis of supply chain and value chain  13  ENISA Technical Guideline on Threats and Assets https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article- 13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  18   Fiber cable from local exchange to local cabinet as for Fibre-to-the-Cabinet (FTTC) solutions   Customer Premises Equipment(CPE), e.g. Fiber termination equipment, router, DSL  modem/router, switch supporting a carrier ethernet connection at an operator of critical  infrastructure   Microwave equipment supporting a point-to-point access link   Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)  equipment  It must be underlined that this is only an example and the actual list depends on the critical service  supported, the different characteristics of the MS and of the operator. The goal here is to give an  example of the actual network assets that should be identified using this methodology.  Regional/area network components supporting the CII could also be critical assets. These may be:   Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM) at the local exchange   Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS) connected to the DSLAM   Router used to connect to the Internet   GigaEthernet for backhauling (e.g. DSLAM to BRAS)  Core and transit network components are critical to CII, since they support a bigger part of the  network. These may be:   Backbone and (Border Gateway Protocol) BGP routers handling a significant percentage of  the internet traffic   Gigabit Ethernet switches used for the Carrier Ethernet (CE) service   Backbone links handling a significant percentage of the traffic  The higher a network component is in the network hierarchy, the higher the probability that it serves  one or more critical services.  Moreover vulnerabilities which are affecting CII are not specific but they  are commonly affecting all types of communication networks. Below follows an abstraction of the  typical attack surfaces regarding physical and logical infrastructure that should be considered and it is  valid for CII and also for all types of data and IP networks:  Figure 11:  Typical network attack surfaces  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  19  Examples of MS using the service driven approach  Estonia  Estonia is one of the very few European countries that has developed a definition for the term of  “Critical Information Infrastructure” and has assigned to a specific body the responsibility for the  protection of Critical Information Infrastructures, RIA - the Estonian Information System Authority14.  Estonian definition of Critical Information Infrastructure  Information and communications systems whose maintenance, reliability and safety are essential for  the proper functioning of a country. The critical information infrastructure is a part of the critical  infrastructure.15  The basis for Critical Infrastructure Protection in Estonia is the Emergency Act that was issued in  2009 16 , which defines an extended list of vital services, i.e. services that are essential for the  maintenance of society, and the health, safety, security, economic or social well-being of people.  Currently, this list consists of 43 services.  Furthermore, Estonia has developed a methodological approach for the identification of Critical  Information Infrastructure assets, which comprises the following steps:  a) For each one of the vital services identified, a Ministry is appointed as ‘service organizer’ and  this Ministry is responsible to propose the criteria and the criteria thresholds in order to identify  the vital service providers. For example, for the IT sector one of the used criteria is the number of  customers served by a specific company.  b) Then, the vital service providers carry out a risk assessment analysis and draft a business  continuity plan, which they submit to the responsible Ministry (‘service organizer’).  c) One of the outputs of the risk assessment analysis is the list of critical IT resources, which RIA is  responsible to check and provide feedback on how this list could be improved.  d) Based on the outputs of the risk analysis assessments of all vital service providers, a national list  of critical information infrastructure is compiled. Furthermore, a national interdependencies  analysis is carried out based on the input provided by the vital service providers.  Czech Republic  In the Czech Republic CIIs are identified through a specific process in accordance with Act no.  240/2000, on Crisis Management. A CII is defined as an element of CI in the cyber security sector.  Every CI element (and every CII element) needs to fulfil two sets of criteria, which are cross-cutting  criteria and sectorial criteria.  Cross-cutting criteria define the gravity of malfunction or disruption of the system, i.e. if it causes  death to more than 250 people, or the economy of the state is damaged of more than 0,5% GDP, or it  has serious impact on providing necessary services to more than 125,000 people, etc. Sectorial criteria  determine five areas within the cyber security sector where CII might be identified. One of the most  important sectorial criteria is that the information or communication system significantly or  completely affects the operations of other already identified element of CI, e.g. a communication  system upon which the operation and security of a power plant is dependent. CII can also be  identified in the area of information systems administrated by public authority containing personal  information about 300,000, and others.  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  20  A CII is identified and determined by legal act. If the CII is administered by a governmental  department, the governmental resolution is issued. If the CII is administered by other (mostly private)  bodies, the NSA CZE issues a specific general measure decision.  Comparison of the different approaches  After the presentation of the different approaches and some MS examples, below the different  advantages and disadvantages of each approach are listed. It is important to underline that the  purpose of this study is to present the MS with a portfolio of methodological approaches – rather than  a single ‘fits-all’ methodology – so that the MS can tailor the approach that suits better its own specific  characteristics and needs.  Advantages Disadvantages  Network  Architecture  Analysis  The traditional commonly applied  approach in mapping, analysing and  protecting the network  components. This is usually  employed in the private sector.  It is based on the fact that the core  network and certain additional  components serve the majority of  the traffic, therefore they should be  designed resilient. It is expected  that all network operators review,  analyse and take actions to assure  & gradually enhance resilience of  the critical network components.  Given that the ICT sector is  commonly considered critical, its  core infrastructures are CII.  Ignores critical services, served by the  connectivity solutions (CII).  Requires an analysis of the overall national  network (which means having an overview of  the whole network infrastructure formed by  the various network operators).  Cost-benefit criteria, used in network design  & deployment decisions, may be analysed in  financial terms only.  It does not identify access network  components which architecture-wise may  seem insignificant, but may be critical to a  critical service’s connectivity.  Complexity in mapping internet  infrastructures, has been stressed in previous  reports 17.  Complexity is extremely high when dealing  with the lower network hierarchy levels  (transport & access network) and the  relevant components/assets.  14 https://www.ria.ee/en/  15 https://www.ria.ee/CIIP/  16 EMERGENCY ACT, passed 15 June 2009  17 ENISA, Guidelines for enhancing the Resilience of eCommunication Networks  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  21  State-driven  approach /  Critical  services  driven  approach  More systematic. If designed  properly, it could be better aligned  to the actual societal needs.  Better assessment of the critical  services, the relevant value chain  and involved parties. May involve a  process spanning multiple CI/CIIs  operators. Since relationships have a  ‘many to ’many’ nature (e.g. critical  service to operates), the service  value chain complexity should be  analysed early-on.  Done prior to the selection of the  operator of CI/CIIs.  Better MS control of the process.  Detailed list of critical services is not always  present in each MS approach  Define criticality criteria for the identification  of critical assets is a challenging process  especially regarding interdependencies  aspects  The complexity can be significant (including  cross-sector dependencies, cross-border CI  issues). Requires a higher level of  sophistication, in the initial analysis of  services.  State-driven investment in the  development/application of the method is  needed.  Any such approach has not been  identified.  Operator  Driven  approach  Pragmatic approach given the  current state of the art of CII  identification since operators have a  better knowledge of their  infrastructures.  It also represents a shift of the effort  needed to the operator to which is  delegated the accountability.  Need for a strict rule set which has not been  identified. Lack of rules (e.g. a uniform  criticality level applied) may lead to a non- homogeneous deployment of protection  measures (which would not assure alignment  to societal needs).  The concept of critical service maybe under- examined (going directly from operator to  critical assets).  Cross-sector or cross-operators critical  service dependencies may be inadequately  assessed.  Need for strict audit on the identified CI  assets.  Relevant cost for the operator of CI/CIIs (to  apply strict CIP) may provide incentive to  minimize the CI, CII and assets identified.  Effective collaboration between public sector  (Government & mandated Agencies) and the  private sector is fundamental in protecting CII  assets and services.  Table 3: Comparison of methodological approaches in identification of CIIs  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  22  5 Challenges in identification of CIIs assets and services  Based on the findings of the survey presented in chapter 2, the feedback from stakeholders and the  analysis of the different approaches, it was possible to underline the following challenges:   detailed list of critical services is not always present and it is difficult to develop from scratch.   defining criticality criteria for the identification of critical assets is a challenging process   effective collaboration between public sector (Government & mandated Agencies) and the  private sector is fundamental in identifying and protecting CII assets and services.  For these reasons, some improvements for addressing the above issues are presented here. In the  improvements we will focus on critical services dependent approaches. As presented, the network  architecture approach does not scale to a size of a MS due to its complexity and also doesn’t take into  consideration access network components which architecture-wise may seem insignificant, but may  be critical to a critical service’s connectivity.  5.1 Identification of critical sector and services  During the stocktaking process, it became clear that a significant number of Member States present a  low level of maturity and lack a structured approach. Therefore, it was considered useful to have a  reference list of critical sectors / services that they could consult in order to define their own list  depending on their specific geographical characteristics, culture and history.  In that direction, having reviewed several national definitions, an indicative list of critical sectors and  associated sub-sectors and services, is provided in the following table. While compiling the list, an  effort was made to consider the complete value chain of each critical sector.  It is suggested that this  list be used as a reference list by MS (as a starting point), in order to evaluate the sectors and the  services to be classified as critical.

This was underlined by stakeholders as particularly difficult and for this reason an initial outline is here  presented.  Usually, this process consists of the following activities:  a) Application of sector specific criteria, in order to come up with a short-list of potential critical  services  b) Assessment of criticality level of short-listed services. Criticality is the: (I) level of contribution  of an infrastructure to society in maintaining a minimum level of national and international  law and order, public safety, economy, public health and environment, or (ii) impact level to  citizens or to the government from the loss or disruption of the infrastructure.19  Impact is usually evaluated with respect to three primary characteristics:  i. scope or spatial distribution – the geographic area that could be affected by the loss or  unavailability of a critical infrastructure;  ii. severity or intensity or magnitude – the consequences of the disruption or destruction of a  particular critical infrastructure;  iii. Effects of time or temporal distribution – the point that the loss of an element could have a  serious impact (immediate, one to two days, one week).  Several Countries have issued criticality criteria in order to identify the critical assets. A table of  indicative impact criteria is presented below, which could be used as a reference list by Member States  that have not defined yet their own criticality criteria.  Criterion title Explanation  Population affected The percentage of the population of the MS affected from  the disruption of the service  Concentration The density of the population on the geographic  area  affecting the service  Economic Impact The cost of service disruption in terms of GDP percentage.  Public confidence The effect that the proper operation of this service has on  the public confidence towards the government  19  E. Luiijf, H. Burger and M.

Public order The effect that a service interruption may cause to the  public order  Public operations hindered The daily operations of the public, such as going to work  via public transportation, are stopped or thwarted  3rd party MS services are affected Inter-dependencies with critical services of other MS  should be accounted for.  Table 5: List of critical sectors and related critical services  c) Assessment of dependencies. An important dimension to be taken into consideration during  the identification of critical services is the dependencies among the different sectors and  subsectors as well as cross-border dependencies. Dependencies may cause a service and /or  infrastructure to be identified as critical, not because of the first order of disruptions, but due  to the cascading effects that their disruption may have on other services / infrastructures.  Furthermore, disruption of a service in one MS may cause serious effects in other countries.  While assessing the criticality of services, infrastructures and supporting network assets, it is crucial  to examine the system in its entirety rather than per constituent, given that there are at least four  types of dependencies that should be taken into consideration:   Interdependencies within a critical sector (intra-sector): In the telecommunications sector  strong intra-sector dependencies exist. A significant example is the fact that a single Network  Operator owns the fixed network ‘last mile’ and offers wholesale services to the other Network  operators (the so-called Local-loop-unbundling (LLU)). Therefore the business processes of all  NOs depend on the process of the NO which owns the ‘last mile’.   Interdependencies between critical sectors (cross-sector): Interdependencies or dependencies  between critical sectors have been documented in previous studies. In terms of criticality  analysis, the fact that interdependencies between infrastructures exist should be taken into  consideration, as suggested in literature, both at the logical and at the physical level.   Interdependencies among communication network assets: Data networks are built by linking  components/nodes.  Component interdependency is an inherent property of a data network:  each network node depends on other nodes to exchange and forward data packets in order to  provide communication services.  Apart from the ‘physical connectivity interdependency’  clearly reflected in the network architecture, many ‘logical connectivity interdependency’ types  exist in the modern data networking landscape.  Moreover dependencies can be found at the national and international level (cross-border), further  complicating the task to assess risk.  5.3 Effective collaboration: tagging of CIIs assets and centralized views  For the identification of Critical Information Infrastructures in communication networks, the  involvement of two categories of stakeholders should be pursued, i.e. operators of CIs and Network  operators, given the complementarity of their perspectives, responsibilities and expertise.  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  26  Operators of CIs set the requirements for connectivity solutions that they need to procure from the  network operators. In other words, operators of CIs place the order (which may be characterized by a  high degree of complexity) and network operators fulfil the order. The operators of CIs need to identify  and classify the access & private network infrastructures supporting critical applications, according to  their criticality. They are responsible to determine the core processes, the respective applications and,  as a last step, the network assets and services (connectivity solutions) which are used to operate the  respective applications.  Network operators, on the other hand, are responsible to determine the network assets & services,  enabling the connectivity solutions needed by the operators of CIs.  Cybersecurity agencies/ NRAs with mandate on CIIs may have a leading role in all activities related  to the identification and protection of CIIs and as presented in the stock taking aim in the future to  have:   Information systems which would support automated-prioritized handling of incidents affecting  Critical Information Infrastructure.   Maintain a CI/CIIs assets and services database which should include relevant critical services  details, location, dependencies, role/person responsible and point of contacts.  To foster the security of CII and develop effective cooperation, MS should work together with CIIs  asset owners in developing a common approach to the ‘Tagging’ of CII assets  and have a holistic  overview of their status:   Operators of CII should identify the detailed network assets and tag them using a common  taxonomy that can be used to federate the different views.   Mandated agencies could develop the ability to have a centralized view of the CII network  assets and related information in order to react timely in case of incident.  This could allow automated-prioritized handling of incidents affecting CIIs and lead to a prompt and  coordinated response in case of incident or outage.  Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets  and services Guidelines for charting electronic data communication network  December 2014  Page  27  6 Recommendations  Recommendation 1: Member States should clearly identify Critical Information Infrastructures if not  already covered in their Critical Infrastructure activities. As underlined during the stock taking, not  all Member States have clearly defined the asset perimeter of Critical Information Infrastructures. For  this reason, if not already covered by the Critical Infrastructure definition, Member States should  clearly define which specific network assets are covered and should be secure and resilient.  Recommendation 2:  Member States who are starting to work on the identification of CII assets  should work together with the stakeholders involved in the operations of Critical Information  Infrastructures.  Effective collaboration between public sector (Government & mandated Agencies)  and the private sector is fundamental in protecting CII assets and services. For the identification of CIIs  in communication networks, the involvement of two categories of stakeholders should be pursued:   operators of Critical Infrastructures   Network operators  given the complementarity of their perspectives, responsibilities and expertise.  Recommendation 3: Member States who are starting to work on the identification of CII should  adopt a methodology for identification of critical network assets and services, using one or a mix of  the proposed solutions in this study that better fits the need of the MS. It is worth-noting that the  purpose here is to present the Member States with a portfolio of methodological approaches – rather  than a single ‘fits-all’ methodology –that each Member State may choose the approach or a  combination of approaches that suits better to its own specific characteristics and needs.  Recommendation 4: Member States who base their identification of CIIs on critical services should  develop a list of these services and assess internal and external interdependencies. While assessing  the criticality of services, infrastructures and supporting network assets, Member States should define  criticality criteria in order to identify the critical assets and examine the system in its entirety rather  than per constituent. At least four types of dependencies should be taken into consideration:   Interdependencies within a critical sector (intra-sector)   Interdependencies between critical sectors (cross-sector).   Interdependencies among communication network assets.  Moreover dependencies can be found at the national and international level (cross-border), further  complicating the task to have a complete overview.  Recommendation 5: Member States should foster baseline security guidelines for communication  networks used for critical services. To ensure the resilience of critical networks, the Critical  Infrastructure operator or asset owner should adopt security guidelines to be used also at  procurement stage. For this reason a checklist with baseline security  guidelines for communication  networks used for critical services should be made available to align practices across the EU.  Recommendation 6: Member States should foster the adoption of automated procedures for CIIs  tagging in order to be prepared to face future challenges.  To foster the security of critical networks,  Member States should work together with CIIs asset owners in developing a common approach to the  ‘Tagging’ of CII assets. This could allow automated-prioritized handling of incidents affecting Critical  Information infrastructures.

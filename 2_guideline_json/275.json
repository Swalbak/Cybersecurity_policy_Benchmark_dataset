This requires that all relevant levels of the ICT market, from sectoral ICT services and systems  via ICT infrastructures to ICT products and ICT processes, will be addressed and that the  related cybersecurity certification schemes are well accepted by the market. The CSA stipulates  specific requirements, which target efficiency and coherence between schemes of the CSA’s  cybersecurity certification framework. These requirements include:  ‒ The security and assurance requirements for ICT services, ICT processes or ICT  products should be defined based on the risk associated with their intended use.  ‒ Assurance levels should be implemented consistently across schemes.  ‒ Support for security-by-design.  The methodology for sectoral cybersecurity assessments described in this document  (hereinafter called SCSA Methodology) addresses these objectives in the context of drafting  sectoral cybersecurity certification schemes, which address ICT services in individual market  sectors. It is designed to be used as a preparatory step for the definition of a candidate scheme  involving sectoral stakeholders.  A basic principle of the proposed methodology is to establish a sound understanding of the  sectoral ICT services and system as a foundation for all other functions:  ‒ A cybersecurity assessment at the sectoral level will provide information about the  objectives of the sectoral stakeholders and will identify the primary assets and related  risks. As an enhancement of the typical risk assessment procedure, a ‘deep dive’ to gain  detailed information about the intended use of relevant subsystems, products or services  will be conducted. In addition, cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) will be employed to provide  information on potential attackers, their motivation and capabilities. This adds an  important parameter to the risk analysis and contributes to the information needed to  assign security and assurance requirements to ICT subsystems, ICT products or ICT  services based on risk.  ‒ The SCSA Methodology provides the option to integrate sectoral, product, process and  potentially also ISMS-based cybersecurity certification schemes. It offers a concept of  internal risk, security and assurance reference levels. If these are commonly used, they  will support consistency in the definition of risk, security and assurance across schemes.  The SCSA Methodology is designed to address a wide range of certification schemes,  beyond Common Criteria or other ISO/IEC 15408-based schemes. Optionally other  types of certification schemes can be integrated in order to establish consistency across  the various types of schemes that support the proposed methodology.  1 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eu-cybersecurity-certification-framework  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eu-cybersecurity-certification-framework  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  7  ‒ A link between the ISO/IEC 270xx series of standards and ISO/IEC 15408 is needed to  allow information to be exchanged between the outcome of risk assessment and the  specification of security and assurance of products. The expert team has developed a  mapping approach that addresses existing divergences of terminology between these  standards and allows the transfer of the information that is required.  ‒ The introduction of a common, scalable approach to risk-based security and assurance  supports the definition of scaled controls. These controls are associated with clear  security levels which are defined in accordance with their ability to treat risk and protect  against known attack potentials. The expert team has drafted a sample list of scaled  controls and has described how these controls can be used in a coordinated way.  Based on these properties and functions, the SCSA Methodology has the potential to fully  support the aforementioned requirements stipulated by the CSA and to promote the market  acceptance of cybersecurity certification in the following ways:  ‒ The SCSA Methodology supports the identification of risk associated with the intended  use of ICT systems, ICT services and ICT processes at any level of the sectoral  architecture. In applying the methodology, relevant stakeholders will be responsible for  the identification of risks and they will be involved in the definition of security and  assurance requirements. This will allow them to balance their view of risks against the  investment needed to mitigate these risks by introducing appropriate levels of security  and assurance. It can be expected that this transparent, cooperative approach will  contribute significantly to the market acceptance of schemes under the CSA.  ‒ As required by the CSA, consistency in the implementation of assurance levels can be  achieved across schemes. This will allow the re-use of certificates issued by one scheme  in other schemes, thus providing an important benefit both to the business interests of  product and infrastructure service providers and to their customers. At the same time,  the methodology’s approach to consistency is also flexible enough to support the  integration of new types of cybersecurity certification schemes, which may emerge as a  result of specific requirements from different markets.  ‒ Introducing a common concept for security levels facilitates the definition of controls  which can be commonly used across participating schemes. This provides a sound basis  for the introduction of libraries of such controls. The availability of those could  significantly promote the introduction of security-by-design, as well as the  implementation of defined security levels in ICT products, ICT processes and also in ICT  systems.  Applying the SCSA Methodology will generate sound information about the sectoral system and  defined relationships between the stakeholders involved, which may enable additional tangible  benefits, including:  ‒ Product and service providers will benefit from reliable information about the intended  use of their products and services, as well as sectoral security and assurance  requirements. This will allow them to optimize their products and their market reach.  ‒ The defined relationships between risk, security and assurance proposed by this  methodology support the definition of horizontal products and services, which can serve  various sectors.  ‒ A sound understanding of the ICT system, the defined roles of the relevant parts and  stakeholders, and the availability of controls with defined properties concerning risk and  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  8  attack potential open new options, especially for sectors that have, for example, to deal  with cost pressures and attackers with an elevated potential at the same time. Based on  this methodology, the deployment of controls may be coordinated and firmly agreed  between stakeholders. For example a basic-level control in an IoT device and a medium-  level control in the sectoral back-office may be concatenated and coordinated in such a  way that they jointly reach a security level that also protects against elevated attack  potentials.  The version of the methodology described in this document is sufficiently mature to allow a first  practical use in drafting sectoral cybersecurity certification schemes. Experience gained from  this first deployment should be used to improve and consolidate the methodology.  In summary, the proposed methodology not only supports the workflow of drafting the CSA  cybersecurity scheme but also offers a potential for a broader use by sectors and providers of  infrastructure.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  9  1. INTRODUCTION TO THE SCSA  METHODOLOGY  1.1 BACKGROUND AND REQUIREMENTS  The European Cybersecurity Act (CSA) stipulates fundamental requirements for the definition,  implementation and maintenance of EU cybersecurity certification schemes. The use of these  schemes is voluntary. Therefore their market take-up, as a prerequisite, requires acceptance by  the ICT industry and the consumers.  The market success of the EU cybersecurity certification framework requires, amongst other  things, a balance to be struck between potentially contradictory requirements, as follows:  1. Flexibility vs consistency  The individual market needs of sectors or product and system vendors may require the  flexibility to establish specific schemes at sectoral level or for certain categories of ICT  services, products and processes. The CSA supports this flexibility.  However, it is also of fundamental importance for market acceptance that certificates  issued by one scheme can be re-used and recognized by other schemes under the CSA.  This requires a well-balanced compromise between flexibility and consistency of scheme  definition and a clear definition of the relationship between schemes under the CSA. The  CSA stipulates that assurance levels should be implemented consistently across sectoral  schemes, which would then support the recognition of certified products, processes and  services by those sectoral schemes.  2. Cost vs benefit of security and assurance  The optimization of investments in security and assurance is a fundamental criterion for  market acceptance by ICT system owners. The CSA supports this requirement by  stipulating that the security and assurance requirements of ICT services, products and  processes should be defined based on the risk associated with their intended use. This  allows an informed decision to be made based on an appropriate balance between the  level of risk that would be acceptable to the risk owners and the cost of security and  assurance.  The implementation of this principle requires that the risk associated with the intended use  of an ICT product or process at sectoral level is understood and that this information can  be used to optimize the security and assurance of the product or process accordingly.  3. High attack potential vs limitations of controls  Some market sectors, for instance those which make use of ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT)  elements, must take account of the pressure to limit costs associated with the mass-  market or the limitations inherent in consumer devices. This may prohibit the deployment  of high-level controls and assurance, despite the fact that highly skilled attackers may be  motivated to conduct attacks against such devices.  There should therefore be a method that helps to identify and document such cases and  which supports the development of appropriate remedies.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  10  The implementation of practical and sound solutions to these questions requires a transparent  methodology. This methodology is introduced in Section 1.2 of this document. Section 1.3  describes how it can be applied in the process of developing a cybersecurity scheme.  A detailed interpretation of the requirements given by the CSA is provided with the  documentation of the methodology in sections 4.1 and 5.1.  1.2 INTRODUCTION TO THE SCSA METHODOLOGY  This document describes a methodology designed to be used in the process of drafting  cybersecurity certification schemes for sectoral ICT services and systems in order to address  the issues mentioned in Section 1.1. It was developed by a cross-functional team of  experienced European ICT experts led by ENISA. The following paragraphs describe the steps  that had to be taken to establish the methodology.  1. Understanding sectoral services and schemes - introduction of a structured  approach to cybersecurity certification schemes  The first step in the development of the methodology was to clarify the types of  cybersecurity certification schemes to be supported and to define the relationships  between these with the goal of enabling the re-use of certificates. For this purpose, the  methodology introduces a layered architecture model that distinguishes between the layer  of sectoral ICT systems, which support sectoral ICT services, the layer of ICT  infrastructures and the layer of generic ICT products and processes. It categorizes the  related types of cybersecurity certification schemes into sectoral, infrastructural, ISMS and  product schemes, and defines the relations between these for the propagation of risk  information, security and assurance requirements and the recognition of certificates.  A typical sectoral ICT system employs:   numerous types of ICT systems which are part of an internal ISMS,   generic ICT products provided by external vendors, and also, very likely   ICT services provided by ICT infrastructures such as mobile networks, payment or  ID services.  It would not be practical to request that a sectoral cybersecurity certification scheme  evaluates and certifies all of these elements. Instead, such a scheme should, for each  individual element, reference, as far as possible, those certificates that have been issued  by any schemes which address those elements. Chapter 4 documents these  considerations.  2. Enabling information exchange between the relevant standards  Sectors typically use a combination of ISMS certification and certified ICT products and  processes for the certification of the required levels of security and assurance for the  sectoral ICT system that enables their ICT services. The risk assessment of information  security and ISMS certification is standardized by ISO/IEC 270xx, while the leading series  of standards for ICT product security evaluation is ISO/IEC 15408. These standards have  different approaches and use different terminology, which makes the transfer of  information and requirements between them difficult.  The CSA stipulates that the definition of security and assurance requirements for ICT  products, ICT processes and ICT services should reflect the risk associated with their  intended use. The identification of this risk is typically conducted at sectoral system level  using an ISO/IEC 270xx-conformant risk assessment. However, the specification of the  security and assurance requirements of an ICT product is typically carried out using  ISO/IEC 15408. Before the development of this methodology there was no link between  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  11  the two standards, which could be used to transfer the information in a defined way. The  specification of ICT products by protection profiles or security targets has to date typically  been based on assumptions by the product vendor or by limited stakeholder groups, not  on input from the sectoral system owner.  As one of the foundations of the methodology, the working-group experts have developed  an approach to analyse and compare the viewpoints and the meanings of terms in  ISO/IEC 270xx and in ISO/IEC 15408. This is documented in Annex A. A comparison of  different meanings in the two groups of standards is given in Section 2.3.  On the basis of  this analysis and comparison, it was possible to develop the method mentioned in the  previous paragraph. This method allows the exchange of the required information between  the sectoral level, which uses ISO/IEC 270xx, and product level specifications based on  ISO/IEC 15408.  Using this innovative approach it will be possible to optimize the development of ICT  products, ICT processes and ICT services by providing information about the precise  security context and needs of the sectors in which the ICT products, ICT processes and  ICT services will be deployed. Sectors can also be sure that they are in a position to  communicate their requirements to the developers and vendors of ICT products, ICT  processes and ICT services, and will be able to check if certified ICT products, ICT  processes and ICT services suit their purposes.  3. Using existing risk assessment methods and cyberthreat intelligence  Balancing the potentially contradictory objectives described in Section 1.1 requires a  sound understanding of the objectives of the sectoral stakeholders, the sectoral system  and the intended use of supporting ICT services, ICT products and ICT processes which  are employed by the sector.  The basis for the required knowledge is established by conducting a risk assessment at  sectoral level. Established ISO-conformant methods such as Ebios RM2 may be used to  identify and document risks from the perspective of the sectoral stakeholders. The  proposed methodology is designed to re-use these existing risk assessment methods, not  to replace or modify them.  However, the targeted purposes require the classical risk assessment methods to be  supplemented by additional elements. The working-group’s proposals for doing this are  described in this methodology.  First, there is a need to document the intended use of  supporting ICT products, ICT processes and ICT services. Second, cyberthreat  intelligence (CTI) should be applied to allow the input of information about attacker types  and their motivation, means and opportunities to attack targeted ICT products, ICT  processes and ICT services. Section 5.3 contains detailed descriptions of how these  additional elements should be used. Chapter 9 provides an introduction to CTI and to the  methods for estimating the potential of attackers.  4. Supporting a flexible definition of risk and consistent implementation of  assurance and security  Chapter 5 describes not just how to apply risk assessment and CTI tools but it also  describes a core part of the methodology, the concept of how to balance consistency in  the implementation of assurance levels and the flexibility to adapt to the individual  requirements of particular markets. The principles behind this concept are documented in  Section 5.1.  2 For an inventory of Risk Assessment and Management Methodologies see:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  12  The CSA defines three assurance levels and stipulates that each assurance level should  be consistent between the sectoral domains. This is essential to avoid fragmentation  between schemes and is a precondition for a broad recognition of certificates issued under  the CSA.  As a first step in identifying a consistent implementation, the expert team defined an  approach, the ‘common assurance reference’ (CAR) concept, which aims at comparability  between implementations instead of full consistency and, by this, allows deviations  between scheme-specific implementations of assurance levels. This supports the flexibility  to follow market requirements and maximizes the options to integrate certificates from  CSA-internal, incumbent Common Criteria and also industry schemes while maintaining a  sufficient level of comparability.  The common assurance reference concept is derived from the AVA_VAN assurance  family, which is the basis for the vulnerability analysis in ISO/IEC 15408-3. The use of  AVA_VAN as a key parameter allows flexibility in comparing implementations of assurance  levels. Moreover, deviations from the standard are allowed as documented in Subsection  5.6.6. This concept would support the integration of certificates which are issued by  schemes that employ the evaluation methodologies defined in ISO/IEC 15408 and  ISO/IEC 18045. This includes EUCC, SOGIS and other CC schemes, and also, potentially,  a variety of industry schemes which re-use parts of ISO/IEC 18045 because of its maturity  and reputation in the market.  Other evaluation methodologies and related certification schemes, including those which  are not related to ISO/IEC 15408, could potentially also be linked to the proposed common  assurance reference concept. This could allow the integration of cybersecurity certification  schemes with different approaches into the cybersecurity certification framework under the  CSA.  The CAR concept supports five levels. These levels can be mapped to the CSA assurance  levels as it is known from the EUCC candidate scheme. The considerations concerning the  common assurance reference concept are documented in Section 5.6. The CAR-concept  can be viewed as the cornerstone of the SCSA Methodology. It is intended to introduce  consistency across sectors and schemes.  The CSA suggests that the definition of security and assurance requirements is based on  risk. This leads to the two other critical features of the methodology, the ‘meta-risk classes’  (MRC) to allow a common approach to risk assessment, and ‘common security levels’  (CSL) to allow a consistent approach to security controls. In the proposed methodology,  each level of common assurance reference (CAR) and common security level (CSL)  corresponds to a particular meta-risk class (MRC). The concept of meta-risk classes and  how they are defined based on risk and CTI information is documented in Section 5.3. The  common security levels and the selection of levels based on the meta-risk class and attack  potential are described in Section 5.5.  This relationship between meta-risk classes and common assurance references and  common security levels satisfies the CSA’s requirement for risk-based assurance and  security and also the requirement for a consistent definition of assurance levels. If applied  in all sectoral scheme drafting projects, it will help suppliers to define generic ICT products,  ICT processes and ICT services, whose certificates can be recognized in all these sectors.  In particular, from a security certification perspective, the common methodology to define  assurance levels allows the comparability of certificates issued by different certification  schemes.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  13  The SCSA Methodology also defines how the assurance level to be claimed for the  certification of an ICT product or ICT product type is determined, and which information,  from any sectoral risk assessment, would be a valuable input for vulnerability analysis.  Then, certificates issued by any certification scheme can be compared based on their  claimed assurance level and be recognized between different sectors in which the certified  ICT product is intended to be used.  However, the requirement for consistency and coherence of schemes under the CSA has  to be balanced with the need for the flexibility that will allow particular schemes and their  evaluation methodologies to be adapted to the requirements of certain markets. The SCSA  Methodology introduces this required flexibility in two ways:  1. The identification of risks and the assignment of these risks to meta-risk classes is  the responsibility of the sectoral stakeholders. Based on their ‘risk-appetite’,  stakeholders from different sectors may select different meta-risk classes for  comparable risks.  2. Sectoral stakeholders may deviate from the defaults for the selection of assurance  and security levels based on meta-risk classes if these deviations are explained  and documented.  It can be concluded that, using the methodology as documented in Chapter 5, it should be  possible to balance consistency and flexibility as required in Section 1.1.  5. Enabling a coordinated application of security controls  According to the CSA, it is the purpose of controls to decrease risk and to prevent  cybersecurity incidents. Therefore control strength, which is defined by this methodology in  relation to common security levels, takes into account not only the risk but also the potential  of motivated attackers to cause an impact. Section 5.5 documents this part of the  methodology.  Based on the common security level concept it should also be possible to develop libraries  of controls scaled according to their common security levels. These libraries could help  product vendors as well as owners of ISMS to implement a well-defined level of security.  They would also provide a practical approach to security-by-design. This would be of  particular help to developers, who are not cybersecurity experts, in the correct  implementation of IT security. An example of such a library, which includes single examples  of controls assigned to common security levels, is given in Annex F.  The use of the methodology set out in this document should generate a sound and  comprehensive understanding of sectoral ICT systems with respect to all aspects related to  cybersecurity risks, controls and assurance. Such systems include all the ICT products, ICT  processes and ICT services deployed, as well as the cybersecurity functionality contributed  by the ISMS implemented by sectoral stakeholders.  In the absence of this methodology ICT product developers and vendors, as well as those  responsible for sectoral ISMS, will be restricted to an understanding only of those  cybersecurity risks and controls implemented in the domains for which they are  responsible. With the support of this methodology, however, they will be able to plan the  provision of cybersecurity controls to a level that is appropriate to the demands of overall  sectoral cybersecurity risk management. As described in the previous section such  planning is vital if, for example, an ICT product imposes limits on the degree to which its  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  14  level of security can be raised, while at the same time an elevated attack potential has to be  assumed.  Based on knowledge of the system as a whole, which can be generated by this  methodology, it should be possible to apply cybersecurity controls in a coordinated and  holistic way. For example, the cybersecurity controls inherent in an ICT product and the  cybersecurity controls implemented within a sectoral ISMS can support each other to gain  the level of security required to manage the overall risk. This concept is termed  ‘concatenation of controls’ and is described in Subsection 5.5.3. An example is given in  Chapter 8. This approach should help to deliver a viable balance between risk and attack  potential and the limitations imposed by ICT products – such as those associated with the  application of IoT devices.  1.3 APPLYING THE SCSA METHODOLOGY  The SCSA Methodology described in this document should address the objectives given in 1.1  in the context of the workflow for drafting sectoral cybersecurity certification schemes. It is  designed to be used in a preparatory step for the definition of a candidate scheme and should  be conducted in cooperation with stakeholders and experts invited by ENISA to an ad hoc  working group. It is important that the required expertise (in risk assessment, CTI, definition of  controls etc.) should be considered when selecting participants. Chapter 6 describes the setup  and the workflow to be followed.  1.4 STATE OF THE WORK  The version of the proposed methodology described in this document contains all the features  and functions which are necessary for an application in the context of drafting a sectoral  cybersecurity certification scheme. The methodology relies as far as possible on standards and  proven concepts. However, some parts were developed specifically for this methodology and  can be seen as innovations.  The practicality of the SCSA Methodology and its applicability in the area of 5G was evaluated  in a dedicated pilot project. Respective improvements and enhancements have been added to  this version.  1.4.1 Potential future steps  The sample list of security controls could be enhanced to cover more control objectives and  more technical or organizational controls. In addition, the practicality of the methodology could  be significantly increased by the development of methods to assign controls to a specific  common security level (CSL, cf. Section 5.5) and to estimate the overall CSL resulting from a  concatenation of controls.  The new methods for identifying the potential of attackers specified in Chapter 9 should be  consolidated after their first practical implementation.

DEFINITIONS AND  ABBREVIATIONS  2.1 DEFINITION OF TERMS  Generally, the definitions of terms as given in the regulatory documents and references listed in  Chapter 3 apply in this report. However, terms given in the CSA have the highest priority. This  section provides definitions for terms which are not included in those normative references or  which are of special relevance for the methodology described in this report.  Asset:  Anything related to information security that has value to the sectoral  ecosystem.  Note 1 to entry: Two kinds of information security related assets can  be distinguished:  ‒ the primary assets:   business processes & activities   functional assets   information assets.  ‒ the supporting assets (on which the primary assets rely) of all types:   ICT system   hardware component   software component   network infrastructure   personnel   site   organization’s structure.  Note 2: Primary assets are critical to the achievement of business  objectives.  Assurance level: Basis for confidence that an ICT product, ICT service or ICT process  meets the security requirements of a specific European cybersecurity  certification scheme, indicates the level at which an ICT product, ICT  service or ICT process has been evaluated but, as such, does not  measure the security of the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process  concerned (cf. CSA, article 2.22).  Attack scenario: Description of an attack, including attacker types, considerations of  attacker objectives, attack potential, motivation and the primary asset  and supporting assets potentially targeted by the attack.  Horizontal: Adjective indicating that an ICT product, ICT process or ICT service  targets multiple markets and that the related cybersecurity certificate  may be recognized by corresponding cybersecurity certification  schemes of these targeted markets.  ICT process: Set of activities performed to design, develop, deliver or maintain an  ICT product or ICT service (cf. CSA).  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  16  ICT product: Element or a group of elements of a network or information system  (cf. CSA).  ICT service: Service consisting fully or mainly in the transmission, storing,  retrieving or processing of information by means of network and  information systems (cf. CSA).  ICT system: Network or information system (cf. CSA); combination of ICT products  and ICT processes that supports one or more ICT services.  Risk scenario: Description of a potential event or incident that could have a negative  impact on one or more stakeholder objectives.  NOTE: The risk scenario defines a particular combination of  parameters that define the incident. These include, primarily, a  stakeholder objective related to a specific business process and a  primary asset in which ICT security is essential for this stakeholder  objective. In addition, the related stakeholder requirements,  supporting assets as well as relevant attacker information and attack  scenarios are included.  2.2 ABBREVIATIONS  AP Attack potential  APL Attack potential level  AVA_VAN Assurance family defined by ISO/IEC 15408-3; addresses the  vulnerability analysis  CAR Common assurance reference  CC Common Criteria  CSA European Union Cybersecurity Act  CSL Common security level  CTI Cyberthreat intelligence  EAL Evaluation assurance level as defined in ISO/IEC 15408  EUCC European Union Common Criteria cybersecurity certification scheme  IC Impact class  ICT Information and communication technology  IoT Internet of things  ISAC Intelligence sharing and analysis centre  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  17  ISMS Information security management system as defined in the  ISO/IEC 270xx series of standards  MRC Meta-risk class  OSP Organizational security policies  PP Protection profile  SAR Security assurance requirements  SCSA Sectoral cybersecurity assessment  SCSAM Sectoral cybersecurity assessment methodology  SFR Security functional requirements  SPD Security problem definition  ST  Security target as defined in ISO/IEC 15408-1  TOE Target of evaluation as defined in ISO/IEC 15408  TSF Target of evaluation security functionality  TTP Techniques, tactics and procedures  2.3 OVERVIEW OF DIVERGING USES OF TERMS  The normative references for the methodology described in this document use certain terms in  the context of different concepts and with different meanings. The following table provides an  overview of those terms, provides a short interpretation of the meaning of each term for each  normative reference and explains how the term is used in the context of this document. The  conceptual considerations that lead to the interpretation of meanings concerning ISO/IEC 270xx  and ISO/IEC 15408 are documented in Annex A.  Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is currently not covered by specific standards and typically uses  ISO/IEC 270xx as a basis for the definition of the terms it uses. The following table shows, in  some cases, a CTI-specific use of terms. However, when no statement for CTI is provided, it  can be assumed that the use of a term in CTI follows ISO/IEC 270xx.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  18  Basic term  Meaning in the  CSA  Meaning in  ISO/IEC 27000:2018  Meaning  ISO/IEC 15408-1:2014  Meaning in  Cyberthreat  intelligence  (CTI)  Attacker Term not defined but  used in CSA, Art. 52.7  providing a description  of evaluation activities  relevant to assurance  level ‘high’. One such  activity is: (..) an  assessment of their  resistance to skilled  attackers, using  penetration testing.  Term not defined but  used to characterize the  factors of a risk:  — for deliberate threat  sources: the motivation  and capabilities, which  change over time, and  resources available to  possible attackers, as  well as the perception of  attractiveness and  vulnerability of assets for  a possible attacker  [ISO/IEC 27005, Clause  8.3.3].  Term not defined but used  (see ‘attack potential’  below).  ‘Threat agent’ is defined  as entity that can  adversely act on assets.  Both terms are used in  similar context but the  meaning of ‘threat agent’  is broader. It can be a  hacker, user, computer  process, and accident (see  Annex A).  Attacker and  adversary are used  synonymously.  Remarks on the  use of term  ‘attacker’  In this document, the term means an actor or actors who could potentially perform an attack. The terms  ‘attacker’, ‘adversary’ and ‘threat agent’ are used synonymously.  The CSA and ISO/IEC15408-1 use this term in the context of evaluation, assessing the resistance of the  ICT product against skilled attacks, while ISO/IEC 27000 considers it as a source for influencing risk.  Attack  potential  Term not defined nor  used.  Term not defined but  indirectly used when  analysing deliberate  threat sources (see  ‘attacker’) for the  purposes of risk  assessment.  Attack potential – term  defined as measure of the  effort to be expended in  attacking a TOE,  expressed in terms of an  attacker's expertise,  resources and motivation.  Attack potential is  characterized by the  opportunity, means  and motivation of  the attacker.  Remarks on the  use of term  ‘attack  potential’  CTI uses three factors to describe an attack potential: motives, means and opportunities. This document  follows the use of the term introduced by CTI as necessary to conduct risk assessment in sectoral  schemes.  ISO/IEC 15408-1 and ISO/IEC 18045 use the term to describe the level of effort evaluators are obliged  to use in performing vulnerability assessments. In this context there are five factors that characterize an  attack potential: Elapsed Time, Window of Opportunity, Specialist Expertise, Knowledge of the TOE, IT  hardware/software or other equipment. In addition, ISO/IEC 18045 provides classifications for each  factor and provides a scale for the calculation of the potential value of a particular attack. (See below and  Subsection 5.6.5.)  Attack  potential  (means)  n/a n/a IT hardware/software or  other equipment refers  to the equipment required  to identify or exploit a  vulnerability.  Capability and  Resources: access  to vulnerabilities,  exploits, tooling, and  financial means  necessary to  conduct attacks.  Attack  potential  (skills)  n/a n/a Expertise: refers to the  level of generic knowledge  of the underlying  principles, product type or  attack methods (e.g.  Internet protocols, Unix  operating systems, buffer  overflows).  Knowledge of TOE: is a  specific expertise with  respect to the TOE that  goes beyond generic  knowledge  Skill: knowledge and  expertise to  conceptualize and  realize a particular  attack.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  19  Basic term  Meaning in the  CSA  Meaning in  ISO/IEC 27000:2018  Meaning  ISO/IEC 15408-1:2014  Meaning in  Cyberthreat  intelligence  (CTI)  Attack  potential  (opportunity)  n/a n/a Elapsed Time: is the total  amount of time taken by  an attacker to identify that  a particular potential  vulnerability may exist in  the TOE, to develop an  attack method and to  sustain effort required to  mount the attack against  the TOE.  Window of Opportunity:  related to the Elapsed  Time factor. Identification  or exploitation of a  vulnerability may require  considerable amounts of  access to a TOE that may  increase the likelihood of  detection. Some attack  methods may require  considerable effort off-line,  and only brief access to  the TOE to exploit. Access  may also need to be  continuous, or over a  number of sessions.  Opportunity:  Possibility of the  adversary getting  access to the  system or artifact,  presence of  exploitable  vulnerabilities.  Control  Control – term used in  CSA, Art. 52.4: The  certificate or the EU  statement of  conformity shall refer  to technical  specifications,  standards and  procedures related  thereto, including  technical controls,  the purpose of which  is to decrease the risk  of, or to prevent,  cybersecurity  incidents.  Control - term defined  as a measure that is  modifying risk.  Control – term not defined  but used in relation to  ‘security’: (…) it is  recognised that significant  security can often be  achieved through or  supported by  administrative measures  such as organisational,  personnel, physical, and  procedural controls.  Remarks on the  use of the term  ‘control’  In this document the term means a measure to decrease risk or to prevent cybersecurity incidents. It  should be noted that ISO/IEC 27000 uses the term ‘control’ in direct relation to ‘objective’ and to ‘risk’,  while in ISO/IEC 15408 it is related to ‘security’. CSA understands ‘technical control’ as a measure for  decreasing the risk, which is similar to ISO/IEC 27000.  Objective security objective –  term not defined but  used with reference to  requirements set up  by cybersecurity  certification schemes  (CSA, Art. 51): A  European  cybersecurity  certification scheme  shall be designed to  achieve, as applicable,  control objective – term  defined as statement  describing what is to be  achieved as a result of  implementing controls.  security objective – term  defined as statement of an  intent to counter identified  threats and/or satisfy  identified organization  security policies and/or  assumptions.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  20  Basic term  Meaning in the  CSA  Meaning in  ISO/IEC 27000:2018  Meaning  ISO/IEC 15408-1:2014  Meaning in  Cyberthreat  intelligence  (CTI)  at least the following  security objectives (..).  Remarks on the  use of the term  ‘objective’  In this document, the term is generally used in its common dictionary meaning. If a specific context of  risk management is concerned ISO/IEC 270xx is followed.  The use in the CSA is different from the referenced standards where the meaning is related to what is to  be achieved by implementing controls (ISO/IEC 270xx) or security functionality (ISO/IEC 15408). The  CSA understands ‘security objectives’ as ‘high-level security requirements’.  Process [ICT] process – term  defined as set of  activities performed to  design, develop,  deliver or maintain an  ICT product or ICT  service.  Process – term defined  as set of interrelated or  interacting activities  which transforms inputs  into outputs.  Process – term not  defined and used with its  common meaning.  Remarks on the  use of term  ‘process’  In this document, the definition provided by the CSA is used.  Both CSA and ISO/IEC 270xx consider ‘ICT service’ as a subject of certification. It should be noted that  ISO/IEC 15408 does not present a process-oriented approach.  Product [ICT] product – term  defined as an  element or a group of  elements of a network  or information  system.  product – term not used [IT] product – term not  defined but used with its  common meaning. In the  context of evaluation,  ISO/IEC 15408  establishes an important  distinction between an IT  product and a TOE  (Target of Evaluation):  The TOE may be an IT  product, a part of an IT  product, a set of IT  products, a unique  technology that may  never be made into a  product, or a combination  of these.  Remarks on the  use of term  ‘product’  In this document the definition provided by CSA is used. It should be noted that the CSA is very general  when speaking of certification / evaluation with regards to ICT products. Existing schemes based on  ISO/IEC 15408/ISO/IEC 18045 allow certification of Protection Profiles that relate to types of ICT  products, not specific ones.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  21  Basic term  Meaning in the  CSA  Meaning in  ISO/IEC 27000:2018  Meaning  ISO/IEC 15408-1:2014  Meaning in  Cyberthreat  intelligence  (CTI)  Requirement [security] requirement  – term not defined but  used in the context of  conformity  assessment  performed against the  technical specification  that contains such  requirements (see  CSA, Art. 46.2): (..) to  attest that the ICT  products, ICT services  and ICT processes  that have been  evaluated in  accordance with such  schemes comply with  specified security  requirements for the  purpose of protecting  the availability,  authenticity, integrity  or confidentiality of  stored or transmitted  or processed data or  the functions or  services (..).  requirement – term  defined as need or  expectation that is  stated, generally implied  or obligatory.  [security] requirement –  term defined as  requirement, stated in a  standardised language,  which is meant to  contribute to achieving the  security objectives for a  TOE [Target of  Evaluation].  Remarks on the  use of term  ‘requirement’  In this document the term follows the definition given in ISO/IEC 270xx.  It should be noted that this term is used in similar ways in the referenced documents – all lead to  establishing relationships between ‘conformity’ and ‘requirement’, although ISO/IEC 15408 uses this  term in a narrow technical context. Further, it should be underlined that ISO/IEC 270xx defines  ‘conformity’ as ‘fulfilment of a requirement’ and considers ‘conformance’ used in ISO/IEC 15408 as a  synonym. Finally, ISO/IEC 15408 uses ‘requirement’ with a direct relationship to ‘objectives’.  Service [ICT] service – term  defined as Service  consisting fully or  mainly in the  transmission, storing,  retrieving or  processing of  information by means  of network and  information systems.  Service – term not  defined and used with  its technical meaning to  describe relationships  between various  elements of an  information system;  additionally, it is used to  describe business  relationships in the  ISMS (for example an  organization’s  relationship with a  service provider);  providing services can  be included in the  scope of the ISMS.  Service – term not  defined and used only  with its technical meaning  to describe relationships  between elements/  components of the  information system.  Remarks on the  use of term  ‘service’.  In this document the use of this term follows CSA.  Both CSA and ISO/IEC 270xx consider ‘ICT service’ as a subject of certification.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  22  Basic term  Meaning in the  CSA  Meaning in  ISO/IEC 27000:2018  Meaning  ISO/IEC 15408-1:2014  Meaning in  Cyberthreat  intelligence  (CTI)  Security [cyber] security - term  defined as: activities  necessary to protect  network and  information systems,  the users of such  systems, and other  persons affected by  cyberthreats.  [information] security –  term defined as  preservation of  confidentiality, integrity  and availability of  information.  security – term not  defined but considered as  a fundamental concept  with many characteristics,  for example: security  attribute, security  problem, security  requirement, security  functionality.  Remarks on the  use of term  ‘security’  ‘Security’ in the CSA means ‘activities’, while in referenced standards ‘security’ is considered as a state  for the object described (a security attribute that can be lost – loss of confidentiality, integrity of  availability). It is to be noted that ISO/IEC 15408 defines ‘secure state’ as state in which the TSF [Target  of Evaluation Security Functionality] data are consistent and the TSF continues correct enforcement of  the SFRs [Security Functional Requirements].  In this document the term is used in both meanings, i. e. describing the state or the activities, depending  on the context.

INTRODUCTION TO SECTORAL  SYSTEMS AND CYBERSECURITY  CERTIFICATION SCHEMES  4.1 SECTORAL SYSTEMS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CSA  The CSA defines and distinguishes between ICT products, ICT processes and ICT services.  The relationships between these elements can be visualized as follows:  Figure 1: CSA-defined elements and their relations  The CSA stipulates that an ICT service is supported by ICT products and ICT processes. This  combination of ICT products and ICT processes that support an ICT service is called an ICT  service system or, in brief, an ‘ICT system’.  In addition, there are ICT processes that support ICT products, for example product  development processes. These are usually different from those that support ICT services.  Typically, there is a coordinated use of several ICT products to support all product-based  functions needed for the implementation and operation of the ICT service. The specification of  this coordinated use of several ICT products is called the system architecture.  It should be noted that ICT processes are also able to use ICT products.  With a view to conducting risk assessment, evaluation and certification, it is necessary to  distinguish between the following layers of an ICT system:  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  25  1. ICT Infrastructures  ICT infrastructures serve several markets, applications and end-user services. Examples are  mobile networks, cloud services and payment or ID services if these can be integrated into  sectoral ICT systems. ICT infrastructures could also be regarded as providing ICT services  to the owners of the sectoral ICT systems they support. From a business perspective, this  could be seen as a relationship between unrelated organizations in the roles of an ICT  infrastructure service provider and a business user.  2. Sectoral ICT Systems  Sectoral systems include all functions that are specific to the provision of services to a  particular market sector targeted at end-users. Sectoral ICT systems usually rely on ICT  infrastructure services for specific functions. Whenever security-relevant functions of a  sectoral ICT system depend on external ICT services, these are regarded as ICT  infrastructure services.  Combinations of ICT infrastructures and sectoral ICT systems are common. For example in 5G,  payment and ID services are typically both integrated by sectoral systems and offer ICT  services to end-users. Both infrastructures and sectoral ICT systems combine ICT products and  ICT processes as defined in the CSA. The following picture shows the characteristic  relationships between:   sectoral ICT systems, which support one or more sectoral ICT services,   ICT infrastructures, which potentially provide ICT infrastructure services to support sectoral  ICT systems, and   ICT products, which may be used in both, sectoral ICT systems and ICT infrastructures.  Figure 2: Relations between system architecture levels  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  26  From the perspective of cybersecurity evaluation and certification, it is important to consider not  only the technical interaction between these building blocks of the overall ICT system but also  the allocation of responsibilities within them, since the owners of each of the building blocks  must carry out risk assessments, implement appropriate controls, and support evaluation and  certification at their level.  This consideration leads to an important difference between ICT infrastructures and ICT  products: the definition, implementation and operation of ICT infrastructures is the responsibility  of the stakeholders in an ICT infrastructure. In contrast, responsibility for the integration and  operation of an ICT product in accordance with its intended use is with the entities that purchase  the ICT product, i.e. the stakeholders of ICT infrastructures or sectoral ICT systems. The vendor  is responsible for evaluation and certification of ICT products.  4.2 RISK-BASED DEFINITION OF SECURITY AND ASSURANCE ACROSS  ARCHITECTURE LEVELS  The structure and relationships between the building blocks of an ICT service system, as  defined in the previous section, provide the basis for risk-based identification of security and  assurance requirements at all levels.  The basic relationships are as follows:  1. The sectoral stakeholders should identify the security and assurance requirements to the  sectoral ICT system and the supporting ICT infrastructures and ICT products based on a  risk assessment from the perspective of the targeted sectoral ICT services.  2. ICT infrastructure stakeholders should consider these sectoral requirements when defining  the security and assurance of their ICT infrastructure and confirming the compliance of their  ICT services to the owners of sectoral ICT systems in service level agreements.  3. Security and assurance requirements from all supported sectors must therefore be  considered when ICT infrastructures and their ICT services, ICT products and ICT  processes are being implemented.  4. ICT products and processes, which are employed by sectoral ICT systems or ICT  infrastructures, must comply with the stipulated requirements covering their intended use in  all environments where they are targeted for deployment.  5. All stipulated requirements made by the targeted sectoral ICT systems or ICT  infrastructures should be consolidated and included in the definition of the security problem,  the security functional requirements and security assurance requirements of the ICT  product.  Sectoral risk assessments are key to the formulation of security and assurance requirements for  supporting ICT infrastructures and ICT products, and those ICT products and processes used  by sectoral systems internally.  Risk assessments must also be carried out for ICT infrastructure services and systems.  Section 4.4 will provide more detail on how cybersecurity certification schemes for sectoral ICT  systems and ICT infrastructures should be prepared and implemented.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  27  4.3 INTRODUCTION TO SECTORAL ICT SYSTEMS  4.3.1 Properties of sectoral ICT systems  Subsection 4.1 introduced definitions for the terms ICT system, sectoral ICT system and ICT  infrastructure and described the relationships between these building blocks of an ICT service  system, both amongst each other and in relation to the terms defined by the CSA.  The following properties characterize a sectoral ICT system:  ‒ Sectoral systems support one or more ICT services, which are offered by the sectoral ICT  service provider(s) to end-users.  ‒ A potentially large number of stakeholders, in several well-defined roles with dedicated  responsibilities and functions, cooperate in the implementation and operation of these  sectoral ICT services. Typically, it is the responsibility of these stakeholders to operate their  own ICT processes and ICT products, which could be seen as ICT subsystems of the  sectoral ICT system.  ‒ Frequently several sectoral stakeholders participate in the same role (e.g. mobile network  operators or health insurance companies). These stakeholders may be in competition.  4.3.2 Typical system architecture of sectoral ICT systems  As described in Subsection 4.1, sectoral ICT systems typically use ICT infrastructures and  generic ICT products for defined functions that are required for the implementation and  operation of sectoral ICT services. Figure 2 shows the relation between the sectoral ICT system  and these underlying layers of the overall system architecture.  Usually, the system architecture of a sectoral ICT system consists of numerous ICT  subsystems, which are owned, operated and maintained by individual sectoral stakeholder  organizations. These ICT subsystems are interconnected as specified by the architecture of the  sectoral ICT system and act as required in support of the sectoral portfolio of ICT services.  4.3.3 Coordination of sectoral activities  The implementation and operation of sectoral ICT systems needs a common understanding  between all stakeholders concerning the supported portfolio of ICT services. This understanding  must comprise a common set of objectives and rules, common specifications and processes  that govern the interactions between the various stakeholders and their ICT systems, as well as  a common view on risks and the appropriate levels of security and assurance. This requires a  dedicated organization or structure that provides such guidance to and the coordination of all  parties involved in the sectoral ICT system.  A typical objective of sectoral ICT systems is to support ICT services on a national scale or even  throughout the EU internal market. This would probably require cooperation between numerous  sectoral stakeholders from the targeted areas and demand coordination of their technical and  operational activities. However, such coordination is also likely to support societal goals such as  non-discriminatory access for all interested stakeholder organizations, vendors and users,  fostering competing offers and avoiding misuse of market power, as well as meeting the needs  for privacy and data protection.  In practice, such coordination functions could be established by a combination of governmental  rules, which set the boundary conditions for protecting societal goals and by implementing a  sectoral organization, which conducts the day-to-day coordination work within these boundaries.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  28  There are examples of governmental institutions or organizations that have been established by  sectoral stakeholders to coordinate and guide the activities of ICT services in sectors such as  health, ID and mobility. Similar coordinating entities also exist in ICT infrastructures such as  mobile networks or payment schemes.  Figure 3 visualizes the relations between the coordinating entity, the sectoral stakeholder  organizations, the end-users and the ICT infrastructure service and ICT product suppliers.  Figure 3: High-level roles in sectoral ICT systems  Typical responsibilities and activities of the individual roles in a sectoral ICT system are given  below:  1. The coordinating entity defines rules for the participation of stakeholder organizations in the  sectoral ICT system. Such rules may require, for example, functional and security  certification of the ICT subsystems or ICT products as a precondition for participating in or  operating the ICT system.  2. The coordinating entity specifies the sectoral ICT services to be provided and which ICT  infrastructure services, ICT products and ICT processes are to be commonly used, as well  as specifying details of their functions, security and assurance levels. The sectoral  stakeholders must comply with these specifications for their own ICT operations and will  reference these sectoral specifications when ordering ICT infrastructure services or when  purchasing ICT products.  3. Typically, sectoral systems are organized in such a way that end-users of sectoral ICT  services have a contractual relationship (service level agreement) with the ‘ICT service  provider’ or the ‘ICT service retailer’. These end-users may be equipped with ICT products  such as smartcards by their sectoral contract partner or they may be entitled to use a  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  29  sectoral application on their smartphone. Such ‘3rd party ICT product’-scenarios must also  be addressed by the functional and security specifications of the sector.  Interestingly, it is quite common for ICT infrastructures to both support sectoral organizations as  business users and to offer ICT services to end-users. A typical case would be a mobile  network, which could be seen as providing both ICT infrastructure services and end-user  services.  4.4 CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION OF SECTORAL ICT SYSTEMS  4.4.1 Considerations from the architectural point of view  From the perspective of cybersecurity evaluation and certification it is important to note that the  sectoral ICT system as well as the stakeholder’s ICT subsystems can be quite complex. In  addition, the implementation of the required functions can vary significantly from stakeholder  organization to stakeholder organization. This applies in particular if sectoral ICT systems arise  from a newly established cooperation between stakeholder organizations, with the resulting  integration of the stakeholder organization’s incumbent ICT subsystems. Such complexity and  diversity usually prohibit the definition of a clear-cut protection profile as used for ICT products  and required for product certification.  Instead, the implementation and certification of ICT security at both the sectoral layer and the  stakeholder organization’s ICT subsystems is usually based on the standards of information  security management systems such as ISO/IEC 27001 and related certifications. These provide  a proven and practical approach to system security and are well established in many sectors.  However, they do not support the concept of defined assurance levels as provided by  ISO/IEC 15408 for ICT products. A consistent implementation of security and assurance  requirements across all ICT subsystems of sectoral stakeholder organization’s which use an  ISMS would be hard to support, based on the current status of the standard. This limitation must  be considered when defining the security architecture and the certification concept of a sectoral  ICT system.  In a typical sectoral ICT system, the ISMS-based approach to ICT security and certification  covers processes at the level of the sectoral ICT subsystems, which use the bulk of ICT  products and ICT processes within a sectoral ICT system. ICT product certification is mainly  used for ICT products, which support critical functions of the sectoral ICT system and require a  defined level of security and assurance.  Consequently, cybersecurity evaluation and certification in sectoral ICT systems and their  supported ICT services is typically a combination of ICT product, ICT process and ISMS  certification.  4.4.2 Enabling the recognition and reuse of certificates  The recognition and reuse of certificates that have been granted by horizontal cybersecurity  certification schemes to ICT infrastructure services, ICT products or ICT processes is a  prerequisite for the practicability and economic viability of sectoral cyber security certification  schemes and should be a central goal in their definition. This should include certificates from  cybersecurity certification schemes under the EU cybersecurity framework and potentially also  from other schemes that are relevant in the particular market sector.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  30  The following prerequisites must be in in place to enable the necessary synergies with  horizontal cybersecurity certification schemes:  1. Compliance with sectoral requirements  The certified ICT infrastructure service, ICT product or ICT process must conform to the  functional, security and assurance requirements as stipulated by the sectoral ICT system.  Section 4.2 documents how these requirements should be defined based on a risk  assessment that takes the perspective of the targeted sectoral ICT services as its starting  point.  The sectoral cybersecurity certification scheme should support processes that  communicate these requirements, including all relevant information on the ‘intended use’,  to the relevant suppliers and their certification schemes. There should also be a means to  allow the identification of suitable certified ICT infrastructure services, ICT products or ICT  processes, which are already available in the market. Also required is a process that  evaluates other certification schemes for their compliance with the sectoral requirements  for cybersecurity certification.  2. Consistent definition of risk, security and assurance  The reuse of certified ICT infrastructure services, ICT products or ICT processes requires  that the definitions of security requirements and security levels as well as the definitions for  assurance requirements and assurance levels are consistent and comparable across all  relevant cybersecurity certification schemes, and that the methods used for evaluation are  accepted by the sectoral scheme as appropriate for the defined levels. In addition, there  needs to be a common understanding of the underlying risk. The definitions of generic risk  classes should support a consistent and comparable approach to risk levels and risk  acceptance criteria.  3. Common terminology  The recognition and reuse of certificates requires that the sectoral ICT cybersecurity  certification scheme and the schemes that are referenced use the same terminology and  definitions, or that a commonly accepted means is available to translate those terms or  definitions that are different.  4.4.3 Setup of sectoral cybersecurity certification schemes  The partitioning of a sectoral ICT system with regard to cybersecurity certification is to a large  extent defined by internal roles and responsibilities within the sectoral ICT system. The  stakeholder organizations are responsible for conducting cybersecurity certification for their own  ICT subsystems.  They have to ensure that ICT infrastructure services, ICT products and ICT  processes they purchase from their suppliers comply with sectoral certification requirements. By  this means, the totality of certificates provided by sectoral stakeholder organizations will address  cybersecurity certification for the largest part, by far, of a sectoral ICT system.  The definition of a sectoral cybersecurity certification scheme should try, as far as possible, to  optimize practicality and economic efficiency by supporting the re-use of the ISMS-certifications  that are the responsibility of the different sectoral stakeholder organizations, as well as the  horizontal certifications for ICT infrastructure services, ICT processes and ICT products. By this  means, the certification of a sectoral system would, to a large extent, build on all the certificates  of underlying ICT subsystems, ICT services, ICT products and ICT processes. In an ideal case,  only the evaluation and certification of those ICT processes and ICT products which are the  responsibility of the sector’s coordinating entity would need to be evaluated by the sectoral ICT  scheme.

CONSISTENT DEFINITION OF  RISK, SECURITY AND  ASSURANCE  5.1 REQUIREMENTS AND OBJECTIVES  The CSA stipulates objectives, requirements and definitions as the basis of the definitions of  risk, security and assurance and the relations between these. Figure 4 illustrates the  relationships between these elements, as documented in the CSA:  Figure 4: CSA-defined elements and their relations  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  32  The key requirements for cybersecurity certification schemes, drafted under the CSA, can be  summarized as follows:  1. As known from ISO/IEC 15408, security and assurance are seen as distinct, independent  objectives. However, the CSA introduces an association between assurance levels and  security requirements as well as selected security functions.  2. Assurance levels should be implemented consistently across schemes.  3. The definitions of security and assurance requirements as well as assurance levels should  be based on the risk associated with the intended use, in terms of probability and impact,  of the respective ICT product, ICT process or ICT service.  4. The definition of methods and specifications shall as far as possible follow European and  international standards.  Furthermore, the following conclusions can be deduced:  1. The definition of requirements for the security and assurance of ICT products, ICT  processes or ICT services, based on risk, requires a preparatory step that documents the  intended use of the ICT product, ICT process or ICT service and identifies the risk related  to that use.  2. Risks related to the intended use of ICT products, ICT processes and infrastructural ICT  services can only be determined in the context of the sector in which they are to be used.  Consequently, relevant results of the risk assessment must be made available to suppliers  and schemes that are responsible for the development and certification of these ICT  products, ICT processes and infrastructural ICT services.  5.2 CONCEPTUAL APPROACH FOR THE CONSISTENT DEFINITION OF  RISK, SECURITY AND ASSURANCE  5.2.1 Introduction and principles  The SCSA Methodology, which is documented in the following sections, is in compliance with  the requirements mentioned in the previous sections and supports a practical and sound  approach for the identification of risk and the definition of security and assurance to be used in  the drafting of sectoral or infrastructural candidate cybersecurity certification schemes.  A. Integration into the workflow for drafting sectoral schemes  This sectoral assessment methodology should be integrated into the workflow for sectoral  schemes as a preparatory activity in drafting the candidate scheme. This puts in place the  following boundary conditions and requirements for a consistent methodology for risk,  security and assurance:  1. The methodology must be applied in the preparatory phases of drafting sectoral  candidate schemes for the EU cybersecurity certification framework.  2. The methodology should be able to take advantage of risk assessment methods  already in use by sectors or infrastructures. Consequently, the methodology does not  define a specific risk assessment approach; assuming that existing risk assessment  methods will conform to the ISO/IEC 270xx series of ISMS-standards. Definitions  used by the targeted methodology regards the series of ISO/IEC 270xx standards as  normative references and focuses on enhancements whenever necessary. Deviations  from these standards are not permitted.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  33  3. Cyberthreat Intelligence (CTI) shall contribute to the identification of risk and to the  estimation of the capabilities of potential types of adversaries. Existing methods for  CTI and available information sources such as ENISA’s threat landscape shall be re-  used.  B. Balancing flexibility and consistency  The CSA acknowledges that the design of cybersecurity certification schemes needs  flexibility to adapt to the requirements of a specific sector or class of ICT products, ICT  processes or ICT services. However, the need for flexibility potentially conflicts with the  objective of implementing assurance levels consistently across schemes, which is a  prerequisite for the recognition and re-use of certificates within cybersecurity certification  schemes under the CSA.  Taking into account the CSA’s requirements concerning relationships between risk,  security and assurance, it can be concluded that the following concept can be adduced in  support of an appropriate balance between flexibility and consistency:  1. Assurance levels, risk and security, and the relations between these, should be firmly  defined. These definitions should be applied to any sectoral or infrastructural  cybersecurity certification schemes under the CSA. This will provide the consistency  required for the definition of ICT products, ICT products and infrastructural ICT  services, which are designed for use in several sectors. It will also allow the re-use  and recognition of certificates.  2. Differing sectoral views concerning risk tolerance or appetite can be accommodated  during risk assessment. The result of allowing this flexibility would mean that sectors  could rate a comparable risk differently, thus leading to different sectoral assurance  and security requirements without affecting the goal of consistency. In addition, there  should be the option to deviate from the relationships described in the previous  paragraph, if the deviation is fully justified and well-documented.  Figure 5 illustrates this concept. It distinguishes between the sectoral risk assessment  methodology used, which allows sectors their own specific view on risk, and the mapping of this  assessed risk to so-called ‘CSA meta-risk classes’ (MRC). These MRCs provide a normalized  definition of risk which should be used in all sectoral or infrastructural schemes. MRCs are the  starting point for a firm definition of relations with assurance levels, security objectives and the  level of controls related to these security objectives.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  34  Figure 5: Conceptual approach for flexibility and consistency  Figure 5 also shows the principles of how the CSA’s requirements for consistency can be  implemented by the methodology defined in this document. The individual steps are marked by  the letters A to D.  A. A detailed definition of the assurance levels related to assurance requirements and  evaluation specifications is a starting point for considerations under this methodology.  B. This step introduces a level structure for MRCs that corresponds with the defined  assurance levels. This means that there is a defined relationship between a level of  assurance and an MRC.  C. The CSA requests that specific controls should be related to particular assurance levels.  Since MRCs are matched with assurance levels, this can be supported in a generic way  by introducing a level structure for controls that matches the level structure for MRC.  D. The level structure for attack potential, which is used by the evaluator as part of his  vulnerability analysis, should also be implemented in the CTI-based determination of  attack potential.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  35  5.2.2 Integration with the preparation of a cybersecurity certification  scheme  The SCSA methodology can be integrated as a preparatory step into the workflow for drafting a  cybersecurity certification scheme governed by the CSA as shown in Figure 6.  Figure 6: Application of the methodology in the context of drafting a sectoral cybersecurity  scheme  The application of the methodology for the sectoral cybersecurity assessment should be  conducted in workshops with the ad hoc working group.  All relevant sectoral stakeholder roles should be represented in the ad hoc working group.  In order to ensure transparency and continuity, all information and results generated by the  sectoral assessment should be documented. Accurate documentation is particularly important  where stakeholders decide to deviate from the default relationships defined by the concept for  consistent implementation of security and assurance.  Special attention should be paid to the documentation of information from the sectoral level.  This is needed by sectoral ISMS-owners and external suppliers of ICT products, ICT processes  and ICT services in order to adapt these to the requirements of the sector.  5.2.3 Establishing the context for the sectoral cybersecurity assessment  As known from information security risk management according to ISO/IEC 27005, the  application of the SCSA Methodology requires documentation of the context in which the  sectoral cybersecurity assessment should be carried out. This includes all information that is of  relevance for the assessment of risks and the definition of security and assurance requirements:  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  36  1. Description of the scope of the sectoral cybersecurity assessment,  2. Documentation of the sectoral stakeholder’s roles and responsibilities and the business  processes relevant for the defined scope,  3. Documentation of the sectoral stakeholder’s objectives and requirements with regard to  the documented business processes,  4. Description of the architecture of sectoral ICT subsystems or operational processes  supporting the documented business processes,  5. Identification and documentation of primary information or functional assets supporting  the business processes,  6. Identification of ICT subsystems, products, processes and services (supporting assets)  supporting the primary information or functional assets,  7. Documentation of threat landscape and CTI information for the selected scope, in  particular relevant attacker types, their potential objectives, motivation and attack  potential level.  The detailed workflow for conducting context establishment is documented in Section 6.2.  5.2.4 Incorporating Cyberthreat Intelligence Information  As discussed in detail in Chapter 9, cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) provides further insights into  the threat landscape, as well as a characterization of potential attackers that constitutes a  crucial component of the SCSA Methodology.  Attackers can be characterized by the means, motives and the opportunities they have for  launching an attack – as described in Chapter 9 and illustrated in figure 7. The portfolio of  potential attackers, as well as their characteristics, have a major influence on the level of risk  and the required levels of security and assurance of any ICT system as the following two  examples may illustrate:  1. Even if the level of security of a control is high, it will be ineffective if it is lower than the  level of attack capability that an adversary can bring to bear. This means that cyber risk  and the choice of security controls directly depend on the potential that an attacker has to  impact the ICT system while it is in use.  2. A sophisticated adversary with ambition to target a critical infrastructure sector, such as  energy, will have not only the means to execute such an attack - for example being funded  and staffed by a nation state – but is also likely to be able to develop sufficient  opportunities to execute an attack with significant success.  Therefore, the assessment of risks, the security of a sectoral ICT system and its ICT products,  ICT processes and ICT services and the need for assurance should be evaluated in the context  of any adversary seeking to attack it.  In the methodology described in this document, different components of attack potential are  considered and used as input at different stages of the assessment:  1. The motive of potential attackers and an estimate of their attack potential level form part of  the determination of sectoral risks.  2. Attack potential and the means of the attackers as well as their opportunity to conduct  attacks are used as input to determine the appropriate security and assurance levels for  sectoral ICT systems, ICT processes and ICT products.  3. The potential of an attacker’s means and opportunities guide the selection of suitable  controls able to withstand an attack.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  37  4. Attack potential3 as defined by CTI should be seen in relation to its use as defined by  ISO/IEC 18045 for ICT product evaluation. This would allow a confirmation of the targeted  level of resistance against the CTI-defined attack potential by an evaluation.  These components and the relationship between attack potential and risk, security and  assurance level are described in further detail in sections 5.3 through 5.6. Subsection 9.6  describes two new methods which support the estimation of the attack potential level.  5.2.5 Method for linking cybersecurity risks with security and assurance  requirements  A major objective of the SCSA Methodology is to link the risk associated with the intended use  of ICT systems, products, processes and services with the requirements for the certification, the  security and the assurance of these components. This requires a dedicated method which is  described in this subsection.  The assessment of cybersecurity risks is based on the relevant business processes and the  sectoral stakeholders’ related objectives that could be impacted by ICT security incidents.  These considerations focus on business, governmental or societal views on the sectoral system  and should reflect the sectoral role model and work split between stakeholders as described in  Chapter 4.  In contrast, the definition of requirements for certification, security and assurance requires a  technical and system architecture perspective. These requirements target sectoral ICT  subsystems, products, processes and services that support the implementation of the relevant  business processes at the sectoral system level, called ‘supporting assets’.  The SCSA Methodology connects these two perspectives by introducing ‘primary information  assets’ and ‘primary functional assets’ in the following way:  In line with the definition given in ISO/IEC 27005, these types of primary assets stand for  information or functions which are of special relevance for the sectoral stakeholder’s objectives.  For both types of primary assets it is possible to document, on the one hand, the potential  impact of a successful attack on the sectoral stakeholders’ objectives and, on the other hand, to  determine which ‘supporting assets’ of the sectoral architecture support and protect the  particular information or function.  Information assets are essentially data (such as cryptographic keys, certificates, applets,  personal data of customers or product configuration parameters) whereas functional assets are  those that are directly deployed in the system as hardware or software in support of a primary  activity (for example ‘user authentication’ or ‘secure boot function’).  Supporting assets are those that are deployed, as the name implies, to support the primary  assets. They constitute the critical elements of the systems which enable the primary assets to  support the business process efficiently and effectively. It is important to note that there is not  necessarily a one-to-one relationship between supporting assets and primary assets; one  supporting asset may be important to more than one primary asset. The relations between  assets used by this method are presented in Figure 7.  3 The meanings of the term in both areas are explained in section 2.3.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  38  Figure 7: Relationships of assets and information security attributes  5.2.6 Introduction of risk scenarios  Subsection 5.2.5 describes the method for linking the business-related assessment of risks with  the technical considerations on security and assurance requirements to single supporting  assets. Subsection 5.2.4 documents that information on attackers, their motives and capacity  has a major influence on the assessment of risks and the definition of the security and  assurance requirements to ICT components or processes that serve as supporting assets.  In order to ensure consistency of considerations of risk, attack potential, security and assurance  and to support reversibility when changing between the different perspectives described in  Subsection 5.2.5, the parameters that are relevant for these considerations and their  relationship have to be well defined.  Attackers follow their own objectives concerning the sectoral system which determine their  attacks and their motivation for conducting attacks. Since these objectives could diverge  significantly from the objectives of the sectoral stakeholders, it is not practical to deduce the  impact on stakeholders’ objectives or the probability that this impact will occur from the  attacker’s motivation and potential with regard to his own objectives. A solution has to be found  for linking attacker information to considerations of the stakeholders’ risks.  Assuming that it is very likely that an attack implementing the attacker’s objectives would affect  primary functional or primary information assets defined from the stakeholder’s perspective, the  SCSA Methodology selects also, in this case, the two types of primary assets described in  Subsection 5.2.5 as linking elements. Based on an assumed attack scenario that involves a  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  39  primary asset, the impact on a stakeholder’s objectives and the probability of such an incident  occurring could be estimated.  The introduction of risk scenarios by the SCSA methodology implements this approach.  A risk scenario describes a potential event or incident that could have a negative impact on one  or more business objectives. This description includes the documentation of the relevant  parameters from the following domains:  Business perspective: Targeted business process, involved stakeholders and their  objectives and requirements concerning the targeted business  process.  Architecture perspective: Primary asset (information and functional) in relation to the  targeted business process, supporting assets for the primary  asset.  Attacker perspective: Attacker types that may be capable and motivated to conduct  attacks on the primary asset. All relevant information is  summarized in attack scenarios which should be associated  with the primary asset.  The identification of risk scenarios should be conducted in relation to a business process and a  primary asset that is of relevance for the objectives of this business process. After this, an  attack scenario which could potentially lead to an incident via an attack on the primary asset  would be added.  Risk scenarios are assigned with a meta-risk class (MRC) based on impact and probability. A  detailed description is given in Section 5.3.  5.2.7 Layered approach to sectoral cybersecurity assessment  Subsection 5.2.5 and Subsection 5.2.6 describe the method applied for linking the business, the  architectural and the attacker perspectives on the sectoral system to enable a risk-based,  consistent definition of security and assurance requirements. For this purpose, primary assets  and risk scenarios have been introduced in Subsections 5.2.5 and 5.2.6 respectively.  Based on these considerations, the SCSA Methodology proposes to conduct the assessment of  the following three layers in sequential steps:  1. Assessment of business layer  Following the pattern set by the normative standard ISO/IEC 27005, the sectoral  assessment will start at the business process layer. The relevant business processes and  the business, governmental or societal objectives of the sectoral stakeholders with regard to  these business processes should be documented. The identification of objectives should be  discussed with the sectoral stakeholders and should be consolidated with regard to the risk  areas given in Annex B.  On this basis, the primary information and primary functional assets as well as the  supporting assets can be identified. This step is considered part of the ‘sectoral context  establishment’ described in Subsection 5.2.5.  2. Assessment of primary asset layer  In the second step, the potential impact on the stakeholder’s objectives of successful attacks  on primary assets and the probability that this impact may occur are estimated and  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  40  documented. Information from CTI on threats and attack potential is used to consolidate the  stakeholders’ estimate of an impact and the probability of a particular incident as described  in Section 5.3. In addition, risk information provided by sectoral stakeholders or generated  by any ISO/IEC 27005-conformant risk management tool can be included. All this is  packaged by risk scenarios as described in Subsection 5.2.6. On this basis Meta-risk  classes (MRC) can be assigned to the identified risk scenarios as described in Section 5.3.  This MRC is inherited by all supporting assets associated with the risk scenario.  3. Assessment of supporting assets  The third layer of the assessment targets the definition of the security and assurance  requirements to ICT subsystems, products, services and processes that serve primary  information and functional assets as supporting assets. The risk information, in particular the  MRC, which applies to a particular supporting asset is inherited from the assessment of the  primary information or functional asset which is supported by the supporting asset to be  assessed. For the definition of the security and assurance requirements for the supporting  asset, the MRC and the capacity of the relevant attacker types to conduct attacks, the attack  potential level (APL) and also the intended use and the operational environment will be  taken into account. The definition of APL and the method for determining the APL are  described in Section 5.4. The methods for defining the required security and assurance  levels in a risk-related and consistent way are described in Section 5.5 and Section 5.6.  Figure 8 visualizes the relationship between the business layer, the primary asset and the  supporting assets for a mobile network as an example.  Figure 8: Example of the relationship between business, primary asset and  supporting asset layer  The detailed workflows for conducting the context establishment and the assessment using the  layered approach are documented in Chapter 6.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  41  5.3 CSA META-RISK CLASSES – A COMMON APPROACH TO THE  SCALING OF RISK  5.3.1 Introduction to sectoral risk assessment  Risk assessment is a prerequisite for the establishment of security and trust in ICT systems.  Risk assessment enables risks to be understood and therefore correctly mitigated through the  use of risk controls. Most modern information security and risk management standards therefore  call for a risk-based approach to the selection of appropriate security controls.  The typical approach followed in an organizational information security management system  (ISMS) is that the level of risk is assessed as a function of the impact (or consequences) of an  event and the likelihood (probability) of it occurring. Although this approach enables the loss or  damage as a result of an incident or event to be estimated, it is increasingly inaccurate where  events have either (or both) a very low probability and the potential to cause a very high degree  of impact.  Figure 9: Example of qualitative risk mapping in an ISMS based on ISO/IEC 31010  An example of using a qualitative method for risk assessment is illustrated in Figure 9. The  criteria chosen by the organization are applied to all qualitative levels of likelihood and impact  and the formula for risk estimation is given to achieve qualitative levels of risk expressed by  appropriate names and colours.  To provide a consistent approach to certification and to ensure that certificates are comparable  and consistent throughout a whole sector, it is necessary to base the considerations on  comparable risk levels appropriate for that sector.  Sectoral risk assessments must be carried out at a high level for instance by the coordinating  entity for the sector or by the developer of a sectoral cybersecurity certification scheme. Both  would need to involve the relevant stakeholder roles from within the sector and its constituent  organizations:  ‒ The stakeholders and coordinating entity that are engaged in providing the sectoral  services (‘business risk owners’).  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  42  ‒ Consumers of sectoral services.  ‒ Society generally, both at the European and international levels.  ‒ Governmental risk owners.  According to the approach defined in Subsection 5.2.7, the sectoral risk assessment is carried  out in the primary asset layer assessment. As described in the following subsections, CTI and  attacker information will be used to improve the reliability of the estimations of impacts and their  probability4 compared to the classical approach described above.  Further, the SCSA Methodology implements the risk scenario approach (see Subsection 5.2.6)  to support consistency and the reversibility of considerations on risk, attack potential, security  and assurance that bridge all three levels of the sectoral assessment.  5.3.2 Attacker information as criteria for risk assessment  Section 5.2 describes the use of CTI and attacker information for sectoral assessment at a high  level. This subsection explains how to apply attacker information to assess the risks and how to  assign meta-risk classes when assessing the primary asset layer.  For the assessment of risks and the estimation of the MRC, the portfolio of possible adversaries  and their attack potential should be considered, concentrating on their motives. If a  sophisticated adversary, such as a nation-state actor, cyber terrorist or foreign military force has  its own objectives and, based on these, a strong motivation to target a particular sectoral  system, we have to assume that the adversary will be likely to develop the means to execute  and succeed in such an attack. Such a scenario must be discussed with the sectoral  stakeholders so that it can be reflected in the description of the risk and the assignment of the  MRC. A similar reasoning follows if the ICT system is subject to highly skilled adversaries, such  as cybercriminal groups, who may not have direct governmental support or military capabilities,  but still have sufficient funding and skills to develop significant offensive capabilities.  Consequently, an assessment of potential attacker types must be conducted as part of the  context establishment. The result should be a list of potential types of adversaries5, their  potential objectives and resulting motivation and a high-level estimate of their means. Based on  these objectives, attack scenarios that could affect the primary information and functional assets  should be analysed and rated with regard to the motivation and means of the respective  attacker types. This information should be considered by the sectoral stakeholders as input to  the identification and assessment of the risk and the related MRC classification.  During the context establishment and the primary asset layer assessment, only general  considerations of a potential attacker's means and opportunity can be taken into account as the  supporting assets, which would be the targets of attacks, and their environment are not yet fully  identified. Any estimation of the attack potential level is preliminary and must be renewed during  the assessment of supporting assets in the context of the specific supporting asset.  However, for the assessment of risks in the primary asset layer, these limitations of the  estimated attack potential are acceptable since the focus is on the estimation of the probability  of an incident that may affect the stakeholders’ objective. This largely depends on the objectives  and motivations of the attacker types which can be estimated for each risk scenario based on its  associated attack scenario. With regards to attacker potential, it suffices to have a high-level  indication as to whether the attacker types referenced in the attack scenario would be capable  of implementing the attack.  4 For consistency with the CSA, the term Probability is used by this methodology as equivalent to the term Likelihood.  5 A generic list of attacker types is given in Chapter 9.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  43  Details about the different focus of the use of CTI information for the assessment of risks in the  primary asset layer and for the identification of security and assurance requirements for  supporting assets at the assessment layer for these assets are described in Section 9.5 and in  Section 9.6.  The workflows for establishing the context with regard to CTI and attacker types, the estimation  of impact and probability, and the definition of meta-risk classes are documented in Chapter 6.  5.3.3 Sectoral risk assessment – guidance for impact estimation  A principle of our methodology is that sectoral stakeholders will identify risk scenarios that can  cause damage to the objectives of one or more stakeholders. The identification of these  scenarios will be based on the means and motivation of attackers as well as on the  opportunities they have to have an impact on the functional (primary or supporting) assets.  From the identification of the risk scenarios, it should be possible for the stakeholders to  estimate their impact on the business and the probability that the scenario will occur. Both  impact and probability strongly depend on the characteristics of the sectoral business,  concretely, the level of the impact depends on the business objectives affected and the  perspective of the particular stakeholder.  It is worth remarking that a risk scenario may concern several stakeholder’s objectives and, at  the same time, different stakeholders in the sector may take a different view of the related  impact. Therefore, in this methodology we introduce two concepts for harmonizing the decisions  concerning the impact that could be caused by the implementation of a given risk scenario.  On the one side, in order to ensure comparability of impact estimation across sectors, generic  levels of impact are defined for use in sectoral risk assessments. These levels, called impact  classes (IC), qualitatively measure the damage a risk scenario can cause to the business of the  stakeholders. The impact classes defined are shown in Table 1 below.  Table 1: Definition of 5 impact classes of incidents (IC1-IC5)  IC1 IC2 IC3 IC4 IC5  Negligible impact Minor impact Moderate impact Major impact Catastrophic  impact  Obviously, the stakeholder may map qualitative dimension into quantitative. For example, a  major impact could mean the loss of 10% of revenues due to breach of contract or a drop of  15% in clients due to loss of confidence. Even in this example, we may observe that the impact  may be considered in many areas of the stakeholder’s business. Since stakeholders, depending  on their objectives, could have different perceptions of the impact that could potentially be  caused by a risk scenario and might select a different IC, a moderation with the goal of defining  a common IC should be conducted. This discussion should also consider relevant attackers and  their potential that may influence the classification of impact as described in Subsection 5.3.2.  The stakeholder’s initial selections of IC should be documented.  Applying the concept of risk areas is the second concept that we define in the SCSA  Methodology for harmonizing impact analysis. As described in Subsection 5.2.7, a generic  description of risk areas given in Annex B should support the stakeholders in taking into  consideration all relevant areas when defining their objectives and requirements in relation to a  particular business process. To support consistency for the definition of IC, this description of  generic risk areas in Annex B includes a definition of a minimum IC. The selection of the IC for a  risk scenario which is associated with objectives that have been selected in the context of a risk  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  44  area must not fall below the minimum IC given for this risk area. A risk scenario may potentially  impact different risk areas, with a different level of impact. In our methodology, each scenario  will be attached to the highest impact class (IC) that the scenario may cause.  5.3.4 Sectoral risk assessment – probability estimation  In addition to the definition of impact classes, the sectoral stakeholders involved in a risk  scenario must estimate the probability that an incident as described in an identified risk scenario  will occur. The estimation of the probability may come from different sources:  ‒ The experience of the stakeholders and/or the organization that provides coordination of all  parties involved in the sectoral ICT system.  ‒ The analysis of the potential attackers, their motivations, means and opportunities. Such  information should be provided by CTI as described in Subsection 5.3.2 and is referenced  by the risk scenario.  ‒ If the risk scenario is not specific to the sector, then the probability may be estimated based  on information of similar attacks in other ICT systems, in particular those with a similar  supply chain.  The abovementioned information is measured or estimated in a different way. In general the  experience of the stakeholders with previous risk events may provide a measurable probability  (e.g. the number of a certain type of attack suffered during a year), especially in the case of ICT  systems already running for a long time. Other information is more qualitative as, for example,  the information provided about the motivation and capabilities of an organization to attack the  sector ICT system. The disparity of information brings the necessity of introducing qualitative  levels for measuring the probability that a risk event will occur. A classification into five levels, as  presented in Table 2, is considered in the SCSA methodology.  Table 2: Definition of 5 levels of probability of incidents (P1-P5)  P1 P2 P3 P4 P5  Incidents are  highly unlikely to  occur  Incidents are  unlikely to occur  Incidents are  somewhat likely to  occur  Incidents are  highly likely to  occur  Incidents are  almost certain to  occur  Each sector shall determine its own definitions of probability assigned to risk scenarios for each  of the five levels, bearing in mind the following factors:  ‒ Risk assessments are prone to errors in estimation where probability is at a low level. This  introduces the potential for misclassification of risks, which may result in an inappropriate  risk treatment. Given the importance of sectoral systems, it is important to ensure, as far  as possible, that errors of this kind are minimized.  ‒ Sectoral risks, given their scope, are such that even low impact events will tend to cause  significant disturbances to the stakeholders within a sector, the sector’s customers and  governmental risk owners or even to society as a whole. Furthermore, even if a single  event causes insignificant damage, it will not be acceptable if such events happen  frequently. These factors must be taken into account in both sectoral risk assessment and  treatment, ensuring that such risks are assessed at an appropriately high level and are not  left untreated.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  45  5.3.5 Assessing sectoral meta-risk classes  The level of meta-risk class for a sectoral ICT product, ICT service or ICT process is assessed  as a function of the estimated consequences (harmful impact) and the perceived likelihood of  those consequences happening (probability). In practice, the two parameters we must consider  when making this assessment are those outlined in the three previous sections (5.3.2, 5.3.3 and  5.3.4):  ‒ Estimated consequences – or Impact Class (see IC1-IC5 in Table 1)  ‒ Probability of the incidents occurring (see P1-P5 in Table 2).  The two parameters in Table 1 and Table 2 are combined to enable the meta-risk class to be  deduced. By consulting the matrix, estimates of probability and impact class can be used by a  sector to deduce a meta-risk class from 1 to 5 (as shown in the cells in Table 3). In assessing a  meta-risk class the highest assessed impact class (IC) is the one that must be used.  For the definition of such material a number of general design considerations must be taken into  account as described above:  ‒ Incidents of a catastrophic nature shall be assigned a high MRC (5) even where these  have a very low level of probability (P1).  ‒ Incidents at IC1 level can have serious consequences if they occur at a high frequency  and must therefore be assigned a MRC5.  These factors must be taken into account in assigning the MRC in order to ensure that such  risks are assessed at an appropriately high level and are not left untreated. In Table 3,  therefore, it will be noted that there are 9 instances of MRC5, 8 of MRC4, 5 of MRC3, 2 of  MRC2 and only 1 instance of MRC1. A description of the risk assessment process used by a  sector to assess MRC is outlined in Chapter 6.  Table 3: Matrix showing meta-risk classes 1-5 for given estimates of probability and impact  class  Probability Levels  Impact Class  P1  P2  P3  P4  P5  IC5  MRC5 MRC5 MRC5 MRC5 MRC5  IC4  MRC4 MRC4 MRC4 MRC4 MRC5  IC3  MRC3 MRC3 MRC4 MRC4 MRC5  IC2  MRC2 MRC3 MRC3 MRC4 MRC5  IC1  MRC1 MRC2 MRC3 MRC4 MRC5  5.4 USING ATTACK POTENTIAL FOR THE SELECTION OF SECURITY  AND ASSURANCE LEVEL  Typically, the opportunity and means of an attacker type are to a certain degree dependent on  the type and intended use of the ICT product, ICT process or ICT service that serves as a  supporting asset. Therefore, it is important to review the attack potential that was estimated in  the first step of the assessment when conducting the second step at the level of supporting  assets, i.e. ICT products, ICT processes, ICT services and supporting ISMS of sectoral  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  46  stakeholders. Depending on the type of the supporting asset, this could result in different attack  potentials for the same adversary. In addition, the detailed estimation of the parameters,  opportunity and means requires an assessment for each supporting asset and its intended use.  Chapter 6 describes how this is implemented in the workflow for the assessment of supporting  assets.  As discussed in Chapter 9 and shown in Figure 10, ‘attack potential (AP)’ consists of motive,  means and opportunity. A high-level estimation of attack potential and motivation is considered  by sectoral stakeholders to identify risk and define the related MRC. The two remaining  components of ‘attack potential (AP)’, namely opportunity and means, will be used for the  definition of the implementation of security and assurance as described in Sections 5.5 and 5.6.  Attack potential not only influences the level of risk, but also the required level of security and  assurance needed by the ICT system. If the sectoral system is likely to be subject to a  sophisticated adversary, such as a nation-state actor with significant capabilities such as the  ability to understand the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the ICT system, this must be  reflected in the way security controls and evaluation are designed and selected.  CTI must therefore provide information that supports the selection and adjustment of security  controls, based on the sector’s control objectives. Using CTI information, sectoral risk owners  will have the information to deploy only those controls with security levels, as described in  Section 5.5 that can withstand the attack potential. For instance, if the attacker is assumed to be  capable of extracting credentials stored on smartcards by deploying attacks at the hardware  level, the ICT products used by the sector must be hardened and certified to withstand such  attacks.  It is therefore proposed that, in estimating meta-risk levels for a sector, attack potential should  be taken into account using the five levels (AP1-AP5) defined in the examples shown in Table 4  below. Please note that, in this table, ‘motivation’ is assumed at all levels of attack potential.  Table 4: Example definitions for the five levels of attack potential (AP1-AP5)  AP 1 AP2 AP3 AP4 AP5  Adversary  Characteristics  Unskilled  adversary  Skilled  adversary with  limited  resources and  opportunity  Skilled  adversary with  significant  resources and  opportunity  Highly skilled  adversary with  significant  resources and  opportunity  Highly  sophisticated  adversary with  significant  resources and  opportunity  Equivalent  ISO/IEC 18045  attack  potential  Basic Enhanced-Basic Moderate High Beyond High  Related  AVA_VAN  assurance  component  AVA_VAN.1/2 AVA_VAN.3 AVA_VAN.4 AVA_VAN.5 None available  The table furthermore lists, from a CTI perspective, for each attack potential the equivalent  attack potentials in ISO/IEC 18045 and the related AVA_VAN assurance component. If a  sectorial ICT system is, for example, subject to an adversary with attack potential AP3,  evaluation at level AVA_VAN.4 would be necessary as a sufficient deterrent against this threat.  As the table indicates, the highest attack potential of ‘beyond high’ has at the moment no  corresponding product evaluation level.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  47  ‘Beyond high’ in ISO/IEC 18045 is typically applicable if the adversary has expert-level  expertise, bespoke equipment, significant knowledge of the Target of Evaluation (TOE) and  significant time available. All of these are features of a sophisticated adversary such as a  nation-state actor or a sophisticated cybercriminal group. These actors may be considered as  possible adversaries of a sectoral ICT system, meaning that controls evaluated above  AVA_VAN.5 would be required. The current lack of a product evaluation level to fill this need for  the protection of critical sectorial ICT systems should be noted.  Given the lack of such a certification level and the absence of appropriate products, it should be  noted that a system may also be secured through architectural means, such as the combined  deployment of multiple controls rated at AVA_VAN.5. This approach is, in communication  systems for example, referred to as ‘defence in depth’. However, even the combination of  multiple controls at a lower level may not be sufficient to prevent an adversary from succeeding  in a compromise. It may merely result in the attack being slowed down sufficiently to enable  detection and response.  Figure 10: Characteristics of attackers in CTI and ISO/IEC 18045  As shown in Figure 10, the information provided by CTI on opportunity and means has a direct  analogy to the parameter of attack potential as specified in ISO/IEC 18045 for product  evaluation. After a product is evaluated, aspects of the evaluation such as the window of  opportunity, the elapsed time the evaluator had to spend with the product, or the knowledge and  equipment necessary to compromise the product is considered to determine the attack potential  rating from ‘Basic’ to ‘Beyond High’ (see ISO/IEC 18045, p. 288). Manufacturers would thus  have their products evaluated and certified with respect to a particular attack potential.  It should be noted in the assessment of supporting assets that the same type of information is  used but from a different viewpoint. In this case stakeholders will have obtained, from their  portfolio of potential adversaries, an estimate of attackers’ capability and skills (means), as well  as their opportunity to, for example, potentially gain access to the product or system. In the  selection of suitable controls for the sectoral system, stakeholders must therefore choose those  controls appropriate to the level of attack potential derived from this information.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  48  5.5 RISK-BASED DEFINITION OF COMMON SECURITY LEVELS AND  SELECTION OF CONTROLS  5.5.1 Basic requirements, conceptual approach  Section 5.1 provides an overview on the CSA’s requirements concerning the security of ICT  services, ICT products and ICT processes and its relationships with risk and assurance.  The CSA stipulates that security requirements for ICT services, ICT products and ICT  processes should be determined based on the risk associated with their intended use. It  introduces a structured approach to security, as known from ISO/IEC 27002, by distinguishing  between security requirements / security objectives and secure functions / controls for the  implementation of these requirements / objectives.  The CSA also describes the relationship between the concepts of security and assurance.  According to CSA, Article 2.1, the assurance level shall establish confidence that the security  requirements of a particular scheme for ICT services, ICT products and ICT processes are met,  but it does not measure the security of the ICT service, ICT product or ICT process. In addition,  EU cybersecurity certification schemes are asked to document security objectives for each  assurance level and to provide examples of controls that address these security objectives.  One can conclude that the CSA establishes a direct relationship between the level of risk, which  was identified in relation to the intended use of ICT services, ICT products and ICT processes,  and the level of security required to mitigate this risk. The relationship between security and  assurance is described as more indirect.  Overall, the level of risk can be seen as the leading parameter when determining the level of  security required. In addition, security requirements and controls shall be documented for each  assurance level. This combination of requirements makes security and the introduction of  security levels a subject to be considered for consistency across schemes.  The considerations mentioned above lead to the following conclusions for the design of the  targeted methodology:  1. A structure of Common Security Levels (CSL) that is commensurate with the meta-risk  classes defined in section 5.3 should be established.  2. To avoid inconsistencies and fragmentation between schemes caused by deviations in the  assignment of security controls of particular strength to assurance levels, the CSL should  be commensurate with the definition of common assurance reference (CAR) levels defined  in section 5.6. This can be achieved indirectly since both, CSL and CAR levels, can be  directly linked with respective MRC levels.  The availability of CTI provides the opportunity to consider information on attackers. The  methodology will employ information on the relevant attack potential as input to the estimation of  the required security level.  As the methodology for sectoral risk assessment shall comply with the ISO/IEC 270xx series of  standards, definitions and terminology used in the following subsections on security and CSL, it  will also follow this series of standards, in particular ISO/IEC 27002. If possible, there should be  a common set of control objectives and controls that can be used across sectors and schemes.  The concept for the introduction of CSL and the application of controls by means of CSL is  explained in the following sections.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  49  5.5.2 Definition of Common Security Levels  Subsection 5.5.1 explains that coherence between schemes under the CSA requires a common  approach to security levels and that security levels need to be commensurate with the level of  concepts for risk and, although indirectly, assurance.  Consequently, the concept of Common Security Levels (CSL) is defined with five levels. Starting  from CSL1, each common security level is more stringent than the previous one.  Table 5 provides an overview on the defined structure of CSL and the default relationships  between CSL, meta-risk classes (MRC) and attack potential levels (AP).  The information on risks and the associated MRC supports the definition of control objectives  and the required CSL of the related controls so that these are able to mitigate the risk efficiently  and effectively.  The association with the parameter AP level, which is determined by CTI, allows checking as to  whether the selected CSL has the strength to withstand the assumed attack potential.  In both cases there is a default one-to-one relationship between the same levels of the  parameters MRC and CSL, as well as between AP and CSL. However, sectoral stakeholders  may decide to deviate from this default relationship during the sectoral assessment.  Table 5: Definition of Common Security Levels (CSL) and their default relationships  Common  Security  Level  Description  Default relationships between CSL  and MRC, AP  CSL mitigates  risk of level  CSL protects  against attack  potential  CSL1  CSL 1 provides a basic level of security against  unskilled adversaries.  MRC1 AP1  CSL2  CSL 2 adds requirements to CSL1, providing security  against skilled adversaries with limited resources and  opportunity to attack a system.  MRC2 AP2 or lower  CSL3  CSL 3 extends the coverage of the security against  skilled adversaries with significant resources and/or  significant opportunity to attack a system.  MRC3 AP3 or lower  CSL4  CSL 4 provides security against a highly skilled  adversary with significant resources and opportunity.  MRC4 AP4 or lower  CSL5  CSL 5 provides the highest level of security, capable of  protecting against highly sophisticated adversaries with  significant resources at their disposal and/or  opportunity for an attack.  MRC5 AP5 or lower  The estimation of the attack potential of a particular type of attacker, which also provides the  criteria and examples for the classification of AP used above, is explained in Chapter 9.  The allocation of controls and the strength of their mechanisms to CSL should be discussed and  agreed with the relevant stakeholders in dedicated workshops as part of the development of a  horizontal scheme and maintenance activities under the CSA.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  50  The implementation of an authentication mechanism for use with mobile ICT services could  serve as an example:  CSL1: Implementation of an authentication protocol on a common OS-platform.  CSL3: Implementation of an authentication protocol in a protected execution environment of  the mobile OS.  CSL5: Implementation on a platform, which is equipped with controls against logical and  physical attacks on hardware and the OS.  5.5.3 Application of controls by using the CSL-concept  As stipulated by the CSA and as defined in ISO/IEC 27002, there is a two-step-approach to  implementing controls. In the first step, control objectives targeting the mitigation of the  identified sectoral risks will be defined. For each risk, there can be more than one control  objective.  A control objective is met by implementing a set of controls. For each control objective, more  than one control can be applied.  The common security level (CSL) specifies the strength of a control. Since the objective of a  control is independent of its strength, only controls are categorized according to the CSL  structure.  1. Employing Meta-risk Classes (MRC) and Common Security Levels (CSL) for  sectoral risk treatment  During sectoral risk assessment, any identified risk will be associated with a meta-risk  class. In a second step, the sectoral ad hoc working group will define control objectives to  mitigate the risk. These control objectives inherit the assigned MRC as a parameter.  In order to ensure that MRC and CSL are commensurate, there shall be by default a one-  to-one relationship between MRC and CSL of the same level.  During sectoral  assessment, the sectoral stakeholders may deviate from this default relationship in specific  cases. Such deviations should be justified and documented during sectoral assessment.  The controls that support the control objective will be selected in accordance with the MRC  that is associated with the control objective. Consequently, controls with an adequate CSL  will be selected for risk treatment.  In some cases, there may be no control that supports the required CSL. If so, a control or  combination of controls that supports the next higher CSL should be selected. Controls  can be of a technical, operational or organizational nature.  2. Attack Potential (AP) as criterion for selecting the CSL of controls  It is a fundamental principle that controls should withstand the assumed types of attackers  and their capabilities. As described in Section 5.4, the potential of relevant attackers will be  estimated during sectoral assessment. The motivation of potential attackers contributes to  the classification of risk as described in section 5.3. However, it could occur that despite a  high attack potential, risk assessment could result in the assignment of a lower MRC. This  would lead to a CSL that could not protect against the assumed attack potential. In such  case, the following rule shall apply:  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  51  If the MRC is at a lower level than the estimated AP, the AP level should determine the  CSL, which is used for selecting the strength of the controls employed for the treatment of  risk. The CSL should be selected to provide protection against the assumed AP.  It should also be noted that a meaningful selection of controls could reduce the window of  opportunity that an adversary may use and in this way help to reach the required CSL.  During sectoral assessment, the sectoral stakeholders may deviate from this default  relationship in specific cases. Such deviations should be justified and documented.  3. Concatenating controls to meet the required CSL  Practical risk treatment may require that a certain CSL is reached by a well-defined  combination of controls with lower CSL. For example, low cost, high volume ICT products  such as IoT devices may not allow costly controls. In such cases, ICT product-based  controls with lower CSL could be combined with controls in the system’s back office or  network to jointly match the required CSL level. Additional information on this concept is  provided in Chapter 8.  Figure 11 visualizes the flow of activities for sectoral risk assessment and risk treatment  and the relationships between CSL, MRC and AP.  Figure 11: Relationship between MRC, CSL and AP levels  The following table shows the possible combinations of MRC, AP and the resulting CSL for the  default scenarios.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  52  Table 6: Common Security Levels (CSL) scorecard  AP levels  AP1 AP2 AP3 AP4 AP5  MRC  MRC1 CSL1 CSL2 CSL3 CSL4 CSL5  MRC2 CSL2 CSL2 CSL3 CSL4 CSL5  MRC3 CSL3 CSL3 CSL3 CSL4 CSL5  MRC4 CSL4 CSL4 CSL4 CSL4 CSL5  MRC5 CSL5 CSL5 CSL5 CSL5 CSL5  Deviations from this default are allowed under conditions as described above.  5.5.4 The CSL-concept as a basis for security-by-design and control  libraries  A defined structure of security levels which is commensurate with related level structures for risk  and assurance not only supports consistency and coherence between schemes and the re-use  of certified ICT products etc, but it can also be used to develop libraries of CSL-conformant  controls. These libraries could help product vendors and owners of ISMS-supported IT systems  to implement a well-defined level of security and assurance. They would also allow a practical  approach to security-by-design for developers who are not experts in implementing IT security  and assurance.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  53  5.6 THE COMMON ASSURANCE REFERENCE CONCEPT – CONSISTENT  IMPLEMENTATION OF ASSURANCE  5.6.1 Objectives  The Cybersecurity Act (CSA) stipulates the definition and implementation of a scalable concept  for assurance requirements that shall support the basic, substantial and high levels and  stipulates a consistent implementation of these assurance levels across the schemes of the EU  cybersecurity certification framework.  This requires consistency for the specifications of security and assurance requirements as well  as evaluation and certification.  5.6.2 Introduction to a common assurance concept  The objective of a consistent implementation of assurance levels should be seen in the context  of the following targets:  1. The CSA established the EU cybersecurity certification framework to overcome the  fragmentation between cybersecurity certification schemes in the internal market. A  consistent implementation of key parameters such as risk, security and assurance level  across schemes will avoid fragmentation between schemes and enable the re-use and  referencing of certificates.  2. The CSA anticipates that the requirements for the certification of ICT products, ICT  processes and ICT services may vary depending on technologies, targeted markets,  responsible stakeholders etc. Specific cybersecurity certification schemes both under  public or industry responsibility may have to be established to support these needs.  Consequently, there may be numerous schemes under the EU cybersecurity certification  framework. All these schemes will try to optimize their operations, which is likely to lead to  deviations. Without appropriate measures, these deviations could lead to a fragmentation  between the schemes under the EU cybersecurity certification framework and prohibit the  recognition of certificates.  It will be apparent that there is a potential conflict between the two targets. Therefore, a balance  between the targets of recognition and re-use of certificates and the required flexibility for the  implementation of schemes has to be established.  It is proposed that the common assurance reference concept, which is described in the following  sections, would support the implementation of such a balance. It should be applied to all  cybersecurity certification schemes covered by the EU cybersecurity certification framework.  The idea is to establish a common set of parameters across all schemes, which will allow the  implementation of assurance between schemes to be compared as a prerequisite for the  recognition and re-use of certificates.  However, the need for flexibility mentioned above does not lend itself to a single, firm definition  of assurance for all schemes of the EU cybersecurity certification framework. Therefore, a  common assurance reference concept requires a pragmatic approach.  The idea is to adhere as far as possible to proven, trusted standards and methods but to allow  their use in a very flexible way. This is likely to lead to uncertainties and a need for interpretation  and alignment. In order to address this, the EU cybersecurity certification framework could  establish structures such as, for example, a team of experts from the schemes involved, to  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  54  promote alignment with regard to the comparability of definitions of scheme-specific assurance  levels within the schemes involved.  5.6.3 Selection of the basis for the common assurance reference concept  Several criteria should be taken into consideration to help define a meaningful selection of the  principles for the concept of common assurance levels for the EU cybersecurity certification  framework:  1. European or international standards  The CSA stipulates that European cybersecurity certification schemes should be based on  European or international standards. This also applies to crucial parts of the schemes and  is an important prerequisite both for acceptance in the European market and to enhance  the marketability of European suppliers in international markets. The assurance level  concept to be selected for the EU cybersecurity framework should therefore be based on  specifications in either European or international standards.  2. Availability and maturity of evaluation methods  The credibility of assurance levels is largely dependent on the trust of the market in the  evaluation methods that are associated with these levels. Such trust cannot be gained  overnight. The development of new evaluation methods for elevated security and  assurance levels, the deployment of evaluation facilities, the training of developers and  evaluators and, in particular, gaining the trust of the market in these new methods would  probably take years.  As a consequence, existing evaluation methods should be used if  available and applicable.  3. Available base of certified ICT products  Especially for the ramp-up phase of the EU cybersecurity certification framework, there will  be a need to integrate certified ICT products which are already available in the market.  The proposed assurance reference concept should allow these certified ICT products to be  re-used. This applies for certified ICT products which are already in use in a sectoral or  infrastructural ICT system and also to those which are to be introduced.  The following considerations should be taken into account:  ‒ It is advisable to rely on established European or international standards for scaled  assurance and to re-use the associated proven evaluation methodologies as far as  possible.  ‒ The EU cybersecurity certification framework is intended to serve a wide variety of  market sectors and related schemes. Therefore, sector-specific standards are  unsuitable as a basis for a consistent implementation of assurance levels across all  schemes. This narrows the options down to two sector-independent families of  international standards, the ISO/IEC 270xx and the ISO/IEC 15408 series of  standards.  ‒ The ISO/IEC 270xx series of standards is widely used for the implementation of  Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) in ICT systems and for the  certification of these implementations. It provides potentially the broadest coverage  globally for ICT systems owned by organizations. Information security risk  assessment methods are used for the identification of risk related to the intended use  of ICT products, ICT processes and ICT systems, taking into account the perspective  of organizations that provide ICT services. However, the ISO/IEC 270xx series of  standards does not define the term assurance, it does not use the concept of  assurance levels and does not support well-specified common evaluation methods.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  55  ‒ In contrast, the ISO/IEC 15408 series of standards supports scalable assurance and  complies with the above criteria. However, specific considerations are required if  ISO/IEC 15408-concepts, which are mainly known from Common Criteria certification  schemes, are to be used in a broad range of schemes for different ICT products, ICT  infrastructures and sectoral ICT systems under the EU cybersecurity certification  framework. This will be discussed in the following sections.  5.6.4 Potential for use of ISMS as a basis for the common assurance  reference concept  The proposed common assurance reference concept shall support ICT systems which employ  certified ICT services, ICT products and ICT processes and which, for the security of  stakeholder ICT systems, rely on ISMS certification. Consequently, the common assurance  reference concept should be defined in such a way that the integration of product certification  schemes and ISMS certification is possible.  ISMS certification takes its perspective from the system level, making sure that ICT products  and processes are integrated, operated and maintained as required to meet the information  security objectives of the organization.  Typically, ISMS certifications do not audit vulnerabilities on the ICT products, which are part of  the system. As described in Section 5.6.3, ISMSs do not work with defined security and  assurance levels since the targets for these vary, depending on the individual information  security objectives of the organization. Currently, there is no open evaluation methodology in  place, which could be commonly used across organizations and their ISMSs and referenced by  a cybersecurity certification scheme. The applicability of the proposed common assurance  reference concept to current ISMS-based certification concepts is therefore limited.  Product certification schemes, on the other hand, are not suitable for evaluations at system  levels. Their domain is the in-depth evaluation of ICT products up to a high level of assurance  and resistance against high attack potential.  Because of these fundamental differences in applicability, ISMS and product certification  schemes can be seen as complementary or even synergistic. Especially so, if ICT systems  within an ISMS are aiming to reach elevated assurance levels. Substantial or high assurance  can be associated with an ISMS if it employs ICT products certified at an appropriate assurance  level. As a result, the security architecture of sectoral or infrastructural ICT systems should be  defined in such a way that the required level of assurance is introduced through well-defined,  certified ICT products, ICT processes and supporting ICT services.  Based on these considerations, the definition of the common assurance reference concept  should focus on ICT product cybersecurity certification schemes as a foundation. An extension  to support ISMS-based approaches should be implemented as soon as the prerequisites are in  place, and in particular when one or more ISMS-based multi-level schemes for ICT systems or  ICT services will be publicly available. This will largely depend on the availability of an open,  common evaluation methodology for ICT systems that are used within an ISMS.  5.6.5 Definition of a common assurance reference concept based on  ISO/IEC 15408  ISO/IEC 15408 specifies seven Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL) together with related  definitions of assurance components to be addressed at each level. The analysis of  vulnerabilities can be seen as the central part of the evaluation activities described in the EAL  assurance packages and thus qualifies as the key parameter for a comparison of assurance.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  56  ISO/IEC 15408-3 specifies the vulnerability analysis by defining AVA_VAN assurance  components. These have five levels of increasing rigor and depth. The evaluation  methodologies for the AVA_VAN assurance components are well-defined, trusted by the  European and international markets and are implemented in numerous evaluation facilities  globally.  It may be worthwhile noting that AVA_VAN-based concepts are also used by some industry-  owned cybersecurity certification schemes. Although these may not always fully conform to  ISO/IEC 15408, they employ the AVA_VAN concept to take advantage of its proven evaluation  methodologies. This feature could provide a starting point to investigate the comparability of  assurance by using the structures mentioned in Section 5.6.2.  Following these considerations, the EU cybersecurity certification framework should establish  the common assurance reference concept based on ISO/IEC 15408’s AVA_VAN approach to  assurance levels and re-use the associated evaluation methodologies.  In order to allow deviations from the strict definitions of AVA_VAN assurance components in  ISO/IEC 15408, it is proposed that the term ‘Common Assurance Reference’ (CAR) should be  introduced.  The definition of Common Assurance References, based on ISO/IEC 15408’s definition of  AVA_VAN assurance components, is shown in the following table:  Table 7: Overview of Common Assurance Reference (CAR) levels  Common  Assurance  Reference  (CAR)  ISO/IEC 15408 baseline specification Associated baseline  contents for the  AVA_VAN assurance  components  Selected lead  parameter  Associated  EAL package  Related attack  potential  1  AVA_VAN.1  Vulnerability survey  EAL1 Basic See Annex  D.2  2  AVA_VAN.2  Vulnerability analysis  EAL2 Basic See Annex D.3  3  AVA_VAN.3 Focused  vulnerability analysis  EAL4 Enhanced-basic See Annex D.4  4  AVA_VAN.4  Methodical  vulnerability analysis  EAL5 Moderate See Annex D.5  5  AVA_VAN.5  Advanced methodical  vulnerability analysis  EAL6  High See Annex D.6  AVA_VAN assurance components define so-called ‘dependencies’, which provide a minimum  configuration of other assurance components that have to be addressed with vulnerability  analysis. In order to achieve full conformance with ISO/IEC 15408 the entire set of assurance  components from the lowest-level EAL package that includes the particular AVA_VAN-  component have to be carried out. This concept is also used in the EUCC scheme.  While this methodology does not imply full ISO/IEC 15408 conformance, it however requires that  the ATE_IND component of the lowest-level EAL package, which includes the selected  AVA_VAN-component is also included as part of the assurance activities of the associated CAR.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  57  5.6.6 Implementation of the common assurance reference concept  The application of the common assurance reference concept, as defined in Section 5.6.5, could  be described for three implementation scenarios. These are described in the following  subsections.  5.6.6.1 EUCC and other ISO/IEC15408-conformant cybersecurity certification schemes  The EUCC and potentially other public or industry schemes will implement assurance concepts  as described by the EUCC scheme based on the AVA_VAN assurance components.  Since full conformance with ISO/IEC15408 can be assumed, no further information exchange or  alignment between schemes in the EU cybersecurity certification framework is deemed  necessary in this scenario.  5.6.6.2 Cybersecurity certification schemes for cost-sensitive and evaluation time critical  conditions  European cybersecurity certification schemes, which address cost-sensitive ICT products with  basic or substantial assurance requirements, or which have to ensure short, predictable  evaluation times, may have to deviate from the methods implemented by classical CC schemes  such as the EUCC. Nevertheless, such schemes may wish to make sure that their certificates  are recognized by other cybersecurity schemes of the EU cybersecurity certification framework.  The common assurance reference concept could help these schemes adapt to economic or  market requirements while keeping comparability of assurance in the following ways:  1. The schemes could accept alternative approaches to provide evidence concerning certain  assurance components. Documentation could, for instance, be replaced by information  provided in audits or workshops.  2. If duly justified, certain assurance components could be skipped.  In the first case, conformance with ISO/IEC 15408 could still be possible.  In both cases, deviations from the standards and the classical approach must be justified and  documented in detail.  Deviations will probably lead to a need for discussion and alignment with the schemes that are  interested in recognizing the certificates. As proposed in Section 5.6.2, the EU cybersecurity  certification framework could establish structures (e.g. an expert group) that involve  representatives of the certifying scheme and those schemes that are interested in re-using  these certificates. This expert group could support the scheme by selecting an approach that is  commonly accepted for the targeted level of assurance.  Examples for alternative approaches to provide evidence are given in Annex E.  5.6.6.3 Evaluating assurance of external schemes  As stated before, there are market-relevant industry schemes, which re-use parts of  ISO/IEC 15408 such as the AVA_VAN assurance component definitions, as well as evaluation  methodologies from the ‘smartcard’ technical domain. Other known examples, such as the  eIDAS implementing regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/1502)6, refer to or employ  6 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502 of 8 September 2015 on setting out minimum technical  specifications and procedures for assurance levels for electronic identification means pursuant to Article 8(3) of  Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust  services for electronic transactions in the internal market  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015R1502&qid=1630050753803 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015R1502&qid=1630050753803 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015R1502&qid=1630050753803 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015R1502&qid=1630050753803  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  58  ISO/IEC 15408’s terminology on ‘attack potential’ to define their security and assurance  requirements.  The implementation of the proposed common assurance reference concept by the EU  cybersecurity certification framework would provide the option to use these similarities as a  starting point for a rough comparison of assurance with the respective specifications of such  cybersecurity certification schemes.  As described in Section 5.6.6.2, the EU cybersecurity certification framework could establish  structures that conduct an assessment if the assurance level provided by an external scheme  complies with the requirements of the EU cybersecurity certification framework. Of course, this  would require transparency concerning the methodologies applied by the external scheme.  5.6.7 Relevance of evaluation methodologies, support for new technical  domains  Evaluation methodologies, which are trusted by the market to prove the promised level of  assurance, are important assets of any cybersecurity certification scheme. This applies in  particular to elevated assurance levels.  Common Criteria schemes, like the EUCC, support the evaluation and certification of any kind  of ICT product up to AVA_VAN.3. Evaluation and certification for higher levels is restricted to  certain categories of products, termed ‘technical domains’. These provide domain-specific  information, for example on vulnerabilities, as well as dedicated methodologies, for instance  those used for evaluation and estimation of attack potential. This information and these  methodologies should not be re-used for other product domains without careful consideration,  and they will probably require adaptation before use.  EUCC currently supports two technology domains: ‘Hardware devices with security boxes’ and  ‘smartcards and similar devices’.  New technology or architectural trends may lead to a need for new technical domains. It can be  assumed that the evaluation of software (for example operating systems and web applications)  or cloud service systems for levels higher than CAR3/AVA_VAN.3 cannot be implemented  based on information and methodologies designed, for example, for the ‘smartcard’ technical  domain.  The implementation of all necessary guidance and the methodology for a new technical domain  takes a considerable amount of time and must be conducted using transparent, inclusive  processes.  It should be noted that the distinction between security functional requirements and security  assurance requirements, as stipulated in ISO/IEC 15408, could help to support a stepwise  approach in the event that the methods and guidance information of a technical domain are not  yet completely available. It would be possible to define a high level of security for the first step of  implementation but limit the level to CAR3/AVA_VAN.3. The upgrade to assurance at  CAR4/AVA_VAN.4 or CAR5/AVA_VAN.5 level could follow as a second step once the  evaluation methodologies for the technical domain are completely implemented.  5.6.8 Mapping to CSA assurance levels  The previous chapter documents the reasoning why the common assurance level concept,  which is based on ISO/IEC 15408’s AVA_VAN assurance components and the related EAL  packages, should be the basis for a consistent definition of common assurance references  throughout the schemes of the EU cybersecurity certification framework. The five CAR-levels,  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  59  which are defined by the common assurance reference concept, have to be assigned to the  three levels of assurance, which are stipulated by the CSA.  The following should also be considered:  ‒ In addition, for economic reasons, it is advisable that the evaluation should be carried out  in relation to the 5 common assurance reference levels or the equivalent AVA_VAN-based  definitions given in the EUCC. A structure that supports only 3 levels would probably not  support the degree of granularity needed to balance assurance requirements against the  effort of evaluation.  ‒ Both the CSA assurance level and the CAR-level should be documented in the certificate.  Theoretically, the assignment of common assurance references to CSA assurance levels could  be handled individually for each scheme. Moreover, in such cases, the proposed common  assurance level concept could serve as a reference for the consistent implementation of  assurance levels across all schemes of the EU cybersecurity certification framework.  5.6.9 Relationship between risk and assurance level concepts  According to the conceptual approach for consistency between risk and assurance, which is  described in Section 5.1, there should be, by default, a one-to-one relation between the same  levels of MRC and CAR.  However, it is a fundamental principle that the evaluation should reflect the assumed types of  attackers and their capabilities. As described in Section 5.4, the attack potential, which includes  the opportunity, means and motives of assumed attackers, will be estimated during the sectoral  assessment, which will be carried out in the preparatory phase of sectoral candidate scheme  drafting. The relationship between the levels of attack potential identified by CTI and the  respective levels specified in ISO/IEC 18045 is given in Table 4.  The motivation of potential attackers contributes to the classification of risk as described in  Section 5.3. However, it could occur that the risk assessment assigns a lower level to the MRC  than was detected by CTI for the AP.  This could lead to a CAR below the related level of attack  potential AP. In such a case, the following rule shall apply:  If the MRC is at a lower level than the AP level, the AP level should determine the level of the  CAR by using the relationship defined in Table 4. For instance, as shown in Table 8, for the  combination MRC1 and AP3, the CAR should be determined based on AP3. By this, it can be  ensured that the evaluation matches the opportunity and means of the potential adversaries.  During the sectoral assessment, the sectoral stakeholders may deviate from this default  relationship in some cases. Such deviations should be justified and documented during the  sectoral assessment.  A special case occurs if AP5, which matches a ‘beyond high’ attack potential according to  ISO/IEC 18045, was identified for the adversary. Evaluation methodologies for this level are  currently not available. Section 5.4 describes this case. The following figure illustrates the  principle:  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  60  Figure 12: Relationship between MRC, CAR and CSA assurance levels  The following table shows the possible combinations of MRC, AP and the resulting CAR for the  default scenarios.  Table 8: Common Assurance Reference (CAR) scorecard  AP levels  AP1 AP2 AP3 AP4 AP5  MRC  MRC1 CAR1/2 CAR3 CAR4 CAR5 Not supported  MRC2 CAR2 CAR3 CAR4 CAR5 Not supported  MRC3 CAR3 CAR3 CAR4 CAR5 Not supported  MRC4 CAR4 CAR4 CAR4 CAR5 Not supported  MRC5 CAR5 CAR5 CAR5 CAR5 Not supported  It should be noted that, as shown in Table 4, the parameter AP is related to the levels of attack  potential given in ISO/IEC 18045. The ‘Basic’ level relates to AVA_VAN.1/CAR1 and also  AVA_VAN.2/CAR2.  Exceptions from the default relationship between MRC, AP and CAR are allowed provided the  deviation is justified and documented. Extreme combinations such as MRC 1 in combination  with AP3 or AP4 may suggest careful considerations.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  61  5.7 TRIGGERS FOR REACTIONS TO UNEXPECTED EVENTS  There may be unexpected events (e.g. geopolitical crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic or massive  changes in the cyberthreat landscape) that could cause significant changes to the risk exposure  of the sectoral system and its ICT services (e.g. new vulnerabilities, new attack methods,  change of attacker motivation).  The sectoral stakeholders should implement a method that can re-start the methodology  described in this document in response to a defined trigger and specify the criteria for releasing  such a trigger.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  62  6. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE  SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY  ASSESSMENT  The objectives, principles and the approach for the sectoral cybersecurity assessment are  described in Chapter 5. The following sections document the workflows proposed for the  preparation and implementation of sectoral cybersecurity certification schemes.  6.1 OVERVIEW OF THE IMPLEMENTATION STEPS  The integration of the SCSA Methodology into the CSA’s workflow for the preparation of  cybersecurity certification candidate schemes is described in Subsection 5.2.2 and shown in  Figure 6.  Figure 13 shows the sequential steps that should be carried out and names the workflows that  are proposed for each step.  Figure 13: Sequential steps for the implementation of the SCSA Methodology  The workflows are described in the following sections.  6.2 WORKFLOW A ‘CONTEXT ESTABLISHMENT AND BUSINESS LAYER  ASSESSMENT’  The documentation of the sectoral context can be seen as an equivalent to the ‘context  establishment’ known from ISO/IEC 27005 for ISMS risk management7. All information relevant  for the assessment of sectoral risks and the definition of certification, security and assurance  requirements is collected and documented.  According to the SCSA Methodology, and as an extension to the approach given in  ISO/IEC 27005, not only is information relevant for consideration from the perspective of the  sectoral stakeholders (i.e. risk owners in terms of ISO/IEC 27005) documented but CTI and  attacker information are also documented.  7 ISO/IEC 27005 builds on the method defined in ISO/IEC 31000 for information security  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  63  Figure 14 depicts the proposed workflow for the documentation of the sectoral context which  was chosen as the basis for the sectoral assessment and for assessing the relevant business  layer information.  Figure 14: Workflow A ‘Context establishment and business layer assessment’  The activities to be conducted in the individual steps are described in the following list:  A-1 Scoping the sectoral context  This activity defines the sectoral context which defines the basis for the sectoral  assessment. The scope should be defined based on the customers that the sector  wants to address and the services and use cases that should be provided to these  customers. At this stage the sectoral stakeholders and their roles and responsibilities  should also be documented. The identification of stakeholders should include those  sectoral roles that contribute to the delivery of the targeted services, the coordinating  entity, consumers or their organizations, and governmental authorities that supervise or  regulate the sector.  A-2 Identification of required business processes  Based on the results from A-1 the business processes which are required to support  the targeted services and use cases should be documented. In addition, the sectoral  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  64  stakeholders contributing to or depending on the particular business processes should  be identified.  The following steps establish the context from the perspective of business processes and  related objectives:  A-3 Identification of stakeholder objectives and requirements for each business  process  The objectives and requirements of the involved stakeholders should be documented  for each business process. The goal should be to collect, depending on the roles of the  stakeholders involved, the relevant range of objectives from the business, customer,  societal or governmental perspective for each business process. Practical experience  shows that general objectives cannot always be linked to ICT incidents as would be  required for the assessment of risks. Therefore it is advisable to add more specific ICT-  related requirements to those objectives.  In addition, steps should be taken to ensure that generic risk areas are taken into  account for the definition of objectives and requirements for each business case.  Annex B contains a list of these risk areas.  A-4 Classification of objectives and requirements  The stakeholder’s objectives and requirements related to the particular business  processes may be relevant in the assessment of risks but there could also be  requirements that concern the characteristics of the cybersecurity scheme or others  that indicate stakeholders’ needs for assurance. The objectives and requirements  should be categorized and documented accordingly.  For the further steps of the workflow, the relationship between objectives and their  requirements, stakeholders and business processes must be kept.  The following steps establish the context from the architectural perspective:  A-5 Identification and documentation of ICT subsystems or processes supporting  business processes  Based on the documentation of the business processes, the ICT subsystem or process  supporting a particular business process should be documented. This should include  the architecture and all involved ICT products, services and processes, as well as  external ones that contribute to the ICT subsystem. In case of processes, for instance  the supply chain, the process flow and the supporting architecture and components  should be documented.  A-6 Identification of information and functional assets and related supporting assets  As described in Subsection 5.2.5 and based on the result of A-5, the primary  information and functional assets and their supporting assets should be identified and  documented for each ICT subsystem or process identified in A-5. In addition, an initial  ranking of the relevance of primary information and functional assets with regard to  stakeholders’ objectives identified in A-3 should be aligned with the sectoral  stakeholders involved in the related business process.  Information from A-8 on potential attack scenarios and attackers that could be  motivated and, in principle, be capable of conducting such attacks on information or  functional assets should be taken into account for this priority ranking. Those  information or functional assets prioritized by the ranking discussion should be seen as  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  65  primary assets and would become the basis for the definition of risk scenarios in  context assessment.  The following steps establish the context from the perspective of CTI and adversaries:  A-7 Documentation of context-specific CTI and relevant attacker types and their  properties  The first step of the context establishment regarding threats and adversaries should  generate an assessment of threats, CTI information and relevant attacker types for the  scope and business processes defined in A-1 and A-2. Existing sector-specific  information such as threat landscapes should be used as input. The identification of  relevant attacker types should use the list of attacker types given in Chapter 9 as its  basis. The estimation of the attack potential level and the motivation of attackers  should also apply the characteristics and methods defined in Chapter 9.  A-8 Documentation of relevant attack scenarios  Based on the results of A-7 and information on the relevant subsystems of the sectoral  architecture (A-5), relevant attack scenarios that could affect the primary assets (A-6)  should be identified and documented. The relevant attacker types and probability of the  implementation of the attack should also be estimated for each attack scenario.  The outcome may lead to a re-prioritization of the information and functional assets  identified in A-6. If any of these assets cannot be associated with an attack scenario  that is likely to occur it should be disregarded.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  66  6.3 WORKFLOW B ‘PRIMARY ASSET LAYER ASSESSMENT’  As described in Subsection 5.2.7, the primary asset layer assessment builds on the results of  Workflow A, ‘Context establishment and business layer assessment’.  The main targets of this workflow are the identification of relevant risk scenarios and the  assignment of meta-risk classes for each risk scenario. Figure 15depicts the proposed  workflow.  Figure 15: Workflow B ‘Primary asset layer assessment’  The activities to be conducted in the individual steps are described in the following list:  B-1 Identification of risk scenarios  In this step of the workflow, risk scenarios as described in Subsection 5.2.6 will be  defined based on the following information:  ‒ Stakeholder objectives or requirements related to a specific business process  as documented in A-R1.  ‒ Specific primary information or functional asset relevant to the selected  stakeholder objective or requirement as documented in A-R2.  ‒ Attack scenario targeting the specific primary information or functional asset  as documented in A-R3. Before applying this attack scenario it will be  reviewed and potentially specified in more detail by activity B-2.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  67  ‒ Information from an ISO/IEC 27005-conformant sectoral risk assessment may  be associated to the risk scenario.  ‒ Stakeholder information.  ‒ CTI information.  A specific stakeholder objective or requirement and a thereto related specific primary  information or functional asset which, if successfully attacked, could lead to cybersecurity  risks for the selected stakeholder objective are used as a starting point for consideration.  In the next step an attack scenario that targets the primary information or functional  asset and other information listed above will be added to the risk scenario.  If no scenario of an attack on the primary information or functional asset can be  identified and if there is no information from CTI or stakeholders that indicates the  practical relevance of the risk scenario, the risk scenario can be disregarded.  B-2 Specific assessment of attack scenarios for each risk scenario  As a supporting activity in parallel to B-1, the attack scenarios documented in A-R3 will  be reviewed for their relevance for a specific risk scenario which is defined in B-1. In  this process additional information from CTI or stakeholders may be added to enhance  and consolidate the description of the attack scenario.  B-3 Assignment of probability level and impact class for each risk scenario  For each risk scenario defined in B-1, the potential impact and the probability of its  occurrence is estimated. The methods for assigning the impact class and the  probability level are described in Subsection 5.3.3 and in Subsection 5.3.4. This activity  should be conducted in direct discussions with the stakeholders whose objectives  could be impacted by an incident as described by the risk scenario.  Every stakeholder type should describe his perception of the severity of the impact an  incident would have on his objectives or requirements and select an impact class.  Should the perceptions and choices of stakeholders diverge, a discussion that leads to  a jointly accepted impact class for the risk scenario should be facilitated. All  stakeholder positions and selections should be documented.  As a final step of the impact class identification, it must be verified that the selected  impact class complies with the minimum IC value given for the defined risk areas in  Annex B. The relation to a risk area is given if the stakeholder objective was defined in  relation to one of these risk areas as described in A-3.  The selection of the probability level depends mainly on the probability that the attack  scenario associated with the risk scenario will be implemented by the attacker. This  probability should be estimated based on the detailed attack scenario description  generated by B-2 and information that may be provided by stakeholders.  B-4 Assignment of the meta-risk class for each risk scenario  For each risk scenario that went through the assignment of an impact class and a  probability level in step B-3, a meta-risk class is assigned. The method for assessing  meta-risk classes is described in Subsection 5.3.5.  Risk scenarios should be documented including the impact class, the probability level  and the meta-risk class. The meta-risk class may be used for prioritising risk scenarios  for the assessment of supporting assets. The meta-risk class assigned to a risk  scenario is inherited by the primary asset and all its supporting assets.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  68  6.4 WORKFLOW C ‘ASSESSMENT OF SUPPORTING ASSETS’  As described in Subsection 5.2.7, the assessment of supporting assets builds on the results of  workflows A and B, the context establishment, business layer assessment and the primary  asset layer assessment.  The main targets of this workflow are the identification of the certification, security and  assurance requirements for supporting assets. The supporting assets to be assessed are  defined by the risk scenarios selected for the assessment. Figure 16 depicts the proposed  workflow.  Figure 16: Workflow C ‘Assessment of supporting assets’  The activities to be conducted in the individual steps are described in the following list:  C-1 Documentation of relevant parameters for each supporting asset and its  intended use  As a first step in the assessment of a specific supporting asset, parameters relevant to  that assessment are documented. This has to be conducted for the particular ‘intended  use’. The intended use of the supporting asset is defined, for instance, by the business  process to be supported, by its place and role in the ICT architecture and by the  primary assets that it supports.  The following parameters are deemed relevant for the subsequent steps of the  workflow and should be documented:  1. ‘Intended use’ of the supporting asset with reference to the supported business  process and its supporting primary information or functional assets.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  69  2. Meta-risk class for the intended use. The supporting asset inherits the MRC from  the risk scenario of which it is a part.  3. Operational environment for the specific intended use.  4. Typical high-level architecture and implementation technology.  5. Specifications and standards.  6. Specific stakeholder requirements.  7. Other sectors where the supporting asset may be in use.  Any business-layer requirements that, independently of risk- or attacker-based  considerations, could have an impact on the security, assurance or certification  requirements of the supporting asset should also be documented. This could apply, for  instance, where relevant regulations by national authorities exist.  It is not untypical that ICT products, processes or services serve a sectoral system in  various ‘intended uses’ or appear as supporting assets in several risk scenarios. If so,  the assessment has to be carried out for each relevant case. The MRC and the  certification, security and assurance requirements could diverge. Faced with such  results, the supplier would have the choice to either develop portfolios of ICT products,  processes or services optimized for the particular intended use or to have just one offer  which conforms to the most demanding case of ‘intended use’ but can be used for  those with lower requirements as well.  C-2 Re-assessment of estimated parameters  In the primary asset layer assessment, the MRC was assigned to a risk scenario based  on considerations of the consequences of a potential incident on the objectives of  stakeholders. Assuming that the incident could, in principle, be caused by attacks on  any supporting asset, the risk scenario’s MRC is inherited by those supporting assets.  However, this is not always the case. It could very well be that certain supporting  assets supporting a primary asset are not as prone to attacks as others and would  hence not contribute to the probability of the risk occurring as assumed at the primary  asset layer. If a supporting asset is also used by other sectors, this should be taken  into account as this could increase the motivation of attackers and the probability of an  attack.  Another parameter to be re-assessed is the APL of the attacker types listed in the risk  scenario’s attack scenario. In context establishment and in primary asset layer  assessment, due to the lack of detailed information on the targeted supporting assets,  only a general estimate of the APL is possible. C-1 generates information about the  operational environment, the technology etc. which could significantly change the  estimate of the opportunity and means of the relevant attacker types concerning the  particular supporting asset.  The re-assessment of the parameters estimated in Workflow A and Workflow B could  be conducted in the following steps:  1. The list of relevant attacker types and their APL associated with the relevant risk  scenarios should be reviewed with regard to the specific technology and  operational environment of the supporting asset. If available, CTI information  concerning the type of supporting asset should be taken into account. Any  changes to the most relevant attacker types and their APL and motivation should  be documented.  2. If changes to the probability level for the relevant risk scenarios have been  encountered in the previous step, the MRC should be recalculated. The revised  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  70  value should be assigned to the supporting asset and used for the definition of its  security and assurance levels. Furthermore, it should be checked whether new or  changed views on relevant attacker types, their capacities and motivation  stemming from the detailed assessment at supporting asset level, might suggest  an adapted assignment of the MRC that was associated with the risk scenario at  primary asset level in Workflow B. The revised value should be used for the  definition of the security and assurance level of the supporting asset.  Typically, sectoral stakeholders prefer to apply cybersecurity certification only to those  system components for which this is clearly warranted by an elevated level of risk or by  a dedicated need for assurance.  3. Therefore, in a further step in C-3, it could be decided that the re-assessed MRC  and attacker information suggests certification of the supporting asset is required.  Stakeholder objectives and requirements collected in A-3 and categorized in A-4  that indicate a need for assurance with regard to this supporting asset should  support such decision. In addition, whether sectoral measures already deployed  for the supporting asset would make a certification redundant needs to be  checked.  C-3 Definition of specific security and assurance levels  Based on the consolidation of the APL, the probability level and MRC for the specific  supporting asset, and by considering potential risk-independent obligations in C-2, the  CAR and CSL levels should be defined. If the sector plans to deploy different variants  of the supporting asset depending on its intended use and operational environment,  the assignment of security and assurance levels should be carried out for each variant.  The use of attack potential for the selection of security levels and assurance levels is  described in Section 5.4.  The risk-based definition of common security levels and the assignment of the CSL  based on the MRC and the APL are described in Section 5.5.  The risk-based definition of common assurance levels and the assignment of the CAR  based on the MRC and the APL are described in Section 5.6.  Certain results of this workflow should be made available to suppliers or owners of supporting  assets so that they can optimize their ICT systems, products, processes or services with regard  to the requirements identified. This includes, for instance:  ‒ Information about the ‘intended use’ and the operational environment of the supporting  ICT product, ICT process or infrastructural ICT service,  ‒ Minimum security and assurance requirements to be implemented by the sectoral  stakeholders in their ISMS-supported ICT systems,  ‒ Information as required by ICT product developers for the ICT product’s security  problem definition, security functional requirements (SFR) and security assurance  requirements (SAR).  The SCSA Methodology provides in Chapter 7 and in Annex D guidance for the transfer of this  information and for its translation into the terminology typically used by ICT product definition  and evaluation.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  71  6.5 WORKFLOW D ‘SUPPORTING ASSET GAP ANALYSIS’  The assessment of supporting assets described in Section 6.4 documents the ‘intended use’ of  supporting assets and identifies the requirements for certification, security and assurance. The  goal of workflow D is to ensure that these requirements can be implemented and verified.  Existing specifications and certification means should be re-used as far as possible.  This workflow starts with an analysis of the extent to which these requirements are already  covered by the supporting asset and the extent to which existing means could be used for  evaluation and certification. Gaps should be identified and resolutions to these gaps proposed.  Figure 17 depicts the proposed workflow.  Figure 17: Workflow D ‘Supporting asset gap analysis’  The activities to be conducted in the individual steps are described in the following list:  D-1 Documentation of the ‘status quo’  As a first step of this workflow, the status quo of the supporting asset and the certification  scheme that is potentially already applicable should be identified. The following  information should be collected and documented for the supporting asset type:  ‒ System specifications describing the role of the supporting assets in the system,  ‒ Open specifications and standards describing the functions and architecture of the  supporting asset,  ‒ Security specifications,  ‒ Specifications for security evaluation and certification that already exist.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  72  D-2 Identification of gaps  D-1 documented the status quo regarding the relevant specification of the supporting  asset. In this step the extent to which these available specifications and tools cover the  specific intended use and the identified requirements for certification, security and  assurance should be assessed:  ‒ An analysis should be carried out to ensure that all functions of the supporting  asset, which are required for its intended use, are sufficiently specified. The  relevant standards should be referenced and gaps should be documented.  ‒ An analysis should be carried out to clarify if all required functions and security  features of the supporting asset are supported by the existing specifications at the  CSL and CAR levels required. Any gaps should be documented.  The results of the gap analysis should be summarized in a way that it can be used as  input to the definition of a security problem and the definition of security objectives for  ISO/IEC 15408-conformant product certification, and also for comparison with existing  protection profile (PP) or security targets, or as external requirements to define an  ISMS and its risk management process, whichever is appropriate for the particular  supporting asset.  D-3 Generate resolution proposals  To support the appropriate implementation of the supporting asset’s defined features,  security and assurance level, resolutions for the gaps identified in D-2 should be  developed and communicated.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  73  7. RE-USE OF SECTORAL  ASSESSMENT RESULTS FOR ICT  PRODUCT DEFINITION  7.1 OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND  The CSA stipulates that the security and certification requirements for ICT services, ICT  products and ICT processes and the related assurance levels should be identified based on the  risk associated with their intended use. This requires an assessment of the sectoral or  infrastructural environment that employs these ICT services, ICT products and ICT processes.  The previous chapter proposes a consistent approach to risk, security and assurance. It  documents how a sectoral risk assessment in combination with CTI can provide required  information about the MRC, the use and the operational environment of the ICT services, ICT  products or ICT processes, which are a supporting asset for the sector or infrastructure. This  information also includes, for instance, the identification of potential adversaries, their motivation  and capacity to launch an attack.  The proposed methodology for identifying security and assurance requirements at sectoral or  infrastructural level uses the ISO/IEC 270xx series of standards as normative references. Terms  that describe risk etc. are in accordance with ISO/IEC 270xx. The employed risk assessment  methods, which may be specific to sectors, and their results are conformant with  ISO/IEC 27005.  However, the security and assurance requirements for ICT products and potentially ICT  processes are often documented using the ISO/IEC 15408 series of standards. The difficulty is  that the two series of standards are not harmonized. Terms and methods may diverge.  The objective of the conceptual work described in this section is to allow an exchange of  relevant information between the methodology applied at sectoral and infrastructural level,  which follows ISO/IEC 270xx, and an ISO/IEC 15408-based approach to security and  assurance of ICT products.  The following use cases should be supported:  1. Submission of security and assurance requirements associated with sectoral use as input  to the definition of an ICT product.  2. Assessment of ICT products already certified to check their suitability for sectoral use,  based on their existing certification.  3. Submission of information on attacker capabilities (attack potential) for the purpose of an  evaluation.  All three cases require the provisioning of relevant information from the sectoral assessment  methodology and its mapping into an ISO/IEC 15408-compliant format.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  74  7.2 CONCEPTUAL APPROACH  The targeted re-use of information from sectoral assessments for the purposes of the developer  of an ICT product or ICT process has the following prerequisites:  1. Clarification of terms and definitions  The terms defined in the ISO/IEC 270xx and ISO/IEC 15408 series of standards may  diverge. For a transfer of information generated by methods governed by one standard to  the other it is necessary to identify potential divergences and to consider the particular  context in which they will be used. Section 7.3 contains a comparison of divergent terms  and describes the boundary conditions which should be taken into account when  transferring related information.  2. Mapping table  A dedicated table should support the mapping of the information generated by a sectoral  assessment with the information needed for the definition of security and assurance  requirements for ICT products by an ISO/IEC 15408-based methodology. Figure 18  illustrates the principle.  Figure 18: Mapping between ISO/IEC 270xx and ISO/IEC 15408 methodologies  The following sections describe the mapping. A mapping table is given in Annex C.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  75  7.3 GUIDANCE FOR DIVERGENT DEFINITIONS OF TERMS  Some definitions of terms given in the series of ISO/IEC 270xx and the series of ISO/IEC 15408  standards, which are the normative references for this project, diverge from each other. A  transfer of information from the sectoral assessment to the specification of security and  certification of ICT products requires a sound understanding of the meaning of the relevant  terms on both sides.  A simple mapping of terms could lead to misinterpretations because the ISO/IEC 270xx series  and the ISO/IEC 15408 series of standards follow very different philosophies and purposes. The  concept, which was developed for this project, considers these specific boundary conditions and  explains terms in both groups of standards based on their overall objectives and the  relationships between terms in each standard (see Section 2.3). These considerations and a  mapping between terms in ISO/IEC 270xx and ISO/IEC 15408 are given in Annex A.  7.4 MAPPING TO SECURITY PROBLEM DEFINITION  The outputs of the sectoral risk assessment generated by an ISO/IEC 27005-conformant  method, and used for the definition of the meta-risk class (see Section 5.3) can be re-used as  inputs to the definition of the security problem in the context of the ISO/IEC 15408 security  assessment of an ICT product.  A security problem definition typically consists of the determination of the threats the ICT  product must be able to counter, the assumptions about the environment the product potentially  relies on to ensure its security, and the organizational policies to be put in place by the ICT  product itself or by its environment to fulfil various type of requirements as standards,  regulations or interoperability requirements.  7.4.1 Threats  Threats against an ICT product can be seen as an action against an asset associated with the  ICT product, performed by an attacker with particular expertise and means, and which results in  an unwanted event from the perspective of the ICT product with a negative impact, more or less  directly, on the overall ICT system.  Each item of a threat is detailed in the subsequent sub-sections and a synthesis is shown in  Annex C.  7.4.1.1 Assets  The list of assets associated with an ICT product constitutes the target of attacks. At the product  level, such assets can be of different types, as data (e.g. keys, passwords, user personal data)  or services (e.g. access to encryption, signature verification).  Some assets can be related to the assets of an ICT service or ICT infrastructure making use of  the ICT product, such as, for example, a cryptographic key associated with an ICT service. A  description of these assets from the point-of-view of the ICT service/infrastructure, also called  primary assets, must be provided as part of the output of the sectoral assessment.  Other assets are specific to the ICT product implementation. These are to be determined by the  related standards and/or the ICT product developer.  7.4.1.2 Unwanted events (incidents) with negative effects  In defining the security problem, a list of assets is not sufficient to determine how attacks can be  exploited to cause damage. For instance, considering a cryptographic certificate, for extracting it  is unlikely to have a negative effect (assuming it is public information), while replacing it could  result in an impersonation attack with negative consequences.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  76  Therefore, in order to determine the risk, it is also necessary to identify the unwanted events  (incidents) that could happen to the ICT product and that would have subsequent negative  effects on the ICT system.  Negative effects on the ICT system are mostly identified by the sector and/or organization  through risk assessment. For instance, without understanding the context within which a  signature service is used, it would not be possible to determine if the inability to access that  service would have negative consequences on the overall ICT system, the result being that  such negative consequences cannot be defined at the ICT product development level.  Thus, from knowledge of both negative effects and of how the ICT product functions, the  consequences of unwanted events at the ICT product level can be determined. For instance, if  the inability to access a signature service is indeed considered a negative effect, an associated  unwanted event at the ICT level could be the erasing of the signature key.  As another example, if the disclosure of some user data is considered a negative effect, an  associated unwanted event at the ICT level could be a bypassing of the mechanism for  controlling access to the confidential information.  The list of unwanted events is determined in part (at a sectoral level) based on the estimation of  an impact class as described in subsection 5.3.3.  7.4.1.3 Attack surface, inherent and potential vulnerabilities  The hardware and software components and interfaces of an ICT product determine its attack  surface. Knowledge of this attack surface is needed to allow the definition of what means of  attack and techniques can be used to target an ICT product. For instance, the use of a well-  known hardware or software technology could directly discount some attacks and attack  techniques and thus the threat from those attacks.  Knowledge of the attack surface also enables the existence of inherent or potential  vulnerabilities to be determined. For example, the use of a certain CPU implies that Spectre8-  like attacks are automatically applicable, or the use of some specific DDRAM implies that  Rowhammer9-like attack techniques can be used to inject faults. As a result, threats based on  this type of fault injection must be taken into consideration.  The dimension of the attack surface is also an essential indicator of the effort that might be  expended on vulnerability analysis, as well as of the probability of the presence of security  issues.  Information to establish this attack surface mainly comes from the ICT product developer.  However, as part of its risk assessment the sector may also monitor vulnerabilities related to the  hardware and/or software technologies within the ICT products used in the ICT system.  Furthermore, some sectors and organizations have compiled checklists with common potential  vulnerabilities that can be followed. One resource that can be used in the context of such an  assessment is the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)10, which lists, describes and  structures typical software and hardware vulnerabilities in ICT systems. Note that, at the level of  threat definition, the attack surface does not need a lot of technical detail.  8 https://spectreattack.com  9 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer  10 https://cwe.mitre.org/  https://spectreattack.com/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer https://cwe.mitre.org/  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  77  7.4.1.4 Threat agents  Threat agents are potential attackers of the ICT product. ‘Attackers’ can be of different types  (e.g. human or accidental) and have different motivations (e.g. financial for crime organizations,  reputation for independent hackers). See Subsection 9.3 for more details on threat agents.  Depending on the context in which an ICT product will be used, not all threat agents are  relevant and related threats can therefore be excluded. For instance, for an ICT product used in  a not-for-profit, non-political organization, threats agents are unlikely to be criminal  organizations with sophisticated means of attack (see next section).  The threat agents applicable to an ICT product therefore depend on the operational  environment and the final use to which the product is put. Such information can only be  provided by the organization or the sector using the ICT product, and is typically an output of the  sectoral and organizational risk assessment.  Member state agencies tasked with cyber defence frequently provide briefings and threat  landscape overviews on currently occurring threats to selected sectors, for example, those with  organizations that are part of a critical infrastructure. Other means of obtaining this information  are through the membership in ISACs (Intelligence Sharing and Analysis Centres)11 as well as  community-driven and commercial providers of threat intelligence.  Note that the exclusion of threat agents is usually one of the assumptions made concerning the  operational environment (see Subsection 7.4.2).  7.4.1.5 Attack means  Means of attack include all the hardware and software tools and techniques that a threat agent  could use to attack an ICT product, such as, for example, lasers, electromagnetic probes or  binary editors.  As is the case for threat agents, not all attack means are relevant and related threats can be  excluded depending on the context in which the ICT product is used. For instance, for an ICT  product not physically accessible by any attacker, all threats based on attack techniques  requiring physical access to the ICT product do not apply.  Note that attack means are closely related to the expertise, the financial resources and the  privileges of the threat agent.  As for threats agents, the means of attack applicable to an ICT product depend on the  operational environment and the final use of the product, which can only be provided by the  organization or the sector deploying the ICT product. Such information is typically an output of  the sectoral and organizational risk assessment, as well as forensic investigations of previous  incidents which are shared among stakeholders, for example in the context of an ISAC.  Note that exclusion of attack means is usually part of the assumptions made concerning the  operational environment (see Subsection 7.4.2).  7.4.2 Assumptions  The context in which of an ICT product is used can allow the mitigation of some threats when  counter measures cannot be implemented in the ICT product itself, for various reasons (e.g.  technical, financial, human). For instance, the administrator of an ICT product must be trusted  as no counter measures can fully prevent malicious actions by a user with high-level privileges.  11 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Sharing_and_Analysis_Center  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Sharing_and_Analysis_Center  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  78  The definition of assumption is mainly based on the outputs of risk assessments. This includes,  in particular, the list of security measures implemented by the operational environment and that  are essential to the security of the product.  Note that the list of such security measures may originate from security requirements stipulated  by the ICT product developer.  7.4.3 Organizational Security Policies  Organization security policies are implementation requirements for an ICT product or for its  operational environment. These policies specify some aspects of the implementation of the ICT  product or its operational environment. For instance, a policy could specify which algorithm is to  be implemented to allow the interoperability requirement from a sector or to fulfil a national  regulation.  Typical organizational security policies express requirements from national or sectoral  regulations, standards to be followed, accreditation and certification to be obtained, etc.  The definition of security policies can originate from different needs such as national  regulations, sector requirements for interoperability, etc. All these are usually identified by risk  assessment.  7.5 MAPPING TO ASSURANCE LEVELS  For the assessment of ICT products based on ISO 15408, Evaluation Assurance Levels (EALs)  need to be defined. No formal methodology to determine this assurance level has been defined.  However, in practice outputs from risk assessments used to determine such assurance levels  include the list of unwanted events (see 7.4.1.2), an estimation of the impact each event may  have and the likelihood of each event occurring. Annex C provides examples of the information  to be provided to assess the risk and determine the level of assurance.  These inputs are part of those required for the establishment of the CSA meta-risk class defined  in Section 5.3. Details about the relations between the risk assessment items used to establish  the assurance level and CSA Meta-Risk classes are shown in Subsection 5.6.9.  A mapping between the Common Assurance Reference (CAR) and the EALs defined in  ISO/IEC 15408 is provided in Chapter 5.6.5.  7.6 MAPPING TO SECURITY LEVELS  For ICT product assessment based on ISO 15408, a security level concept is not defined.  However, the choice of security features (similar to security controls) during the security  definition of the ICT product is commonly based on the outputs of risk assessment , such as  unwanted events, the evaluation of the impact of each event and the likelihood of an event  occurring, as well as the ICT product architecture and related potential of known vulnerabilities.  As shown in Subsection 5.5.3, this methodology also includes the attack potential as a  parameter.  Annex C. provides examples of the information to be provided by risk assessment for  determining the security level.  Those inputs are part of those required for the establishment of the CSA meta-risk class defined  in Section 5.3. Details about the relations between the risk assessment items used to establish  the security level and CSA meta-risk classes are shown in Subsections 5.5.3 and 5.6.9.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  79  8. DEFINITION AND APPLICATION  OF COMMON CONTROLS  8.1 OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND  In general, the CSA promotes a proactive approach to implementing security. Security-by-  design is proposed as a way to put this in place.  In the context of cybersecurity certification, the CSA stipulates that the security and certification  requirements for ICT services, ICT products and ICT processes and the related assurance  levels should be identified based on the risk associated with their intended use. In addition, the  CSA requires that certificates should reference technical controls [CSA, Art. 52.4] and that these  should be documented for each assurance level [CSA, recital 86].  8.2 COMMONLY USED CONTROLS  The consistent definition of risk, security and assurance is a key part of the SCSA Methodology.  Chapter 5 documents how a default relationship between the common assurance reference  level and common security levels can be established by using the meta-risk classes and attack  potential as joint reference points. This addresses the CSA’s requirements described in Section  8.1. Section 5.5 describes how the concept of common security levels can be used to define  controls in accordance with their capabilities to mitigate certain levels of risk and attack  potential. On this basis, there is now the option to define and deploy controls, which are scaled  according to the CSL concept, in a way that is common across sectorial domains and the  supporting ICT systems, ICT products and ICT processes.  This option for a common, cross-sector use of controls suggests that a set of controls for  common use should be defined. Such a set of controls:  ‒ could serve as reference for the introduction of security-by-design,  ‒ could reduce the time-demand and cost of development, implementation and testing of  ICT systems, ICT products and ICT processes,  ‒ could significantly reduce the evaluation effort for the supported ICT systems, ICT  products and ICT processes, as a set of controls could be integrated in the form of a  certified product.  In the long run, developing and deploying certified libraries of controls for common use could  improve security and assurance across sectors and at the same time reduce the cost and risk of  development and implementation.  Further benefits could arise when combining common controls with the scalability provided by  the common security levels described in Section 5.5. Two examples are described in the  following two paragraphs.  8.2.1 Introducing common security levels to ISMS  When deployed in the ISMS of sectoral stakeholders, scaled CSL-enabled controls which are  defined as a result of the assessment of sectoral risk and attack potential could introduce a  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  80  defined and appropriate level of security to certain functions of the ICT system, a feature which  is currently not supported by the ISMS-standard series ISO/IEC 270xx.  8.2.2 Concatenating controls  As described in Subsection 5.5.3, it may be necessary to protect against a certain attack  potential or risk by developing the common security level required to mitigate the certain level of  this attack or risk using a well-defined combination of concatenated controls. Such cases are  quite common where parts of the ICT system provide limited options to deploy controls with  elevated CSL. An example could be a low-cost IoT device where elevated CSL and CAR would  be unaffordable but where, at the same time, an elevated risk or attack potential applies.  Another common case could arise from third-party devices, which are intended to be integrated  into the sectoral system, but where there is an option for adapting the CSL or CAR to the  necessary levels.  Such concatenation of controls should be discussed and documented during the sectoral risk  assessment and treatment conducted by the ad hoc working group that supports the  preparatory phase for drafting a sectoral candidate scheme. If a set of concatenated controls is  to be implemented across various ICT products, ICT processes and ICT services, it is essential  that all involved stakeholders are well informed. Examples for concatenated controls are given  in Section 8.4.  8.3 SAMPLE LIST OF COMMON CONTROLS  Generating an exhaustive library of common controls would have exceeded the scope of the  project for developing this methodology. Instead, there is now an indicative list of samples that  can be used to demonstrate the principle for scaling controls according to the CSL structure and  their application in sectoral ICT systems, ICT subsystems within ISMS, in ICT products and in  ICT processes. This list of indicative examples is given in Annex F.  8.3.1 Terminology  According to the methodology, the selection of controls would be based on information  generated by an ISO/IEC 270xx-based sectoral risk assessment. Therefore, the terminology  used for the definition of controls follows ISO/IEC 270xx.  8.3.2 Definition of controls and assigning the common security level (CSL)  As described in Section 5.5, the definition of controls will follow the principle described in  ISO/IEC 27002. One or more control objectives will be defined to address a certain risk. In a  next step, controls that support these control objectives are defined. There may be several  controls for each control objective and these may vary depending on the targeted component  (ICT product, ICT process or ICT system), on the market, technology etc.  To establish a common set of controls it would probably make sense to reuse control objectives  from ISO/IEC 27002 or define new control objectives which could be employed across sectors.  The association of a control with a particular CSL should be based on an estimation of the  attack potential (AP) that the control could resist. The characteristics defined for the description  of attackers and the estimation of attack potential given in Chapter 9.4 provide guidance on  performing this categorization.  8.4 EXAMPLES OF THE COORDINATED APPLICATION OF CONTROLS  A coordinated application of controls enables a common security level to be increased by  introducing several controls at a lower level. The idea is that a combination of two or more  controls at CSL x can lead to an overall CSL greater than x for the system. In the following  example scenarios, the CSLs listed in the tables are sometimes lower than the overall targeted  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  81  CSL for the system. The idea is to show two scenarios, one with a hardened secure processing  environment in the mobile phone at the targeted system CSL and one for a mobile phone with  lesser capabilities but ‘compensating’ backend support.  8.4.1 Example use case ‘Mobile device based authentication system’  Mobile phones are a constant companion in everyday life and are increasingly used in solutions  where more traditional methods might have been deployed, in, for example, controlling access  to buildings.  1. Area of usage  ‒ Corporate building or site access control,  ‒ Managed shared building or site access control,  ‒ Public transport.  2. Adversary  Depending on the site, building, or company’s assessment of risk, the required CSL can  take any level from 1 to 5.  3. Control objectives and examples for concatenating controls  The use case described does not address all security aspects and functions. Instead, this  example centres on controls used to store and process access credentials in a mobile  phone. The minimum security functionalities in the mobile phone features include trusted  product identity, secure communication support, secure storage and secure processing of  cryptographic functions. For simplicity, these are summarized under the control objective  mobile phone access control support features.

CYBERTHREAT INTELLIGENCE  Cyberthreat intelligence - the study of adversaries and their techniques, tactics and procedures -  can provide an important contribution to a risk assessment process. Being a relatively new field,  this chapter provides a brief introduction into threat intelligence, as well as some discussion how  information of threats can be used for risk assessment and treatment.  9.1 WHAT IS THREAT INTELLIGENCE?  In order to effectively defend yourself, you have to understand what threats you might be  potentially facing and how they operate. Consider the example of a shop keeper who would like  to protect the business against a burglary. In order to confidently invest into security, the shop  keeper needs to know how burglaries would typically take place, such as would robbers pick the  lock or smash the window, and then use this knowledge to, for example, invest in a better door  lock in lieu of bars in front of the shop window. Although this seems an obvious and natural  strategy in the case of physical security, the same holds true for cyberthreats. Sound  investments into security can only be made given sufficient information about threats.  While characterizing and assessing cyberthreats we know about is already somewhat  challenging, we also need to consider the known unknowns and even the unknown unknowns.  In other words, there are threats we are aware of but have no readily available data at hand to  quantify, and there are threats that we do not even know exist and hence are not part of the  current risk management methodology. The goal of cyberthreat intelligence is to identify and  characterize potential threat actors, exchange information about their tactics, techniques and  procedures (TTPs) and observables, and build a comprehensive view about the cyberthreat  landscape an organization, sector or society is facing.  As such, cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) is a natural complement to an ISO 31000 risk  management process and augments it as shown in Figure 19 in various stages.  First, the operational risk management cycle requires a comprehensive identification of all  potential risk sources. Here, cyberthreat intelligence can supplement insights into threats that  occurred elsewhere but were previously not considered by the organization.  Second, for the analysis and evaluation of cyber risks, CTI can provide information about  whether a particular threat is targeting a particular geographical region or industry and how it  operates, and thus help quantify the likelihood and potential impact of a particular risk.  Third, controls need to be selected to adequately treat a risk. With respect to cyberthreats and  their dynamic behaviour this means that the organization needs to select those controls that  exceed the currently level of capability, otherwise a particular countermeasure is easily  bypassed by an adversary. Here, cyberthreat intelligence can provide insights on current  techniques in use by threat actors and their capability levels.  Finally, by sharing information about the threats faced and past incidents with others in their  sector, organizations can further adapt their control portfolio, deploy new or tune existing  controls, and improve detection by monitoring for specific artefacts known to belong to particular  threat actors.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  85  Figure 19: Interconnection of cyberthreat intelligence with organizational risk management  9.2 WHAT IS A THREAT?  In risk management, the level of risk is typically measured as a function of likelihood and impact,  i.e. risk = likelihood x impact or, more generically, risk = f(likelihood, impact). While this method  works well for non-cyberthreats where a good quantification of frequency and consequences is  available, this is more challenging in case of cyberthreats and especially adversaries that act  intentionally. Here, threats do not remain static but will on the one hand change over time and  on the other hand also change in response to the organization and the measures it takes.  This makes it frequently challenging to determine reliable estimates for these values. We also  have to realize these values are a direct outcome of the interplay between adversary and victim.  Consider again the example of the physical shop: if a burglar intends to break in and existing  controls such as the door lock, security door or safety glass exceed the criminal’s level of  capability, the probability that this threat actor at this particular moment will successfully break in  is zero. If the controls, however, are insufficient and below the adversary’s attack capabilities, a  successful break-in would likely be certain.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  86  Figure 20: Adversaries can be characterized in terms of their means, motives and opportunities  to establish whether they pose a threat to an organization.  Whether or not a particular actor is actually a threat to an ICT system or to an organization thus  depends on the characteristics of the adversary, namely his/her means, motive and opportunity  as shown in Figure 20. An adversary only presents a potential cyberthreat, if the attacker has  the means to execute an attack, the opportunity to do so and exploit a vulnerability, and a  motive to target the victim in question. Threat actors pose no risk if any of the three components  is not present. Examples would be an adversary who would be interested in performing the  attack but does not have the capability to surpass existing controls, or an attacker who has the  capability but does not go after a particular type of victim.  Interestingly, money can substitute for any components under opportunity and motive. For  example, an adversary lacking the necessary capabilities could buy an exploit for a vulnerability  or outsource an attack to more capable cyber mercenaries. Thus, within the context of  intentional cyberthreats, risk thus becomes a function of likelihood, impact and the threat actor.  Cyberthreat intelligence provide insights into the means, motives and opportunities of  adversaries. This includes information about the threat actors, their intentions and past targets  and accomplishments, but also insights into techniques a particular actor has used before and  the tools to which the adversary has been observed to have access. Based on information from  past compromises (or attempts at doing so), CTI also collects information about vulnerabilities  particular actors have exploited in the past and the various modus operandi they have used  previously.  9.3 TYPES OF ATTACKERS  A high-level view of the potential threats to an ICT system is presented in Figure 21. In a  first stage we differentiate between a threat that is the result of a natural cause, such as  flood, tectonic activity or wind, and one that is the result of a person triggering the  vulnerability. Even further, when it comes to human actors, we need to differentiate, for the  sake of cyber defence, between an actor who is unintentionally creating damage and an  actor who has a deliberate intention to cause harm. In the latter case, we typically refer to  the threat actor as an attacker or adversary.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  87  Figure 21: High level decomposition of threats into natural and human causes, as well as  unintentionally and intentionally-acting adversaries.  In the literature of cyberthreat intelligence, lists and taxonomies of cyberthreat actors are still  being developed. Overall most proposal lists identify the following threat actors with specific  motivations and abstract levels of capability:  INTENTIONAL ACTORS  Disgruntled Employees or Insider Attackers are a class of threats with detailed knowledge of  an organization and its systems. Examples of this adversary class are staff, contractors,  vendors, customers, or former employees. While this type of adversary has only medium-level  capability (while of course there could also be insiders with intricate system knowledge and  skills), a complicating factor in this group is that attackers have access to valid credentials, know  about processes and security systems and how to circumvent them. Common motivations for  these attackers are dissatisfaction about the working environment, the organization’s or  industry’s activities, corruption, or revenge.  Cyber Terrorists perform violent activities and sabotage in an attempt to influence public  opinion and decision-making. Although the primary objective of cyber terrorist activities is the  sabotage and destruction of property, these actors are also indifferent or even in support of  creating harm to people and society in general. Cyber terrorists may command significant  resources. The asymmetry between the costs to defenders and offenders in an attack means  that even moderately funded groups can have a significant impact on assets and systems.  Hacktivists / Civil Activists most commonly extract and expose data or disrupt business  operations for ideological reasons or to draw attention to a political, social or moral agenda.  While highly motivated, actors in this group are typically non-violent and may draw on external  support in terms of capabilities and resources.  (Organized) Cyber Crime. The shared motivation of the broad spectrum of actors in this class  is the goal of obtaining a financial profit from online criminal activities. Cyber-criminal activities  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  88  span the entire spectrum from coercion and ransom, abuse of e-finance or e-payment services,  malware authoring and distributing, cryptomining, the collection, sale and abuse of personal  data, to the sale of counterfeit goods. By now, a very diverse ecosystem of specialization exists  in the cybercrime underground economy, which means that specialist knowledge, expert tools  or even (parts of) the criminal activity can be outsourced or externally acquired. This effectively  lowers the bar to entry, as attackers with insufficient capabilities and resources can augment  their deficiencies using money, potentially in the form of a cut from the criminal proceeds,  culminating in the emergence of ‘cybercrime as a service’.  Script Kiddies are typically incapable from the perspective of technology, and make use of  externally provided tooling and instructions to perform their activities. Common motivation for  this type of adversary is the interruption of service, often executed through distributed denial-of-  service attacks, with the underlying goal of public recognition or exploration. The frequent lack  of inherent capabilities is often compensated for by outsourcing as, for example, tooling or even  attacks themselves can be acquired via the criminal underground at a trivial cost.  State-Sponsored Attackers / Government Spies operate to obtain access to privileged  information, such as intellectual property, business plans, roadmaps, personnel or customer  data, etc. as well as insight into business operations and upcoming decision-making or to  establish a foothold in systems in order to achieve future objectives. This information is used to  gain an edge in negotiations, predict future activities or ascertain likely responses. Frequently,  these actors are in direct contact with commercial entities in their respective countries to deliver  information that could be used for a commercial advantage. Their activity is driven by ideology  and personal gain, and they are a potent attacker as they can command government resources  and have an advanced set of skills and capabilities.  Competitors / Commercial Industrial Espionage Agents try to gain a commercial advantage  through the theft of intellectual property, documentation on business operations and decisions  or customer data.  They may also damage the targeted organization by modifying or destroying  business information. If not executing these activities themselves, they often outsource them to  cyber mercenaries, highly trained specialists with sophisticated tooling who pursue offensive  cyber activities for profit.  Cyberwarriors / Individual Cyber Fighters are patriotically motivated types of actors, who are  not on a government payroll but operate independently. They may be directly controlled or  influenced by a nation or are individuals or groups of people driven by their political, social,  ethical, or religious values. They may be officially sanctioned or supported by a nation state, and  could be equipped with resources or training by the nation state, which significantly raises their  level of opportunity and means.  Cyber Vandals / Cyber Punks’ main motivation is the destruction of property, driven by the  quest for personal satisfaction and dominance. This group of actors is usually not driven by  ideology, and has a narrow spectrum of capabilities around attacks on availability.  Blackhat Hackers / Crackers try to gain access to systems out of curiosity and personal gain,  which may range from financial rewards from exploiting data, products and systems they obtain,  or in terms of reputation and recognition among their peers. While a highly diverse group of  actors, their capabilities may be highly sophisticated and they may command significant  resources.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  89  UNINTENTIONAL ACTORS  Untrained Employees and Reckless Employees are two types of unintentionally acting  adversaries, who still have the potential to cause harm to the organization. They do not act on a  specifically malicious motivation, but may cause incidents as a result of insufficient knowledge  or negligence of security precautions or procedures in order to attain a (non-malicious) goal. As  these threat actors have valid access credentials, their activities can inadvertently lead to  significant damage.  To date, there is however no universally accepted standard for a threat taxonomy, and new  definitions and proposals for taxonomies are still emerging. Even within the different member  states and EU bodies, there exists a wide variety of how actors are classified. In the threat  landscape reporting of the Netherlands, actors are classified as government, critical, private  citizen with the goal of either espionage, disruption, sabotage, data theft, leak and system  manipulation. In the UK, the classification differentiates criminals, nation-state actors, patriotic  hackers, terrorist groups, and hacktivists.  In addition, across EU agencies, different classification schemes are in use. In 2013, ENISA  defined a taxonomy of 15 actor types characterized in terms of the sector they are active in,  their capabilities and their underlying motives. This model is developed further by this  methodology.  With the major development of the cyberthreat landscape over the past decade, this report  consolidated, refined and enhanced previous taxonomies into the above set of 11 attacker  types, which both reflect the current threat landscape and can be mapped to other taxonomies  in use at member states and EU bodies.  9.4 CHARACTERIZATION OF ATTACKERS  The goal of CTI in sectoral assessment is to provide information about potential adversaries,  their characteristics and resulting attack potential, the assessment of risk, the definition of  controls and the evaluation process. In this section, a generic, abstract method aimed at  achieving these objectives is described, which needs to be customized after further research  into specific scenarios.  In the scheme presented in this document, the information provided by cyberthreat intelligence  serves three purposes:  Firstly, CTI is used to identify the set of actors that are relevant and likely attackers of an ICT  product or system;  Secondly, given their capabilities, means and motives, it defines the security criteria that would  enable a particular product to withstand an adversary; and  Thirdly, it provides input for the evaluation of the product to confirm that these security criteria  are fulfilled and the product can thus be expected to successfully thwart an attack.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  90  Figure 22: 17 characteristics of adversarial motives, means and opportunity  The motives, means and opportunity of an attacker can be characterized in a plethora of  ways, each one capturing a different facet of the abstract, complex concept of a persona  and its interaction with an ICT system or product and the context in which it is used. Figure  22 shows a selection of 17 dimensions towards such characterization:  9.4.1 Area System Access / Knowledge  In order to be presented with an opportunity for an attack, the adversary must gain access  to the ICT system/product/service and have sufficient knowledge to interact with it.  C1 Access/time with the product for attack preparation  Certain types of attacks require extensive preparation with the actual TOE, such as for  obtaining measurements or training models. It has to be assessed whether the  adversary can obtain an equivalent product, that is to be attacked later, for internal  evaluation, and whether there is sufficient time between the acquisition of the specimen  and the time the attack must take place.  C2 Access/time with the product in application context for attack execution  Evaluation as to whether the adversary will be able to gain direct access to the  component to launch the attack, and the maximum timespan of such a potential  interaction with the TOE.  C1 and C2 have an analogous match in window of opportunity and elapsed time in  ISO/IEC 18045.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  91  C3 Knowledge of the TOE  The adversary’s specific expertise with regard to the TOE, such as whether the  adversary can only draw from public knowledge or has access to sensitive information  about the artefact.  This component of CTI has a direct equivalent in ISO/IEC 18045.  9.4.2 Area Vulnerabilities  An attack may only happen, if there is a vulnerability in the component that can be  exploited.  C4 Knowledge of vulnerabilities  Evaluation as to whether the adversary is expected to have knowledge over  vulnerabilities in the system, either obtained through independent investigation or  acquired from a third party  Even if no vulnerability exists or none is known to the attacker, such an opportunity may be  created by an adversary through one of the following ways:  C5 Access to the source or production  Characterization of access to the development and production information about the  TOE and/or the ability to modify it. For example, access to the source code would make  the search for a vulnerability significantly easier. If the adversary could introduce  changes (open source code, support of insiders, compromised tooling etc.) a suitable  vulnerability might be planted.  C6 Ability to access/modify product/components in the supply chain to introduce  vulnerabilities  The identification or introduction of vulnerabilities can also target the supply chain, either  by an attack on raw or intermediate components that will be included in the product or  the ability to intercept and modify products between the warehouse and the deployment  location.  C7 Ability to recruit insiders  Insiders may be corrupted or coerced to cooperate with the attacker, to disable controls  or provide access to the TOE, or development or production components.  9.4.3 Area Capability and Resources  Certain types of attacks require specific assets to be successful. CTI can provide an  estimation of available support in terms of physical assets or monetary funds.  C8 Equipment  Characterization of the type of equipment to which the adversary has access and could  enable him/her to identify and exploit a vulnerability, and an estimation of the volume of  such materials if the duration of an attack can be shortened by parallelization.  This aspect has an equivalent component in ISO/IEC 18045.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  92  C9 Avoidance of visibility  Evaluation as to whether the attacker needs to conduct the operation in a stealthy  manner so that it remains undetected even after completion, and whether he is  concerned that the activities could potentially be attributed to him.  C10 Funds to substitute for lack of components  Short-comings in system access, knowledge, vulnerabilities, capabilities or resources  can be overcome by outsourcing to third parties. Characterization of the funding  situation of the attacker and his willingness to contract out attack components.  9.4.4 Area Skill  To identify vulnerabilities and execute an attack, specialist expertise is needed. CTI can  provide an estimation of the skill level of potential adversaries:  C11 General attack knowledge  Overall expertise and generic knowledge of the adversary in product design,  engineering principles, and attack vectors.  C12 Available methods  Diversity of the portfolio of attack methods available in order to pivot if necessary and  surpass the deployment of stacked controls.  This component may be used for the planning of suitable, complimentary controls in a  defence-in-depth approach. C10 and C11 have a corresponding counterpart in  specialist expertise in ISO/IEC 18045.  9.4.5 Area Valuation  An attack is only likely if the attacker can draw a value out of the activity, for example a  monetary or ideological gain. The characterization of the adversary by CTI provides insight  into the value perceived by adversaries:  C13 Time window to reach goals  Characterization of the time by which the attack has to be finished if it is to deliver value  to the adversary. For example, this could be based on overall duration or external  trigger events.  C14 Derived value  Characterization of the value the adversary is pursuing (if applicable), an estimation of  the monetary gain the adversary might derive from the activity.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  93  9.4.6 Area Goals  The ultimate goal of the adversary determines to a large degree the attack vector used.  Cyberthreat intelligence provides information about intentions, and information about past  behaviour and modus operandi.  C15 Objective  Information about the end goal of the adversary’s modus operandi, such as the  disruption of a service for public consumption or the theft of customer data, is used  towards the planning and correct localization of the controls in the organization.  C16 Legal and ethical limits  Boundaries that constrain the adversaries in their activities, such as a code of conduct  or the limits of law.  C17 Geopolitical context  Geopolitical developments are main triggers of tensions between various types of  stakeholders and are considered to be a strong motive in pursuing mutual attacks  among parties.  9.5 ESTIMATING THE POTENTIAL OF ATTACKERS BASED ON CTI  As discussed above, the purpose of CTI in the SCSA Methodology is to provide information  about potential adversaries and to estimate their attack potential. Section 9.4 proposed  parameters that characterize the opportunities, means and motives of attackers. By rating the  capacities of adversaries based on these parameters, the assignment of an attack potential to a  particular type of attacker will be possible.  The motivation and capabilities of an attacker may vary depending on, for instance, the market  sector and the technology that supports controls. Therefore, the potential of a particular type of  attacker must be identified for each market sector and each supporting asset that could be the  target of an attack. Note that the attacker profile will change over time, necessitating a regular  update of the assessments.  Information on attacker types and attack potential are important contributions at two points in  the methodology proposed in this document:  1. The identification and assessment of risks in the primary asset layer assessment  described in subsection 5.2.7 requires information on the relevant types of attackers. The  focus here is on identifying the potential attackers and on understanding the motives they  may have with regard to the specific sector. All information and characteristics that CTI  can offer to understand the motives (see section 9.4) should be used. In this case, a  generic estimation of the capabilities of the type of attacker may be sufficient.  2. If a sectoral risk is identified, which implies that there are potential attackers with a  significant motivation, there will be a deeper look at the adversaries and the system  components that might be subject to an attack at the layer of assessing supporting assets.  At this stage, a full investigation of relevant attackers and their attack potential will be  conducted. With motives already established in the previous phase, the focus of this  activity mainly lies on the means and opportunities of motivated attackers. The identified  attack potential may serve as input to the definition of security and assurance  requirements of the supporting ICT products, ICT processes and ICT services, and is  applicable both for the evaluation of primary assets as well as supporting assets.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  94  It can very well be that the potential of an attacker varies as a function of the type of ICT  product, ICT processes, ICT service and their intended use.  Chapter 6 describes the steps of the sectoral assessment, which are related to the identification  and application of the attack potential in detail.  To allow ICT product vendors to benefit from the results of the assessment of supporting assets,  it is important to ensure comparability of the relevant parameters with ISO/IEC 15408 and  ISO/IEC 18045 is achieved. These standards are typically used for the definition of products  with regard to security, assurance and evaluation. Chapter 7 and Annex C provide details how  this mapping can be implemented.  The parameter ‘attack potential’ is also used in ISO/IEC 18045 for the purposes of product  evaluation for a specific attack rating. The required characteristics are a subset of those given in  Section 9.4 as C1 to C17. With the full adversarial assessment of means, motive and  opportunity in hand through the method presented, we not only support the sectoral risk  assessment but can also reuse the outcomes to compute the attack potential level as described  in ISO/IEC 18045. This selection is described in further detail in Subsection 9.6.2, and it  ensures that the level of attack potential identified for each supporting ICT product, ICT process  and ICT service is thus comparable to the level used by an evaluator in the vulnerability analysis  of the same components.  9.6 STEPS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CTI-BASED ASSESSMENTS  OF ATTACK POTENTIAL  This section describes methods for the qualitative assessment of attacker potential based on  the characteristics given in Section 9.4 for both scenarios described in the previous section.  Subsection 9.6.1 describes the process for generating attack potential scores for each of the  three adversarial characteristics, means, motive and opportunity. These scores can be  aggregated to create an overall attack potential score for each general type of attacker. It can  be applied to establish the context and to assess the primary asset layer. In addition, with more  detailed information about the supporting asset and its intended use, it can be applied at the  layer for assessing a supporting asset.  Subsection 9.6.2 contains a description for the mapping of cyberthreat intelligence information  to attack potential as defined by ISO/IEC 18045. This will ensure for the assessment of  supporting assets comparability with the concept typically used in product security evaluation.  Until experience has shown that both methods provide consistent results, it is advisable to use  the method described in Subsection 9.6.2 for ICT products which are expected to be evaluated  and certified in an ISO/IEC 15408-conformant scheme.  9.6.1 CTI-based qualitative assessment of attack potential for risk  assessment  Cyberthreat intelligence provides information about attacker capabilities, their modus operandi,  targeted victims, and attack campaigns based on collected observations and interpretation. This  information is usually assembled with respect to specific actors, in other words CTI tracks the  activities and developments of specific adversaries which, when taken together, provide an  insight into the threat landscape a particular organization faces. For the purposes of sectoral  risk assessment, this level of detail is not necessary, and would only add significant complexity  and workload while providing relatively little benefit.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  95  If we consider a particular system to be a likely target of a particular type of attacker, any  existing perpetrator within this class of attacker could be the source of an attack. For  instance, if a sectorial system is a likely target for cyber terrorists, there is little utility in  enumerating the different cyber terrorist groups and their specific capabilities in defence  planning. It would be better to design protections against the capabilities that can be  expected within this particular class of adversaries. This not only simplifies the analysis and  avoids issues of data scarcity, but it is a more realistic assessment of the threat landscape  as adversaries are known to exchange knowledge and tools and to hire expertise from  others when needs arise.  The analysis of attackers and their potential thus begins by collecting evidence on any  actual actors within a specific attacker type, and then aggregating every piece of  information within each category to arrive at an evaluation for the components C1 through  C17 for this particular class.  In summary, the methodology follows the following steps:  1. For the complete list of attacker types, cyberthreat intelligence on the motivations of  attackers is collected. Information about valuation, goals and past targets is used to derive  an attack potential score for each particular type of adversary. The sectoral stakeholders  decide, based on this information, whether an attacker type is deemed a relevant threat  actor for the sectoral system. This information is used in workflow A. For the selected  attacker types, the methodology is then continued.  2. Given the list of relevant attacker types, a body of threat intelligence is assembled,  detailing past attacks and campaigns, the attack vector and approach used, and the  means used to create an compromise by a perpetrator belonging to this attacker type. An  analysis of each group of specific threat actors within an attacker type is not necessary, as  it can be assumed that the capabilities and opportunities available to one type would also  be attainable by another group of actors of the same type. The data collected should span  a multi-year timeframe to avoid individual campaigns skewing the data and biased  reporting and to allow sectoral stakeholders to not only evaluate current capabilities and  opportunities but also to attempt an extrapolation into the near future. The extrapolation  should assess the expected progression in attack potential until the next application of the  methodology and the completion of a re-assessment and an update.  3. All reporting related to threat actors of a particular attacker type is analysed and the  characteristics of this general attacker type are scored with respect to the criteria named  below. This delivers an estimation of the characteristics C1 through C17 for each selected  attacker type. Each characteristic contains the levels low, medium and high, which are  characterized by specific features. The scoring for each characteristic C1 through C17  should be assigned the highest level value occurring when assessing the applicable  criteria, i.e. if 2 out of 2 criteria for level low are met, 1 out of 2 for level medium, and 0 out  of 2 for level high, the overall value for this criteria shall be medium. When different  attacks, known from CTI, exhibit different levels, for example, three attacks used a medium  level while the same actor employed different techniques in a fourth campaign that would  be associated with the high level, the actor type is ranked as high as this level has already  been attained.  4. The outcome provides aggregate attack potential scores for the three aspects, means,  motive and opportunity, as discussed in Subsection 9.6.1.1, which can be further  aggregated using the techniques in Subsection 9.6.1.2 to a general attack potential level  for this particular attack type. Subsections 9.6.1.1 and 9.6.1.2 also provide justification and  motivation for the aggregation method and fusion of the individual scores.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  96  AREA OPPORTUNITY  An attack may only happen if there is a vulnerability in the supporting asset that can be  exploited. To quantify knowledge of the exposure of the system, as well as the potential for  exploitable vulnerabilities, seven characteristics are used to assess adversarial opportunity.  C1: Access/time with the supporting asset for attack preparation  Certain types of attacks require extensive preparation with the actual supporting asset, such as  for obtaining measurements or training models. It has to be assessed whether the adversary  can obtain a product that is equivalent to the product that will be attacked later for internal  evaluation, and whether there is sufficient time for that evaluation between the acquisition of the  specimen and the time the attack must take place. The level for this characteristic should be  assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low  • Supporting asset is publicly available for purchase and/or provided to users as part of  service.  • It is estimated that the attacker takes less than 2 weeks to identify an attack vector / exploit,  and develop it.  Medium  • Supporting asset is only sold after the vetting of customers and their use case. Delivered  products are not expected to be tracked over their lifetime.  • It is estimated that the attacker takes more than 2 weeks but less than 4 months to identify  an attack vector and exploit, and to develop it.  High  • Supporting asset is available only to selected customers, substantial efforts are needed to  obtain a sample.  • It is estimated that the attacker takes more than 4 months to identify an attack vector /  exploit, and to develop it.  C2: Access/time with the supporting asset in application context for attack execution  Evaluation as to whether the adversary will be able to gain direct access to the supporting asset  to launch the attack, and the maximum timespan for such a potential interaction with the  supporting asset.  C1 and C2 have an analogous match in the window of opportunity and elapsed time in  ISO/IEC 18045. The level for this characteristic should be assigned the value of the highest  applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • Attacks are targeted at Internet-connected assets without (by default or by access) industry- standard authentication, providing for an unlimited window of opportunity.  • Operational tempo is regularly high as attacks are quick to execute.  Medium • Attacks are targeted at assets not connected to the Internet, but the exploit can be delivered  by pivoting through assets that are connected to the Internet (lateral movement).  High • The campaign is targeted at assets which are not internet-connected directly and are not  pivoted via Internet-connected assets (air-gapped).  • Exploitation requires physical access, using either accomplices or unknowingly infected  insiders for installation and/or execution.  • Operational tempo can vary from low to high but time horizon, including attack preparation,  is long due to complexity of the attack.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  97  C3: Knowledge of the supporting asset  The extent of the adversary’s specific expertise with regard to the supporting asset, such as  whether the adversary can only draw on public knowledge or has access to sensitive  information about the artifact. This component of CTI has a direct equivalent in ISO/IEC 18045.  The level for this characteristic should be assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • Knowledge required for the execution of attack(s) is sourced from generally available  sources on the Internet or other open sources.  • When knowledge is sourced from documents leaked from restricted, sensitive and critical  sources, it should also be considered public.  Medium • Knowledge required for the execution of attack(s) is sourced from restricted sources (e.g.  code repositories of closed development communities).  High • Knowledge required for the execution of attack(s) is sourced from sources only available to  the developer/manufacturer of the supporting asset. According to CTI, the attacker is likely  to have had access to inside sources to obtain this supporting asset.  • Knowledge required for the execution of this campaign is sourced from highly restricted  sources, only available to staff from the developer of the supporting asset, on a need-to- know basis.  • According to CTI, the attacker likely had access to inside sources to obtain knowledge of the  supporting asset. As opposed to sensitive, the knowledge obtained of the supporting asset  is information about the security and actual vulnerabilities of and threats to critical parts of  the supporting asset.  C4: Knowledge of vulnerabilities  Evaluation as to whether the adversary is expected to have knowledge of vulnerabilities in the  system, either obtained through independent investigation or acquired from a third party. The  level for this characteristic should be assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • The adversary has been observed to exclusively use publicly disclosure vulnerabilities in  their activities.  Medium • The adversary has been shown to and can be expected to adopt new vulnerabilities after  public disclosure, and active deployment will be faster than the median turnaround time in the  defender’s vulnerability management process.  High • The adversary is able to create vulnerabilities and introduce them into the product or  service.  • The adversary has been shown to have knowledge of zero-day vulnerabilities, targeted  specifically towards organizational assets.  C5: Access to the source or production  Characterization of access to development and production information about the supporting  asset and/or the ability to modify it. For example, access to the source code would make the  search for a vulnerability significantly easier. If the adversary could introduce changes (open  source code, support of insiders, compromised tooling etc.), a suitable vulnerability could be  planted. The level for this characteristic should be assigned the value of the highest applicable  criteria:  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  98  Level Criteria  Low • Product uses open source code, which the adversary may inspect for vulnerabilities and/or  introduction of vulnerabilities.  • Hardware design may be obtained from inspection of the supporting asset, software can be  extracted at C8 Medium level from the product.  Medium • Product uses open source code for security- or mission-critical functionality, which the  adversary may inspect for vulnerabilities and/or introduce vulnerabilities.  High • Adversary has access to the production facility and can introduce changes to the supporting  asset.  • Adversary has single or sustained access to the source code and/or hardware design of the  supporting asset.  • Adversary has the capability to take over maintenance of an open source code repository.  C6: Ability to access/modify supporting asset in the supply chain to introduce  vulnerabilities  The identification or introduction of vulnerabilities can also target the supply chain, either by an  attack on raw or intermediate components that will be included in the supporting asset, or the  ability to intercept and modify products between the warehouse and the deployment location.  The level for this characteristic should be assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low No capability to interfere with the supply chain  Medium • Adversary can exchange and modify product during transport and storage before it is  delivered to the customer, prior to an inspection before deployment.  High • Adversary can maliciously influence the design process, the use of protocols, algorithms,  cryptographic primitives and/or configurations.  • Adversary can modify the tooling used during design, development, production,  implementation or testing, to introduce changes or hide past modifications to the supporting  asset.  C7: Ability to recruit insiders  Insiders may be corrupted or coerced to cooperate with the attacker, disabling controls or  providing access to supporting assets, or development or production components. The level for  this characteristic should be assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • Adversary would recruit the services of an insider if offered the opportunity, but not actively  seek out insiders.  Medium • Adversary can be expected to try to proactively recruit insiders within the victim organization  or business partners as support, using financial compensation and/or release of personal  information to entice insiders  High • Adversary can be expected to try to proactively recruit insiders within the victim organization  or business partners as support, using any kind of means such as financial compensation,  coercion, physical force etc.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  99  AREA MEANS  Certain types of attacks require specific assets to be successful. CTI can provide an estimation  of the support available in terms of physical assets or monetary funds.  C8: Equipment  Characterization of the type of equipment to which the adversary has access to and may use  this to  identify and exploit a vulnerability, and an estimation of the quantity of such materials if  the attack duration can be shortened by parallelization. This aspect has a comparable  component in ISO/IEC 18045. The level for this characteristic should be assigned the value of  the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • Capabilities are sourced from publicly available websites and source code repositories and  do not require tailoring towards the TOE.  • Capabilities are sourced from non-free but otherwise commercially available sources (e.g.  commercial/professional-grade penetration test suites).  Medium • Capabilities are custom-developed involving experts from multiple domains (assembly  developers, reverse engineers, payload delivery developers).  • The capabilities observed are not generally available and only available to restricted  communities (law enforcement, intelligence) or through illegitimate means (dark web).  • In the observed attack(s), the attacker exploited a non-targeted zero-day (potentially  affecting multiple unrelated organizations).  High • Capabilities are custom-developed involving experts from multiple domains (assembly  developers, reverse engineers, payload delivery developers).  • In previously observed attack(s), the attacker exploited a zero-day vulnerability specifically  targeting this organization’s assets.  • Capabilities deployed in this campaign were kinetic, aiming to physically destroy target  assets.  • Development of the capabilities required testing on and actual possession of the affected  assets.  C9: Avoidance of visibility  Evaluation as to whether the attacker needs to conduct the operation in a stealthy manner so  that he/her remains undetected even after completion, and whether he/her is concerned that the  activities could potentially be attributed to him/her. Adversaries will be more sophisticated the  greater the concern they have for avoiding visibility, as well as if they have the means to  conduct attacks generating minimal visibility. The level for this characteristic should be assigned  the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • Adversary has little concern to be publicly attributed with the attack. Past activities by this  actor might be well known publicly and documented.  • Adversary relies on commonly known tools, techniques and tactics for a compromise, that  are well documented and observable using state-of-the-art defences  • Adversary has little concern to be publicly attributed with the attack, nor to obfuscate his  activities.  Medium • Adversary uses various means to hide origin of and responsibility for the attack using, for  example, technical means such as proxies, onion routing, compromised intermediaries to  launch and conduct activities, as well as means for hiding the flow of funds with respect to  the financing of the attack and its proceeds.  • Adversary outsources the attack to a third party or proxy as a means of hiding his own  involvement.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  100  Level Criteria  High • Adversary makes significant efforts to avoid detection by, for example spreading out the  attack in time and space using multiple vantage points for the attack and reducing the  momentary intensity.  • Adversary has the ability to develop and/or uses custom tooling that is not widely known and  available to defenders. Tools may be adapted between attempts and victims to avoid  detection.  • Adversary has to expect consequences such as public shaming, retaliation, sanctions and  intensive law enforcement actions if his involvement is detected.  C10: Funds to substitute for a lack of components  Short-comings in system access, knowledge, vulnerabilities, capabilities or resources can be  resolved by outsourcing to third parties. Characterization of the funding situation of the attacker  and his willingness to contract out attack components. The level for this characteristic should be  assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • The adversary has insufficient funds to outsource attacks to specialized third parties, and  has previously not been observed to buy system access, knowledge, vulnerabilities or other  resources used in an attack.  Medium • Expenditures required to overcome short-comings are significant with respect to the total  turnover of the adversary or the expected proceeds from an attack.  High • The adversary has sufficient funds to outsource and buy in capabilities from third parties,  either based on expected/past proceeds of the attack or internal or external funding.  • Cost of acquiring support is minor given the overall budget and financial capability of the  actor.  • The adversary has a strong non-monetary motivation so that a negative return on  investment for this attack or for entire campaigns is acceptable.  C11: General attack knowledge  Overall expertise and generic knowledge of the adversary in product design, engineering  principles, attack methods. The level for this characteristic should be assigned the value of the  highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • The adversary relies exclusively on publicly known and well understood attack vectors, for  which existing tools may already be available.  Medium • The adversary has the ability to adopt and modify attacks, which requires moderate domain  knowledge or system expertise.  • The adversary has command over a portfolio of potential attack vectors, and is able to  deploy several of these to accomplish the desired objective. Using these the adversary is  able to circumvent or react to basic information security controls.  High • The adversary is expected to derive new attack vectors, which were either not observed  before and are potentially unknown to the targeted organization, vendors or other  stakeholders.  • The adversary can draw on advanced knowledge in multiple domains, such as software  engineering, networking, system architecture, hardware, or the target’s subject domain.  • The adversary has command over a portfolio of potential attack vectors, and has the ability  to adapt and/or innovate them to accomplish the desired objective. The adversary is able to  circumvent or react to medium level information security controls.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  101  C12: Available methods  Diversity in the portfolio of available attack methods available in order to pivot if necessary, and  surpass the deployment of stacked controls. This characteristic may be used for the planning of  suitable, complimentary controls in a defence-in-depth approach. C11 and C12 have a  corresponding counterpart in specialist expertise in ISO/IEC 18045. The level for this  characteristic should be assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • Tactics and procedures observed in this attack(s) do not require specific expertise,  experience or specialization towards the supporting asset.  Medium • Tactics and procedures deployed are common and/or regularly observed in industry  reporting.  • Targeting of widely/commonly used software, exploitation of known vulnerabilities using  known, detectable malware code.  High • Tactics and procedures require several years of industry experience and expertise, or highly  specialized training (stealth exfiltration of sensitive data, spear phishing critical employees).  • Custom development of tools instead of simple copying.  • Exploitation of industry- or organization specific or tailored software, tactics and procedures  involving the targeting of personal or home devices of critical employees. Delivery of  implants via tampered devices  • Tactics and procedures deployed require the sustained involvement of multiple experts due  to the deep familiarity required for the exploitation of target systems (e.g. combining novel  delivery vector with novel deception TTPs to remain undetected).  • Tactics and procedures deployed include specialized malware.  • Tactics and procedures deployed include supply chain attack vectors (tampering firmware to  include a backdoor, or inserting counterfeited hardware into the supply chain).  AREA VALUATION  An attack is only likely if the attacker can obtain value from the activity, for example a monetary  or ideological gain. CTI’s characterization of adversaries provides insight into how adversaries  perceive value.  C13: Time window to reach goals  Characterization of the time window during which the attack must be finished to deliver value to  the adversary, based on overall duration, for example, or external trigger events. The level for  this characteristic should be assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • The attack has to be planned, executed and the results used in a very short amount of time.  • Assets that might be stolen have only a utility window of a few days before expiry or public  release of the information devaluates it.  Medium • Attack might require significant preparation and time for execution, but obtainable assets  can be monetized within a short time frame, and/or hold their value for weeks or longer  High • Obtainable assets have a validity exceeding months or may hold value permanently.  • The adversary can modify technology or organizational processes to maintain a long-term  foothold in the organization. This would shorten the time needed to access perishable  assets.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  102  C14: Derived value  Characterization of the value the adversary is pursuing and/or, if applicable, an estimation of the  monetary gain the adversary might obtain from the activity. The level for this characteristic  should be assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • Obtainable assets in a compromise will be of minor economic value for each compromise  and will not exceed the adversary’s cost and effort in realising the attack. A positive return  on investment is realised by replicating the attack across many victims.  Medium • Assets obtainable from even a single attack will clearly exceed the cost and effort needed to  implement the attack. A positive return on investment is very likely.  High • Assets obtained from the compromise will provide a significant technological advance or  competitive business advantage to the opponent and/or the economy of the adversary.  • The attack will significantly weaken the ability of the victim to maintain its operation and  conduct business or significantly reduce its ability in the future.  • The adversary is not required to derive economic value from its activities. The adversary  might not be funded by the proceeds from the attack and/or its value is related to other  aspects such as geopolitical factors, social issues, moral agendas, or personal motives.  AREA GOALS  The ultimate goal of the adversary determines to a large degree the attack vector used.  Cyberthreat intelligence provides information about intentions as well as information about past  behaviour and modus operandi.  C15: Objective  Information about the end goal of the adversary’s modus operandi, such as the disruption of a  service for public consumption or the theft of customer data, is used in the planning and correct  localization of controls in the organization. The level for this characteristic should be assigned  the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • Unguided destruction of property, driven by a quest for personal satisfaction and dominance  • Compromise is creating major public exposure on the victim organization, and/or gain in  reputation for the perpetrator  Medium • Attack is used as a platform for the communication of a political/social/moral agenda  • Theft or modification of general information assets that provide a significant economic  advantage to the adversary  High • Theft or modification of intellectual property and information assets critical to the  organization and/or of high value to the adversary and the adversary’s economy  • Damage and destruction of the victim’s infrastructure and the services it provides  C16: Legal and ethical limits  Boundaries that constrain the adversaries in their activities, such as a code of conduct or the  limits of law to which the attacker adheres. The level for this characteristic should be assigned  the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • Victim organization is universally recognized as protected by international law or  agreements such as the Hague Conventions, for example medical services and  infrastructure. The attacker type wants to avoid the risk of being associated with the  consequences of his actions.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  103  Level Criteria  Medium • Adversaries hired as executing proxies by the perpetrator, which may operate without or  ignore legal and ethical limits  • Vector, modus operandi and targeted victim will make it unlikely that the attack can be  traced back to the perpetrator, which is otherwise bound by limits and fear of public  exposure  High • Actor groups operating without restraint and consideration of international treaties, such as  cyber terrorists, cyber anarchists, individual cyber fighters, organized cyber criminals  C17: Geopolitical context  Geopolitical developments are main triggers of tensions between various types of stakeholders  and are considered to be strong motives in provoking mutual attacks among rival parties. The  level for this characteristic should be assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low no (geo)political motivation observed  Medium no (geo)political motivation observed  High • Attack on the victim occurs within the context of or as a proxy for aconflict between states.  • Targeted organization provides adversary with the ability to completely or largely disable  infrastructure and systems regarded as critical infrastructure  9.6.1.1 Calculation of Attack Potential Level for each category  a) Opportunity  The characterization of Opportunity refers to the use of the component ‘system access /  knowledge’, i.e. whether the information asset is sufficiently exposed to the adversary for a  compromise to take place. It also refers to using a component ‘vulnerability’, i.e. whether  there exist weaknesses that the adversary might take advantage of in the attack.  Vulnerabilities can be inherent to the design and only known to the adversary or be  explicitly planted by the adversary to realize an attack.  To compute the APL of Opportunity, the following principle applies:  ‒ The level of vulnerability is equal to the maximum level of C4, C5, C6 and C7 as  any vulnerability will be exploitable, regardless of how it was made available.  ‒ Attack preparation can either be online or offline, depending on system access  and deployment. The level of system access will therefore be the maximum of C1  and C2.  ‒ Knowledge of the system is a critical component in realising the attack. The  combined score of system access/knowledge is thus the minimum of system  access and C3, as system access without knowledge will be just as ineffective as  a high degree of knowledge without system access.  Based on this reasoning, a combined Attack Potential Level for Opportunity is calculated as follows:  APL_O = MIN [ MIN( MAX(C1, C2), C3) ],  [ MAX(C4, C5, C6, C7) ]  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  104  b) Means  The characterization of Means assesses whether the adversary has the technical  capabilities and equipment to accomplish a particular goal, as well as the required  knowledge to use it towards a compromise. With the wide-spread availability of  ‘cybercrime-as-a-service, even specialist knowledge and equipment can be bought or  hired, hence an unequipped attacker, if provided with sufficient funding (C10)’ would still  pose a relevant threat.  To compute the APL component of Means, the following principle applies:  ‒ The level of technical means and skills is equal to the minimum level of C8, C11,  C12, as all three components determine the severity of a potential approach.  ‒ As a lack of technical means and skills can be overcome through outsourcing or  the hiring of external talent, the overall level of means is increased to the level of  expected external support C10 if it exceeds its own technical competences.  ‒ If the adversary has advanced capabilities and is sufficiently patient so that the  attack can be spread out over time and space, detection and response is further  complicated for the defender. In case component C9 is larger than the result of the  above two items, the overall attacker potential level for Means should be  increased to the next level.  Based on this reasoning, a combined Attack Potential Level for Means is calculated as follows:  APL_Me = MAX [ C10, MIN( C8, C11, C12 ) ]  Given the third principle, an additional adjustment applies. If the score assigned to C9 is  larger than the current value of APL_Me, the Attack Potential Level for the means shall be  rounded up to the next integer.  c) Motive  To compute the APL component of Motive, the following principle applies:  ‒ Timeframe and derived value are counteracting forces. If the value is high but the  time window in which the information asset can be exploited is very short, this  limits the overall value that can be derived. The combined level for value will be  the higher of the two scores C13 and C14, but this may be discounted by one level  if either C13 or C14 is determined to be low.  ‒ The main driving force for goals is adversarial objective, with C16 and C17 only  acting as secondary criteria that only become relevant for select and advanced  attacker types. The level of goals is equal to C15, and needs to be increased to  the maximum of C16 and C17 if these are higher.  Based on this reasoning, a combined Attack Potential Level for Motive is calculated as follows:  APL_Mo = MAX [MAX(C13, C14) - MIN(|C14-C13|, 1) ],  MAX[ C15, MAX(C16, C17) ]  9.6.1.2 Calculation of attack potential level (APL)  From the above calculations, we obtain rankings of low, medium and high for each APL  component for each attacker type. The overall attacker potential level is the arithmetic average  of the sub scores for motive, means and opportunity. For this, we assign an integer value of 1 to  level low, and integer value of 3 to a level medium, and a value of 5 to the level high. The  resulting average is then rounded up to the next integer.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  105  9.6.2 CTI-based qualitative assessment of attack potential at supporting  asset layer  The use of attack potential in a risk assessment involves evaluating potential attackers that may  wish to target the primary functions which are the subject of a sectoral risk assessment.  However, in reality the primary functions themselves are not suitable as targets of attack, as  they are composed of a broad ecosystem of many interlinked and interdependent ICT products,  ICT processes and ICT services. Attackers will instead look to target those individual ICT  products, ICT processes or ICT services which they perceive as being either most critical to the  broader ecosystem or the easiest to attack.  As described in Chapter 6 the sectoral risk assessment is a process which moves from sectoral  business objectives, through the primary business functions which help to achieve these, and  on to the individual assets (ICT products, ICT processes and ICT services) which support the  primary business functions. However, the process is also iterative – so that risks to primary  business functions must be re-assessed in the light of assessed risk to the supporting assets  once these have been identified and evaluated. It is proposed that attack potential is taken into  account at the stage of the iterative re-assessment.  The method provides a CTI-based definition of the attack potential at supporting component  level, focusing on the means and opportunity of the attacker in order to support the definition of  security and assurance requirements. This approach is close to the one defined in  ISO/IEC 18045. This ensures consistency with the definitions of attack potential used in  evaluation and assurance and supports comparability.  For this bridging, the subset of criteria that have a direct equivalence in ISO/IEC 18045 are  selected for the estimation of the attack potential for the vulnerability assessment from the  previously prepared cyberthreat intelligence results. Table 9 lists the matches between attacker  characteristics and the corresponding element in ISO/IEC 18045. Table 10 proposes how the  corresponding evaluation criteria based on CTI input is to be set.  Table 9: Summary of CTI criteria for use by the method for the assessment of AP at the product level  CTI Criteria  Type of  criteria  ISO/IEC 18045 rating criteria  correspondence  C1 - Access/time with the product for  attack preparation  Opportunity Part of  window of opportunity and elapsed time  C2 - Access/time with the product in  application context for attack execution  Opportunity Part of window of opportunity and elapsed time  C3 – Knowledge of the TOE Opportunity Knowledge of the TOE  C4 - Knowledge of vulnerabilities Opportunity No direct equivalence but could be part of  knowledge of the TOE  C5 - Access to the source or  production  Opportunity Access to source: part of knowledge of the TOE  Access to production: no equivalence but could  be rated under Window of opportunity and/or  Means (to be studied further)  C6 - Ability to access/modify  product/components in the supply  chain to introduce vulnerabilities  Opportunity No direct equivalence but could be in Window  of opportunity and/or Means (to be studied  further)  C7 - Ability to recruit insiders Opportunity No direct equivalence but could be in Window  of opportunity and/or Means (to be studied  further)  C8 – Equipment Means Equipment  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  106  CTI Criteria  Type of  criteria  ISO/IEC 18045 rating criteria  correspondence  C9 - Avoidance of visibility Means / Motive No equivalence  C10 - Funds to substitute for lack of  components  Means No direct equivalence but could be part of  Equipment (as the price is considered)  C11 - General attack knowledge Means Expertise  C12 - Available methods Means Expertise (related to the use of equipment and  methods)  C13 – Time window to reach goals Motive No equivalence  C14 - Derived value Motive No equivalence  C15 - Objective Motive No equivalence  C16 - Legal and ethical limits Motive No equivalence  C17 - Geopolitical context Motive No equivalence  The table below lists a method to determine an attack potential level based on those CTI inputs  that have an impact on the vulnerability analysis of an ICT product or system and that are to be  considered in the determination of CAR (see Chapter 5.6) and CSL (see Chapter 5.5).  Four groups of attacker characteristics based on these CTI inputs have been determined: the  expertise, the knowledge, the resources, and the opportunity of an attacker to perform an attack.  Each of these groups is associated with four levels of attacker expertise: Layman, Proficient,  Expert and Multi-Expert. Level definitions are for the current version of this document taken  directly from ISO/IEC 18045.  Table 10: Method for estimating AP by applying CTI characteristics relevant to the vulnerability analysis  CTI  characteristics  ISO 18045  equivalence  AP1  Unskilled  AP2  Skilled,  limited  resources  and  opportunity  AP3  Skilled,  significant  resources  and  opportunity  AP4  Highly  skilled,  significant  resources  and  opportunity  AP5  Highly  sophisticated,  significant  resources and  opportunity  Expertise  C11, C12  Expertise Layman Proficient Proficient Expert Multi-Expert  Knowledge  C3, C4, C5  Knowledge  of the TOE  Public Public Restricted Sensitive Critical  Resources  C5, C6, C7, C8,  C10  Equipment Standard Standard Specialized Specialized Bespoke  Opportunity  C1, C2, C5, C6  Windows of  opportunity  Elapsed  Time  Unlimited /  Easy  Easy Moderate Difficult Difficult  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  107  The method should be applied for those types of attackers that have been identified as relevant  by the assessment of sectoral risk in relation to the particular supporting ICT product, ICT  process or ICT service.  The overall attack potential level assigned to a supporting ICT product, ICT process or ICT  service for a particular attacker type is defined by the highest one selected for a group of  characteristics.  Where there are several motivated attackers, the overall attack potential level assigned to a  supporting ICT product, ICT process or ICT service is defined by the highest level reached by a  relevant type of attacker.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  108  A ANNEX: CONCEPTUAL  APPROACH FOR CONSISTENCY  OF TERMINOLOGY  A.1 BACKGROUND  According to the ISO/IEC JTC1 Directives, Part 2, Clause 16.4, ‘Terms and definitions should  preferably be listed according to the hierarchy of the concepts (i.e. systematic order).  Alphabetical order is the least preferred order.’  Concept approach is described in several international standards related to terminology  developed by the ISO Technical Committee TC37 Language and Terminology.  A fundamental principle for this approach is that one term corresponds to one concept, and only  one concept corresponds to one term in a given domain or subject in a given language.  For this document, relevant terms are defined as follows:  ‒ concept means a unit of knowledge created by a unique combination of characteristics;  ‒ term means a verbal designation of a general concept in a specific domain or subject;  ‒ definition means a representation of a concept by a descriptive statement which serves  to differentiate it from related concepts.  The concept can have its definition but this is not always the case.  Systematic order requires identification of unique concepts and further determining terms which  relate to the concept and provide the necessary characteristics. Characteristics can bind terms  in subsequent levels of dependency, thus creating a hierarchy of terms. Systematic order is  achieved by the proper numbering in the hierarchy of terms to reflect levels of dependency on  the concept (see Figure 23). In standards one can find different styles of numbering that  express the hierarchy of terms (see Figure 24). The only condition is to use the style  consistently.  The style of numbering shown in Figure 23 is used in this document.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  109  Figure 23: Numbering of terms showing dependency on the concept (1. example)  Figure 24: Numbering of terms showing dependency on the concept (2. example)  Minimising the number of concepts is recommended in order to produce a clear picture of the  relationships inside a single concept map and limit cross-relations between concepts.  An excellent introduction to the concept approach is given in JTC1 Standing Document N20  Best practices for IT Vocabulary.  Although the systematic approach has been used in ISO standards for the presentation of  terminology for many years (see, for example, ISO/IEC 9000) it has not been widely applied in  the IT security domain due to its complexity and heritage of old security references. However,  the concept approach can help in understanding the terminology and facilitate interconnection  between different realms of knowledge.  Often terminology is presented in the form of concept mapping, which allows all relationships to  be shown and emphasizes the significant characteristics of the concept. Such will be the form in  this document.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  110  A.2 THE CONCEPTUAL APPROACH APPLIED TO THE 15408-BASED  MODEL OF IT SECURITY EVALUATION  A.2.1 The ‘TOE’ concept preliminary considerations  ISO/IEC 15408-1 presents two high-level models upon which IT security evaluation is based,  i.e. the security model and the evaluation model.  If one concept is to be chosen to describe what IT security evaluation really means then that  would be Target of Evaluation (TOE).  The definition for TOE included in ISO/IEC 15408-1 includes ‘set of software, firmware and/or  hardware possibly accompanied by guidance, which is the subject of an evaluation’.  If we were to analyse the whole set of almost two hundred terms in ISO/IEC 15408 and  ISO/IEC 18045 five essential characteristics of the TOE could be found, i.e. (1) Asset, (2)  Operational environment, (3) Security Problem Definition, (4) TOE Security Functionality, (5)  Vulnerability.  These five principal characteristics form the highest level of systematic order for the TOE.  These characteristics are further explained with the second and third level of terms, if applicable  (see Table 11). Terms relate to each other and, if significant relationships are found, such a  map would be a simple representation of the IT product security evaluation, which is depicted in  Figure 25.  A chosen subset of terminology from ISO/IEC 15408 and ISO/IEC 18045 is sufficient for the  methodology.  NOTE 1: Colours of the nodes presented in the map indicate subsequent levels (L1-L3) of terms  given in systematic order. The same colours are reflected in the table containing terms and their  definitions.  NOTE 2: Terms in blue font contained in the concept map do not have separate definitions in  ISO/IEC 15408-1 or ISO/IEC 18045 for three reasons: a) they have their common dictionary  meaning (e.g. threat), or b) they can be derived from a defined term (e. g. security objective for  an operational environment), or c) two defined terms combined create a new term (e.g.  assurance class). There are no separate levels for such terms,  NOTE 3: Assurance classes indicated in the picture are shown for completeness of the  assurance description. For the simplicity of the concept map, only the vulnerability assessment  class is further analysed.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  111  Figure 25: Concept map for TOE  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  112  A.2.2 Terms in systematic order  Table 11 presents all relevant terms in systematic order. Terms in green represent major  characteristics for the TOE (in red font, the concept).  Table 11: Systematic order for the TOE concept  A.3 THE CONCEPTUAL APPROACH APPLIED TO  ISO/IEC 27001- BASED ISMS  A.3.1 The ‘organization’ concept - preliminary considerations  The concept mapping related to terms used in management standards has been developed by  a special ISO Task Force called the Joint Technical Coordination Group (JTCG) on MSS  [Management System Standards]. This group has developed a conceptual diagram of common  terms and core definitions related to management systems12 (see Figure 26). The map created  by JTCG is built around the concept of an ‘organization.’  12 ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27 internal document  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  113  Figure 26: Concept diagram for common terms and core definitions – JTCG View  Assuming that part of the terminology defined by the JTCG is identical for all MSSs in the ISO  world (including ISO/IEC 27001), terms in the family of ISMS standards have several  relationships through the management system objectives specific to ISO/IEC 27001, i.e. related  to ‘security’. A more detailed concept map relevant to information security risk is presented in  Figure 27.  The concept ‘organization’ has its own definition:  A person or group of people that has its own functions with responsibilities, authorities and  relationships to achieve its objectives.  Note 1 to entry: The concept of organization includes but is not limited to sole-trader, company,  corporation, firm, enterprise, authority, partnership, charity or institution, or part or combination  thereof, whether incorporated or not, public or private.  The same approach as for the ISO/IEC 15408 and ISO/IEC 18045 ‘TOE’ concept applies (see  NOTE 1, NOTE 2 and NOTE 3 in Subsection A.2.1).  A chosen subset of terminology from ISO/IEC 27000 is sufficient for the purpose.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  114  Figure 27: Concept map for 'organization.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  115  A.4 THE CONCEPTUAL APPROACH APPLIED TO ISO/IEC 27001- BASED  ISMS  The relationships between the two concepts discussed earlier (TOE and organization) are built  around risk. It should be noted that the concept of organization leads to the organization’s  information security management system, which in turn, is based on [information security]  objectives. Risk management is dealing with uncertainty on [information security] objectives.  Some of the objectives can be assigned to particular assets (we avoid here a discussion on  assets, their characteristics, relation to business processes), and typically they are defined with  respect to loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability.  If one identifies a risk related to loss of confidentiality or integrity of an asset, and then finds the  level of risk unacceptable compared to risk criteria, one possible option to protect the assets is  to choose controls to mitigate the risk. If a control appears to be an ICT product, it could be  chosen and then implemented based on two criteria set up by the risk owner:  1. specification of [information security] requirements which allow assessed risk related to the  asset(s) to be mitigated,  2. expression of needs related to the confidence that implementation of security functionality in  the product is done correctly and functionality is sufficient.  The developer responds to the first criterion by designing the security functionalities properly. In  that case, the developer performs its own assessment of risk and its treatment leading to the  required security functionality.  The vendor of the product (it could be the developer) responds to the need related to  confidence by setting up security assurance requirements with clearly defined assurance levels  expressing the scope, rigour and depth of the evaluation.  The ICT product, while implemented in its operational environment, mitigates the risk by  protecting the asset(s) as expected. In terms of [information security] objectives, the uncertainty  is controlled by the control (ICT product).  The relationships between the concepts are shown in Figure 28.  Following the guidance given by the developer/vendor, the risk owner may decide to implement  relevant controls to address the risks related to the operational environment of the product. In  that way the risks identified by the risk owner are addressed completely.  The relationships between the concepts that complement the product itself are shown in Figure 29.

METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  119  B ANNEX: GUIDANCE FOR  THE RISK-BASED SELECTION  OF IMPACT CLASSES  Six risk areas are proposed as generally applicable to all sectors. These include impact on  business operations and functionality; citizens; the type of data processed; reputation and trust;  compliance with contractual requirements; and health and life.  Table 13 shows 5 proposed sectoral impact classes (IC1 to IC5) within the 6 risk areas outlined  above. The number of impact classes has been selected to correspond to the 5 levels of the  Common Security Level (CSL) and the Common Assurance Reference (CAR) that are  presented in Subsection 5.5.2 and in Subsection 5.6.5. The risk areas given in Table 13 are not  exhaustive but may be added, or adapted, to meet the requirements of different sectors.  The impact defined for each class with the risk areas must be regarded as the minimum level  that shall be applied by a sector. However, sectors are permitted to increase the impact class  level definition where they feel this is justified. For example, any impact on personal data, in the  risk area concerning type of data processed, shall be assessed at least at IC2. However, the  sectoral stakeholders may consider that this particular factor is of more concern to their sector,  and the impact on personal data should have an impact level of IC3 or higher.  In addition, sectors could decide to create more specific definitions. For example, a sector may  consider that the definition of IC2 in that risk area should instead be: ‘personal data of fewer  than 10 individuals’. Whilst the definition of IC3 in that risk area should be: ‘special categories of  personal data OR personal data of more than 10 individuals’. Sectoral stakeholders are also  free to add additional risk areas to their assessment.  As Table 13 represents minimum requirements, a reduction in impact class is not foreseen. For  example, the stakeholders may not reduce the IC level if loss of life (IC5) has to be assumed as  an impact. Thus, in other words, cell contents may be shifted to the right, but not to the left.

The implementation representation is expected to be in a  form that captures the detailed internal workings of the  TSF.

Sources of information publicly available to identify potential vulnerabilities in the TOE are to  be examined  While examining the evidence provided, the evaluators will use the information in the public  domain to further search for potential vulnerabilities. Where the evaluators have identified  areas of concern, they should consider information publicly available that relates to those  areas of concern.  AVA_VAN.3.3E  Independent, focused vulnerability analysis of the TOE, using the guidance documentation,  functional specification, TOE design, security architecture description and implementation  representation to identify potential vulnerabilities in the TOE, is to be performed.  A focused approach to the identification of vulnerabilities is an analysis of the evidence with  the aim of identifying any potential vulnerabilities evident in the available information. It is an  unstructured analysis, as the approach is not predetermined.  During the conduct of evaluation activities the evaluator may also identify areas of concern.  These are specific portions of the TOE evidence that the evaluator has some reservation  about, although the evidence meets the requirements for the activity with which the evidence  is associated.  4.  The evaluator uses knowledge of the TOE design and operation gained from the TOE  deliverables to conduct a flaw hypothesis to identify potential flaws in the development of the  TOE and potential errors in the method specified for the operation of the TOE.  The following are some examples of the approach a hypothesis may take:  a) consideration of malformed input for interfaces available to an attacker at the external  interfaces;  b) examination of a key security mechanism cited in the description of the security  architecture, such as process separation, hypothesizing internal buffer overflows that may  lead to degradation of separation;  c) search to identify any objects created in the TOE implementation representation that are  then not fully controlled by the TSF and could be used by an attacker to undermine SFRs.  The identification process is iterative, i.e. where the identification of one potential vulnerability  may lead to the identification of another area of concern that requires further investigation.  Subject to the SFRs the TOE is to meet in the operational environment, the evaluator's  independent vulnerability analysis should consider generic potential vulnerabilities under  each of the following headings:  a) generic potential vulnerabilities relevant for the type of TOE being evaluated, as may be  supplied by the evaluation authority;  b) bypassing;  c) tampering;  d) direct attacks;  e) monitoring;  f) misuse.  5.

EXAMPLE 1: SKIPPING OR DOWNSCALING THE ASSURANCE COMPONENT ATE  ISO/IEC 15408 is very broad in its requirements to allow evaluations of a broad range of ICT  products from operating systems to smart cards while giving full guidance to the evaluator. For  specific technologies however, it is possible to condense the evaluation tasks specific to such  technologies. An example is the silicon industry which by default applies strong testing and  validation to their products due to their physical properties and potential defects. Hence,  assurance efforts on functional testing in such schemes can be reduced as the manufacturer  will ensure that his products are functional before delivery.  EXAMPLE 2: DEVIATIONS IN TERMINOLOGY  Another example could be that a scheme, although using the ISO/IEC15408 evaluation  concept, decides to define its own easily understandable security functional requirements  catalogue for the scheme. This catalogue could, for example, be in plain English language and  replace the catalogue of ISO/IEC 15408 Part 2. Although such a scheme would not be  compliant with ISO/IEC 15408, it may deliver the same assurance results as a compliant  scheme while making understandable security claims available to its stakeholders.

This requires that all relevant levels of the ICT market, from sectoral ICT services and systems  via ICT infrastructures to ICT products and ICT processes, will be addressed and that the  related cybersecurity certification schemes are well accepted by the market. The CSA stipulates  specific requirements, which target efficiency and coherence between schemes of the CSA’s  cybersecurity certification framework. These requirements include:  ‒ The security and assurance requirements for ICT services, ICT processes or ICT  products should be defined based on the risk associated with their intended use.  ‒ Assurance levels should be implemented consistently across schemes.  ‒ Support for security-by-design.  The methodology for sectoral cybersecurity assessments described in this document  (hereinafter called SCSA Methodology) addresses these objectives in the context of drafting  sectoral cybersecurity certification schemes, which address ICT services in individual market  sectors. It is designed to be used as a preparatory step for the definition of a candidate scheme  involving sectoral stakeholders.  A basic principle of the proposed methodology is to establish a sound understanding of the  sectoral ICT services and system as a foundation for all other functions:  ‒ A cybersecurity assessment at the sectoral level will provide information about the  objectives of the sectoral stakeholders and will identify the primary assets and related  risks. As an enhancement of the typical risk assessment procedure, a ‘deep dive’ to gain  detailed information about the intended use of relevant subsystems, products or services  will be conducted. In addition, cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) will be employed to provide  information on potential attackers, their motivation and capabilities. This adds an  important parameter to the risk analysis and contributes to the information needed to  assign security and assurance requirements to ICT subsystems, ICT products or ICT  services based on risk.  ‒ The SCSA Methodology provides the option to integrate sectoral, product, process and  potentially also ISMS-based cybersecurity certification schemes. It offers a concept of  internal risk, security and assurance reference levels. If these are commonly used, they  will support consistency in the definition of risk, security and assurance across schemes.  The SCSA Methodology is designed to address a wide range of certification schemes,  beyond Common Criteria or other ISO/IEC 15408-based schemes. Optionally other  types of certification schemes can be integrated in order to establish consistency across  the various types of schemes that support the proposed methodology.  1 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eu-cybersecurity-certification-framework  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eu-cybersecurity-certification-framework  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  7  ‒ A link between the ISO/IEC 270xx series of standards and ISO/IEC 15408 is needed to  allow information to be exchanged between the outcome of risk assessment and the  specification of security and assurance of products. The expert team has developed a  mapping approach that addresses existing divergences of terminology between these  standards and allows the transfer of the information that is required.  ‒ The introduction of a common, scalable approach to risk-based security and assurance  supports the definition of scaled controls. These controls are associated with clear  security levels which are defined in accordance with their ability to treat risk and protect  against known attack potentials. The expert team has drafted a sample list of scaled  controls and has described how these controls can be used in a coordinated way.  Based on these properties and functions, the SCSA Methodology has the potential to fully  support the aforementioned requirements stipulated by the CSA and to promote the market  acceptance of cybersecurity certification in the following ways:  ‒ The SCSA Methodology supports the identification of risk associated with the intended  use of ICT systems, ICT services and ICT processes at any level of the sectoral  architecture. In applying the methodology, relevant stakeholders will be responsible for  the identification of risks and they will be involved in the definition of security and  assurance requirements. This will allow them to balance their view of risks against the  investment needed to mitigate these risks by introducing appropriate levels of security  and assurance. It can be expected that this transparent, cooperative approach will  contribute significantly to the market acceptance of schemes under the CSA.  ‒ As required by the CSA, consistency in the implementation of assurance levels can be  achieved across schemes. This will allow the re-use of certificates issued by one scheme  in other schemes, thus providing an important benefit both to the business interests of  product and infrastructure service providers and to their customers. At the same time,  the methodology’s approach to consistency is also flexible enough to support the  integration of new types of cybersecurity certification schemes, which may emerge as a  result of specific requirements from different markets.  ‒ Introducing a common concept for security levels facilitates the definition of controls  which can be commonly used across participating schemes. This provides a sound basis  for the introduction of libraries of such controls. The availability of those could  significantly promote the introduction of security-by-design, as well as the  implementation of defined security levels in ICT products, ICT processes and also in ICT  systems.  Applying the SCSA Methodology will generate sound information about the sectoral system and  defined relationships between the stakeholders involved, which may enable additional tangible  benefits, including:  ‒ Product and service providers will benefit from reliable information about the intended  use of their products and services, as well as sectoral security and assurance  requirements. This will allow them to optimize their products and their market reach.  ‒ The defined relationships between risk, security and assurance proposed by this  methodology support the definition of horizontal products and services, which can serve  various sectors.  ‒ A sound understanding of the ICT system, the defined roles of the relevant parts and  stakeholders, and the availability of controls with defined properties concerning risk and  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  8  attack potential open new options, especially for sectors that have, for example, to deal  with cost pressures and attackers with an elevated potential at the same time. Based on  this methodology, the deployment of controls may be coordinated and firmly agreed  between stakeholders. For example a basic-level control in an IoT device and a medium-  level control in the sectoral back-office may be concatenated and coordinated in such a  way that they jointly reach a security level that also protects against elevated attack  potentials.  The version of the methodology described in this document is sufficiently mature to allow a first  practical use in drafting sectoral cybersecurity certification schemes. Experience gained from  this first deployment should be used to improve and consolidate the methodology.  In summary, the proposed methodology not only supports the workflow of drafting the CSA  cybersecurity scheme but also offers a potential for a broader use by sectors and providers of  infrastructure.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  9  1. INTRODUCTION TO THE SCSA  METHODOLOGY  1.1 BACKGROUND AND REQUIREMENTS  The European Cybersecurity Act (CSA) stipulates fundamental requirements for the definition,  implementation and maintenance of EU cybersecurity certification schemes. The use of these  schemes is voluntary. Therefore their market take-up, as a prerequisite, requires acceptance by  the ICT industry and the consumers.  The market success of the EU cybersecurity certification framework requires, amongst other  things, a balance to be struck between potentially contradictory requirements, as follows:  1. Flexibility vs consistency  The individual market needs of sectors or product and system vendors may require the  flexibility to establish specific schemes at sectoral level or for certain categories of ICT  services, products and processes. The CSA supports this flexibility.  However, it is also of fundamental importance for market acceptance that certificates  issued by one scheme can be re-used and recognized by other schemes under the CSA.  This requires a well-balanced compromise between flexibility and consistency of scheme  definition and a clear definition of the relationship between schemes under the CSA. The  CSA stipulates that assurance levels should be implemented consistently across sectoral  schemes, which would then support the recognition of certified products, processes and  services by those sectoral schemes.  2. Cost vs benefit of security and assurance  The optimization of investments in security and assurance is a fundamental criterion for  market acceptance by ICT system owners. The CSA supports this requirement by  stipulating that the security and assurance requirements of ICT services, products and  processes should be defined based on the risk associated with their intended use. This  allows an informed decision to be made based on an appropriate balance between the  level of risk that would be acceptable to the risk owners and the cost of security and  assurance.  The implementation of this principle requires that the risk associated with the intended use  of an ICT product or process at sectoral level is understood and that this information can  be used to optimize the security and assurance of the product or process accordingly.  3. High attack potential vs limitations of controls  Some market sectors, for instance those which make use of ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT)  elements, must take account of the pressure to limit costs associated with the mass-  market or the limitations inherent in consumer devices. This may prohibit the deployment  of high-level controls and assurance, despite the fact that highly skilled attackers may be  motivated to conduct attacks against such devices.  There should therefore be a method that helps to identify and document such cases and  which supports the development of appropriate remedies.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  10  The implementation of practical and sound solutions to these questions requires a transparent  methodology. This methodology is introduced in Section 1.2 of this document. Section 1.3  describes how it can be applied in the process of developing a cybersecurity scheme.  A detailed interpretation of the requirements given by the CSA is provided with the  documentation of the methodology in sections 4.1 and 5.1.  1.2 INTRODUCTION TO THE SCSA METHODOLOGY  This document describes a methodology designed to be used in the process of drafting  cybersecurity certification schemes for sectoral ICT services and systems in order to address  the issues mentioned in Section 1.1. It was developed by a cross-functional team of  experienced European ICT experts led by ENISA. The following paragraphs describe the steps  that had to be taken to establish the methodology.  1. Understanding sectoral services and schemes - introduction of a structured  approach to cybersecurity certification schemes  The first step in the development of the methodology was to clarify the types of  cybersecurity certification schemes to be supported and to define the relationships  between these with the goal of enabling the re-use of certificates. For this purpose, the  methodology introduces a layered architecture model that distinguishes between the layer  of sectoral ICT systems, which support sectoral ICT services, the layer of ICT  infrastructures and the layer of generic ICT products and processes. It categorizes the  related types of cybersecurity certification schemes into sectoral, infrastructural, ISMS and  product schemes, and defines the relations between these for the propagation of risk  information, security and assurance requirements and the recognition of certificates.  A typical sectoral ICT system employs:   numerous types of ICT systems which are part of an internal ISMS,   generic ICT products provided by external vendors, and also, very likely   ICT services provided by ICT infrastructures such as mobile networks, payment or  ID services.  It would not be practical to request that a sectoral cybersecurity certification scheme  evaluates and certifies all of these elements. Instead, such a scheme should, for each  individual element, reference, as far as possible, those certificates that have been issued  by any schemes which address those elements. Chapter 4 documents these  considerations.  2. Enabling information exchange between the relevant standards  Sectors typically use a combination of ISMS certification and certified ICT products and  processes for the certification of the required levels of security and assurance for the  sectoral ICT system that enables their ICT services. The risk assessment of information  security and ISMS certification is standardized by ISO/IEC 270xx, while the leading series  of standards for ICT product security evaluation is ISO/IEC 15408. These standards have  different approaches and use different terminology, which makes the transfer of  information and requirements between them difficult.  The CSA stipulates that the definition of security and assurance requirements for ICT  products, ICT processes and ICT services should reflect the risk associated with their  intended use. The identification of this risk is typically conducted at sectoral system level  using an ISO/IEC 270xx-conformant risk assessment. However, the specification of the  security and assurance requirements of an ICT product is typically carried out using  ISO/IEC 15408. Before the development of this methodology there was no link between  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  11  the two standards, which could be used to transfer the information in a defined way. The  specification of ICT products by protection profiles or security targets has to date typically  been based on assumptions by the product vendor or by limited stakeholder groups, not  on input from the sectoral system owner.  As one of the foundations of the methodology, the working-group experts have developed  an approach to analyse and compare the viewpoints and the meanings of terms in  ISO/IEC 270xx and in ISO/IEC 15408. This is documented in Annex A. A comparison of  different meanings in the two groups of standards is given in Section 2.3.  On the basis of  this analysis and comparison, it was possible to develop the method mentioned in the  previous paragraph. This method allows the exchange of the required information between  the sectoral level, which uses ISO/IEC 270xx, and product level specifications based on  ISO/IEC 15408.  Using this innovative approach it will be possible to optimize the development of ICT  products, ICT processes and ICT services by providing information about the precise  security context and needs of the sectors in which the ICT products, ICT processes and  ICT services will be deployed. Sectors can also be sure that they are in a position to  communicate their requirements to the developers and vendors of ICT products, ICT  processes and ICT services, and will be able to check if certified ICT products, ICT  processes and ICT services suit their purposes.  3. Using existing risk assessment methods and cyberthreat intelligence  Balancing the potentially contradictory objectives described in Section 1.1 requires a  sound understanding of the objectives of the sectoral stakeholders, the sectoral system  and the intended use of supporting ICT services, ICT products and ICT processes which  are employed by the sector.  The basis for the required knowledge is established by conducting a risk assessment at  sectoral level. Established ISO-conformant methods such as Ebios RM2 may be used to  identify and document risks from the perspective of the sectoral stakeholders. The  proposed methodology is designed to re-use these existing risk assessment methods, not  to replace or modify them.  However, the targeted purposes require the classical risk assessment methods to be  supplemented by additional elements. The working-group’s proposals for doing this are  described in this methodology.  First, there is a need to document the intended use of  supporting ICT products, ICT processes and ICT services. Second, cyberthreat  intelligence (CTI) should be applied to allow the input of information about attacker types  and their motivation, means and opportunities to attack targeted ICT products, ICT  processes and ICT services. Section 5.3 contains detailed descriptions of how these  additional elements should be used. Chapter 9 provides an introduction to CTI and to the  methods for estimating the potential of attackers.  4. Supporting a flexible definition of risk and consistent implementation of  assurance and security  Chapter 5 describes not just how to apply risk assessment and CTI tools but it also  describes a core part of the methodology, the concept of how to balance consistency in  the implementation of assurance levels and the flexibility to adapt to the individual  requirements of particular markets. The principles behind this concept are documented in  Section 5.1.  2 For an inventory of Risk Assessment and Management Methodologies see:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  12  The CSA defines three assurance levels and stipulates that each assurance level should  be consistent between the sectoral domains. This is essential to avoid fragmentation  between schemes and is a precondition for a broad recognition of certificates issued under  the CSA.  As a first step in identifying a consistent implementation, the expert team defined an  approach, the ‘common assurance reference’ (CAR) concept, which aims at comparability  between implementations instead of full consistency and, by this, allows deviations  between scheme-specific implementations of assurance levels. This supports the flexibility  to follow market requirements and maximizes the options to integrate certificates from  CSA-internal, incumbent Common Criteria and also industry schemes while maintaining a  sufficient level of comparability.  The common assurance reference concept is derived from the AVA_VAN assurance  family, which is the basis for the vulnerability analysis in ISO/IEC 15408-3. The use of  AVA_VAN as a key parameter allows flexibility in comparing implementations of assurance  levels. Moreover, deviations from the standard are allowed as documented in Subsection  5.6.6. This concept would support the integration of certificates which are issued by  schemes that employ the evaluation methodologies defined in ISO/IEC 15408 and  ISO/IEC 18045. This includes EUCC, SOGIS and other CC schemes, and also, potentially,  a variety of industry schemes which re-use parts of ISO/IEC 18045 because of its maturity  and reputation in the market.  Other evaluation methodologies and related certification schemes, including those which  are not related to ISO/IEC 15408, could potentially also be linked to the proposed common  assurance reference concept. This could allow the integration of cybersecurity certification  schemes with different approaches into the cybersecurity certification framework under the  CSA.  The CAR concept supports five levels. These levels can be mapped to the CSA assurance  levels as it is known from the EUCC candidate scheme. The considerations concerning the  common assurance reference concept are documented in Section 5.6. The CAR-concept  can be viewed as the cornerstone of the SCSA Methodology. It is intended to introduce  consistency across sectors and schemes.  The CSA suggests that the definition of security and assurance requirements is based on  risk. This leads to the two other critical features of the methodology, the ‘meta-risk classes’  (MRC) to allow a common approach to risk assessment, and ‘common security levels’  (CSL) to allow a consistent approach to security controls. In the proposed methodology,  each level of common assurance reference (CAR) and common security level (CSL)  corresponds to a particular meta-risk class (MRC). The concept of meta-risk classes and  how they are defined based on risk and CTI information is documented in Section 5.3. The  common security levels and the selection of levels based on the meta-risk class and attack  potential are described in Section 5.5.  This relationship between meta-risk classes and common assurance references and  common security levels satisfies the CSA’s requirement for risk-based assurance and  security and also the requirement for a consistent definition of assurance levels. If applied  in all sectoral scheme drafting projects, it will help suppliers to define generic ICT products,  ICT processes and ICT services, whose certificates can be recognized in all these sectors.  In particular, from a security certification perspective, the common methodology to define  assurance levels allows the comparability of certificates issued by different certification  schemes.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  13  The SCSA Methodology also defines how the assurance level to be claimed for the  certification of an ICT product or ICT product type is determined, and which information,  from any sectoral risk assessment, would be a valuable input for vulnerability analysis.  Then, certificates issued by any certification scheme can be compared based on their  claimed assurance level and be recognized between different sectors in which the certified  ICT product is intended to be used.  However, the requirement for consistency and coherence of schemes under the CSA has  to be balanced with the need for the flexibility that will allow particular schemes and their  evaluation methodologies to be adapted to the requirements of certain markets. The SCSA  Methodology introduces this required flexibility in two ways:  1. The identification of risks and the assignment of these risks to meta-risk classes is  the responsibility of the sectoral stakeholders. Based on their ‘risk-appetite’,  stakeholders from different sectors may select different meta-risk classes for  comparable risks.  2. Sectoral stakeholders may deviate from the defaults for the selection of assurance  and security levels based on meta-risk classes if these deviations are explained  and documented.  It can be concluded that, using the methodology as documented in Chapter 5, it should be  possible to balance consistency and flexibility as required in Section 1.1.  5. Enabling a coordinated application of security controls  According to the CSA, it is the purpose of controls to decrease risk and to prevent  cybersecurity incidents. Therefore control strength, which is defined by this methodology in  relation to common security levels, takes into account not only the risk but also the potential  of motivated attackers to cause an impact. Section 5.5 documents this part of the  methodology.  Based on the common security level concept it should also be possible to develop libraries  of controls scaled according to their common security levels. These libraries could help  product vendors as well as owners of ISMS to implement a well-defined level of security.  They would also provide a practical approach to security-by-design. This would be of  particular help to developers, who are not cybersecurity experts, in the correct  implementation of IT security. An example of such a library, which includes single examples  of controls assigned to common security levels, is given in Annex F.  The use of the methodology set out in this document should generate a sound and  comprehensive understanding of sectoral ICT systems with respect to all aspects related to  cybersecurity risks, controls and assurance. Such systems include all the ICT products, ICT  processes and ICT services deployed, as well as the cybersecurity functionality contributed  by the ISMS implemented by sectoral stakeholders.  In the absence of this methodology ICT product developers and vendors, as well as those  responsible for sectoral ISMS, will be restricted to an understanding only of those  cybersecurity risks and controls implemented in the domains for which they are  responsible. With the support of this methodology, however, they will be able to plan the  provision of cybersecurity controls to a level that is appropriate to the demands of overall  sectoral cybersecurity risk management. As described in the previous section such  planning is vital if, for example, an ICT product imposes limits on the degree to which its  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  14  level of security can be raised, while at the same time an elevated attack potential has to be  assumed.  Based on knowledge of the system as a whole, which can be generated by this  methodology, it should be possible to apply cybersecurity controls in a coordinated and  holistic way. For example, the cybersecurity controls inherent in an ICT product and the  cybersecurity controls implemented within a sectoral ISMS can support each other to gain  the level of security required to manage the overall risk. This concept is termed  ‘concatenation of controls’ and is described in Subsection 5.5.3. An example is given in  Chapter 8. This approach should help to deliver a viable balance between risk and attack  potential and the limitations imposed by ICT products – such as those associated with the  application of IoT devices.  1.3 APPLYING THE SCSA METHODOLOGY  The SCSA Methodology described in this document should address the objectives given in 1.1  in the context of the workflow for drafting sectoral cybersecurity certification schemes. It is  designed to be used in a preparatory step for the definition of a candidate scheme and should  be conducted in cooperation with stakeholders and experts invited by ENISA to an ad hoc  working group. It is important that the required expertise (in risk assessment, CTI, definition of  controls etc.) should be considered when selecting participants. Chapter 6 describes the setup  and the workflow to be followed.  1.4 STATE OF THE WORK  The version of the proposed methodology described in this document contains all the features  and functions which are necessary for an application in the context of drafting a sectoral  cybersecurity certification scheme. The methodology relies as far as possible on standards and  proven concepts. However, some parts were developed specifically for this methodology and  can be seen as innovations.  The practicality of the SCSA Methodology and its applicability in the area of 5G was evaluated  in a dedicated pilot project. Respective improvements and enhancements have been added to  this version.  1.4.1 Potential future steps  The sample list of security controls could be enhanced to cover more control objectives and  more technical or organizational controls. In addition, the practicality of the methodology could  be significantly increased by the development of methods to assign controls to a specific  common security level (CSL, cf. Section 5.5) and to estimate the overall CSL resulting from a  concatenation of controls.  The new methods for identifying the potential of attackers specified in Chapter 9 should be  consolidated after their first practical implementation.

DEFINITIONS AND  ABBREVIATIONS  2.1 DEFINITION OF TERMS  Generally, the definitions of terms as given in the regulatory documents and references listed in  Chapter 3 apply in this report. However, terms given in the CSA have the highest priority. This  section provides definitions for terms which are not included in those normative references or  which are of special relevance for the methodology described in this report.  Asset:  Anything related to information security that has value to the sectoral  ecosystem.  Note 1 to entry: Two kinds of information security related assets can  be distinguished:  ‒ the primary assets:   business processes & activities   functional assets   information assets.  ‒ the supporting assets (on which the primary assets rely) of all types:   ICT system   hardware component   software component   network infrastructure   personnel   site   organization’s structure.  Note 2: Primary assets are critical to the achievement of business  objectives.  Assurance level: Basis for confidence that an ICT product, ICT service or ICT process  meets the security requirements of a specific European cybersecurity  certification scheme, indicates the level at which an ICT product, ICT  service or ICT process has been evaluated but, as such, does not  measure the security of the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process  concerned (cf. CSA, article 2.22).  Attack scenario: Description of an attack, including attacker types, considerations of  attacker objectives, attack potential, motivation and the primary asset  and supporting assets potentially targeted by the attack.  Horizontal: Adjective indicating that an ICT product, ICT process or ICT service  targets multiple markets and that the related cybersecurity certificate  may be recognized by corresponding cybersecurity certification  schemes of these targeted markets.  ICT process: Set of activities performed to design, develop, deliver or maintain an  ICT product or ICT service (cf. CSA).  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  16  ICT product: Element or a group of elements of a network or information system  (cf. CSA).  ICT service: Service consisting fully or mainly in the transmission, storing,  retrieving or processing of information by means of network and  information systems (cf. CSA).  ICT system: Network or information system (cf. CSA); combination of ICT products  and ICT processes that supports one or more ICT services.  Risk scenario: Description of a potential event or incident that could have a negative  impact on one or more stakeholder objectives.  NOTE: The risk scenario defines a particular combination of  parameters that define the incident. These include, primarily, a  stakeholder objective related to a specific business process and a  primary asset in which ICT security is essential for this stakeholder  objective. In addition, the related stakeholder requirements,  supporting assets as well as relevant attacker information and attack  scenarios are included.  2.2 ABBREVIATIONS  AP Attack potential  APL Attack potential level  AVA_VAN Assurance family defined by ISO/IEC 15408-3; addresses the  vulnerability analysis  CAR Common assurance reference  CC Common Criteria  CSA European Union Cybersecurity Act  CSL Common security level  CTI Cyberthreat intelligence  EAL Evaluation assurance level as defined in ISO/IEC 15408  EUCC European Union Common Criteria cybersecurity certification scheme  IC Impact class  ICT Information and communication technology  IoT Internet of things  ISAC Intelligence sharing and analysis centre  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  17  ISMS Information security management system as defined in the  ISO/IEC 270xx series of standards  MRC Meta-risk class  OSP Organizational security policies  PP Protection profile  SAR Security assurance requirements  SCSA Sectoral cybersecurity assessment  SCSAM Sectoral cybersecurity assessment methodology  SFR Security functional requirements  SPD Security problem definition  ST  Security target as defined in ISO/IEC 15408-1  TOE Target of evaluation as defined in ISO/IEC 15408  TSF Target of evaluation security functionality  TTP Techniques, tactics and procedures  2.3 OVERVIEW OF DIVERGING USES OF TERMS  The normative references for the methodology described in this document use certain terms in  the context of different concepts and with different meanings. The following table provides an  overview of those terms, provides a short interpretation of the meaning of each term for each  normative reference and explains how the term is used in the context of this document. The  conceptual considerations that lead to the interpretation of meanings concerning ISO/IEC 270xx  and ISO/IEC 15408 are documented in Annex A.  Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is currently not covered by specific standards and typically uses  ISO/IEC 270xx as a basis for the definition of the terms it uses. The following table shows, in  some cases, a CTI-specific use of terms. However, when no statement for CTI is provided, it  can be assumed that the use of a term in CTI follows ISO/IEC 270xx.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  18  Basic term  Meaning in the  CSA  Meaning in  ISO/IEC 27000:2018  Meaning  ISO/IEC 15408-1:2014  Meaning in  Cyberthreat  intelligence  (CTI)  Attacker Term not defined but  used in CSA, Art. 52.7  providing a description  of evaluation activities  relevant to assurance  level ‘high’. One such  activity is: (..) an  assessment of their  resistance to skilled  attackers, using  penetration testing.  Term not defined but  used to characterize the  factors of a risk:  — for deliberate threat  sources: the motivation  and capabilities, which  change over time, and  resources available to  possible attackers, as  well as the perception of  attractiveness and  vulnerability of assets for  a possible attacker  [ISO/IEC 27005, Clause  8.3.3].  Term not defined but used  (see ‘attack potential’  below).  ‘Threat agent’ is defined  as entity that can  adversely act on assets.  Both terms are used in  similar context but the  meaning of ‘threat agent’  is broader. It can be a  hacker, user, computer  process, and accident (see  Annex A).  Attacker and  adversary are used  synonymously.  Remarks on the  use of term  ‘attacker’  In this document, the term means an actor or actors who could potentially perform an attack. The terms  ‘attacker’, ‘adversary’ and ‘threat agent’ are used synonymously.  The CSA and ISO/IEC15408-1 use this term in the context of evaluation, assessing the resistance of the  ICT product against skilled attacks, while ISO/IEC 27000 considers it as a source for influencing risk.  Attack  potential  Term not defined nor  used.  Term not defined but  indirectly used when  analysing deliberate  threat sources (see  ‘attacker’) for the  purposes of risk  assessment.  Attack potential – term  defined as measure of the  effort to be expended in  attacking a TOE,  expressed in terms of an  attacker's expertise,  resources and motivation.  Attack potential is  characterized by the  opportunity, means  and motivation of  the attacker.  Remarks on the  use of term  ‘attack  potential’  CTI uses three factors to describe an attack potential: motives, means and opportunities. This document  follows the use of the term introduced by CTI as necessary to conduct risk assessment in sectoral  schemes.  ISO/IEC 15408-1 and ISO/IEC 18045 use the term to describe the level of effort evaluators are obliged  to use in performing vulnerability assessments. In this context there are five factors that characterize an  attack potential: Elapsed Time, Window of Opportunity, Specialist Expertise, Knowledge of the TOE, IT  hardware/software or other equipment. In addition, ISO/IEC 18045 provides classifications for each  factor and provides a scale for the calculation of the potential value of a particular attack. (See below and  Subsection 5.6.5.)  Attack  potential  (means)  n/a n/a IT hardware/software or  other equipment refers  to the equipment required  to identify or exploit a  vulnerability.  Capability and  Resources: access  to vulnerabilities,  exploits, tooling, and  financial means  necessary to  conduct attacks.  Attack  potential  (skills)  n/a n/a Expertise: refers to the  level of generic knowledge  of the underlying  principles, product type or  attack methods (e.g.  Internet protocols, Unix  operating systems, buffer  overflows).  Knowledge of TOE: is a  specific expertise with  respect to the TOE that  goes beyond generic  knowledge  Skill: knowledge and  expertise to  conceptualize and  realize a particular  attack.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  19  Basic term  Meaning in the  CSA  Meaning in  ISO/IEC 27000:2018  Meaning  ISO/IEC 15408-1:2014  Meaning in  Cyberthreat  intelligence  (CTI)  Attack  potential  (opportunity)  n/a n/a Elapsed Time: is the total  amount of time taken by  an attacker to identify that  a particular potential  vulnerability may exist in  the TOE, to develop an  attack method and to  sustain effort required to  mount the attack against  the TOE.  Window of Opportunity:  related to the Elapsed  Time factor. Identification  or exploitation of a  vulnerability may require  considerable amounts of  access to a TOE that may  increase the likelihood of  detection. Some attack  methods may require  considerable effort off-line,  and only brief access to  the TOE to exploit. Access  may also need to be  continuous, or over a  number of sessions.  Opportunity:  Possibility of the  adversary getting  access to the  system or artifact,  presence of  exploitable  vulnerabilities.  Control  Control – term used in  CSA, Art. 52.4: The  certificate or the EU  statement of  conformity shall refer  to technical  specifications,  standards and  procedures related  thereto, including  technical controls,  the purpose of which  is to decrease the risk  of, or to prevent,  cybersecurity  incidents.  Control - term defined  as a measure that is  modifying risk.  Control – term not defined  but used in relation to  ‘security’: (…) it is  recognised that significant  security can often be  achieved through or  supported by  administrative measures  such as organisational,  personnel, physical, and  procedural controls.  Remarks on the  use of the term  ‘control’  In this document the term means a measure to decrease risk or to prevent cybersecurity incidents. It  should be noted that ISO/IEC 27000 uses the term ‘control’ in direct relation to ‘objective’ and to ‘risk’,  while in ISO/IEC 15408 it is related to ‘security’. CSA understands ‘technical control’ as a measure for  decreasing the risk, which is similar to ISO/IEC 27000.  Objective security objective –  term not defined but  used with reference to  requirements set up  by cybersecurity  certification schemes  (CSA, Art. 51): A  European  cybersecurity  certification scheme  shall be designed to  achieve, as applicable,  control objective – term  defined as statement  describing what is to be  achieved as a result of  implementing controls.  security objective – term  defined as statement of an  intent to counter identified  threats and/or satisfy  identified organization  security policies and/or  assumptions.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  20  Basic term  Meaning in the  CSA  Meaning in  ISO/IEC 27000:2018  Meaning  ISO/IEC 15408-1:2014  Meaning in  Cyberthreat  intelligence  (CTI)  at least the following  security objectives (..).  Remarks on the  use of the term  ‘objective’  In this document, the term is generally used in its common dictionary meaning. If a specific context of  risk management is concerned ISO/IEC 270xx is followed.  The use in the CSA is different from the referenced standards where the meaning is related to what is to  be achieved by implementing controls (ISO/IEC 270xx) or security functionality (ISO/IEC 15408). The  CSA understands ‘security objectives’ as ‘high-level security requirements’.  Process [ICT] process – term  defined as set of  activities performed to  design, develop,  deliver or maintain an  ICT product or ICT  service.  Process – term defined  as set of interrelated or  interacting activities  which transforms inputs  into outputs.  Process – term not  defined and used with its  common meaning.  Remarks on the  use of term  ‘process’  In this document, the definition provided by the CSA is used.  Both CSA and ISO/IEC 270xx consider ‘ICT service’ as a subject of certification. It should be noted that  ISO/IEC 15408 does not present a process-oriented approach.  Product [ICT] product – term  defined as an  element or a group of  elements of a network  or information  system.  product – term not used [IT] product – term not  defined but used with its  common meaning. In the  context of evaluation,  ISO/IEC 15408  establishes an important  distinction between an IT  product and a TOE  (Target of Evaluation):  The TOE may be an IT  product, a part of an IT  product, a set of IT  products, a unique  technology that may  never be made into a  product, or a combination  of these.  Remarks on the  use of term  ‘product’  In this document the definition provided by CSA is used. It should be noted that the CSA is very general  when speaking of certification / evaluation with regards to ICT products. Existing schemes based on  ISO/IEC 15408/ISO/IEC 18045 allow certification of Protection Profiles that relate to types of ICT  products, not specific ones.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  21  Basic term  Meaning in the  CSA  Meaning in  ISO/IEC 27000:2018  Meaning  ISO/IEC 15408-1:2014  Meaning in  Cyberthreat  intelligence  (CTI)  Requirement [security] requirement  – term not defined but  used in the context of  conformity  assessment  performed against the  technical specification  that contains such  requirements (see  CSA, Art. 46.2): (..) to  attest that the ICT  products, ICT services  and ICT processes  that have been  evaluated in  accordance with such  schemes comply with  specified security  requirements for the  purpose of protecting  the availability,  authenticity, integrity  or confidentiality of  stored or transmitted  or processed data or  the functions or  services (..).  requirement – term  defined as need or  expectation that is  stated, generally implied  or obligatory.  [security] requirement –  term defined as  requirement, stated in a  standardised language,  which is meant to  contribute to achieving the  security objectives for a  TOE [Target of  Evaluation].  Remarks on the  use of term  ‘requirement’  In this document the term follows the definition given in ISO/IEC 270xx.  It should be noted that this term is used in similar ways in the referenced documents – all lead to  establishing relationships between ‘conformity’ and ‘requirement’, although ISO/IEC 15408 uses this  term in a narrow technical context. Further, it should be underlined that ISO/IEC 270xx defines  ‘conformity’ as ‘fulfilment of a requirement’ and considers ‘conformance’ used in ISO/IEC 15408 as a  synonym. Finally, ISO/IEC 15408 uses ‘requirement’ with a direct relationship to ‘objectives’.  Service [ICT] service – term  defined as Service  consisting fully or  mainly in the  transmission, storing,  retrieving or  processing of  information by means  of network and  information systems.  Service – term not  defined and used with  its technical meaning to  describe relationships  between various  elements of an  information system;  additionally, it is used to  describe business  relationships in the  ISMS (for example an  organization’s  relationship with a  service provider);  providing services can  be included in the  scope of the ISMS.  Service – term not  defined and used only  with its technical meaning  to describe relationships  between elements/  components of the  information system.  Remarks on the  use of term  ‘service’.  In this document the use of this term follows CSA.  Both CSA and ISO/IEC 270xx consider ‘ICT service’ as a subject of certification.

[information] security –  term defined as  preservation of  confidentiality, integrity  and availability of  information.  security – term not  defined but considered as  a fundamental concept  with many characteristics,  for example: security  attribute, security  problem, security  requirement, security  functionality.  Remarks on the  use of term  ‘security’  ‘Security’ in the CSA means ‘activities’, while in referenced standards ‘security’ is considered as a state  for the object described (a security attribute that can be lost – loss of confidentiality, integrity of  availability). It is to be noted that ISO/IEC 15408 defines ‘secure state’ as state in which the TSF [Target  of Evaluation Security Functionality] data are consistent and the TSF continues correct enforcement of  the SFRs [Security Functional Requirements].  In this document the term is used in both meanings, i. e. describing the state or the activities, depending  on the context.

INTRODUCTION TO SECTORAL  SYSTEMS AND CYBERSECURITY  CERTIFICATION SCHEMES  4.1 SECTORAL SYSTEMS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CSA  The CSA defines and distinguishes between ICT products, ICT processes and ICT services.  The relationships between these elements can be visualized as follows:  Figure 1: CSA-defined elements and their relations  The CSA stipulates that an ICT service is supported by ICT products and ICT processes. This  combination of ICT products and ICT processes that support an ICT service is called an ICT  service system or, in brief, an ‘ICT system’.  In addition, there are ICT processes that support ICT products, for example product  development processes. These are usually different from those that support ICT services.  Typically, there is a coordinated use of several ICT products to support all product-based  functions needed for the implementation and operation of the ICT service. The specification of  this coordinated use of several ICT products is called the system architecture.  It should be noted that ICT processes are also able to use ICT products.  With a view to conducting risk assessment, evaluation and certification, it is necessary to  distinguish between the following layers of an ICT system:  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  25  1. ICT Infrastructures  ICT infrastructures serve several markets, applications and end-user services. Examples are  mobile networks, cloud services and payment or ID services if these can be integrated into  sectoral ICT systems. ICT infrastructures could also be regarded as providing ICT services  to the owners of the sectoral ICT systems they support. From a business perspective, this  could be seen as a relationship between unrelated organizations in the roles of an ICT  infrastructure service provider and a business user.  2. Sectoral ICT Systems  Sectoral systems include all functions that are specific to the provision of services to a  particular market sector targeted at end-users. Sectoral ICT systems usually rely on ICT  infrastructure services for specific functions. Whenever security-relevant functions of a  sectoral ICT system depend on external ICT services, these are regarded as ICT  infrastructure services.  Combinations of ICT infrastructures and sectoral ICT systems are common. For example in 5G,  payment and ID services are typically both integrated by sectoral systems and offer ICT  services to end-users. Both infrastructures and sectoral ICT systems combine ICT products and  ICT processes as defined in the CSA. The following picture shows the characteristic  relationships between:   sectoral ICT systems, which support one or more sectoral ICT services,   ICT infrastructures, which potentially provide ICT infrastructure services to support sectoral  ICT systems, and   ICT products, which may be used in both, sectoral ICT systems and ICT infrastructures.  Figure 2: Relations between system architecture levels  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  26  From the perspective of cybersecurity evaluation and certification, it is important to consider not  only the technical interaction between these building blocks of the overall ICT system but also  the allocation of responsibilities within them, since the owners of each of the building blocks  must carry out risk assessments, implement appropriate controls, and support evaluation and  certification at their level.  This consideration leads to an important difference between ICT infrastructures and ICT  products: the definition, implementation and operation of ICT infrastructures is the responsibility  of the stakeholders in an ICT infrastructure. In contrast, responsibility for the integration and  operation of an ICT product in accordance with its intended use is with the entities that purchase  the ICT product, i.e. the stakeholders of ICT infrastructures or sectoral ICT systems. The vendor  is responsible for evaluation and certification of ICT products.  4.2 RISK-BASED DEFINITION OF SECURITY AND ASSURANCE ACROSS  ARCHITECTURE LEVELS  The structure and relationships between the building blocks of an ICT service system, as  defined in the previous section, provide the basis for risk-based identification of security and  assurance requirements at all levels.  The basic relationships are as follows:  1. The sectoral stakeholders should identify the security and assurance requirements to the  sectoral ICT system and the supporting ICT infrastructures and ICT products based on a  risk assessment from the perspective of the targeted sectoral ICT services.  2. ICT infrastructure stakeholders should consider these sectoral requirements when defining  the security and assurance of their ICT infrastructure and confirming the compliance of their  ICT services to the owners of sectoral ICT systems in service level agreements.  3. Security and assurance requirements from all supported sectors must therefore be  considered when ICT infrastructures and their ICT services, ICT products and ICT  processes are being implemented.  4. ICT products and processes, which are employed by sectoral ICT systems or ICT  infrastructures, must comply with the stipulated requirements covering their intended use in  all environments where they are targeted for deployment.  5. All stipulated requirements made by the targeted sectoral ICT systems or ICT  infrastructures should be consolidated and included in the definition of the security problem,  the security functional requirements and security assurance requirements of the ICT  product.  Sectoral risk assessments are key to the formulation of security and assurance requirements for  supporting ICT infrastructures and ICT products, and those ICT products and processes used  by sectoral systems internally.  Risk assessments must also be carried out for ICT infrastructure services and systems.  Section 4.4 will provide more detail on how cybersecurity certification schemes for sectoral ICT  systems and ICT infrastructures should be prepared and implemented.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  27  4.3 INTRODUCTION TO SECTORAL ICT SYSTEMS  4.3.1 Properties of sectoral ICT systems  Subsection 4.1 introduced definitions for the terms ICT system, sectoral ICT system and ICT  infrastructure and described the relationships between these building blocks of an ICT service  system, both amongst each other and in relation to the terms defined by the CSA.  The following properties characterize a sectoral ICT system:  ‒ Sectoral systems support one or more ICT services, which are offered by the sectoral ICT  service provider(s) to end-users.  ‒ A potentially large number of stakeholders, in several well-defined roles with dedicated  responsibilities and functions, cooperate in the implementation and operation of these  sectoral ICT services. Typically, it is the responsibility of these stakeholders to operate their  own ICT processes and ICT products, which could be seen as ICT subsystems of the  sectoral ICT system.  ‒ Frequently several sectoral stakeholders participate in the same role (e.g. mobile network  operators or health insurance companies). These stakeholders may be in competition.  4.3.2 Typical system architecture of sectoral ICT systems  As described in Subsection 4.1, sectoral ICT systems typically use ICT infrastructures and  generic ICT products for defined functions that are required for the implementation and  operation of sectoral ICT services. Figure 2 shows the relation between the sectoral ICT system  and these underlying layers of the overall system architecture.  Usually, the system architecture of a sectoral ICT system consists of numerous ICT  subsystems, which are owned, operated and maintained by individual sectoral stakeholder  organizations. These ICT subsystems are interconnected as specified by the architecture of the  sectoral ICT system and act as required in support of the sectoral portfolio of ICT services.  4.3.3 Coordination of sectoral activities  The implementation and operation of sectoral ICT systems needs a common understanding  between all stakeholders concerning the supported portfolio of ICT services. This understanding  must comprise a common set of objectives and rules, common specifications and processes  that govern the interactions between the various stakeholders and their ICT systems, as well as  a common view on risks and the appropriate levels of security and assurance. This requires a  dedicated organization or structure that provides such guidance to and the coordination of all  parties involved in the sectoral ICT system.  A typical objective of sectoral ICT systems is to support ICT services on a national scale or even  throughout the EU internal market. This would probably require cooperation between numerous  sectoral stakeholders from the targeted areas and demand coordination of their technical and  operational activities. However, such coordination is also likely to support societal goals such as  non-discriminatory access for all interested stakeholder organizations, vendors and users,  fostering competing offers and avoiding misuse of market power, as well as meeting the needs  for privacy and data protection.  In practice, such coordination functions could be established by a combination of governmental  rules, which set the boundary conditions for protecting societal goals and by implementing a  sectoral organization, which conducts the day-to-day coordination work within these boundaries.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  28  There are examples of governmental institutions or organizations that have been established by  sectoral stakeholders to coordinate and guide the activities of ICT services in sectors such as  health, ID and mobility. Similar coordinating entities also exist in ICT infrastructures such as  mobile networks or payment schemes.  Figure 3 visualizes the relations between the coordinating entity, the sectoral stakeholder  organizations, the end-users and the ICT infrastructure service and ICT product suppliers.  Figure 3: High-level roles in sectoral ICT systems  Typical responsibilities and activities of the individual roles in a sectoral ICT system are given  below:  1. The coordinating entity defines rules for the participation of stakeholder organizations in the  sectoral ICT system. Such rules may require, for example, functional and security  certification of the ICT subsystems or ICT products as a precondition for participating in or  operating the ICT system.  2. The coordinating entity specifies the sectoral ICT services to be provided and which ICT  infrastructure services, ICT products and ICT processes are to be commonly used, as well  as specifying details of their functions, security and assurance levels. The sectoral  stakeholders must comply with these specifications for their own ICT operations and will  reference these sectoral specifications when ordering ICT infrastructure services or when  purchasing ICT products.  3. Typically, sectoral systems are organized in such a way that end-users of sectoral ICT  services have a contractual relationship (service level agreement) with the ‘ICT service  provider’ or the ‘ICT service retailer’. These end-users may be equipped with ICT products  such as smartcards by their sectoral contract partner or they may be entitled to use a  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  29  sectoral application on their smartphone. Such ‘3rd party ICT product’-scenarios must also  be addressed by the functional and security specifications of the sector.  Interestingly, it is quite common for ICT infrastructures to both support sectoral organizations as  business users and to offer ICT services to end-users. A typical case would be a mobile  network, which could be seen as providing both ICT infrastructure services and end-user  services.  4.4 CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION OF SECTORAL ICT SYSTEMS  4.4.1 Considerations from the architectural point of view  From the perspective of cybersecurity evaluation and certification it is important to note that the  sectoral ICT system as well as the stakeholder’s ICT subsystems can be quite complex. In  addition, the implementation of the required functions can vary significantly from stakeholder  organization to stakeholder organization. This applies in particular if sectoral ICT systems arise  from a newly established cooperation between stakeholder organizations, with the resulting  integration of the stakeholder organization’s incumbent ICT subsystems. Such complexity and  diversity usually prohibit the definition of a clear-cut protection profile as used for ICT products  and required for product certification.  Instead, the implementation and certification of ICT security at both the sectoral layer and the  stakeholder organization’s ICT subsystems is usually based on the standards of information  security management systems such as ISO/IEC 27001 and related certifications. These provide  a proven and practical approach to system security and are well established in many sectors.  However, they do not support the concept of defined assurance levels as provided by  ISO/IEC 15408 for ICT products. A consistent implementation of security and assurance  requirements across all ICT subsystems of sectoral stakeholder organization’s which use an  ISMS would be hard to support, based on the current status of the standard. This limitation must  be considered when defining the security architecture and the certification concept of a sectoral  ICT system.  In a typical sectoral ICT system, the ISMS-based approach to ICT security and certification  covers processes at the level of the sectoral ICT subsystems, which use the bulk of ICT  products and ICT processes within a sectoral ICT system. ICT product certification is mainly  used for ICT products, which support critical functions of the sectoral ICT system and require a  defined level of security and assurance.  Consequently, cybersecurity evaluation and certification in sectoral ICT systems and their  supported ICT services is typically a combination of ICT product, ICT process and ISMS  certification.  4.4.2 Enabling the recognition and reuse of certificates  The recognition and reuse of certificates that have been granted by horizontal cybersecurity  certification schemes to ICT infrastructure services, ICT products or ICT processes is a  prerequisite for the practicability and economic viability of sectoral cyber security certification  schemes and should be a central goal in their definition. This should include certificates from  cybersecurity certification schemes under the EU cybersecurity framework and potentially also  from other schemes that are relevant in the particular market sector.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  30  The following prerequisites must be in in place to enable the necessary synergies with  horizontal cybersecurity certification schemes:  1. Compliance with sectoral requirements  The certified ICT infrastructure service, ICT product or ICT process must conform to the  functional, security and assurance requirements as stipulated by the sectoral ICT system.  Section 4.2 documents how these requirements should be defined based on a risk  assessment that takes the perspective of the targeted sectoral ICT services as its starting  point.  The sectoral cybersecurity certification scheme should support processes that  communicate these requirements, including all relevant information on the ‘intended use’,  to the relevant suppliers and their certification schemes. There should also be a means to  allow the identification of suitable certified ICT infrastructure services, ICT products or ICT  processes, which are already available in the market. Also required is a process that  evaluates other certification schemes for their compliance with the sectoral requirements  for cybersecurity certification.  2. Consistent definition of risk, security and assurance  The reuse of certified ICT infrastructure services, ICT products or ICT processes requires  that the definitions of security requirements and security levels as well as the definitions for  assurance requirements and assurance levels are consistent and comparable across all  relevant cybersecurity certification schemes, and that the methods used for evaluation are  accepted by the sectoral scheme as appropriate for the defined levels. In addition, there  needs to be a common understanding of the underlying risk. The definitions of generic risk  classes should support a consistent and comparable approach to risk levels and risk  acceptance criteria.  3. Common terminology  The recognition and reuse of certificates requires that the sectoral ICT cybersecurity  certification scheme and the schemes that are referenced use the same terminology and  definitions, or that a commonly accepted means is available to translate those terms or  definitions that are different.  4.4.3 Setup of sectoral cybersecurity certification schemes  The partitioning of a sectoral ICT system with regard to cybersecurity certification is to a large  extent defined by internal roles and responsibilities within the sectoral ICT system. The  stakeholder organizations are responsible for conducting cybersecurity certification for their own  ICT subsystems.  They have to ensure that ICT infrastructure services, ICT products and ICT  processes they purchase from their suppliers comply with sectoral certification requirements. By  this means, the totality of certificates provided by sectoral stakeholder organizations will address  cybersecurity certification for the largest part, by far, of a sectoral ICT system.  The definition of a sectoral cybersecurity certification scheme should try, as far as possible, to  optimize practicality and economic efficiency by supporting the re-use of the ISMS-certifications  that are the responsibility of the different sectoral stakeholder organizations, as well as the  horizontal certifications for ICT infrastructure services, ICT processes and ICT products. By this  means, the certification of a sectoral system would, to a large extent, build on all the certificates  of underlying ICT subsystems, ICT services, ICT products and ICT processes. In an ideal case,  only the evaluation and certification of those ICT processes and ICT products which are the  responsibility of the sector’s coordinating entity would need to be evaluated by the sectoral ICT  scheme.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  31  5. CONSISTENT DEFINITION OF  RISK, SECURITY AND  ASSURANCE  5.1 REQUIREMENTS AND OBJECTIVES  The CSA stipulates objectives, requirements and definitions as the basis of the definitions of  risk, security and assurance and the relations between these. Figure 4 illustrates the  relationships between these elements, as documented in the CSA:  Figure 4: CSA-defined elements and their relations  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  32  The key requirements for cybersecurity certification schemes, drafted under the CSA, can be  summarized as follows:  1. As known from ISO/IEC 15408, security and assurance are seen as distinct, independent  objectives. However, the CSA introduces an association between assurance levels and  security requirements as well as selected security functions.  2. Assurance levels should be implemented consistently across schemes.  3. The definitions of security and assurance requirements as well as assurance levels should  be based on the risk associated with the intended use, in terms of probability and impact,  of the respective ICT product, ICT process or ICT service.  4. The definition of methods and specifications shall as far as possible follow European and  international standards.  Furthermore, the following conclusions can be deduced:  1. The definition of requirements for the security and assurance of ICT products, ICT  processes or ICT services, based on risk, requires a preparatory step that documents the  intended use of the ICT product, ICT process or ICT service and identifies the risk related  to that use.  2. Risks related to the intended use of ICT products, ICT processes and infrastructural ICT  services can only be determined in the context of the sector in which they are to be used.  Consequently, relevant results of the risk assessment must be made available to suppliers  and schemes that are responsible for the development and certification of these ICT  products, ICT processes and infrastructural ICT services.  5.2 CONCEPTUAL APPROACH FOR THE CONSISTENT DEFINITION OF  RISK, SECURITY AND ASSURANCE  5.2.1 Introduction and principles  The SCSA Methodology, which is documented in the following sections, is in compliance with  the requirements mentioned in the previous sections and supports a practical and sound  approach for the identification of risk and the definition of security and assurance to be used in  the drafting of sectoral or infrastructural candidate cybersecurity certification schemes.  A. Integration into the workflow for drafting sectoral schemes  This sectoral assessment methodology should be integrated into the workflow for sectoral  schemes as a preparatory activity in drafting the candidate scheme. This puts in place the  following boundary conditions and requirements for a consistent methodology for risk,  security and assurance:  1. The methodology must be applied in the preparatory phases of drafting sectoral  candidate schemes for the EU cybersecurity certification framework.  2. The methodology should be able to take advantage of risk assessment methods  already in use by sectors or infrastructures. Consequently, the methodology does not  define a specific risk assessment approach; assuming that existing risk assessment  methods will conform to the ISO/IEC 270xx series of ISMS-standards. Definitions  used by the targeted methodology regards the series of ISO/IEC 270xx standards as  normative references and focuses on enhancements whenever necessary. Deviations  from these standards are not permitted.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  33  3. Cyberthreat Intelligence (CTI) shall contribute to the identification of risk and to the  estimation of the capabilities of potential types of adversaries. Existing methods for  CTI and available information sources such as ENISA’s threat landscape shall be re-  used.  B. Balancing flexibility and consistency  The CSA acknowledges that the design of cybersecurity certification schemes needs  flexibility to adapt to the requirements of a specific sector or class of ICT products, ICT  processes or ICT services. However, the need for flexibility potentially conflicts with the  objective of implementing assurance levels consistently across schemes, which is a  prerequisite for the recognition and re-use of certificates within cybersecurity certification  schemes under the CSA.  Taking into account the CSA’s requirements concerning relationships between risk,  security and assurance, it can be concluded that the following concept can be adduced in  support of an appropriate balance between flexibility and consistency:  1. Assurance levels, risk and security, and the relations between these, should be firmly  defined. These definitions should be applied to any sectoral or infrastructural  cybersecurity certification schemes under the CSA. This will provide the consistency  required for the definition of ICT products, ICT products and infrastructural ICT  services, which are designed for use in several sectors. It will also allow the re-use  and recognition of certificates.  2. Differing sectoral views concerning risk tolerance or appetite can be accommodated  during risk assessment. The result of allowing this flexibility would mean that sectors  could rate a comparable risk differently, thus leading to different sectoral assurance  and security requirements without affecting the goal of consistency. In addition, there  should be the option to deviate from the relationships described in the previous  paragraph, if the deviation is fully justified and well-documented.  Figure 5 illustrates this concept. It distinguishes between the sectoral risk assessment  methodology used, which allows sectors their own specific view on risk, and the mapping of this  assessed risk to so-called ‘CSA meta-risk classes’ (MRC). These MRCs provide a normalized  definition of risk which should be used in all sectoral or infrastructural schemes. MRCs are the  starting point for a firm definition of relations with assurance levels, security objectives and the  level of controls related to these security objectives.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  34  Figure 5: Conceptual approach for flexibility and consistency  Figure 5 also shows the principles of how the CSA’s requirements for consistency can be  implemented by the methodology defined in this document. The individual steps are marked by  the letters A to D.  A. A detailed definition of the assurance levels related to assurance requirements and  evaluation specifications is a starting point for considerations under this methodology.  B. This step introduces a level structure for MRCs that corresponds with the defined  assurance levels. This means that there is a defined relationship between a level of  assurance and an MRC.  C. The CSA requests that specific controls should be related to particular assurance levels.  Since MRCs are matched with assurance levels, this can be supported in a generic way  by introducing a level structure for controls that matches the level structure for MRC.  D. The level structure for attack potential, which is used by the evaluator as part of his  vulnerability analysis, should also be implemented in the CTI-based determination of  attack potential.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  35  5.2.2 Integration with the preparation of a cybersecurity certification  scheme  The SCSA methodology can be integrated as a preparatory step into the workflow for drafting a  cybersecurity certification scheme governed by the CSA as shown in Figure 6.  Figure 6: Application of the methodology in the context of drafting a sectoral cybersecurity  scheme  The application of the methodology for the sectoral cybersecurity assessment should be  conducted in workshops with the ad hoc working group.  All relevant sectoral stakeholder roles should be represented in the ad hoc working group.  In order to ensure transparency and continuity, all information and results generated by the  sectoral assessment should be documented. Accurate documentation is particularly important  where stakeholders decide to deviate from the default relationships defined by the concept for  consistent implementation of security and assurance.  Special attention should be paid to the documentation of information from the sectoral level.  This is needed by sectoral ISMS-owners and external suppliers of ICT products, ICT processes  and ICT services in order to adapt these to the requirements of the sector.  5.2.3 Establishing the context for the sectoral cybersecurity assessment  As known from information security risk management according to ISO/IEC 27005, the  application of the SCSA Methodology requires documentation of the context in which the  sectoral cybersecurity assessment should be carried out. This includes all information that is of  relevance for the assessment of risks and the definition of security and assurance requirements:  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  36  1. Description of the scope of the sectoral cybersecurity assessment,  2. Documentation of the sectoral stakeholder’s roles and responsibilities and the business  processes relevant for the defined scope,  3. Documentation of the sectoral stakeholder’s objectives and requirements with regard to  the documented business processes,  4. Description of the architecture of sectoral ICT subsystems or operational processes  supporting the documented business processes,  5. Identification and documentation of primary information or functional assets supporting  the business processes,  6. Identification of ICT subsystems, products, processes and services (supporting assets)  supporting the primary information or functional assets,  7. Documentation of threat landscape and CTI information for the selected scope, in  particular relevant attacker types, their potential objectives, motivation and attack  potential level.  The detailed workflow for conducting context establishment is documented in Section 6.2.  5.2.4 Incorporating Cyberthreat Intelligence Information  As discussed in detail in Chapter 9, cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) provides further insights into  the threat landscape, as well as a characterization of potential attackers that constitutes a  crucial component of the SCSA Methodology.  Attackers can be characterized by the means, motives and the opportunities they have for  launching an attack – as described in Chapter 9 and illustrated in figure 7. The portfolio of  potential attackers, as well as their characteristics, have a major influence on the level of risk  and the required levels of security and assurance of any ICT system as the following two  examples may illustrate:  1. Even if the level of security of a control is high, it will be ineffective if it is lower than the  level of attack capability that an adversary can bring to bear. This means that cyber risk  and the choice of security controls directly depend on the potential that an attacker has to  impact the ICT system while it is in use.  2. A sophisticated adversary with ambition to target a critical infrastructure sector, such as  energy, will have not only the means to execute such an attack - for example being funded  and staffed by a nation state – but is also likely to be able to develop sufficient  opportunities to execute an attack with significant success.  Therefore, the assessment of risks, the security of a sectoral ICT system and its ICT products,  ICT processes and ICT services and the need for assurance should be evaluated in the context  of any adversary seeking to attack it.  In the methodology described in this document, different components of attack potential are  considered and used as input at different stages of the assessment:  1. The motive of potential attackers and an estimate of their attack potential level form part of  the determination of sectoral risks.  2. Attack potential and the means of the attackers as well as their opportunity to conduct  attacks are used as input to determine the appropriate security and assurance levels for  sectoral ICT systems, ICT processes and ICT products.  3. The potential of an attacker’s means and opportunities guide the selection of suitable  controls able to withstand an attack.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  37  4. Attack potential3 as defined by CTI should be seen in relation to its use as defined by  ISO/IEC 18045 for ICT product evaluation. This would allow a confirmation of the targeted  level of resistance against the CTI-defined attack potential by an evaluation.  These components and the relationship between attack potential and risk, security and  assurance level are described in further detail in sections 5.3 through 5.6. Subsection 9.6  describes two new methods which support the estimation of the attack potential level.  5.2.5 Method for linking cybersecurity risks with security and assurance  requirements  A major objective of the SCSA Methodology is to link the risk associated with the intended use  of ICT systems, products, processes and services with the requirements for the certification, the  security and the assurance of these components. This requires a dedicated method which is  described in this subsection.  The assessment of cybersecurity risks is based on the relevant business processes and the  sectoral stakeholders’ related objectives that could be impacted by ICT security incidents.  These considerations focus on business, governmental or societal views on the sectoral system  and should reflect the sectoral role model and work split between stakeholders as described in  Chapter 4.  In contrast, the definition of requirements for certification, security and assurance requires a  technical and system architecture perspective. These requirements target sectoral ICT  subsystems, products, processes and services that support the implementation of the relevant  business processes at the sectoral system level, called ‘supporting assets’.  The SCSA Methodology connects these two perspectives by introducing ‘primary information  assets’ and ‘primary functional assets’ in the following way:  In line with the definition given in ISO/IEC 27005, these types of primary assets stand for  information or functions which are of special relevance for the sectoral stakeholder’s objectives.  For both types of primary assets it is possible to document, on the one hand, the potential  impact of a successful attack on the sectoral stakeholders’ objectives and, on the other hand, to  determine which ‘supporting assets’ of the sectoral architecture support and protect the  particular information or function.  Information assets are essentially data (such as cryptographic keys, certificates, applets,  personal data of customers or product configuration parameters) whereas functional assets are  those that are directly deployed in the system as hardware or software in support of a primary  activity (for example ‘user authentication’ or ‘secure boot function’).  Supporting assets are those that are deployed, as the name implies, to support the primary  assets. They constitute the critical elements of the systems which enable the primary assets to  support the business process efficiently and effectively. It is important to note that there is not  necessarily a one-to-one relationship between supporting assets and primary assets; one  supporting asset may be important to more than one primary asset. The relations between  assets used by this method are presented in Figure 7.  3 The meanings of the term in both areas are explained in section 2.3.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  38  Figure 7: Relationships of assets and information security attributes  5.2.6 Introduction of risk scenarios  Subsection 5.2.5 describes the method for linking the business-related assessment of risks with  the technical considerations on security and assurance requirements to single supporting  assets. Subsection 5.2.4 documents that information on attackers, their motives and capacity  has a major influence on the assessment of risks and the definition of the security and  assurance requirements to ICT components or processes that serve as supporting assets.  In order to ensure consistency of considerations of risk, attack potential, security and assurance  and to support reversibility when changing between the different perspectives described in  Subsection 5.2.5, the parameters that are relevant for these considerations and their  relationship have to be well defined.  Attackers follow their own objectives concerning the sectoral system which determine their  attacks and their motivation for conducting attacks. Since these objectives could diverge  significantly from the objectives of the sectoral stakeholders, it is not practical to deduce the  impact on stakeholders’ objectives or the probability that this impact will occur from the  attacker’s motivation and potential with regard to his own objectives. A solution has to be found  for linking attacker information to considerations of the stakeholders’ risks.  Assuming that it is very likely that an attack implementing the attacker’s objectives would affect  primary functional or primary information assets defined from the stakeholder’s perspective, the  SCSA Methodology selects also, in this case, the two types of primary assets described in  Subsection 5.2.5 as linking elements. Based on an assumed attack scenario that involves a  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  39  primary asset, the impact on a stakeholder’s objectives and the probability of such an incident  occurring could be estimated.  The introduction of risk scenarios by the SCSA methodology implements this approach.  A risk scenario describes a potential event or incident that could have a negative impact on one  or more business objectives. This description includes the documentation of the relevant  parameters from the following domains:  Business perspective: Targeted business process, involved stakeholders and their  objectives and requirements concerning the targeted business  process.  Architecture perspective: Primary asset (information and functional) in relation to the  targeted business process, supporting assets for the primary  asset.  Attacker perspective: Attacker types that may be capable and motivated to conduct  attacks on the primary asset. All relevant information is  summarized in attack scenarios which should be associated  with the primary asset.  The identification of risk scenarios should be conducted in relation to a business process and a  primary asset that is of relevance for the objectives of this business process. After this, an  attack scenario which could potentially lead to an incident via an attack on the primary asset  would be added.  Risk scenarios are assigned with a meta-risk class (MRC) based on impact and probability. A  detailed description is given in Section 5.3.  5.2.7 Layered approach to sectoral cybersecurity assessment  Subsection 5.2.5 and Subsection 5.2.6 describe the method applied for linking the business, the  architectural and the attacker perspectives on the sectoral system to enable a risk-based,  consistent definition of security and assurance requirements. For this purpose, primary assets  and risk scenarios have been introduced in Subsections 5.2.5 and 5.2.6 respectively.  Based on these considerations, the SCSA Methodology proposes to conduct the assessment of  the following three layers in sequential steps:  1. Assessment of business layer  Following the pattern set by the normative standard ISO/IEC 27005, the sectoral  assessment will start at the business process layer. The relevant business processes and  the business, governmental or societal objectives of the sectoral stakeholders with regard to  these business processes should be documented. The identification of objectives should be  discussed with the sectoral stakeholders and should be consolidated with regard to the risk  areas given in Annex B.  On this basis, the primary information and primary functional assets as well as the  supporting assets can be identified. This step is considered part of the ‘sectoral context  establishment’ described in Subsection 5.2.5.  2. Assessment of primary asset layer  In the second step, the potential impact on the stakeholder’s objectives of successful attacks  on primary assets and the probability that this impact may occur are estimated and  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  40  documented. Information from CTI on threats and attack potential is used to consolidate the  stakeholders’ estimate of an impact and the probability of a particular incident as described  in Section 5.3. In addition, risk information provided by sectoral stakeholders or generated  by any ISO/IEC 27005-conformant risk management tool can be included. All this is  packaged by risk scenarios as described in Subsection 5.2.6. On this basis Meta-risk  classes (MRC) can be assigned to the identified risk scenarios as described in Section 5.3.  This MRC is inherited by all supporting assets associated with the risk scenario.  3. Assessment of supporting assets  The third layer of the assessment targets the definition of the security and assurance  requirements to ICT subsystems, products, services and processes that serve primary  information and functional assets as supporting assets. The risk information, in particular the  MRC, which applies to a particular supporting asset is inherited from the assessment of the  primary information or functional asset which is supported by the supporting asset to be  assessed. For the definition of the security and assurance requirements for the supporting  asset, the MRC and the capacity of the relevant attacker types to conduct attacks, the attack  potential level (APL) and also the intended use and the operational environment will be  taken into account. The definition of APL and the method for determining the APL are  described in Section 5.4. The methods for defining the required security and assurance  levels in a risk-related and consistent way are described in Section 5.5 and Section 5.6.  Figure 8 visualizes the relationship between the business layer, the primary asset and the  supporting assets for a mobile network as an example.  Figure 8: Example of the relationship between business, primary asset and  supporting asset layer  The detailed workflows for conducting the context establishment and the assessment using the  layered approach are documented in Chapter 6.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  41  5.3 CSA META-RISK CLASSES – A COMMON APPROACH TO THE  SCALING OF RISK  5.3.1 Introduction to sectoral risk assessment  Risk assessment is a prerequisite for the establishment of security and trust in ICT systems.  Risk assessment enables risks to be understood and therefore correctly mitigated through the  use of risk controls. Most modern information security and risk management standards therefore  call for a risk-based approach to the selection of appropriate security controls.  The typical approach followed in an organizational information security management system  (ISMS) is that the level of risk is assessed as a function of the impact (or consequences) of an  event and the likelihood (probability) of it occurring. Although this approach enables the loss or  damage as a result of an incident or event to be estimated, it is increasingly inaccurate where  events have either (or both) a very low probability and the potential to cause a very high degree  of impact.  Figure 9: Example of qualitative risk mapping in an ISMS based on ISO/IEC 31010  An example of using a qualitative method for risk assessment is illustrated in Figure 9. The  criteria chosen by the organization are applied to all qualitative levels of likelihood and impact  and the formula for risk estimation is given to achieve qualitative levels of risk expressed by  appropriate names and colours.  To provide a consistent approach to certification and to ensure that certificates are comparable  and consistent throughout a whole sector, it is necessary to base the considerations on  comparable risk levels appropriate for that sector.  Sectoral risk assessments must be carried out at a high level for instance by the coordinating  entity for the sector or by the developer of a sectoral cybersecurity certification scheme. Both  would need to involve the relevant stakeholder roles from within the sector and its constituent  organizations:  ‒ The stakeholders and coordinating entity that are engaged in providing the sectoral  services (‘business risk owners’).  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  42  ‒ Consumers of sectoral services.  ‒ Society generally, both at the European and international levels.  ‒ Governmental risk owners.  According to the approach defined in Subsection 5.2.7, the sectoral risk assessment is carried  out in the primary asset layer assessment. As described in the following subsections, CTI and  attacker information will be used to improve the reliability of the estimations of impacts and their  probability4 compared to the classical approach described above.  Further, the SCSA Methodology implements the risk scenario approach (see Subsection 5.2.6)  to support consistency and the reversibility of considerations on risk, attack potential, security  and assurance that bridge all three levels of the sectoral assessment.  5.3.2 Attacker information as criteria for risk assessment  Section 5.2 describes the use of CTI and attacker information for sectoral assessment at a high  level. This subsection explains how to apply attacker information to assess the risks and how to  assign meta-risk classes when assessing the primary asset layer.  For the assessment of risks and the estimation of the MRC, the portfolio of possible adversaries  and their attack potential should be considered, concentrating on their motives. If a  sophisticated adversary, such as a nation-state actor, cyber terrorist or foreign military force has  its own objectives and, based on these, a strong motivation to target a particular sectoral  system, we have to assume that the adversary will be likely to develop the means to execute  and succeed in such an attack. Such a scenario must be discussed with the sectoral  stakeholders so that it can be reflected in the description of the risk and the assignment of the  MRC. A similar reasoning follows if the ICT system is subject to highly skilled adversaries, such  as cybercriminal groups, who may not have direct governmental support or military capabilities,  but still have sufficient funding and skills to develop significant offensive capabilities.  Consequently, an assessment of potential attacker types must be conducted as part of the  context establishment. The result should be a list of potential types of adversaries5, their  potential objectives and resulting motivation and a high-level estimate of their means. Based on  these objectives, attack scenarios that could affect the primary information and functional assets  should be analysed and rated with regard to the motivation and means of the respective  attacker types. This information should be considered by the sectoral stakeholders as input to  the identification and assessment of the risk and the related MRC classification.  During the context establishment and the primary asset layer assessment, only general  considerations of a potential attacker's means and opportunity can be taken into account as the  supporting assets, which would be the targets of attacks, and their environment are not yet fully  identified. Any estimation of the attack potential level is preliminary and must be renewed during  the assessment of supporting assets in the context of the specific supporting asset.  However, for the assessment of risks in the primary asset layer, these limitations of the  estimated attack potential are acceptable since the focus is on the estimation of the probability  of an incident that may affect the stakeholders’ objective. This largely depends on the objectives  and motivations of the attacker types which can be estimated for each risk scenario based on its  associated attack scenario. With regards to attacker potential, it suffices to have a high-level  indication as to whether the attacker types referenced in the attack scenario would be capable  of implementing the attack.  4 For consistency with the CSA, the term Probability is used by this methodology as equivalent to the term Likelihood.  5 A generic list of attacker types is given in Chapter 9.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  43  Details about the different focus of the use of CTI information for the assessment of risks in the  primary asset layer and for the identification of security and assurance requirements for  supporting assets at the assessment layer for these assets are described in Section 9.5 and in  Section 9.6.  The workflows for establishing the context with regard to CTI and attacker types, the estimation  of impact and probability, and the definition of meta-risk classes are documented in Chapter 6.  5.3.3 Sectoral risk assessment – guidance for impact estimation  A principle of our methodology is that sectoral stakeholders will identify risk scenarios that can  cause damage to the objectives of one or more stakeholders. The identification of these  scenarios will be based on the means and motivation of attackers as well as on the  opportunities they have to have an impact on the functional (primary or supporting) assets.  From the identification of the risk scenarios, it should be possible for the stakeholders to  estimate their impact on the business and the probability that the scenario will occur. Both  impact and probability strongly depend on the characteristics of the sectoral business,  concretely, the level of the impact depends on the business objectives affected and the  perspective of the particular stakeholder.  It is worth remarking that a risk scenario may concern several stakeholder’s objectives and, at  the same time, different stakeholders in the sector may take a different view of the related  impact. Therefore, in this methodology we introduce two concepts for harmonizing the decisions  concerning the impact that could be caused by the implementation of a given risk scenario.  On the one side, in order to ensure comparability of impact estimation across sectors, generic  levels of impact are defined for use in sectoral risk assessments. These levels, called impact  classes (IC), qualitatively measure the damage a risk scenario can cause to the business of the  stakeholders. The impact classes defined are shown in Table 1 below.  Table 1: Definition of 5 impact classes of incidents (IC1-IC5)  IC1 IC2 IC3 IC4 IC5  Negligible impact Minor impact Moderate impact Major impact Catastrophic  impact  Obviously, the stakeholder may map qualitative dimension into quantitative. For example, a  major impact could mean the loss of 10% of revenues due to breach of contract or a drop of  15% in clients due to loss of confidence. Even in this example, we may observe that the impact  may be considered in many areas of the stakeholder’s business. Since stakeholders, depending  on their objectives, could have different perceptions of the impact that could potentially be  caused by a risk scenario and might select a different IC, a moderation with the goal of defining  a common IC should be conducted. This discussion should also consider relevant attackers and  their potential that may influence the classification of impact as described in Subsection 5.3.2.  The stakeholder’s initial selections of IC should be documented.  Applying the concept of risk areas is the second concept that we define in the SCSA  Methodology for harmonizing impact analysis. As described in Subsection 5.2.7, a generic  description of risk areas given in Annex B should support the stakeholders in taking into  consideration all relevant areas when defining their objectives and requirements in relation to a  particular business process. To support consistency for the definition of IC, this description of  generic risk areas in Annex B includes a definition of a minimum IC. The selection of the IC for a  risk scenario which is associated with objectives that have been selected in the context of a risk  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  44  area must not fall below the minimum IC given for this risk area. A risk scenario may potentially  impact different risk areas, with a different level of impact. In our methodology, each scenario  will be attached to the highest impact class (IC) that the scenario may cause.  5.3.4 Sectoral risk assessment – probability estimation  In addition to the definition of impact classes, the sectoral stakeholders involved in a risk  scenario must estimate the probability that an incident as described in an identified risk scenario  will occur. The estimation of the probability may come from different sources:  ‒ The experience of the stakeholders and/or the organization that provides coordination of all  parties involved in the sectoral ICT system.  ‒ The analysis of the potential attackers, their motivations, means and opportunities. Such  information should be provided by CTI as described in Subsection 5.3.2 and is referenced  by the risk scenario.  ‒ If the risk scenario is not specific to the sector, then the probability may be estimated based  on information of similar attacks in other ICT systems, in particular those with a similar  supply chain.  The abovementioned information is measured or estimated in a different way. In general the  experience of the stakeholders with previous risk events may provide a measurable probability  (e.g. the number of a certain type of attack suffered during a year), especially in the case of ICT  systems already running for a long time. Other information is more qualitative as, for example,  the information provided about the motivation and capabilities of an organization to attack the  sector ICT system. The disparity of information brings the necessity of introducing qualitative  levels for measuring the probability that a risk event will occur. A classification into five levels, as  presented in Table 2, is considered in the SCSA methodology.  Table 2: Definition of 5 levels of probability of incidents (P1-P5)  P1 P2 P3 P4 P5  Incidents are  highly unlikely to  occur  Incidents are  unlikely to occur  Incidents are  somewhat likely to  occur  Incidents are  highly likely to  occur  Incidents are  almost certain to  occur  Each sector shall determine its own definitions of probability assigned to risk scenarios for each  of the five levels, bearing in mind the following factors:  ‒ Risk assessments are prone to errors in estimation where probability is at a low level. This  introduces the potential for misclassification of risks, which may result in an inappropriate  risk treatment. Given the importance of sectoral systems, it is important to ensure, as far  as possible, that errors of this kind are minimized.  ‒ Sectoral risks, given their scope, are such that even low impact events will tend to cause  significant disturbances to the stakeholders within a sector, the sector’s customers and  governmental risk owners or even to society as a whole. Furthermore, even if a single  event causes insignificant damage, it will not be acceptable if such events happen  frequently. These factors must be taken into account in both sectoral risk assessment and  treatment, ensuring that such risks are assessed at an appropriately high level and are not  left untreated.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  45  5.3.5 Assessing sectoral meta-risk classes  The level of meta-risk class for a sectoral ICT product, ICT service or ICT process is assessed  as a function of the estimated consequences (harmful impact) and the perceived likelihood of  those consequences happening (probability). In practice, the two parameters we must consider  when making this assessment are those outlined in the three previous sections (5.3.2, 5.3.3 and  5.3.4):  ‒ Estimated consequences – or Impact Class (see IC1-IC5 in Table 1)  ‒ Probability of the incidents occurring (see P1-P5 in Table 2).  The two parameters in Table 1 and Table 2 are combined to enable the meta-risk class to be  deduced. By consulting the matrix, estimates of probability and impact class can be used by a  sector to deduce a meta-risk class from 1 to 5 (as shown in the cells in Table 3). In assessing a  meta-risk class the highest assessed impact class (IC) is the one that must be used.  For the definition of such material a number of general design considerations must be taken into  account as described above:  ‒ Incidents of a catastrophic nature shall be assigned a high MRC (5) even where these  have a very low level of probability (P1).  ‒ Incidents at IC1 level can have serious consequences if they occur at a high frequency  and must therefore be assigned a MRC5.  These factors must be taken into account in assigning the MRC in order to ensure that such  risks are assessed at an appropriately high level and are not left untreated. In Table 3,  therefore, it will be noted that there are 9 instances of MRC5, 8 of MRC4, 5 of MRC3, 2 of  MRC2 and only 1 instance of MRC1. A description of the risk assessment process used by a  sector to assess MRC is outlined in Chapter 6.  Table 3: Matrix showing meta-risk classes 1-5 for given estimates of probability and impact  class  Probability Levels  Impact Class  P1  P2  P3  P4  P5  IC5  MRC5 MRC5 MRC5 MRC5 MRC5  IC4  MRC4 MRC4 MRC4 MRC4 MRC5  IC3  MRC3 MRC3 MRC4 MRC4 MRC5  IC2  MRC2 MRC3 MRC3 MRC4 MRC5  IC1  MRC1 MRC2 MRC3 MRC4 MRC5  5.4 USING ATTACK POTENTIAL FOR THE SELECTION OF SECURITY  AND ASSURANCE LEVEL  Typically, the opportunity and means of an attacker type are to a certain degree dependent on  the type and intended use of the ICT product, ICT process or ICT service that serves as a  supporting asset. Therefore, it is important to review the attack potential that was estimated in  the first step of the assessment when conducting the second step at the level of supporting  assets, i.e. ICT products, ICT processes, ICT services and supporting ISMS of sectoral  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  46  stakeholders. Depending on the type of the supporting asset, this could result in different attack  potentials for the same adversary. In addition, the detailed estimation of the parameters,  opportunity and means requires an assessment for each supporting asset and its intended use.  Chapter 6 describes how this is implemented in the workflow for the assessment of supporting  assets.  As discussed in Chapter 9 and shown in Figure 10, ‘attack potential (AP)’ consists of motive,  means and opportunity. A high-level estimation of attack potential and motivation is considered  by sectoral stakeholders to identify risk and define the related MRC. The two remaining  components of ‘attack potential (AP)’, namely opportunity and means, will be used for the  definition of the implementation of security and assurance as described in Sections 5.5 and 5.6.  Attack potential not only influences the level of risk, but also the required level of security and  assurance needed by the ICT system. If the sectoral system is likely to be subject to a  sophisticated adversary, such as a nation-state actor with significant capabilities such as the  ability to understand the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the ICT system, this must be  reflected in the way security controls and evaluation are designed and selected.  CTI must therefore provide information that supports the selection and adjustment of security  controls, based on the sector’s control objectives. Using CTI information, sectoral risk owners  will have the information to deploy only those controls with security levels, as described in  Section 5.5 that can withstand the attack potential. For instance, if the attacker is assumed to be  capable of extracting credentials stored on smartcards by deploying attacks at the hardware  level, the ICT products used by the sector must be hardened and certified to withstand such  attacks.  It is therefore proposed that, in estimating meta-risk levels for a sector, attack potential should  be taken into account using the five levels (AP1-AP5) defined in the examples shown in Table 4  below. Please note that, in this table, ‘motivation’ is assumed at all levels of attack potential.  Table 4: Example definitions for the five levels of attack potential (AP1-AP5)  AP 1 AP2 AP3 AP4 AP5  Adversary  Characteristics  Unskilled  adversary  Skilled  adversary with  limited  resources and  opportunity  Skilled  adversary with  significant  resources and  opportunity  Highly skilled  adversary with  significant  resources and  opportunity  Highly  sophisticated  adversary with  significant  resources and  opportunity  Equivalent  ISO/IEC 18045  attack  potential  Basic Enhanced-Basic Moderate High Beyond High  Related  AVA_VAN  assurance  component  AVA_VAN.1/2 AVA_VAN.3 AVA_VAN.4 AVA_VAN.5 None available  The table furthermore lists, from a CTI perspective, for each attack potential the equivalent  attack potentials in ISO/IEC 18045 and the related AVA_VAN assurance component. If a  sectorial ICT system is, for example, subject to an adversary with attack potential AP3,  evaluation at level AVA_VAN.4 would be necessary as a sufficient deterrent against this threat.  As the table indicates, the highest attack potential of ‘beyond high’ has at the moment no  corresponding product evaluation level.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  47  ‘Beyond high’ in ISO/IEC 18045 is typically applicable if the adversary has expert-level  expertise, bespoke equipment, significant knowledge of the Target of Evaluation (TOE) and  significant time available. All of these are features of a sophisticated adversary such as a  nation-state actor or a sophisticated cybercriminal group. These actors may be considered as  possible adversaries of a sectoral ICT system, meaning that controls evaluated above  AVA_VAN.5 would be required. The current lack of a product evaluation level to fill this need for  the protection of critical sectorial ICT systems should be noted.  Given the lack of such a certification level and the absence of appropriate products, it should be  noted that a system may also be secured through architectural means, such as the combined  deployment of multiple controls rated at AVA_VAN.5. This approach is, in communication  systems for example, referred to as ‘defence in depth’. However, even the combination of  multiple controls at a lower level may not be sufficient to prevent an adversary from succeeding  in a compromise. It may merely result in the attack being slowed down sufficiently to enable  detection and response.  Figure 10: Characteristics of attackers in CTI and ISO/IEC 18045  As shown in Figure 10, the information provided by CTI on opportunity and means has a direct  analogy to the parameter of attack potential as specified in ISO/IEC 18045 for product  evaluation. After a product is evaluated, aspects of the evaluation such as the window of  opportunity, the elapsed time the evaluator had to spend with the product, or the knowledge and  equipment necessary to compromise the product is considered to determine the attack potential  rating from ‘Basic’ to ‘Beyond High’ (see ISO/IEC 18045, p. 288). Manufacturers would thus  have their products evaluated and certified with respect to a particular attack potential.  It should be noted in the assessment of supporting assets that the same type of information is  used but from a different viewpoint. In this case stakeholders will have obtained, from their  portfolio of potential adversaries, an estimate of attackers’ capability and skills (means), as well  as their opportunity to, for example, potentially gain access to the product or system. In the  selection of suitable controls for the sectoral system, stakeholders must therefore choose those  controls appropriate to the level of attack potential derived from this information.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  48  5.5 RISK-BASED DEFINITION OF COMMON SECURITY LEVELS AND  SELECTION OF CONTROLS  5.5.1 Basic requirements, conceptual approach  Section 5.1 provides an overview on the CSA’s requirements concerning the security of ICT  services, ICT products and ICT processes and its relationships with risk and assurance.  The CSA stipulates that security requirements for ICT services, ICT products and ICT  processes should be determined based on the risk associated with their intended use. It  introduces a structured approach to security, as known from ISO/IEC 27002, by distinguishing  between security requirements / security objectives and secure functions / controls for the  implementation of these requirements / objectives.  The CSA also describes the relationship between the concepts of security and assurance.  According to CSA, Article 2.1, the assurance level shall establish confidence that the security  requirements of a particular scheme for ICT services, ICT products and ICT processes are met,  but it does not measure the security of the ICT service, ICT product or ICT process. In addition,  EU cybersecurity certification schemes are asked to document security objectives for each  assurance level and to provide examples of controls that address these security objectives.  One can conclude that the CSA establishes a direct relationship between the level of risk, which  was identified in relation to the intended use of ICT services, ICT products and ICT processes,  and the level of security required to mitigate this risk. The relationship between security and  assurance is described as more indirect.  Overall, the level of risk can be seen as the leading parameter when determining the level of  security required. In addition, security requirements and controls shall be documented for each  assurance level. This combination of requirements makes security and the introduction of  security levels a subject to be considered for consistency across schemes.  The considerations mentioned above lead to the following conclusions for the design of the  targeted methodology:  1. A structure of Common Security Levels (CSL) that is commensurate with the meta-risk  classes defined in section 5.3 should be established.  2. To avoid inconsistencies and fragmentation between schemes caused by deviations in the  assignment of security controls of particular strength to assurance levels, the CSL should  be commensurate with the definition of common assurance reference (CAR) levels defined  in section 5.6. This can be achieved indirectly since both, CSL and CAR levels, can be  directly linked with respective MRC levels.  The availability of CTI provides the opportunity to consider information on attackers. The  methodology will employ information on the relevant attack potential as input to the estimation of  the required security level.  As the methodology for sectoral risk assessment shall comply with the ISO/IEC 270xx series of  standards, definitions and terminology used in the following subsections on security and CSL, it  will also follow this series of standards, in particular ISO/IEC 27002. If possible, there should be  a common set of control objectives and controls that can be used across sectors and schemes.  The concept for the introduction of CSL and the application of controls by means of CSL is  explained in the following sections.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  49  5.5.2 Definition of Common Security Levels  Subsection 5.5.1 explains that coherence between schemes under the CSA requires a common  approach to security levels and that security levels need to be commensurate with the level of  concepts for risk and, although indirectly, assurance.  Consequently, the concept of Common Security Levels (CSL) is defined with five levels. Starting  from CSL1, each common security level is more stringent than the previous one.  Table 5 provides an overview on the defined structure of CSL and the default relationships  between CSL, meta-risk classes (MRC) and attack potential levels (AP).  The information on risks and the associated MRC supports the definition of control objectives  and the required CSL of the related controls so that these are able to mitigate the risk efficiently  and effectively.  The association with the parameter AP level, which is determined by CTI, allows checking as to  whether the selected CSL has the strength to withstand the assumed attack potential.  In both cases there is a default one-to-one relationship between the same levels of the  parameters MRC and CSL, as well as between AP and CSL. However, sectoral stakeholders  may decide to deviate from this default relationship during the sectoral assessment.  Table 5: Definition of Common Security Levels (CSL) and their default relationships  Common  Security  Level  Description  Default relationships between CSL  and MRC, AP  CSL mitigates  risk of level  CSL protects  against attack  potential  CSL1  CSL 1 provides a basic level of security against  unskilled adversaries.  MRC1 AP1  CSL2  CSL 2 adds requirements to CSL1, providing security  against skilled adversaries with limited resources and  opportunity to attack a system.  MRC2 AP2 or lower  CSL3  CSL 3 extends the coverage of the security against  skilled adversaries with significant resources and/or  significant opportunity to attack a system.  MRC3 AP3 or lower  CSL4  CSL 4 provides security against a highly skilled  adversary with significant resources and opportunity.  MRC4 AP4 or lower  CSL5  CSL 5 provides the highest level of security, capable of  protecting against highly sophisticated adversaries with  significant resources at their disposal and/or  opportunity for an attack.  MRC5 AP5 or lower  The estimation of the attack potential of a particular type of attacker, which also provides the  criteria and examples for the classification of AP used above, is explained in Chapter 9.  The allocation of controls and the strength of their mechanisms to CSL should be discussed and  agreed with the relevant stakeholders in dedicated workshops as part of the development of a  horizontal scheme and maintenance activities under the CSA.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  50  The implementation of an authentication mechanism for use with mobile ICT services could  serve as an example:  CSL1: Implementation of an authentication protocol on a common OS-platform.  CSL3: Implementation of an authentication protocol in a protected execution environment of  the mobile OS.  CSL5: Implementation on a platform, which is equipped with controls against logical and  physical attacks on hardware and the OS.  5.5.3 Application of controls by using the CSL-concept  As stipulated by the CSA and as defined in ISO/IEC 27002, there is a two-step-approach to  implementing controls. In the first step, control objectives targeting the mitigation of the  identified sectoral risks will be defined. For each risk, there can be more than one control  objective.  A control objective is met by implementing a set of controls. For each control objective, more  than one control can be applied.  The common security level (CSL) specifies the strength of a control. Since the objective of a  control is independent of its strength, only controls are categorized according to the CSL  structure.  1. Employing Meta-risk Classes (MRC) and Common Security Levels (CSL) for  sectoral risk treatment  During sectoral risk assessment, any identified risk will be associated with a meta-risk  class. In a second step, the sectoral ad hoc working group will define control objectives to  mitigate the risk. These control objectives inherit the assigned MRC as a parameter.  In order to ensure that MRC and CSL are commensurate, there shall be by default a one-  to-one relationship between MRC and CSL of the same level.  During sectoral  assessment, the sectoral stakeholders may deviate from this default relationship in specific  cases. Such deviations should be justified and documented during sectoral assessment.  The controls that support the control objective will be selected in accordance with the MRC  that is associated with the control objective. Consequently, controls with an adequate CSL  will be selected for risk treatment.  In some cases, there may be no control that supports the required CSL. If so, a control or  combination of controls that supports the next higher CSL should be selected. Controls  can be of a technical, operational or organizational nature.  2. Attack Potential (AP) as criterion for selecting the CSL of controls  It is a fundamental principle that controls should withstand the assumed types of attackers  and their capabilities. As described in Section 5.4, the potential of relevant attackers will be  estimated during sectoral assessment. The motivation of potential attackers contributes to  the classification of risk as described in section 5.3. However, it could occur that despite a  high attack potential, risk assessment could result in the assignment of a lower MRC. This  would lead to a CSL that could not protect against the assumed attack potential. In such  case, the following rule shall apply:  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  51  If the MRC is at a lower level than the estimated AP, the AP level should determine the  CSL, which is used for selecting the strength of the controls employed for the treatment of  risk. The CSL should be selected to provide protection against the assumed AP.  It should also be noted that a meaningful selection of controls could reduce the window of  opportunity that an adversary may use and in this way help to reach the required CSL.  During sectoral assessment, the sectoral stakeholders may deviate from this default  relationship in specific cases. Such deviations should be justified and documented.  3. Concatenating controls to meet the required CSL  Practical risk treatment may require that a certain CSL is reached by a well-defined  combination of controls with lower CSL. For example, low cost, high volume ICT products  such as IoT devices may not allow costly controls. In such cases, ICT product-based  controls with lower CSL could be combined with controls in the system’s back office or  network to jointly match the required CSL level. Additional information on this concept is  provided in Chapter 8.  Figure 11 visualizes the flow of activities for sectoral risk assessment and risk treatment  and the relationships between CSL, MRC and AP.  Figure 11: Relationship between MRC, CSL and AP levels  The following table shows the possible combinations of MRC, AP and the resulting CSL for the  default scenarios.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  52  Table 6: Common Security Levels (CSL) scorecard  AP levels  AP1 AP2 AP3 AP4 AP5  MRC  MRC1 CSL1 CSL2 CSL3 CSL4 CSL5  MRC2 CSL2 CSL2 CSL3 CSL4 CSL5  MRC3 CSL3 CSL3 CSL3 CSL4 CSL5  MRC4 CSL4 CSL4 CSL4 CSL4 CSL5  MRC5 CSL5 CSL5 CSL5 CSL5 CSL5  Deviations from this default are allowed under conditions as described above.  5.5.4 The CSL-concept as a basis for security-by-design and control  libraries  A defined structure of security levels which is commensurate with related level structures for risk  and assurance not only supports consistency and coherence between schemes and the re-use  of certified ICT products etc, but it can also be used to develop libraries of CSL-conformant  controls. These libraries could help product vendors and owners of ISMS-supported IT systems  to implement a well-defined level of security and assurance. They would also allow a practical  approach to security-by-design for developers who are not experts in implementing IT security  and assurance.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  53  5.6 THE COMMON ASSURANCE REFERENCE CONCEPT – CONSISTENT  IMPLEMENTATION OF ASSURANCE  5.6.1 Objectives  The Cybersecurity Act (CSA) stipulates the definition and implementation of a scalable concept  for assurance requirements that shall support the basic, substantial and high levels and  stipulates a consistent implementation of these assurance levels across the schemes of the EU  cybersecurity certification framework.  This requires consistency for the specifications of security and assurance requirements as well  as evaluation and certification.  5.6.2 Introduction to a common assurance concept  The objective of a consistent implementation of assurance levels should be seen in the context  of the following targets:  1. The CSA established the EU cybersecurity certification framework to overcome the  fragmentation between cybersecurity certification schemes in the internal market. A  consistent implementation of key parameters such as risk, security and assurance level  across schemes will avoid fragmentation between schemes and enable the re-use and  referencing of certificates.  2. The CSA anticipates that the requirements for the certification of ICT products, ICT  processes and ICT services may vary depending on technologies, targeted markets,  responsible stakeholders etc. Specific cybersecurity certification schemes both under  public or industry responsibility may have to be established to support these needs.  Consequently, there may be numerous schemes under the EU cybersecurity certification  framework. All these schemes will try to optimize their operations, which is likely to lead to  deviations. Without appropriate measures, these deviations could lead to a fragmentation  between the schemes under the EU cybersecurity certification framework and prohibit the  recognition of certificates.  It will be apparent that there is a potential conflict between the two targets. Therefore, a balance  between the targets of recognition and re-use of certificates and the required flexibility for the  implementation of schemes has to be established.  It is proposed that the common assurance reference concept, which is described in the following  sections, would support the implementation of such a balance. It should be applied to all  cybersecurity certification schemes covered by the EU cybersecurity certification framework.  The idea is to establish a common set of parameters across all schemes, which will allow the  implementation of assurance between schemes to be compared as a prerequisite for the  recognition and re-use of certificates.  However, the need for flexibility mentioned above does not lend itself to a single, firm definition  of assurance for all schemes of the EU cybersecurity certification framework. Therefore, a  common assurance reference concept requires a pragmatic approach.  The idea is to adhere as far as possible to proven, trusted standards and methods but to allow  their use in a very flexible way. This is likely to lead to uncertainties and a need for interpretation  and alignment. In order to address this, the EU cybersecurity certification framework could  establish structures such as, for example, a team of experts from the schemes involved, to  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  54  promote alignment with regard to the comparability of definitions of scheme-specific assurance  levels within the schemes involved.  5.6.3 Selection of the basis for the common assurance reference concept  Several criteria should be taken into consideration to help define a meaningful selection of the  principles for the concept of common assurance levels for the EU cybersecurity certification  framework:  1. European or international standards  The CSA stipulates that European cybersecurity certification schemes should be based on  European or international standards. This also applies to crucial parts of the schemes and  is an important prerequisite both for acceptance in the European market and to enhance  the marketability of European suppliers in international markets. The assurance level  concept to be selected for the EU cybersecurity framework should therefore be based on  specifications in either European or international standards.  2. Availability and maturity of evaluation methods  The credibility of assurance levels is largely dependent on the trust of the market in the  evaluation methods that are associated with these levels. Such trust cannot be gained  overnight. The development of new evaluation methods for elevated security and  assurance levels, the deployment of evaluation facilities, the training of developers and  evaluators and, in particular, gaining the trust of the market in these new methods would  probably take years.  As a consequence, existing evaluation methods should be used if  available and applicable.  3. Available base of certified ICT products  Especially for the ramp-up phase of the EU cybersecurity certification framework, there will  be a need to integrate certified ICT products which are already available in the market.  The proposed assurance reference concept should allow these certified ICT products to be  re-used. This applies for certified ICT products which are already in use in a sectoral or  infrastructural ICT system and also to those which are to be introduced.  The following considerations should be taken into account:  ‒ It is advisable to rely on established European or international standards for scaled  assurance and to re-use the associated proven evaluation methodologies as far as  possible.  ‒ The EU cybersecurity certification framework is intended to serve a wide variety of  market sectors and related schemes. Therefore, sector-specific standards are  unsuitable as a basis for a consistent implementation of assurance levels across all  schemes. This narrows the options down to two sector-independent families of  international standards, the ISO/IEC 270xx and the ISO/IEC 15408 series of  standards.  ‒ The ISO/IEC 270xx series of standards is widely used for the implementation of  Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) in ICT systems and for the  certification of these implementations. It provides potentially the broadest coverage  globally for ICT systems owned by organizations. Information security risk  assessment methods are used for the identification of risk related to the intended use  of ICT products, ICT processes and ICT systems, taking into account the perspective  of organizations that provide ICT services. However, the ISO/IEC 270xx series of  standards does not define the term assurance, it does not use the concept of  assurance levels and does not support well-specified common evaluation methods.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  55  ‒ In contrast, the ISO/IEC 15408 series of standards supports scalable assurance and  complies with the above criteria. However, specific considerations are required if  ISO/IEC 15408-concepts, which are mainly known from Common Criteria certification  schemes, are to be used in a broad range of schemes for different ICT products, ICT  infrastructures and sectoral ICT systems under the EU cybersecurity certification  framework. This will be discussed in the following sections.  5.6.4 Potential for use of ISMS as a basis for the common assurance  reference concept  The proposed common assurance reference concept shall support ICT systems which employ  certified ICT services, ICT products and ICT processes and which, for the security of  stakeholder ICT systems, rely on ISMS certification. Consequently, the common assurance  reference concept should be defined in such a way that the integration of product certification  schemes and ISMS certification is possible.  ISMS certification takes its perspective from the system level, making sure that ICT products  and processes are integrated, operated and maintained as required to meet the information  security objectives of the organization.  Typically, ISMS certifications do not audit vulnerabilities on the ICT products, which are part of  the system. As described in Section 5.6.3, ISMSs do not work with defined security and  assurance levels since the targets for these vary, depending on the individual information  security objectives of the organization. Currently, there is no open evaluation methodology in  place, which could be commonly used across organizations and their ISMSs and referenced by  a cybersecurity certification scheme. The applicability of the proposed common assurance  reference concept to current ISMS-based certification concepts is therefore limited.  Product certification schemes, on the other hand, are not suitable for evaluations at system  levels. Their domain is the in-depth evaluation of ICT products up to a high level of assurance  and resistance against high attack potential.  Because of these fundamental differences in applicability, ISMS and product certification  schemes can be seen as complementary or even synergistic. Especially so, if ICT systems  within an ISMS are aiming to reach elevated assurance levels. Substantial or high assurance  can be associated with an ISMS if it employs ICT products certified at an appropriate assurance  level. As a result, the security architecture of sectoral or infrastructural ICT systems should be  defined in such a way that the required level of assurance is introduced through well-defined,  certified ICT products, ICT processes and supporting ICT services.  Based on these considerations, the definition of the common assurance reference concept  should focus on ICT product cybersecurity certification schemes as a foundation. An extension  to support ISMS-based approaches should be implemented as soon as the prerequisites are in  place, and in particular when one or more ISMS-based multi-level schemes for ICT systems or  ICT services will be publicly available. This will largely depend on the availability of an open,  common evaluation methodology for ICT systems that are used within an ISMS.  5.6.5 Definition of a common assurance reference concept based on  ISO/IEC 15408  ISO/IEC 15408 specifies seven Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL) together with related  definitions of assurance components to be addressed at each level. The analysis of  vulnerabilities can be seen as the central part of the evaluation activities described in the EAL  assurance packages and thus qualifies as the key parameter for a comparison of assurance.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  56  ISO/IEC 15408-3 specifies the vulnerability analysis by defining AVA_VAN assurance  components. These have five levels of increasing rigor and depth. The evaluation  methodologies for the AVA_VAN assurance components are well-defined, trusted by the  European and international markets and are implemented in numerous evaluation facilities  globally.  It may be worthwhile noting that AVA_VAN-based concepts are also used by some industry-  owned cybersecurity certification schemes. Although these may not always fully conform to  ISO/IEC 15408, they employ the AVA_VAN concept to take advantage of its proven evaluation  methodologies. This feature could provide a starting point to investigate the comparability of  assurance by using the structures mentioned in Section 5.6.2.  Following these considerations, the EU cybersecurity certification framework should establish  the common assurance reference concept based on ISO/IEC 15408’s AVA_VAN approach to  assurance levels and re-use the associated evaluation methodologies.  In order to allow deviations from the strict definitions of AVA_VAN assurance components in  ISO/IEC 15408, it is proposed that the term ‘Common Assurance Reference’ (CAR) should be  introduced.  The definition of Common Assurance References, based on ISO/IEC 15408’s definition of  AVA_VAN assurance components, is shown in the following table:  Table 7: Overview of Common Assurance Reference (CAR) levels  Common  Assurance  Reference  (CAR)  ISO/IEC 15408 baseline specification Associated baseline  contents for the  AVA_VAN assurance  components  Selected lead  parameter  Associated  EAL package  Related attack  potential  1  AVA_VAN.1  Vulnerability survey  EAL1 Basic See Annex  D.2  2  AVA_VAN.2  Vulnerability analysis  EAL2 Basic See Annex D.3  3  AVA_VAN.3 Focused  vulnerability analysis  EAL4 Enhanced-basic See Annex D.4  4  AVA_VAN.4  Methodical  vulnerability analysis  EAL5 Moderate See Annex D.5  5  AVA_VAN.5  Advanced methodical  vulnerability analysis  EAL6  High See Annex D.6  AVA_VAN assurance components define so-called ‘dependencies’, which provide a minimum  configuration of other assurance components that have to be addressed with vulnerability  analysis. In order to achieve full conformance with ISO/IEC 15408 the entire set of assurance  components from the lowest-level EAL package that includes the particular AVA_VAN-  component have to be carried out. This concept is also used in the EUCC scheme.  While this methodology does not imply full ISO/IEC 15408 conformance, it however requires that  the ATE_IND component of the lowest-level EAL package, which includes the selected  AVA_VAN-component is also included as part of the assurance activities of the associated CAR.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  57  5.6.6 Implementation of the common assurance reference concept  The application of the common assurance reference concept, as defined in Section 5.6.5, could  be described for three implementation scenarios. These are described in the following  subsections.  5.6.6.1 EUCC and other ISO/IEC15408-conformant cybersecurity certification schemes  The EUCC and potentially other public or industry schemes will implement assurance concepts  as described by the EUCC scheme based on the AVA_VAN assurance components.  Since full conformance with ISO/IEC15408 can be assumed, no further information exchange or  alignment between schemes in the EU cybersecurity certification framework is deemed  necessary in this scenario.  5.6.6.2 Cybersecurity certification schemes for cost-sensitive and evaluation time critical  conditions  European cybersecurity certification schemes, which address cost-sensitive ICT products with  basic or substantial assurance requirements, or which have to ensure short, predictable  evaluation times, may have to deviate from the methods implemented by classical CC schemes  such as the EUCC. Nevertheless, such schemes may wish to make sure that their certificates  are recognized by other cybersecurity schemes of the EU cybersecurity certification framework.  The common assurance reference concept could help these schemes adapt to economic or  market requirements while keeping comparability of assurance in the following ways:  1. The schemes could accept alternative approaches to provide evidence concerning certain  assurance components. Documentation could, for instance, be replaced by information  provided in audits or workshops.  2. If duly justified, certain assurance components could be skipped.  In the first case, conformance with ISO/IEC 15408 could still be possible.  In both cases, deviations from the standards and the classical approach must be justified and  documented in detail.  Deviations will probably lead to a need for discussion and alignment with the schemes that are  interested in recognizing the certificates. As proposed in Section 5.6.2, the EU cybersecurity  certification framework could establish structures (e.g. an expert group) that involve  representatives of the certifying scheme and those schemes that are interested in re-using  these certificates. This expert group could support the scheme by selecting an approach that is  commonly accepted for the targeted level of assurance.  Examples for alternative approaches to provide evidence are given in Annex E.  5.6.6.3 Evaluating assurance of external schemes  As stated before, there are market-relevant industry schemes, which re-use parts of  ISO/IEC 15408 such as the AVA_VAN assurance component definitions, as well as evaluation  methodologies from the ‘smartcard’ technical domain. Other known examples, such as the  eIDAS implementing regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/1502)6, refer to or employ  6 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502 of 8 September 2015 on setting out minimum technical  specifications and procedures for assurance levels for electronic identification means pursuant to Article 8(3) of  Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust  services for electronic transactions in the internal market  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015R1502&qid=1630050753803 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015R1502&qid=1630050753803 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015R1502&qid=1630050753803 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015R1502&qid=1630050753803  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  58  ISO/IEC 15408’s terminology on ‘attack potential’ to define their security and assurance  requirements.  The implementation of the proposed common assurance reference concept by the EU  cybersecurity certification framework would provide the option to use these similarities as a  starting point for a rough comparison of assurance with the respective specifications of such  cybersecurity certification schemes.  As described in Section 5.6.6.2, the EU cybersecurity certification framework could establish  structures that conduct an assessment if the assurance level provided by an external scheme  complies with the requirements of the EU cybersecurity certification framework. Of course, this  would require transparency concerning the methodologies applied by the external scheme.  5.6.7 Relevance of evaluation methodologies, support for new technical  domains  Evaluation methodologies, which are trusted by the market to prove the promised level of  assurance, are important assets of any cybersecurity certification scheme. This applies in  particular to elevated assurance levels.  Common Criteria schemes, like the EUCC, support the evaluation and certification of any kind  of ICT product up to AVA_VAN.3. Evaluation and certification for higher levels is restricted to  certain categories of products, termed ‘technical domains’. These provide domain-specific  information, for example on vulnerabilities, as well as dedicated methodologies, for instance  those used for evaluation and estimation of attack potential. This information and these  methodologies should not be re-used for other product domains without careful consideration,  and they will probably require adaptation before use.  EUCC currently supports two technology domains: ‘Hardware devices with security boxes’ and  ‘smartcards and similar devices’.  New technology or architectural trends may lead to a need for new technical domains. It can be  assumed that the evaluation of software (for example operating systems and web applications)  or cloud service systems for levels higher than CAR3/AVA_VAN.3 cannot be implemented  based on information and methodologies designed, for example, for the ‘smartcard’ technical  domain.  The implementation of all necessary guidance and the methodology for a new technical domain  takes a considerable amount of time and must be conducted using transparent, inclusive  processes.  It should be noted that the distinction between security functional requirements and security  assurance requirements, as stipulated in ISO/IEC 15408, could help to support a stepwise  approach in the event that the methods and guidance information of a technical domain are not  yet completely available. It would be possible to define a high level of security for the first step of  implementation but limit the level to CAR3/AVA_VAN.3. The upgrade to assurance at  CAR4/AVA_VAN.4 or CAR5/AVA_VAN.5 level could follow as a second step once the  evaluation methodologies for the technical domain are completely implemented.  5.6.8 Mapping to CSA assurance levels  The previous chapter documents the reasoning why the common assurance level concept,  which is based on ISO/IEC 15408’s AVA_VAN assurance components and the related EAL  packages, should be the basis for a consistent definition of common assurance references  throughout the schemes of the EU cybersecurity certification framework. The five CAR-levels,  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  59  which are defined by the common assurance reference concept, have to be assigned to the  three levels of assurance, which are stipulated by the CSA.  The following should also be considered:  ‒ In addition, for economic reasons, it is advisable that the evaluation should be carried out  in relation to the 5 common assurance reference levels or the equivalent AVA_VAN-based  definitions given in the EUCC. A structure that supports only 3 levels would probably not  support the degree of granularity needed to balance assurance requirements against the  effort of evaluation.  ‒ Both the CSA assurance level and the CAR-level should be documented in the certificate.  Theoretically, the assignment of common assurance references to CSA assurance levels could  be handled individually for each scheme. Moreover, in such cases, the proposed common  assurance level concept could serve as a reference for the consistent implementation of  assurance levels across all schemes of the EU cybersecurity certification framework.  5.6.9 Relationship between risk and assurance level concepts  According to the conceptual approach for consistency between risk and assurance, which is  described in Section 5.1, there should be, by default, a one-to-one relation between the same  levels of MRC and CAR.  However, it is a fundamental principle that the evaluation should reflect the assumed types of  attackers and their capabilities. As described in Section 5.4, the attack potential, which includes  the opportunity, means and motives of assumed attackers, will be estimated during the sectoral  assessment, which will be carried out in the preparatory phase of sectoral candidate scheme  drafting. The relationship between the levels of attack potential identified by CTI and the  respective levels specified in ISO/IEC 18045 is given in Table 4.  The motivation of potential attackers contributes to the classification of risk as described in  Section 5.3. However, it could occur that the risk assessment assigns a lower level to the MRC  than was detected by CTI for the AP.  This could lead to a CAR below the related level of attack  potential AP. In such a case, the following rule shall apply:  If the MRC is at a lower level than the AP level, the AP level should determine the level of the  CAR by using the relationship defined in Table 4. For instance, as shown in Table 8, for the  combination MRC1 and AP3, the CAR should be determined based on AP3. By this, it can be  ensured that the evaluation matches the opportunity and means of the potential adversaries.  During the sectoral assessment, the sectoral stakeholders may deviate from this default  relationship in some cases. Such deviations should be justified and documented during the  sectoral assessment.  A special case occurs if AP5, which matches a ‘beyond high’ attack potential according to  ISO/IEC 18045, was identified for the adversary. Evaluation methodologies for this level are  currently not available. Section 5.4 describes this case. The following figure illustrates the  principle:  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  60  Figure 12: Relationship between MRC, CAR and CSA assurance levels  The following table shows the possible combinations of MRC, AP and the resulting CAR for the  default scenarios.  Table 8: Common Assurance Reference (CAR) scorecard  AP levels  AP1 AP2 AP3 AP4 AP5  MRC  MRC1 CAR1/2 CAR3 CAR4 CAR5 Not supported  MRC2 CAR2 CAR3 CAR4 CAR5 Not supported  MRC3 CAR3 CAR3 CAR4 CAR5 Not supported  MRC4 CAR4 CAR4 CAR4 CAR5 Not supported  MRC5 CAR5 CAR5 CAR5 CAR5 Not supported  It should be noted that, as shown in Table 4, the parameter AP is related to the levels of attack  potential given in ISO/IEC 18045. The ‘Basic’ level relates to AVA_VAN.1/CAR1 and also  AVA_VAN.2/CAR2.  Exceptions from the default relationship between MRC, AP and CAR are allowed provided the  deviation is justified and documented. Extreme combinations such as MRC 1 in combination  with AP3 or AP4 may suggest careful considerations.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  61  5.7 TRIGGERS FOR REACTIONS TO UNEXPECTED EVENTS  There may be unexpected events (e.g. geopolitical crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic or massive  changes in the cyberthreat landscape) that could cause significant changes to the risk exposure  of the sectoral system and its ICT services (e.g. new vulnerabilities, new attack methods,  change of attacker motivation).  The sectoral stakeholders should implement a method that can re-start the methodology  described in this document in response to a defined trigger and specify the criteria for releasing  such a trigger.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  62  6. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE  SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY  ASSESSMENT  The objectives, principles and the approach for the sectoral cybersecurity assessment are  described in Chapter 5. The following sections document the workflows proposed for the  preparation and implementation of sectoral cybersecurity certification schemes.  6.1 OVERVIEW OF THE IMPLEMENTATION STEPS  The integration of the SCSA Methodology into the CSA’s workflow for the preparation of  cybersecurity certification candidate schemes is described in Subsection 5.2.2 and shown in  Figure 6.  Figure 13 shows the sequential steps that should be carried out and names the workflows that  are proposed for each step.  Figure 13: Sequential steps for the implementation of the SCSA Methodology  The workflows are described in the following sections.  6.2 WORKFLOW A ‘CONTEXT ESTABLISHMENT AND BUSINESS LAYER  ASSESSMENT’  The documentation of the sectoral context can be seen as an equivalent to the ‘context  establishment’ known from ISO/IEC 27005 for ISMS risk management7. All information relevant  for the assessment of sectoral risks and the definition of certification, security and assurance  requirements is collected and documented.  According to the SCSA Methodology, and as an extension to the approach given in  ISO/IEC 27005, not only is information relevant for consideration from the perspective of the  sectoral stakeholders (i.e. risk owners in terms of ISO/IEC 27005) documented but CTI and  attacker information are also documented.  7 ISO/IEC 27005 builds on the method defined in ISO/IEC 31000 for information security  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  63  Figure 14 depicts the proposed workflow for the documentation of the sectoral context which  was chosen as the basis for the sectoral assessment and for assessing the relevant business  layer information.  Figure 14: Workflow A ‘Context establishment and business layer assessment’  The activities to be conducted in the individual steps are described in the following list:  A-1 Scoping the sectoral context  This activity defines the sectoral context which defines the basis for the sectoral  assessment. The scope should be defined based on the customers that the sector  wants to address and the services and use cases that should be provided to these  customers. At this stage the sectoral stakeholders and their roles and responsibilities  should also be documented. The identification of stakeholders should include those  sectoral roles that contribute to the delivery of the targeted services, the coordinating  entity, consumers or their organizations, and governmental authorities that supervise or  regulate the sector.  A-2 Identification of required business processes  Based on the results from A-1 the business processes which are required to support  the targeted services and use cases should be documented. In addition, the sectoral  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  64  stakeholders contributing to or depending on the particular business processes should  be identified.  The following steps establish the context from the perspective of business processes and  related objectives:  A-3 Identification of stakeholder objectives and requirements for each business  process  The objectives and requirements of the involved stakeholders should be documented  for each business process. The goal should be to collect, depending on the roles of the  stakeholders involved, the relevant range of objectives from the business, customer,  societal or governmental perspective for each business process. Practical experience  shows that general objectives cannot always be linked to ICT incidents as would be  required for the assessment of risks. Therefore it is advisable to add more specific ICT-  related requirements to those objectives.  In addition, steps should be taken to ensure that generic risk areas are taken into  account for the definition of objectives and requirements for each business case.  Annex B contains a list of these risk areas.  A-4 Classification of objectives and requirements  The stakeholder’s objectives and requirements related to the particular business  processes may be relevant in the assessment of risks but there could also be  requirements that concern the characteristics of the cybersecurity scheme or others  that indicate stakeholders’ needs for assurance. The objectives and requirements  should be categorized and documented accordingly.  For the further steps of the workflow, the relationship between objectives and their  requirements, stakeholders and business processes must be kept.  The following steps establish the context from the architectural perspective:  A-5 Identification and documentation of ICT subsystems or processes supporting  business processes  Based on the documentation of the business processes, the ICT subsystem or process  supporting a particular business process should be documented. This should include  the architecture and all involved ICT products, services and processes, as well as  external ones that contribute to the ICT subsystem. In case of processes, for instance  the supply chain, the process flow and the supporting architecture and components  should be documented.  A-6 Identification of information and functional assets and related supporting assets  As described in Subsection 5.2.5 and based on the result of A-5, the primary  information and functional assets and their supporting assets should be identified and  documented for each ICT subsystem or process identified in A-5. In addition, an initial  ranking of the relevance of primary information and functional assets with regard to  stakeholders’ objectives identified in A-3 should be aligned with the sectoral  stakeholders involved in the related business process.  Information from A-8 on potential attack scenarios and attackers that could be  motivated and, in principle, be capable of conducting such attacks on information or  functional assets should be taken into account for this priority ranking. Those  information or functional assets prioritized by the ranking discussion should be seen as  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  65  primary assets and would become the basis for the definition of risk scenarios in  context assessment.  The following steps establish the context from the perspective of CTI and adversaries:  A-7 Documentation of context-specific CTI and relevant attacker types and their  properties  The first step of the context establishment regarding threats and adversaries should  generate an assessment of threats, CTI information and relevant attacker types for the  scope and business processes defined in A-1 and A-2. Existing sector-specific  information such as threat landscapes should be used as input. The identification of  relevant attacker types should use the list of attacker types given in Chapter 9 as its  basis. The estimation of the attack potential level and the motivation of attackers  should also apply the characteristics and methods defined in Chapter 9.  A-8 Documentation of relevant attack scenarios  Based on the results of A-7 and information on the relevant subsystems of the sectoral  architecture (A-5), relevant attack scenarios that could affect the primary assets (A-6)  should be identified and documented. The relevant attacker types and probability of the  implementation of the attack should also be estimated for each attack scenario.  The outcome may lead to a re-prioritization of the information and functional assets  identified in A-6. If any of these assets cannot be associated with an attack scenario  that is likely to occur it should be disregarded.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  66  6.3 WORKFLOW B ‘PRIMARY ASSET LAYER ASSESSMENT’  As described in Subsection 5.2.7, the primary asset layer assessment builds on the results of  Workflow A, ‘Context establishment and business layer assessment’.  The main targets of this workflow are the identification of relevant risk scenarios and the  assignment of meta-risk classes for each risk scenario. Figure 15depicts the proposed  workflow.  Figure 15: Workflow B ‘Primary asset layer assessment’  The activities to be conducted in the individual steps are described in the following list:  B-1 Identification of risk scenarios  In this step of the workflow, risk scenarios as described in Subsection 5.2.6 will be  defined based on the following information:  ‒ Stakeholder objectives or requirements related to a specific business process  as documented in A-R1.  ‒ Specific primary information or functional asset relevant to the selected  stakeholder objective or requirement as documented in A-R2.  ‒ Attack scenario targeting the specific primary information or functional asset  as documented in A-R3. Before applying this attack scenario it will be  reviewed and potentially specified in more detail by activity B-2.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  67  ‒ Information from an ISO/IEC 27005-conformant sectoral risk assessment may  be associated to the risk scenario.  ‒ Stakeholder information.  ‒ CTI information.  A specific stakeholder objective or requirement and a thereto related specific primary  information or functional asset which, if successfully attacked, could lead to cybersecurity  risks for the selected stakeholder objective are used as a starting point for consideration.  In the next step an attack scenario that targets the primary information or functional  asset and other information listed above will be added to the risk scenario.  If no scenario of an attack on the primary information or functional asset can be  identified and if there is no information from CTI or stakeholders that indicates the  practical relevance of the risk scenario, the risk scenario can be disregarded.  B-2 Specific assessment of attack scenarios for each risk scenario  As a supporting activity in parallel to B-1, the attack scenarios documented in A-R3 will  be reviewed for their relevance for a specific risk scenario which is defined in B-1. In  this process additional information from CTI or stakeholders may be added to enhance  and consolidate the description of the attack scenario.  B-3 Assignment of probability level and impact class for each risk scenario  For each risk scenario defined in B-1, the potential impact and the probability of its  occurrence is estimated. The methods for assigning the impact class and the  probability level are described in Subsection 5.3.3 and in Subsection 5.3.4. This activity  should be conducted in direct discussions with the stakeholders whose objectives  could be impacted by an incident as described by the risk scenario.  Every stakeholder type should describe his perception of the severity of the impact an  incident would have on his objectives or requirements and select an impact class.  Should the perceptions and choices of stakeholders diverge, a discussion that leads to  a jointly accepted impact class for the risk scenario should be facilitated. All  stakeholder positions and selections should be documented.  As a final step of the impact class identification, it must be verified that the selected  impact class complies with the minimum IC value given for the defined risk areas in  Annex B. The relation to a risk area is given if the stakeholder objective was defined in  relation to one of these risk areas as described in A-3.  The selection of the probability level depends mainly on the probability that the attack  scenario associated with the risk scenario will be implemented by the attacker. This  probability should be estimated based on the detailed attack scenario description  generated by B-2 and information that may be provided by stakeholders.  B-4 Assignment of the meta-risk class for each risk scenario  For each risk scenario that went through the assignment of an impact class and a  probability level in step B-3, a meta-risk class is assigned. The method for assessing  meta-risk classes is described in Subsection 5.3.5.  Risk scenarios should be documented including the impact class, the probability level  and the meta-risk class. The meta-risk class may be used for prioritising risk scenarios  for the assessment of supporting assets. The meta-risk class assigned to a risk  scenario is inherited by the primary asset and all its supporting assets.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  68  6.4 WORKFLOW C ‘ASSESSMENT OF SUPPORTING ASSETS’  As described in Subsection 5.2.7, the assessment of supporting assets builds on the results of  workflows A and B, the context establishment, business layer assessment and the primary  asset layer assessment.  The main targets of this workflow are the identification of the certification, security and  assurance requirements for supporting assets. The supporting assets to be assessed are  defined by the risk scenarios selected for the assessment. Figure 16 depicts the proposed  workflow.  Figure 16: Workflow C ‘Assessment of supporting assets’  The activities to be conducted in the individual steps are described in the following list:  C-1 Documentation of relevant parameters for each supporting asset and its  intended use  As a first step in the assessment of a specific supporting asset, parameters relevant to  that assessment are documented. This has to be conducted for the particular ‘intended  use’. The intended use of the supporting asset is defined, for instance, by the business  process to be supported, by its place and role in the ICT architecture and by the  primary assets that it supports.  The following parameters are deemed relevant for the subsequent steps of the  workflow and should be documented:  1. ‘Intended use’ of the supporting asset with reference to the supported business  process and its supporting primary information or functional assets.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  69  2. Meta-risk class for the intended use. The supporting asset inherits the MRC from  the risk scenario of which it is a part.  3. Operational environment for the specific intended use.  4. Typical high-level architecture and implementation technology.  5. Specifications and standards.  6. Specific stakeholder requirements.  7. Other sectors where the supporting asset may be in use.  Any business-layer requirements that, independently of risk- or attacker-based  considerations, could have an impact on the security, assurance or certification  requirements of the supporting asset should also be documented. This could apply, for  instance, where relevant regulations by national authorities exist.  It is not untypical that ICT products, processes or services serve a sectoral system in  various ‘intended uses’ or appear as supporting assets in several risk scenarios. If so,  the assessment has to be carried out for each relevant case. The MRC and the  certification, security and assurance requirements could diverge. Faced with such  results, the supplier would have the choice to either develop portfolios of ICT products,  processes or services optimized for the particular intended use or to have just one offer  which conforms to the most demanding case of ‘intended use’ but can be used for  those with lower requirements as well.  C-2 Re-assessment of estimated parameters  In the primary asset layer assessment, the MRC was assigned to a risk scenario based  on considerations of the consequences of a potential incident on the objectives of  stakeholders. Assuming that the incident could, in principle, be caused by attacks on  any supporting asset, the risk scenario’s MRC is inherited by those supporting assets.  However, this is not always the case. It could very well be that certain supporting  assets supporting a primary asset are not as prone to attacks as others and would  hence not contribute to the probability of the risk occurring as assumed at the primary  asset layer. If a supporting asset is also used by other sectors, this should be taken  into account as this could increase the motivation of attackers and the probability of an  attack.  Another parameter to be re-assessed is the APL of the attacker types listed in the risk  scenario’s attack scenario. In context establishment and in primary asset layer  assessment, due to the lack of detailed information on the targeted supporting assets,  only a general estimate of the APL is possible. C-1 generates information about the  operational environment, the technology etc. which could significantly change the  estimate of the opportunity and means of the relevant attacker types concerning the  particular supporting asset.  The re-assessment of the parameters estimated in Workflow A and Workflow B could  be conducted in the following steps:  1. The list of relevant attacker types and their APL associated with the relevant risk  scenarios should be reviewed with regard to the specific technology and  operational environment of the supporting asset. If available, CTI information  concerning the type of supporting asset should be taken into account. Any  changes to the most relevant attacker types and their APL and motivation should  be documented.  2. If changes to the probability level for the relevant risk scenarios have been  encountered in the previous step, the MRC should be recalculated. The revised  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  70  value should be assigned to the supporting asset and used for the definition of its  security and assurance levels. Furthermore, it should be checked whether new or  changed views on relevant attacker types, their capacities and motivation  stemming from the detailed assessment at supporting asset level, might suggest  an adapted assignment of the MRC that was associated with the risk scenario at  primary asset level in Workflow B. The revised value should be used for the  definition of the security and assurance level of the supporting asset.  Typically, sectoral stakeholders prefer to apply cybersecurity certification only to those  system components for which this is clearly warranted by an elevated level of risk or by  a dedicated need for assurance.  3. Therefore, in a further step in C-3, it could be decided that the re-assessed MRC  and attacker information suggests certification of the supporting asset is required.  Stakeholder objectives and requirements collected in A-3 and categorized in A-4  that indicate a need for assurance with regard to this supporting asset should  support such decision. In addition, whether sectoral measures already deployed  for the supporting asset would make a certification redundant needs to be  checked.  C-3 Definition of specific security and assurance levels  Based on the consolidation of the APL, the probability level and MRC for the specific  supporting asset, and by considering potential risk-independent obligations in C-2, the  CAR and CSL levels should be defined. If the sector plans to deploy different variants  of the supporting asset depending on its intended use and operational environment,  the assignment of security and assurance levels should be carried out for each variant.  The use of attack potential for the selection of security levels and assurance levels is  described in Section 5.4.  The risk-based definition of common security levels and the assignment of the CSL  based on the MRC and the APL are described in Section 5.5.  The risk-based definition of common assurance levels and the assignment of the CAR  based on the MRC and the APL are described in Section 5.6.  Certain results of this workflow should be made available to suppliers or owners of supporting  assets so that they can optimize their ICT systems, products, processes or services with regard  to the requirements identified. This includes, for instance:  ‒ Information about the ‘intended use’ and the operational environment of the supporting  ICT product, ICT process or infrastructural ICT service,  ‒ Minimum security and assurance requirements to be implemented by the sectoral  stakeholders in their ISMS-supported ICT systems,  ‒ Information as required by ICT product developers for the ICT product’s security  problem definition, security functional requirements (SFR) and security assurance  requirements (SAR).  The SCSA Methodology provides in Chapter 7 and in Annex D guidance for the transfer of this  information and for its translation into the terminology typically used by ICT product definition  and evaluation.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  71  6.5 WORKFLOW D ‘SUPPORTING ASSET GAP ANALYSIS’  The assessment of supporting assets described in Section 6.4 documents the ‘intended use’ of  supporting assets and identifies the requirements for certification, security and assurance. The  goal of workflow D is to ensure that these requirements can be implemented and verified.  Existing specifications and certification means should be re-used as far as possible.  This workflow starts with an analysis of the extent to which these requirements are already  covered by the supporting asset and the extent to which existing means could be used for  evaluation and certification. Gaps should be identified and resolutions to these gaps proposed.  Figure 17 depicts the proposed workflow.  Figure 17: Workflow D ‘Supporting asset gap analysis’  The activities to be conducted in the individual steps are described in the following list:  D-1 Documentation of the ‘status quo’  As a first step of this workflow, the status quo of the supporting asset and the certification  scheme that is potentially already applicable should be identified. The following  information should be collected and documented for the supporting asset type:  ‒ System specifications describing the role of the supporting assets in the system,  ‒ Open specifications and standards describing the functions and architecture of the  supporting asset,  ‒ Security specifications,  ‒ Specifications for security evaluation and certification that already exist.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  72  D-2 Identification of gaps  D-1 documented the status quo regarding the relevant specification of the supporting  asset. In this step the extent to which these available specifications and tools cover the  specific intended use and the identified requirements for certification, security and  assurance should be assessed:  ‒ An analysis should be carried out to ensure that all functions of the supporting  asset, which are required for its intended use, are sufficiently specified. The  relevant standards should be referenced and gaps should be documented.  ‒ An analysis should be carried out to clarify if all required functions and security  features of the supporting asset are supported by the existing specifications at the  CSL and CAR levels required. Any gaps should be documented.  The results of the gap analysis should be summarized in a way that it can be used as  input to the definition of a security problem and the definition of security objectives for  ISO/IEC 15408-conformant product certification, and also for comparison with existing  protection profile (PP) or security targets, or as external requirements to define an  ISMS and its risk management process, whichever is appropriate for the particular  supporting asset.  D-3 Generate resolution proposals  To support the appropriate implementation of the supporting asset’s defined features,  security and assurance level, resolutions for the gaps identified in D-2 should be  developed and communicated.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  73  7. RE-USE OF SECTORAL  ASSESSMENT RESULTS FOR ICT  PRODUCT DEFINITION  7.1 OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND  The CSA stipulates that the security and certification requirements for ICT services, ICT  products and ICT processes and the related assurance levels should be identified based on the  risk associated with their intended use. This requires an assessment of the sectoral or  infrastructural environment that employs these ICT services, ICT products and ICT processes.  The previous chapter proposes a consistent approach to risk, security and assurance. It  documents how a sectoral risk assessment in combination with CTI can provide required  information about the MRC, the use and the operational environment of the ICT services, ICT  products or ICT processes, which are a supporting asset for the sector or infrastructure. This  information also includes, for instance, the identification of potential adversaries, their motivation  and capacity to launch an attack.  The proposed methodology for identifying security and assurance requirements at sectoral or  infrastructural level uses the ISO/IEC 270xx series of standards as normative references. Terms  that describe risk etc. are in accordance with ISO/IEC 270xx. The employed risk assessment  methods, which may be specific to sectors, and their results are conformant with  ISO/IEC 27005.  However, the security and assurance requirements for ICT products and potentially ICT  processes are often documented using the ISO/IEC 15408 series of standards. The difficulty is  that the two series of standards are not harmonized. Terms and methods may diverge.  The objective of the conceptual work described in this section is to allow an exchange of  relevant information between the methodology applied at sectoral and infrastructural level,  which follows ISO/IEC 270xx, and an ISO/IEC 15408-based approach to security and  assurance of ICT products.  The following use cases should be supported:  1. Submission of security and assurance requirements associated with sectoral use as input  to the definition of an ICT product.  2. Assessment of ICT products already certified to check their suitability for sectoral use,  based on their existing certification.  3. Submission of information on attacker capabilities (attack potential) for the purpose of an  evaluation.  All three cases require the provisioning of relevant information from the sectoral assessment  methodology and its mapping into an ISO/IEC 15408-compliant format.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  74  7.2 CONCEPTUAL APPROACH  The targeted re-use of information from sectoral assessments for the purposes of the developer  of an ICT product or ICT process has the following prerequisites:  1. Clarification of terms and definitions  The terms defined in the ISO/IEC 270xx and ISO/IEC 15408 series of standards may  diverge. For a transfer of information generated by methods governed by one standard to  the other it is necessary to identify potential divergences and to consider the particular  context in which they will be used. Section 7.3 contains a comparison of divergent terms  and describes the boundary conditions which should be taken into account when  transferring related information.  2. Mapping table  A dedicated table should support the mapping of the information generated by a sectoral  assessment with the information needed for the definition of security and assurance  requirements for ICT products by an ISO/IEC 15408-based methodology. Figure 18  illustrates the principle.  Figure 18: Mapping between ISO/IEC 270xx and ISO/IEC 15408 methodologies  The following sections describe the mapping. A mapping table is given in Annex C.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  75  7.3 GUIDANCE FOR DIVERGENT DEFINITIONS OF TERMS  Some definitions of terms given in the series of ISO/IEC 270xx and the series of ISO/IEC 15408  standards, which are the normative references for this project, diverge from each other. A  transfer of information from the sectoral assessment to the specification of security and  certification of ICT products requires a sound understanding of the meaning of the relevant  terms on both sides.  A simple mapping of terms could lead to misinterpretations because the ISO/IEC 270xx series  and the ISO/IEC 15408 series of standards follow very different philosophies and purposes. The  concept, which was developed for this project, considers these specific boundary conditions and  explains terms in both groups of standards based on their overall objectives and the  relationships between terms in each standard (see Section 2.3). These considerations and a  mapping between terms in ISO/IEC 270xx and ISO/IEC 15408 are given in Annex A.  7.4 MAPPING TO SECURITY PROBLEM DEFINITION  The outputs of the sectoral risk assessment generated by an ISO/IEC 27005-conformant  method, and used for the definition of the meta-risk class (see Section 5.3) can be re-used as  inputs to the definition of the security problem in the context of the ISO/IEC 15408 security  assessment of an ICT product.  A security problem definition typically consists of the determination of the threats the ICT  product must be able to counter, the assumptions about the environment the product potentially  relies on to ensure its security, and the organizational policies to be put in place by the ICT  product itself or by its environment to fulfil various type of requirements as standards,  regulations or interoperability requirements.  7.4.1 Threats  Threats against an ICT product can be seen as an action against an asset associated with the  ICT product, performed by an attacker with particular expertise and means, and which results in  an unwanted event from the perspective of the ICT product with a negative impact, more or less  directly, on the overall ICT system.  Each item of a threat is detailed in the subsequent sub-sections and a synthesis is shown in  Annex C.  7.4.1.1 Assets  The list of assets associated with an ICT product constitutes the target of attacks. At the product  level, such assets can be of different types, as data (e.g. keys, passwords, user personal data)  or services (e.g. access to encryption, signature verification).  Some assets can be related to the assets of an ICT service or ICT infrastructure making use of  the ICT product, such as, for example, a cryptographic key associated with an ICT service. A  description of these assets from the point-of-view of the ICT service/infrastructure, also called  primary assets, must be provided as part of the output of the sectoral assessment.  Other assets are specific to the ICT product implementation. These are to be determined by the  related standards and/or the ICT product developer.  7.4.1.2 Unwanted events (incidents) with negative effects  In defining the security problem, a list of assets is not sufficient to determine how attacks can be  exploited to cause damage. For instance, considering a cryptographic certificate, for extracting it  is unlikely to have a negative effect (assuming it is public information), while replacing it could  result in an impersonation attack with negative consequences.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  76  Therefore, in order to determine the risk, it is also necessary to identify the unwanted events  (incidents) that could happen to the ICT product and that would have subsequent negative  effects on the ICT system.  Negative effects on the ICT system are mostly identified by the sector and/or organization  through risk assessment. For instance, without understanding the context within which a  signature service is used, it would not be possible to determine if the inability to access that  service would have negative consequences on the overall ICT system, the result being that  such negative consequences cannot be defined at the ICT product development level.  Thus, from knowledge of both negative effects and of how the ICT product functions, the  consequences of unwanted events at the ICT product level can be determined. For instance, if  the inability to access a signature service is indeed considered a negative effect, an associated  unwanted event at the ICT level could be the erasing of the signature key.  As another example, if the disclosure of some user data is considered a negative effect, an  associated unwanted event at the ICT level could be a bypassing of the mechanism for  controlling access to the confidential information.  The list of unwanted events is determined in part (at a sectoral level) based on the estimation of  an impact class as described in subsection 5.3.3.  7.4.1.3 Attack surface, inherent and potential vulnerabilities  The hardware and software components and interfaces of an ICT product determine its attack  surface. Knowledge of this attack surface is needed to allow the definition of what means of  attack and techniques can be used to target an ICT product. For instance, the use of a well-  known hardware or software technology could directly discount some attacks and attack  techniques and thus the threat from those attacks.  Knowledge of the attack surface also enables the existence of inherent or potential  vulnerabilities to be determined. For example, the use of a certain CPU implies that Spectre8-  like attacks are automatically applicable, or the use of some specific DDRAM implies that  Rowhammer9-like attack techniques can be used to inject faults. As a result, threats based on  this type of fault injection must be taken into consideration.  The dimension of the attack surface is also an essential indicator of the effort that might be  expended on vulnerability analysis, as well as of the probability of the presence of security  issues.  Information to establish this attack surface mainly comes from the ICT product developer.  However, as part of its risk assessment the sector may also monitor vulnerabilities related to the  hardware and/or software technologies within the ICT products used in the ICT system.  Furthermore, some sectors and organizations have compiled checklists with common potential  vulnerabilities that can be followed. One resource that can be used in the context of such an  assessment is the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)10, which lists, describes and  structures typical software and hardware vulnerabilities in ICT systems. Note that, at the level of  threat definition, the attack surface does not need a lot of technical detail.  8 https://spectreattack.com  9 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer  10 https://cwe.mitre.org/  https://spectreattack.com/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer https://cwe.mitre.org/  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  77  7.4.1.4 Threat agents  Threat agents are potential attackers of the ICT product. ‘Attackers’ can be of different types  (e.g. human or accidental) and have different motivations (e.g. financial for crime organizations,  reputation for independent hackers). See Subsection 9.3 for more details on threat agents.  Depending on the context in which an ICT product will be used, not all threat agents are  relevant and related threats can therefore be excluded. For instance, for an ICT product used in  a not-for-profit, non-political organization, threats agents are unlikely to be criminal  organizations with sophisticated means of attack (see next section).  The threat agents applicable to an ICT product therefore depend on the operational  environment and the final use to which the product is put. Such information can only be  provided by the organization or the sector using the ICT product, and is typically an output of the  sectoral and organizational risk assessment.  Member state agencies tasked with cyber defence frequently provide briefings and threat  landscape overviews on currently occurring threats to selected sectors, for example, those with  organizations that are part of a critical infrastructure. Other means of obtaining this information  are through the membership in ISACs (Intelligence Sharing and Analysis Centres)11 as well as  community-driven and commercial providers of threat intelligence.  Note that the exclusion of threat agents is usually one of the assumptions made concerning the  operational environment (see Subsection 7.4.2).  7.4.1.5 Attack means  Means of attack include all the hardware and software tools and techniques that a threat agent  could use to attack an ICT product, such as, for example, lasers, electromagnetic probes or  binary editors.  As is the case for threat agents, not all attack means are relevant and related threats can be  excluded depending on the context in which the ICT product is used. For instance, for an ICT  product not physically accessible by any attacker, all threats based on attack techniques  requiring physical access to the ICT product do not apply.  Note that attack means are closely related to the expertise, the financial resources and the  privileges of the threat agent.  As for threats agents, the means of attack applicable to an ICT product depend on the  operational environment and the final use of the product, which can only be provided by the  organization or the sector deploying the ICT product. Such information is typically an output of  the sectoral and organizational risk assessment, as well as forensic investigations of previous  incidents which are shared among stakeholders, for example in the context of an ISAC.  Note that exclusion of attack means is usually part of the assumptions made concerning the  operational environment (see Subsection 7.4.2).  7.4.2 Assumptions  The context in which of an ICT product is used can allow the mitigation of some threats when  counter measures cannot be implemented in the ICT product itself, for various reasons (e.g.  technical, financial, human). For instance, the administrator of an ICT product must be trusted  as no counter measures can fully prevent malicious actions by a user with high-level privileges.  11 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Sharing_and_Analysis_Center  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Sharing_and_Analysis_Center  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  78  The definition of assumption is mainly based on the outputs of risk assessments. This includes,  in particular, the list of security measures implemented by the operational environment and that  are essential to the security of the product.  Note that the list of such security measures may originate from security requirements stipulated  by the ICT product developer.  7.4.3 Organizational Security Policies  Organization security policies are implementation requirements for an ICT product or for its  operational environment. These policies specify some aspects of the implementation of the ICT  product or its operational environment. For instance, a policy could specify which algorithm is to  be implemented to allow the interoperability requirement from a sector or to fulfil a national  regulation.  Typical organizational security policies express requirements from national or sectoral  regulations, standards to be followed, accreditation and certification to be obtained, etc.  The definition of security policies can originate from different needs such as national  regulations, sector requirements for interoperability, etc. All these are usually identified by risk  assessment.  7.5 MAPPING TO ASSURANCE LEVELS  For the assessment of ICT products based on ISO 15408, Evaluation Assurance Levels (EALs)  need to be defined. No formal methodology to determine this assurance level has been defined.  However, in practice outputs from risk assessments used to determine such assurance levels  include the list of unwanted events (see 7.4.1.2), an estimation of the impact each event may  have and the likelihood of each event occurring. Annex C provides examples of the information  to be provided to assess the risk and determine the level of assurance.  These inputs are part of those required for the establishment of the CSA meta-risk class defined  in Section 5.3. Details about the relations between the risk assessment items used to establish  the assurance level and CSA Meta-Risk classes are shown in Subsection 5.6.9.  A mapping between the Common Assurance Reference (CAR) and the EALs defined in  ISO/IEC 15408 is provided in Chapter 5.6.5.  7.6 MAPPING TO SECURITY LEVELS  For ICT product assessment based on ISO 15408, a security level concept is not defined.  However, the choice of security features (similar to security controls) during the security  definition of the ICT product is commonly based on the outputs of risk assessment , such as  unwanted events, the evaluation of the impact of each event and the likelihood of an event  occurring, as well as the ICT product architecture and related potential of known vulnerabilities.  As shown in Subsection 5.5.3, this methodology also includes the attack potential as a  parameter.  Annex C. provides examples of the information to be provided by risk assessment for  determining the security level.  Those inputs are part of those required for the establishment of the CSA meta-risk class defined  in Section 5.3. Details about the relations between the risk assessment items used to establish  the security level and CSA meta-risk classes are shown in Subsections 5.5.3 and 5.6.9.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  79  8. DEFINITION AND APPLICATION  OF COMMON CONTROLS  8.1 OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND  In general, the CSA promotes a proactive approach to implementing security. Security-by-  design is proposed as a way to put this in place.  In the context of cybersecurity certification, the CSA stipulates that the security and certification  requirements for ICT services, ICT products and ICT processes and the related assurance  levels should be identified based on the risk associated with their intended use. In addition, the  CSA requires that certificates should reference technical controls [CSA, Art. 52.4] and that these  should be documented for each assurance level [CSA, recital 86].  8.2 COMMONLY USED CONTROLS  The consistent definition of risk, security and assurance is a key part of the SCSA Methodology.  Chapter 5 documents how a default relationship between the common assurance reference  level and common security levels can be established by using the meta-risk classes and attack  potential as joint reference points. This addresses the CSA’s requirements described in Section  8.1. Section 5.5 describes how the concept of common security levels can be used to define  controls in accordance with their capabilities to mitigate certain levels of risk and attack  potential. On this basis, there is now the option to define and deploy controls, which are scaled  according to the CSL concept, in a way that is common across sectorial domains and the  supporting ICT systems, ICT products and ICT processes.  This option for a common, cross-sector use of controls suggests that a set of controls for  common use should be defined. Such a set of controls:  ‒ could serve as reference for the introduction of security-by-design,  ‒ could reduce the time-demand and cost of development, implementation and testing of  ICT systems, ICT products and ICT processes,  ‒ could significantly reduce the evaluation effort for the supported ICT systems, ICT  products and ICT processes, as a set of controls could be integrated in the form of a  certified product.  In the long run, developing and deploying certified libraries of controls for common use could  improve security and assurance across sectors and at the same time reduce the cost and risk of  development and implementation.  Further benefits could arise when combining common controls with the scalability provided by  the common security levels described in Section 5.5. Two examples are described in the  following two paragraphs.  8.2.1 Introducing common security levels to ISMS  When deployed in the ISMS of sectoral stakeholders, scaled CSL-enabled controls which are  defined as a result of the assessment of sectoral risk and attack potential could introduce a  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  80  defined and appropriate level of security to certain functions of the ICT system, a feature which  is currently not supported by the ISMS-standard series ISO/IEC 270xx.  8.2.2 Concatenating controls  As described in Subsection 5.5.3, it may be necessary to protect against a certain attack  potential or risk by developing the common security level required to mitigate the certain level of  this attack or risk using a well-defined combination of concatenated controls. Such cases are  quite common where parts of the ICT system provide limited options to deploy controls with  elevated CSL. An example could be a low-cost IoT device where elevated CSL and CAR would  be unaffordable but where, at the same time, an elevated risk or attack potential applies.  Another common case could arise from third-party devices, which are intended to be integrated  into the sectoral system, but where there is an option for adapting the CSL or CAR to the  necessary levels.  Such concatenation of controls should be discussed and documented during the sectoral risk  assessment and treatment conducted by the ad hoc working group that supports the  preparatory phase for drafting a sectoral candidate scheme. If a set of concatenated controls is  to be implemented across various ICT products, ICT processes and ICT services, it is essential  that all involved stakeholders are well informed. Examples for concatenated controls are given  in Section 8.4.  8.3 SAMPLE LIST OF COMMON CONTROLS  Generating an exhaustive library of common controls would have exceeded the scope of the  project for developing this methodology. Instead, there is now an indicative list of samples that  can be used to demonstrate the principle for scaling controls according to the CSL structure and  their application in sectoral ICT systems, ICT subsystems within ISMS, in ICT products and in  ICT processes. This list of indicative examples is given in Annex F.  8.3.1 Terminology  According to the methodology, the selection of controls would be based on information  generated by an ISO/IEC 270xx-based sectoral risk assessment. Therefore, the terminology  used for the definition of controls follows ISO/IEC 270xx.  8.3.2 Definition of controls and assigning the common security level (CSL)  As described in Section 5.5, the definition of controls will follow the principle described in  ISO/IEC 27002. One or more control objectives will be defined to address a certain risk. In a  next step, controls that support these control objectives are defined. There may be several  controls for each control objective and these may vary depending on the targeted component  (ICT product, ICT process or ICT system), on the market, technology etc.  To establish a common set of controls it would probably make sense to reuse control objectives  from ISO/IEC 27002 or define new control objectives which could be employed across sectors.  The association of a control with a particular CSL should be based on an estimation of the  attack potential (AP) that the control could resist. The characteristics defined for the description  of attackers and the estimation of attack potential given in Chapter 9.4 provide guidance on  performing this categorization.  8.4 EXAMPLES OF THE COORDINATED APPLICATION OF CONTROLS  A coordinated application of controls enables a common security level to be increased by  introducing several controls at a lower level. The idea is that a combination of two or more  controls at CSL x can lead to an overall CSL greater than x for the system. In the following  example scenarios, the CSLs listed in the tables are sometimes lower than the overall targeted  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  81  CSL for the system. The idea is to show two scenarios, one with a hardened secure processing  environment in the mobile phone at the targeted system CSL and one for a mobile phone with  lesser capabilities but ‘compensating’ backend support.  8.4.1 Example use case ‘Mobile device based authentication system’  Mobile phones are a constant companion in everyday life and are increasingly used in solutions  where more traditional methods might have been deployed, in, for example, controlling access  to buildings.  1. Area of usage  ‒ Corporate building or site access control,  ‒ Managed shared building or site access control,  ‒ Public transport.  2. Adversary  Depending on the site, building, or company’s assessment of risk, the required CSL can  take any level from 1 to 5.  3. Control objectives and examples for concatenating controls  The use case described does not address all security aspects and functions. Instead, this  example centres on controls used to store and process access credentials in a mobile  phone. The minimum security functionalities in the mobile phone features include trusted  product identity, secure communication support, secure storage and secure processing of  cryptographic functions. For simplicity, these are summarized under the control objective  mobile phone access control support features.

CYBERTHREAT INTELLIGENCE  Cyberthreat intelligence - the study of adversaries and their techniques, tactics and procedures -  can provide an important contribution to a risk assessment process. Being a relatively new field,  this chapter provides a brief introduction into threat intelligence, as well as some discussion how  information of threats can be used for risk assessment and treatment.  9.1 WHAT IS THREAT INTELLIGENCE?  In order to effectively defend yourself, you have to understand what threats you might be  potentially facing and how they operate. Consider the example of a shop keeper who would like  to protect the business against a burglary. In order to confidently invest into security, the shop  keeper needs to know how burglaries would typically take place, such as would robbers pick the  lock or smash the window, and then use this knowledge to, for example, invest in a better door  lock in lieu of bars in front of the shop window. Although this seems an obvious and natural  strategy in the case of physical security, the same holds true for cyberthreats. Sound  investments into security can only be made given sufficient information about threats.  While characterizing and assessing cyberthreats we know about is already somewhat  challenging, we also need to consider the known unknowns and even the unknown unknowns.  In other words, there are threats we are aware of but have no readily available data at hand to  quantify, and there are threats that we do not even know exist and hence are not part of the  current risk management methodology. The goal of cyberthreat intelligence is to identify and  characterize potential threat actors, exchange information about their tactics, techniques and  procedures (TTPs) and observables, and build a comprehensive view about the cyberthreat  landscape an organization, sector or society is facing.  As such, cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) is a natural complement to an ISO 31000 risk  management process and augments it as shown in Figure 19 in various stages.  First, the operational risk management cycle requires a comprehensive identification of all  potential risk sources. Here, cyberthreat intelligence can supplement insights into threats that  occurred elsewhere but were previously not considered by the organization.  Second, for the analysis and evaluation of cyber risks, CTI can provide information about  whether a particular threat is targeting a particular geographical region or industry and how it  operates, and thus help quantify the likelihood and potential impact of a particular risk.  Third, controls need to be selected to adequately treat a risk. With respect to cyberthreats and  their dynamic behaviour this means that the organization needs to select those controls that  exceed the currently level of capability, otherwise a particular countermeasure is easily  bypassed by an adversary. Here, cyberthreat intelligence can provide insights on current  techniques in use by threat actors and their capability levels.  Finally, by sharing information about the threats faced and past incidents with others in their  sector, organizations can further adapt their control portfolio, deploy new or tune existing  controls, and improve detection by monitoring for specific artefacts known to belong to particular  threat actors.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  85  Figure 19: Interconnection of cyberthreat intelligence with organizational risk management  9.2 WHAT IS A THREAT?  In risk management, the level of risk is typically measured as a function of likelihood and impact,  i.e. risk = likelihood x impact or, more generically, risk = f(likelihood, impact). While this method  works well for non-cyberthreats where a good quantification of frequency and consequences is  available, this is more challenging in case of cyberthreats and especially adversaries that act  intentionally. Here, threats do not remain static but will on the one hand change over time and  on the other hand also change in response to the organization and the measures it takes.  This makes it frequently challenging to determine reliable estimates for these values. We also  have to realize these values are a direct outcome of the interplay between adversary and victim.  Consider again the example of the physical shop: if a burglar intends to break in and existing  controls such as the door lock, security door or safety glass exceed the criminal’s level of  capability, the probability that this threat actor at this particular moment will successfully break in  is zero. If the controls, however, are insufficient and below the adversary’s attack capabilities, a  successful break-in would likely be certain.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  86  Figure 20: Adversaries can be characterized in terms of their means, motives and opportunities  to establish whether they pose a threat to an organization.  Whether or not a particular actor is actually a threat to an ICT system or to an organization thus  depends on the characteristics of the adversary, namely his/her means, motive and opportunity  as shown in Figure 20. An adversary only presents a potential cyberthreat, if the attacker has  the means to execute an attack, the opportunity to do so and exploit a vulnerability, and a  motive to target the victim in question. Threat actors pose no risk if any of the three components  is not present. Examples would be an adversary who would be interested in performing the  attack but does not have the capability to surpass existing controls, or an attacker who has the  capability but does not go after a particular type of victim.  Interestingly, money can substitute for any components under opportunity and motive. For  example, an adversary lacking the necessary capabilities could buy an exploit for a vulnerability  or outsource an attack to more capable cyber mercenaries. Thus, within the context of  intentional cyberthreats, risk thus becomes a function of likelihood, impact and the threat actor.  Cyberthreat intelligence provide insights into the means, motives and opportunities of  adversaries. This includes information about the threat actors, their intentions and past targets  and accomplishments, but also insights into techniques a particular actor has used before and  the tools to which the adversary has been observed to have access. Based on information from  past compromises (or attempts at doing so), CTI also collects information about vulnerabilities  particular actors have exploited in the past and the various modus operandi they have used  previously.  9.3 TYPES OF ATTACKERS  A high-level view of the potential threats to an ICT system is presented in Figure 21. In a  first stage we differentiate between a threat that is the result of a natural cause, such as  flood, tectonic activity or wind, and one that is the result of a person triggering the  vulnerability. Even further, when it comes to human actors, we need to differentiate, for the  sake of cyber defence, between an actor who is unintentionally creating damage and an  actor who has a deliberate intention to cause harm. In the latter case, we typically refer to  the threat actor as an attacker or adversary.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  87  Figure 21: High level decomposition of threats into natural and human causes, as well as  unintentionally and intentionally-acting adversaries.  In the literature of cyberthreat intelligence, lists and taxonomies of cyberthreat actors are still  being developed. Overall most proposal lists identify the following threat actors with specific  motivations and abstract levels of capability:  INTENTIONAL ACTORS  Disgruntled Employees or Insider Attackers are a class of threats with detailed knowledge of  an organization and its systems. Examples of this adversary class are staff, contractors,  vendors, customers, or former employees. While this type of adversary has only medium-level  capability (while of course there could also be insiders with intricate system knowledge and  skills), a complicating factor in this group is that attackers have access to valid credentials, know  about processes and security systems and how to circumvent them. Common motivations for  these attackers are dissatisfaction about the working environment, the organization’s or  industry’s activities, corruption, or revenge.  Cyber Terrorists perform violent activities and sabotage in an attempt to influence public  opinion and decision-making. Although the primary objective of cyber terrorist activities is the  sabotage and destruction of property, these actors are also indifferent or even in support of  creating harm to people and society in general. Cyber terrorists may command significant  resources. The asymmetry between the costs to defenders and offenders in an attack means  that even moderately funded groups can have a significant impact on assets and systems.  Hacktivists / Civil Activists most commonly extract and expose data or disrupt business  operations for ideological reasons or to draw attention to a political, social or moral agenda.  While highly motivated, actors in this group are typically non-violent and may draw on external  support in terms of capabilities and resources.  (Organized) Cyber Crime. The shared motivation of the broad spectrum of actors in this class  is the goal of obtaining a financial profit from online criminal activities. Cyber-criminal activities  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  88  span the entire spectrum from coercion and ransom, abuse of e-finance or e-payment services,  malware authoring and distributing, cryptomining, the collection, sale and abuse of personal  data, to the sale of counterfeit goods. By now, a very diverse ecosystem of specialization exists  in the cybercrime underground economy, which means that specialist knowledge, expert tools  or even (parts of) the criminal activity can be outsourced or externally acquired. This effectively  lowers the bar to entry, as attackers with insufficient capabilities and resources can augment  their deficiencies using money, potentially in the form of a cut from the criminal proceeds,  culminating in the emergence of ‘cybercrime as a service’.  Script Kiddies are typically incapable from the perspective of technology, and make use of  externally provided tooling and instructions to perform their activities. Common motivation for  this type of adversary is the interruption of service, often executed through distributed denial-of-  service attacks, with the underlying goal of public recognition or exploration. The frequent lack  of inherent capabilities is often compensated for by outsourcing as, for example, tooling or even  attacks themselves can be acquired via the criminal underground at a trivial cost.  State-Sponsored Attackers / Government Spies operate to obtain access to privileged  information, such as intellectual property, business plans, roadmaps, personnel or customer  data, etc. as well as insight into business operations and upcoming decision-making or to  establish a foothold in systems in order to achieve future objectives. This information is used to  gain an edge in negotiations, predict future activities or ascertain likely responses. Frequently,  these actors are in direct contact with commercial entities in their respective countries to deliver  information that could be used for a commercial advantage. Their activity is driven by ideology  and personal gain, and they are a potent attacker as they can command government resources  and have an advanced set of skills and capabilities.  Competitors / Commercial Industrial Espionage Agents try to gain a commercial advantage  through the theft of intellectual property, documentation on business operations and decisions  or customer data.  They may also damage the targeted organization by modifying or destroying  business information. If not executing these activities themselves, they often outsource them to  cyber mercenaries, highly trained specialists with sophisticated tooling who pursue offensive  cyber activities for profit.  Cyberwarriors / Individual Cyber Fighters are patriotically motivated types of actors, who are  not on a government payroll but operate independently. They may be directly controlled or  influenced by a nation or are individuals or groups of people driven by their political, social,  ethical, or religious values. They may be officially sanctioned or supported by a nation state, and  could be equipped with resources or training by the nation state, which significantly raises their  level of opportunity and means.  Cyber Vandals / Cyber Punks’ main motivation is the destruction of property, driven by the  quest for personal satisfaction and dominance. This group of actors is usually not driven by  ideology, and has a narrow spectrum of capabilities around attacks on availability.  Blackhat Hackers / Crackers try to gain access to systems out of curiosity and personal gain,  which may range from financial rewards from exploiting data, products and systems they obtain,  or in terms of reputation and recognition among their peers. While a highly diverse group of  actors, their capabilities may be highly sophisticated and they may command significant  resources.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  89  UNINTENTIONAL ACTORS  Untrained Employees and Reckless Employees are two types of unintentionally acting  adversaries, who still have the potential to cause harm to the organization. They do not act on a  specifically malicious motivation, but may cause incidents as a result of insufficient knowledge  or negligence of security precautions or procedures in order to attain a (non-malicious) goal. As  these threat actors have valid access credentials, their activities can inadvertently lead to  significant damage.  To date, there is however no universally accepted standard for a threat taxonomy, and new  definitions and proposals for taxonomies are still emerging. Even within the different member  states and EU bodies, there exists a wide variety of how actors are classified. In the threat  landscape reporting of the Netherlands, actors are classified as government, critical, private  citizen with the goal of either espionage, disruption, sabotage, data theft, leak and system  manipulation. In the UK, the classification differentiates criminals, nation-state actors, patriotic  hackers, terrorist groups, and hacktivists.  In addition, across EU agencies, different classification schemes are in use. In 2013, ENISA  defined a taxonomy of 15 actor types characterized in terms of the sector they are active in,  their capabilities and their underlying motives. This model is developed further by this  methodology.  With the major development of the cyberthreat landscape over the past decade, this report  consolidated, refined and enhanced previous taxonomies into the above set of 11 attacker  types, which both reflect the current threat landscape and can be mapped to other taxonomies  in use at member states and EU bodies.  9.4 CHARACTERIZATION OF ATTACKERS  The goal of CTI in sectoral assessment is to provide information about potential adversaries,  their characteristics and resulting attack potential, the assessment of risk, the definition of  controls and the evaluation process. In this section, a generic, abstract method aimed at  achieving these objectives is described, which needs to be customized after further research  into specific scenarios.  In the scheme presented in this document, the information provided by cyberthreat intelligence  serves three purposes:  Firstly, CTI is used to identify the set of actors that are relevant and likely attackers of an ICT  product or system;  Secondly, given their capabilities, means and motives, it defines the security criteria that would  enable a particular product to withstand an adversary; and  Thirdly, it provides input for the evaluation of the product to confirm that these security criteria  are fulfilled and the product can thus be expected to successfully thwart an attack.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  90  Figure 22: 17 characteristics of adversarial motives, means and opportunity  The motives, means and opportunity of an attacker can be characterized in a plethora of  ways, each one capturing a different facet of the abstract, complex concept of a persona  and its interaction with an ICT system or product and the context in which it is used. Figure  22 shows a selection of 17 dimensions towards such characterization:  9.4.1 Area System Access / Knowledge  In order to be presented with an opportunity for an attack, the adversary must gain access  to the ICT system/product/service and have sufficient knowledge to interact with it.  C1 Access/time with the product for attack preparation  Certain types of attacks require extensive preparation with the actual TOE, such as for  obtaining measurements or training models. It has to be assessed whether the  adversary can obtain an equivalent product, that is to be attacked later, for internal  evaluation, and whether there is sufficient time between the acquisition of the specimen  and the time the attack must take place.  C2 Access/time with the product in application context for attack execution  Evaluation as to whether the adversary will be able to gain direct access to the  component to launch the attack, and the maximum timespan of such a potential  interaction with the TOE.  C1 and C2 have an analogous match in window of opportunity and elapsed time in  ISO/IEC 18045.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  91  C3 Knowledge of the TOE  The adversary’s specific expertise with regard to the TOE, such as whether the  adversary can only draw from public knowledge or has access to sensitive information  about the artefact.  This component of CTI has a direct equivalent in ISO/IEC 18045.  9.4.2 Area Vulnerabilities  An attack may only happen, if there is a vulnerability in the component that can be  exploited.  C4 Knowledge of vulnerabilities  Evaluation as to whether the adversary is expected to have knowledge over  vulnerabilities in the system, either obtained through independent investigation or  acquired from a third party  Even if no vulnerability exists or none is known to the attacker, such an opportunity may be  created by an adversary through one of the following ways:  C5 Access to the source or production  Characterization of access to the development and production information about the  TOE and/or the ability to modify it. For example, access to the source code would make  the search for a vulnerability significantly easier. If the adversary could introduce  changes (open source code, support of insiders, compromised tooling etc.) a suitable  vulnerability might be planted.  C6 Ability to access/modify product/components in the supply chain to introduce  vulnerabilities  The identification or introduction of vulnerabilities can also target the supply chain, either  by an attack on raw or intermediate components that will be included in the product or  the ability to intercept and modify products between the warehouse and the deployment  location.  C7 Ability to recruit insiders  Insiders may be corrupted or coerced to cooperate with the attacker, to disable controls  or provide access to the TOE, or development or production components.  9.4.3 Area Capability and Resources  Certain types of attacks require specific assets to be successful. CTI can provide an  estimation of available support in terms of physical assets or monetary funds.  C8 Equipment  Characterization of the type of equipment to which the adversary has access and could  enable him/her to identify and exploit a vulnerability, and an estimation of the volume of  such materials if the duration of an attack can be shortened by parallelization.  This aspect has an equivalent component in ISO/IEC 18045.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  92  C9 Avoidance of visibility  Evaluation as to whether the attacker needs to conduct the operation in a stealthy  manner so that it remains undetected even after completion, and whether he is  concerned that the activities could potentially be attributed to him.  C10 Funds to substitute for lack of components  Short-comings in system access, knowledge, vulnerabilities, capabilities or resources  can be overcome by outsourcing to third parties. Characterization of the funding  situation of the attacker and his willingness to contract out attack components.  9.4.4 Area Skill  To identify vulnerabilities and execute an attack, specialist expertise is needed. CTI can  provide an estimation of the skill level of potential adversaries:  C11 General attack knowledge  Overall expertise and generic knowledge of the adversary in product design,  engineering principles, and attack vectors.  C12 Available methods  Diversity of the portfolio of attack methods available in order to pivot if necessary and  surpass the deployment of stacked controls.  This component may be used for the planning of suitable, complimentary controls in a  defence-in-depth approach. C10 and C11 have a corresponding counterpart in  specialist expertise in ISO/IEC 18045.  9.4.5 Area Valuation  An attack is only likely if the attacker can draw a value out of the activity, for example a  monetary or ideological gain. The characterization of the adversary by CTI provides insight  into the value perceived by adversaries:  C13 Time window to reach goals  Characterization of the time by which the attack has to be finished if it is to deliver value  to the adversary. For example, this could be based on overall duration or external  trigger events.  C14 Derived value  Characterization of the value the adversary is pursuing (if applicable), an estimation of  the monetary gain the adversary might derive from the activity.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  93  9.4.6 Area Goals  The ultimate goal of the adversary determines to a large degree the attack vector used.  Cyberthreat intelligence provides information about intentions, and information about past  behaviour and modus operandi.  C15 Objective  Information about the end goal of the adversary’s modus operandi, such as the  disruption of a service for public consumption or the theft of customer data, is used  towards the planning and correct localization of the controls in the organization.  C16 Legal and ethical limits  Boundaries that constrain the adversaries in their activities, such as a code of conduct  or the limits of law.  C17 Geopolitical context  Geopolitical developments are main triggers of tensions between various types of  stakeholders and are considered to be a strong motive in pursuing mutual attacks  among parties.  9.5 ESTIMATING THE POTENTIAL OF ATTACKERS BASED ON CTI  As discussed above, the purpose of CTI in the SCSA Methodology is to provide information  about potential adversaries and to estimate their attack potential. Section 9.4 proposed  parameters that characterize the opportunities, means and motives of attackers. By rating the  capacities of adversaries based on these parameters, the assignment of an attack potential to a  particular type of attacker will be possible.  The motivation and capabilities of an attacker may vary depending on, for instance, the market  sector and the technology that supports controls. Therefore, the potential of a particular type of  attacker must be identified for each market sector and each supporting asset that could be the  target of an attack. Note that the attacker profile will change over time, necessitating a regular  update of the assessments.  Information on attacker types and attack potential are important contributions at two points in  the methodology proposed in this document:  1. The identification and assessment of risks in the primary asset layer assessment  described in subsection 5.2.7 requires information on the relevant types of attackers. The  focus here is on identifying the potential attackers and on understanding the motives they  may have with regard to the specific sector. All information and characteristics that CTI  can offer to understand the motives (see section 9.4) should be used. In this case, a  generic estimation of the capabilities of the type of attacker may be sufficient.  2. If a sectoral risk is identified, which implies that there are potential attackers with a  significant motivation, there will be a deeper look at the adversaries and the system  components that might be subject to an attack at the layer of assessing supporting assets.  At this stage, a full investigation of relevant attackers and their attack potential will be  conducted. With motives already established in the previous phase, the focus of this  activity mainly lies on the means and opportunities of motivated attackers. The identified  attack potential may serve as input to the definition of security and assurance  requirements of the supporting ICT products, ICT processes and ICT services, and is  applicable both for the evaluation of primary assets as well as supporting assets.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  94  It can very well be that the potential of an attacker varies as a function of the type of ICT  product, ICT processes, ICT service and their intended use.  Chapter 6 describes the steps of the sectoral assessment, which are related to the identification  and application of the attack potential in detail.  To allow ICT product vendors to benefit from the results of the assessment of supporting assets,  it is important to ensure comparability of the relevant parameters with ISO/IEC 15408 and  ISO/IEC 18045 is achieved. These standards are typically used for the definition of products  with regard to security, assurance and evaluation. Chapter 7 and Annex C provide details how  this mapping can be implemented.  The parameter ‘attack potential’ is also used in ISO/IEC 18045 for the purposes of product  evaluation for a specific attack rating. The required characteristics are a subset of those given in  Section 9.4 as C1 to C17. With the full adversarial assessment of means, motive and  opportunity in hand through the method presented, we not only support the sectoral risk  assessment but can also reuse the outcomes to compute the attack potential level as described  in ISO/IEC 18045. This selection is described in further detail in Subsection 9.6.2, and it  ensures that the level of attack potential identified for each supporting ICT product, ICT process  and ICT service is thus comparable to the level used by an evaluator in the vulnerability analysis  of the same components.  9.6 STEPS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CTI-BASED ASSESSMENTS  OF ATTACK POTENTIAL  This section describes methods for the qualitative assessment of attacker potential based on  the characteristics given in Section 9.4 for both scenarios described in the previous section.  Subsection 9.6.1 describes the process for generating attack potential scores for each of the  three adversarial characteristics, means, motive and opportunity. These scores can be  aggregated to create an overall attack potential score for each general type of attacker. It can  be applied to establish the context and to assess the primary asset layer. In addition, with more  detailed information about the supporting asset and its intended use, it can be applied at the  layer for assessing a supporting asset.  Subsection 9.6.2 contains a description for the mapping of cyberthreat intelligence information  to attack potential as defined by ISO/IEC 18045. This will ensure for the assessment of  supporting assets comparability with the concept typically used in product security evaluation.  Until experience has shown that both methods provide consistent results, it is advisable to use  the method described in Subsection 9.6.2 for ICT products which are expected to be evaluated  and certified in an ISO/IEC 15408-conformant scheme.  9.6.1 CTI-based qualitative assessment of attack potential for risk  assessment  Cyberthreat intelligence provides information about attacker capabilities, their modus operandi,  targeted victims, and attack campaigns based on collected observations and interpretation. This  information is usually assembled with respect to specific actors, in other words CTI tracks the  activities and developments of specific adversaries which, when taken together, provide an  insight into the threat landscape a particular organization faces. For the purposes of sectoral  risk assessment, this level of detail is not necessary, and would only add significant complexity  and workload while providing relatively little benefit.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  95  If we consider a particular system to be a likely target of a particular type of attacker, any  existing perpetrator within this class of attacker could be the source of an attack. For  instance, if a sectorial system is a likely target for cyber terrorists, there is little utility in  enumerating the different cyber terrorist groups and their specific capabilities in defence  planning. It would be better to design protections against the capabilities that can be  expected within this particular class of adversaries. This not only simplifies the analysis and  avoids issues of data scarcity, but it is a more realistic assessment of the threat landscape  as adversaries are known to exchange knowledge and tools and to hire expertise from  others when needs arise.  The analysis of attackers and their potential thus begins by collecting evidence on any  actual actors within a specific attacker type, and then aggregating every piece of  information within each category to arrive at an evaluation for the components C1 through  C17 for this particular class.  In summary, the methodology follows the following steps:  1. For the complete list of attacker types, cyberthreat intelligence on the motivations of  attackers is collected. Information about valuation, goals and past targets is used to derive  an attack potential score for each particular type of adversary. The sectoral stakeholders  decide, based on this information, whether an attacker type is deemed a relevant threat  actor for the sectoral system. This information is used in workflow A. For the selected  attacker types, the methodology is then continued.  2. Given the list of relevant attacker types, a body of threat intelligence is assembled,  detailing past attacks and campaigns, the attack vector and approach used, and the  means used to create an compromise by a perpetrator belonging to this attacker type. An  analysis of each group of specific threat actors within an attacker type is not necessary, as  it can be assumed that the capabilities and opportunities available to one type would also  be attainable by another group of actors of the same type. The data collected should span  a multi-year timeframe to avoid individual campaigns skewing the data and biased  reporting and to allow sectoral stakeholders to not only evaluate current capabilities and  opportunities but also to attempt an extrapolation into the near future. The extrapolation  should assess the expected progression in attack potential until the next application of the  methodology and the completion of a re-assessment and an update.  3. All reporting related to threat actors of a particular attacker type is analysed and the  characteristics of this general attacker type are scored with respect to the criteria named  below. This delivers an estimation of the characteristics C1 through C17 for each selected  attacker type. Each characteristic contains the levels low, medium and high, which are  characterized by specific features. The scoring for each characteristic C1 through C17  should be assigned the highest level value occurring when assessing the applicable  criteria, i.e. if 2 out of 2 criteria for level low are met, 1 out of 2 for level medium, and 0 out  of 2 for level high, the overall value for this criteria shall be medium. When different  attacks, known from CTI, exhibit different levels, for example, three attacks used a medium  level while the same actor employed different techniques in a fourth campaign that would  be associated with the high level, the actor type is ranked as high as this level has already  been attained.  4. The outcome provides aggregate attack potential scores for the three aspects, means,  motive and opportunity, as discussed in Subsection 9.6.1.1, which can be further  aggregated using the techniques in Subsection 9.6.1.2 to a general attack potential level  for this particular attack type. Subsections 9.6.1.1 and 9.6.1.2 also provide justification and  motivation for the aggregation method and fusion of the individual scores.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  96  AREA OPPORTUNITY  An attack may only happen if there is a vulnerability in the supporting asset that can be  exploited. To quantify knowledge of the exposure of the system, as well as the potential for  exploitable vulnerabilities, seven characteristics are used to assess adversarial opportunity.  C1: Access/time with the supporting asset for attack preparation  Certain types of attacks require extensive preparation with the actual supporting asset, such as  for obtaining measurements or training models. It has to be assessed whether the adversary  can obtain a product that is equivalent to the product that will be attacked later for internal  evaluation, and whether there is sufficient time for that evaluation between the acquisition of the  specimen and the time the attack must take place. The level for this characteristic should be  assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low  • Supporting asset is publicly available for purchase and/or provided to users as part of  service.  • It is estimated that the attacker takes less than 2 weeks to identify an attack vector / exploit,  and develop it.  Medium  • Supporting asset is only sold after the vetting of customers and their use case. Delivered  products are not expected to be tracked over their lifetime.  • It is estimated that the attacker takes more than 2 weeks but less than 4 months to identify  an attack vector and exploit, and to develop it.  High  • Supporting asset is available only to selected customers, substantial efforts are needed to  obtain a sample.  • It is estimated that the attacker takes more than 4 months to identify an attack vector /  exploit, and to develop it.  C2: Access/time with the supporting asset in application context for attack execution  Evaluation as to whether the adversary will be able to gain direct access to the supporting asset  to launch the attack, and the maximum timespan for such a potential interaction with the  supporting asset.  C1 and C2 have an analogous match in the window of opportunity and elapsed time in  ISO/IEC 18045. The level for this characteristic should be assigned the value of the highest  applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • Attacks are targeted at Internet-connected assets without (by default or by access) industry- standard authentication, providing for an unlimited window of opportunity.  • Operational tempo is regularly high as attacks are quick to execute.  Medium • Attacks are targeted at assets not connected to the Internet, but the exploit can be delivered  by pivoting through assets that are connected to the Internet (lateral movement).  High • The campaign is targeted at assets which are not internet-connected directly and are not  pivoted via Internet-connected assets (air-gapped).  • Exploitation requires physical access, using either accomplices or unknowingly infected  insiders for installation and/or execution.  • Operational tempo can vary from low to high but time horizon, including attack preparation,  is long due to complexity of the attack.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  97  C3: Knowledge of the supporting asset  The extent of the adversary’s specific expertise with regard to the supporting asset, such as  whether the adversary can only draw on public knowledge or has access to sensitive  information about the artifact. This component of CTI has a direct equivalent in ISO/IEC 18045.  The level for this characteristic should be assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • Knowledge required for the execution of attack(s) is sourced from generally available  sources on the Internet or other open sources.  • When knowledge is sourced from documents leaked from restricted, sensitive and critical  sources, it should also be considered public.  Medium • Knowledge required for the execution of attack(s) is sourced from restricted sources (e.g.  code repositories of closed development communities).  High • Knowledge required for the execution of attack(s) is sourced from sources only available to  the developer/manufacturer of the supporting asset. According to CTI, the attacker is likely  to have had access to inside sources to obtain this supporting asset.  • Knowledge required for the execution of this campaign is sourced from highly restricted  sources, only available to staff from the developer of the supporting asset, on a need-to- know basis.  • According to CTI, the attacker likely had access to inside sources to obtain knowledge of the  supporting asset. As opposed to sensitive, the knowledge obtained of the supporting asset  is information about the security and actual vulnerabilities of and threats to critical parts of  the supporting asset.  C4: Knowledge of vulnerabilities  Evaluation as to whether the adversary is expected to have knowledge of vulnerabilities in the  system, either obtained through independent investigation or acquired from a third party. The  level for this characteristic should be assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • The adversary has been observed to exclusively use publicly disclosure vulnerabilities in  their activities.  Medium • The adversary has been shown to and can be expected to adopt new vulnerabilities after  public disclosure, and active deployment will be faster than the median turnaround time in the  defender’s vulnerability management process.  High • The adversary is able to create vulnerabilities and introduce them into the product or  service.  • The adversary has been shown to have knowledge of zero-day vulnerabilities, targeted  specifically towards organizational assets.  C5: Access to the source or production  Characterization of access to development and production information about the supporting  asset and/or the ability to modify it. For example, access to the source code would make the  search for a vulnerability significantly easier. If the adversary could introduce changes (open  source code, support of insiders, compromised tooling etc.), a suitable vulnerability could be  planted. The level for this characteristic should be assigned the value of the highest applicable  criteria:  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  98  Level Criteria  Low • Product uses open source code, which the adversary may inspect for vulnerabilities and/or  introduction of vulnerabilities.  • Hardware design may be obtained from inspection of the supporting asset, software can be  extracted at C8 Medium level from the product.  Medium • Product uses open source code for security- or mission-critical functionality, which the  adversary may inspect for vulnerabilities and/or introduce vulnerabilities.  High • Adversary has access to the production facility and can introduce changes to the supporting  asset.  • Adversary has single or sustained access to the source code and/or hardware design of the  supporting asset.  • Adversary has the capability to take over maintenance of an open source code repository.  C6: Ability to access/modify supporting asset in the supply chain to introduce  vulnerabilities  The identification or introduction of vulnerabilities can also target the supply chain, either by an  attack on raw or intermediate components that will be included in the supporting asset, or the  ability to intercept and modify products between the warehouse and the deployment location.  The level for this characteristic should be assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low No capability to interfere with the supply chain  Medium • Adversary can exchange and modify product during transport and storage before it is  delivered to the customer, prior to an inspection before deployment.  High • Adversary can maliciously influence the design process, the use of protocols, algorithms,  cryptographic primitives and/or configurations.  • Adversary can modify the tooling used during design, development, production,  implementation or testing, to introduce changes or hide past modifications to the supporting  asset.

The level for  this characteristic should be assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • Adversary would recruit the services of an insider if offered the opportunity, but not actively  seek out insiders.  Medium • Adversary can be expected to try to proactively recruit insiders within the victim organization  or business partners as support, using financial compensation and/or release of personal  information to entice insiders  High • Adversary can be expected to try to proactively recruit insiders within the victim organization  or business partners as support, using any kind of means such as financial compensation,  coercion, physical force etc.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  99  AREA MEANS  Certain types of attacks require specific assets to be successful. CTI can provide an estimation  of the support available in terms of physical assets or monetary funds.  C8: Equipment  Characterization of the type of equipment to which the adversary has access to and may use  this to  identify and exploit a vulnerability, and an estimation of the quantity of such materials if  the attack duration can be shortened by parallelization. This aspect has a comparable  component in ISO/IEC 18045. The level for this characteristic should be assigned the value of  the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • Capabilities are sourced from publicly available websites and source code repositories and  do not require tailoring towards the TOE.  • Capabilities are sourced from non-free but otherwise commercially available sources (e.g.  commercial/professional-grade penetration test suites).  Medium • Capabilities are custom-developed involving experts from multiple domains (assembly  developers, reverse engineers, payload delivery developers).  • The capabilities observed are not generally available and only available to restricted  communities (law enforcement, intelligence) or through illegitimate means (dark web).  • In the observed attack(s), the attacker exploited a non-targeted zero-day (potentially  affecting multiple unrelated organizations).  High • Capabilities are custom-developed involving experts from multiple domains (assembly  developers, reverse engineers, payload delivery developers).  • In previously observed attack(s), the attacker exploited a zero-day vulnerability specifically  targeting this organization’s assets.  • Capabilities deployed in this campaign were kinetic, aiming to physically destroy target  assets.  • Development of the capabilities required testing on and actual possession of the affected  assets.  C9: Avoidance of visibility  Evaluation as to whether the attacker needs to conduct the operation in a stealthy manner so  that he/her remains undetected even after completion, and whether he/her is concerned that the  activities could potentially be attributed to him/her. Adversaries will be more sophisticated the  greater the concern they have for avoiding visibility, as well as if they have the means to  conduct attacks generating minimal visibility. The level for this characteristic should be assigned  the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • Adversary has little concern to be publicly attributed with the attack. Past activities by this  actor might be well known publicly and documented.  • Adversary relies on commonly known tools, techniques and tactics for a compromise, that  are well documented and observable using state-of-the-art defences  • Adversary has little concern to be publicly attributed with the attack, nor to obfuscate his  activities.  Medium • Adversary uses various means to hide origin of and responsibility for the attack using, for  example, technical means such as proxies, onion routing, compromised intermediaries to  launch and conduct activities, as well as means for hiding the flow of funds with respect to  the financing of the attack and its proceeds.  • Adversary outsources the attack to a third party or proxy as a means of hiding his own  involvement.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  100  Level Criteria  High • Adversary makes significant efforts to avoid detection by, for example spreading out the  attack in time and space using multiple vantage points for the attack and reducing the  momentary intensity.  • Adversary has the ability to develop and/or uses custom tooling that is not widely known and  available to defenders. Tools may be adapted between attempts and victims to avoid  detection.  • Adversary has to expect consequences such as public shaming, retaliation, sanctions and  intensive law enforcement actions if his involvement is detected.  C10: Funds to substitute for a lack of components  Short-comings in system access, knowledge, vulnerabilities, capabilities or resources can be  resolved by outsourcing to third parties. Characterization of the funding situation of the attacker  and his willingness to contract out attack components. The level for this characteristic should be  assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • The adversary has insufficient funds to outsource attacks to specialized third parties, and  has previously not been observed to buy system access, knowledge, vulnerabilities or other  resources used in an attack.  Medium • Expenditures required to overcome short-comings are significant with respect to the total  turnover of the adversary or the expected proceeds from an attack.  High • The adversary has sufficient funds to outsource and buy in capabilities from third parties,  either based on expected/past proceeds of the attack or internal or external funding.  • Cost of acquiring support is minor given the overall budget and financial capability of the  actor.  • The adversary has a strong non-monetary motivation so that a negative return on  investment for this attack or for entire campaigns is acceptable.  C11: General attack knowledge  Overall expertise and generic knowledge of the adversary in product design, engineering  principles, attack methods. The level for this characteristic should be assigned the value of the  highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • The adversary relies exclusively on publicly known and well understood attack vectors, for  which existing tools may already be available.  Medium • The adversary has the ability to adopt and modify attacks, which requires moderate domain  knowledge or system expertise.  • The adversary has command over a portfolio of potential attack vectors, and is able to  deploy several of these to accomplish the desired objective.

The adversary is able to  circumvent or react to medium level information security controls.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  101  C12: Available methods  Diversity in the portfolio of available attack methods available in order to pivot if necessary, and  surpass the deployment of stacked controls. This characteristic may be used for the planning of  suitable, complimentary controls in a defence-in-depth approach. C11 and C12 have a  corresponding counterpart in specialist expertise in ISO/IEC 18045. The level for this  characteristic should be assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • Tactics and procedures observed in this attack(s) do not require specific expertise,  experience or specialization towards the supporting asset.  Medium • Tactics and procedures deployed are common and/or regularly observed in industry  reporting.  • Targeting of widely/commonly used software, exploitation of known vulnerabilities using  known, detectable malware code.  High • Tactics and procedures require several years of industry experience and expertise, or highly  specialized training (stealth exfiltration of sensitive data, spear phishing critical employees).  • Custom development of tools instead of simple copying.  • Exploitation of industry- or organization specific or tailored software, tactics and procedures  involving the targeting of personal or home devices of critical employees. Delivery of  implants via tampered devices  • Tactics and procedures deployed require the sustained involvement of multiple experts due  to the deep familiarity required for the exploitation of target systems (e.g. combining novel  delivery vector with novel deception TTPs to remain undetected).  • Tactics and procedures deployed include specialized malware.  • Tactics and procedures deployed include supply chain attack vectors (tampering firmware to  include a backdoor, or inserting counterfeited hardware into the supply chain).  AREA VALUATION  An attack is only likely if the attacker can obtain value from the activity, for example a monetary  or ideological gain. CTI’s characterization of adversaries provides insight into how adversaries  perceive value.  C13: Time window to reach goals  Characterization of the time window during which the attack must be finished to deliver value to  the adversary, based on overall duration, for example, or external trigger events. The level for  this characteristic should be assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • The attack has to be planned, executed and the results used in a very short amount of time.  • Assets that might be stolen have only a utility window of a few days before expiry or public  release of the information devaluates it.  Medium • Attack might require significant preparation and time for execution, but obtainable assets  can be monetized within a short time frame, and/or hold their value for weeks or longer  High • Obtainable assets have a validity exceeding months or may hold value permanently.  • The adversary can modify technology or organizational processes to maintain a long-term  foothold in the organization. This would shorten the time needed to access perishable  assets.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  102  C14: Derived value  Characterization of the value the adversary is pursuing and/or, if applicable, an estimation of the  monetary gain the adversary might obtain from the activity. The level for this characteristic  should be assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • Obtainable assets in a compromise will be of minor economic value for each compromise  and will not exceed the adversary’s cost and effort in realising the attack. A positive return  on investment is realised by replicating the attack across many victims.  Medium • Assets obtainable from even a single attack will clearly exceed the cost and effort needed to  implement the attack. A positive return on investment is very likely.  High • Assets obtained from the compromise will provide a significant technological advance or  competitive business advantage to the opponent and/or the economy of the adversary.  • The attack will significantly weaken the ability of the victim to maintain its operation and  conduct business or significantly reduce its ability in the future.  • The adversary is not required to derive economic value from its activities. The adversary  might not be funded by the proceeds from the attack and/or its value is related to other  aspects such as geopolitical factors, social issues, moral agendas, or personal motives.  AREA GOALS  The ultimate goal of the adversary determines to a large degree the attack vector used.  Cyberthreat intelligence provides information about intentions as well as information about past  behaviour and modus operandi.  C15: Objective  Information about the end goal of the adversary’s modus operandi, such as the disruption of a  service for public consumption or the theft of customer data, is used in the planning and correct  localization of controls in the organization. The level for this characteristic should be assigned  the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • Unguided destruction of property, driven by a quest for personal satisfaction and dominance  • Compromise is creating major public exposure on the victim organization, and/or gain in  reputation for the perpetrator  Medium • Attack is used as a platform for the communication of a political/social/moral agenda  • Theft or modification of general information assets that provide a significant economic  advantage to the adversary  High • Theft or modification of intellectual property and information assets critical to the  organization and/or of high value to the adversary and the adversary’s economy  • Damage and destruction of the victim’s infrastructure and the services it provides  C16: Legal and ethical limits  Boundaries that constrain the adversaries in their activities, such as a code of conduct or the  limits of law to which the attacker adheres. The level for this characteristic should be assigned  the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low • Victim organization is universally recognized as protected by international law or  agreements such as the Hague Conventions, for example medical services and  infrastructure. The attacker type wants to avoid the risk of being associated with the  consequences of his actions.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  103  Level Criteria  Medium • Adversaries hired as executing proxies by the perpetrator, which may operate without or  ignore legal and ethical limits  • Vector, modus operandi and targeted victim will make it unlikely that the attack can be  traced back to the perpetrator, which is otherwise bound by limits and fear of public  exposure  High • Actor groups operating without restraint and consideration of international treaties, such as  cyber terrorists, cyber anarchists, individual cyber fighters, organized cyber criminals  C17: Geopolitical context  Geopolitical developments are main triggers of tensions between various types of stakeholders  and are considered to be strong motives in provoking mutual attacks among rival parties. The  level for this characteristic should be assigned the value of the highest applicable criteria:  Level Criteria  Low no (geo)political motivation observed  Medium no (geo)political motivation observed  High • Attack on the victim occurs within the context of or as a proxy for aconflict between states.  • Targeted organization provides adversary with the ability to completely or largely disable  infrastructure and systems regarded as critical infrastructure  9.6.1.1 Calculation of Attack Potential Level for each category  a) Opportunity  The characterization of Opportunity refers to the use of the component ‘system access /  knowledge’, i.e. whether the information asset is sufficiently exposed to the adversary for a  compromise to take place. It also refers to using a component ‘vulnerability’, i.e. whether  there exist weaknesses that the adversary might take advantage of in the attack.  Vulnerabilities can be inherent to the design and only known to the adversary or be  explicitly planted by the adversary to realize an attack.  To compute the APL of Opportunity, the following principle applies:  ‒ The level of vulnerability is equal to the maximum level of C4, C5, C6 and C7 as  any vulnerability will be exploitable, regardless of how it was made available.  ‒ Attack preparation can either be online or offline, depending on system access  and deployment. The level of system access will therefore be the maximum of C1  and C2.  ‒ Knowledge of the system is a critical component in realising the attack. The  combined score of system access/knowledge is thus the minimum of system  access and C3, as system access without knowledge will be just as ineffective as  a high degree of knowledge without system access.  Based on this reasoning, a combined Attack Potential Level for Opportunity is calculated as follows:  APL_O = MIN [ MIN( MAX(C1, C2), C3) ],  [ MAX(C4, C5, C6, C7) ]  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  104  b) Means  The characterization of Means assesses whether the adversary has the technical  capabilities and equipment to accomplish a particular goal, as well as the required  knowledge to use it towards a compromise. With the wide-spread availability of  ‘cybercrime-as-a-service, even specialist knowledge and equipment can be bought or  hired, hence an unequipped attacker, if provided with sufficient funding (C10)’ would still  pose a relevant threat.  To compute the APL component of Means, the following principle applies:  ‒ The level of technical means and skills is equal to the minimum level of C8, C11,  C12, as all three components determine the severity of a potential approach.  ‒ As a lack of technical means and skills can be overcome through outsourcing or  the hiring of external talent, the overall level of means is increased to the level of  expected external support C10 if it exceeds its own technical competences.  ‒ If the adversary has advanced capabilities and is sufficiently patient so that the  attack can be spread out over time and space, detection and response is further  complicated for the defender. In case component C9 is larger than the result of the  above two items, the overall attacker potential level for Means should be  increased to the next level.  Based on this reasoning, a combined Attack Potential Level for Means is calculated as follows:  APL_Me = MAX [ C10, MIN( C8, C11, C12 ) ]  Given the third principle, an additional adjustment applies. If the score assigned to C9 is  larger than the current value of APL_Me, the Attack Potential Level for the means shall be  rounded up to the next integer.  c) Motive  To compute the APL component of Motive, the following principle applies:  ‒ Timeframe and derived value are counteracting forces. If the value is high but the  time window in which the information asset can be exploited is very short, this  limits the overall value that can be derived. The combined level for value will be  the higher of the two scores C13 and C14, but this may be discounted by one level  if either C13 or C14 is determined to be low.  ‒ The main driving force for goals is adversarial objective, with C16 and C17 only  acting as secondary criteria that only become relevant for select and advanced  attacker types. The level of goals is equal to C15, and needs to be increased to  the maximum of C16 and C17 if these are higher.  Based on this reasoning, a combined Attack Potential Level for Motive is calculated as follows:  APL_Mo = MAX [MAX(C13, C14) - MIN(|C14-C13|, 1) ],  MAX[ C15, MAX(C16, C17) ]  9.6.1.2 Calculation of attack potential level (APL)  From the above calculations, we obtain rankings of low, medium and high for each APL  component for each attacker type. The overall attacker potential level is the arithmetic average  of the sub scores for motive, means and opportunity. For this, we assign an integer value of 1 to  level low, and integer value of 3 to a level medium, and a value of 5 to the level high. The  resulting average is then rounded up to the next integer.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  105  9.6.2 CTI-based qualitative assessment of attack potential at supporting  asset layer  The use of attack potential in a risk assessment involves evaluating potential attackers that may  wish to target the primary functions which are the subject of a sectoral risk assessment.  However, in reality the primary functions themselves are not suitable as targets of attack, as  they are composed of a broad ecosystem of many interlinked and interdependent ICT products,  ICT processes and ICT services. Attackers will instead look to target those individual ICT  products, ICT processes or ICT services which they perceive as being either most critical to the  broader ecosystem or the easiest to attack.  As described in Chapter 6 the sectoral risk assessment is a process which moves from sectoral  business objectives, through the primary business functions which help to achieve these, and  on to the individual assets (ICT products, ICT processes and ICT services) which support the  primary business functions. However, the process is also iterative – so that risks to primary  business functions must be re-assessed in the light of assessed risk to the supporting assets  once these have been identified and evaluated. It is proposed that attack potential is taken into  account at the stage of the iterative re-assessment.  The method provides a CTI-based definition of the attack potential at supporting component  level, focusing on the means and opportunity of the attacker in order to support the definition of  security and assurance requirements. This approach is close to the one defined in  ISO/IEC 18045. This ensures consistency with the definitions of attack potential used in  evaluation and assurance and supports comparability.  For this bridging, the subset of criteria that have a direct equivalence in ISO/IEC 18045 are  selected for the estimation of the attack potential for the vulnerability assessment from the  previously prepared cyberthreat intelligence results. Table 9 lists the matches between attacker  characteristics and the corresponding element in ISO/IEC 18045. Table 10 proposes how the  corresponding evaluation criteria based on CTI input is to be set.  Table 9: Summary of CTI criteria for use by the method for the assessment of AP at the product level  CTI Criteria  Type of  criteria  ISO/IEC 18045 rating criteria  correspondence  C1 - Access/time with the product for  attack preparation  Opportunity Part of  window of opportunity and elapsed time  C2 - Access/time with the product in  application context for attack execution  Opportunity Part of window of opportunity and elapsed time  C3 – Knowledge of the TOE Opportunity Knowledge of the TOE  C4 - Knowledge of vulnerabilities Opportunity No direct equivalence but could be part of  knowledge of the TOE  C5 - Access to the source or  production  Opportunity Access to source: part of knowledge of the TOE  Access to production: no equivalence but could  be rated under Window of opportunity and/or  Means (to be studied further)  C6 - Ability to access/modify  product/components in the supply  chain to introduce vulnerabilities  Opportunity No direct equivalence but could be in Window  of opportunity and/or Means (to be studied  further)  C7 - Ability to recruit insiders Opportunity No direct equivalence but could be in Window  of opportunity and/or Means (to be studied  further)  C8 – Equipment Means Equipment  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  106  CTI Criteria  Type of  criteria  ISO/IEC 18045 rating criteria  correspondence  C9 - Avoidance of visibility Means / Motive No equivalence  C10 - Funds to substitute for lack of  components  Means No direct equivalence but could be part of  Equipment (as the price is considered)  C11 - General attack knowledge Means Expertise  C12 - Available methods Means Expertise (related to the use of equipment and  methods)  C13 – Time window to reach goals Motive No equivalence  C14 - Derived value Motive No equivalence  C15 - Objective Motive No equivalence  C16 - Legal and ethical limits Motive No equivalence  C17 - Geopolitical context Motive No equivalence  The table below lists a method to determine an attack potential level based on those CTI inputs  that have an impact on the vulnerability analysis of an ICT product or system and that are to be  considered in the determination of CAR (see Chapter 5.6) and CSL (see Chapter 5.5).  Four groups of attacker characteristics based on these CTI inputs have been determined: the  expertise, the knowledge, the resources, and the opportunity of an attacker to perform an attack.  Each of these groups is associated with four levels of attacker expertise: Layman, Proficient,  Expert and Multi-Expert. Level definitions are for the current version of this document taken  directly from ISO/IEC 18045.  Table 10: Method for estimating AP by applying CTI characteristics relevant to the vulnerability analysis  CTI  characteristics  ISO 18045  equivalence  AP1  Unskilled  AP2  Skilled,  limited  resources  and  opportunity  AP3  Skilled,  significant  resources  and  opportunity  AP4  Highly  skilled,  significant  resources  and  opportunity  AP5  Highly  sophisticated,  significant  resources and  opportunity  Expertise  C11, C12  Expertise Layman Proficient Proficient Expert Multi-Expert  Knowledge  C3, C4, C5  Knowledge  of the TOE  Public Public Restricted Sensitive Critical  Resources  C5, C6, C7, C8,  C10  Equipment Standard Standard Specialized Specialized Bespoke  Opportunity  C1, C2, C5, C6  Windows of  opportunity  Elapsed  Time  Unlimited /  Easy  Easy Moderate Difficult Difficult  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  107  The method should be applied for those types of attackers that have been identified as relevant  by the assessment of sectoral risk in relation to the particular supporting ICT product, ICT  process or ICT service.  The overall attack potential level assigned to a supporting ICT product, ICT process or ICT  service for a particular attacker type is defined by the highest one selected for a group of  characteristics.  Where there are several motivated attackers, the overall attack potential level assigned to a  supporting ICT product, ICT process or ICT service is defined by the highest level reached by a  relevant type of attacker.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  108  A ANNEX: CONCEPTUAL  APPROACH FOR CONSISTENCY  OF TERMINOLOGY  A.1 BACKGROUND  According to the ISO/IEC JTC1 Directives, Part 2, Clause 16.4, ‘Terms and definitions should  preferably be listed according to the hierarchy of the concepts (i.e. systematic order).  Alphabetical order is the least preferred order.’  Concept approach is described in several international standards related to terminology  developed by the ISO Technical Committee TC37 Language and Terminology.  A fundamental principle for this approach is that one term corresponds to one concept, and only  one concept corresponds to one term in a given domain or subject in a given language.  For this document, relevant terms are defined as follows:  ‒ concept means a unit of knowledge created by a unique combination of characteristics;  ‒ term means a verbal designation of a general concept in a specific domain or subject;  ‒ definition means a representation of a concept by a descriptive statement which serves  to differentiate it from related concepts.  The concept can have its definition but this is not always the case.  Systematic order requires identification of unique concepts and further determining terms which  relate to the concept and provide the necessary characteristics. Characteristics can bind terms  in subsequent levels of dependency, thus creating a hierarchy of terms. Systematic order is  achieved by the proper numbering in the hierarchy of terms to reflect levels of dependency on  the concept (see Figure 23). In standards one can find different styles of numbering that  express the hierarchy of terms (see Figure 24). The only condition is to use the style  consistently.  The style of numbering shown in Figure 23 is used in this document.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  109  Figure 23: Numbering of terms showing dependency on the concept (1. example)  Figure 24: Numbering of terms showing dependency on the concept (2. example)  Minimising the number of concepts is recommended in order to produce a clear picture of the  relationships inside a single concept map and limit cross-relations between concepts.  An excellent introduction to the concept approach is given in JTC1 Standing Document N20  Best practices for IT Vocabulary.  Although the systematic approach has been used in ISO standards for the presentation of  terminology for many years (see, for example, ISO/IEC 9000) it has not been widely applied in  the IT security domain due to its complexity and heritage of old security references. However,  the concept approach can help in understanding the terminology and facilitate interconnection  between different realms of knowledge.  Often terminology is presented in the form of concept mapping, which allows all relationships to  be shown and emphasizes the significant characteristics of the concept. Such will be the form in  this document.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  110  A.2 THE CONCEPTUAL APPROACH APPLIED TO THE 15408-BASED  MODEL OF IT SECURITY EVALUATION  A.2.1 The ‘TOE’ concept preliminary considerations  ISO/IEC 15408-1 presents two high-level models upon which IT security evaluation is based,  i.e. the security model and the evaluation model.  If one concept is to be chosen to describe what IT security evaluation really means then that  would be Target of Evaluation (TOE).  The definition for TOE included in ISO/IEC 15408-1 includes ‘set of software, firmware and/or  hardware possibly accompanied by guidance, which is the subject of an evaluation’.  If we were to analyse the whole set of almost two hundred terms in ISO/IEC 15408 and  ISO/IEC 18045 five essential characteristics of the TOE could be found, i.e. (1) Asset, (2)  Operational environment, (3) Security Problem Definition, (4) TOE Security Functionality, (5)  Vulnerability.  These five principal characteristics form the highest level of systematic order for the TOE.  These characteristics are further explained with the second and third level of terms, if applicable  (see Table 11). Terms relate to each other and, if significant relationships are found, such a  map would be a simple representation of the IT product security evaluation, which is depicted in  Figure 25.  A chosen subset of terminology from ISO/IEC 15408 and ISO/IEC 18045 is sufficient for the  methodology.  NOTE 1: Colours of the nodes presented in the map indicate subsequent levels (L1-L3) of terms  given in systematic order. The same colours are reflected in the table containing terms and their  definitions.  NOTE 2: Terms in blue font contained in the concept map do not have separate definitions in  ISO/IEC 15408-1 or ISO/IEC 18045 for three reasons: a) they have their common dictionary  meaning (e.g. threat), or b) they can be derived from a defined term (e. g. security objective for  an operational environment), or c) two defined terms combined create a new term (e.g.  assurance class). There are no separate levels for such terms,  NOTE 3: Assurance classes indicated in the picture are shown for completeness of the  assurance description. For the simplicity of the concept map, only the vulnerability assessment  class is further analysed.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  111  Figure 25: Concept map for TOE  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  112  A.2.2 Terms in systematic order  Table 11 presents all relevant terms in systematic order. Terms in green represent major  characteristics for the TOE (in red font, the concept).  Table 11: Systematic order for the TOE concept  A.3 THE CONCEPTUAL APPROACH APPLIED TO  ISO/IEC 27001- BASED ISMS  A.3.1 The ‘organization’ concept - preliminary considerations  The concept mapping related to terms used in management standards has been developed by  a special ISO Task Force called the Joint Technical Coordination Group (JTCG) on MSS  [Management System Standards]. This group has developed a conceptual diagram of common  terms and core definitions related to management systems12 (see Figure 26). The map created  by JTCG is built around the concept of an ‘organization.’  12 ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27 internal document  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  113  Figure 26: Concept diagram for common terms and core definitions – JTCG View  Assuming that part of the terminology defined by the JTCG is identical for all MSSs in the ISO  world (including ISO/IEC 27001), terms in the family of ISMS standards have several  relationships through the management system objectives specific to ISO/IEC 27001, i.e. related  to ‘security’. A more detailed concept map relevant to information security risk is presented in  Figure 27.  The concept ‘organization’ has its own definition:  A person or group of people that has its own functions with responsibilities, authorities and  relationships to achieve its objectives.  Note 1 to entry: The concept of organization includes but is not limited to sole-trader, company,  corporation, firm, enterprise, authority, partnership, charity or institution, or part or combination  thereof, whether incorporated or not, public or private.  The same approach as for the ISO/IEC 15408 and ISO/IEC 18045 ‘TOE’ concept applies (see  NOTE 1, NOTE 2 and NOTE 3 in Subsection A.2.1).  A chosen subset of terminology from ISO/IEC 27000 is sufficient for the purpose.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  114  Figure 27: Concept map for 'organization.  METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  115  A.4 THE CONCEPTUAL APPROACH APPLIED TO ISO/IEC 27001- BASED  ISMS  The relationships between the two concepts discussed earlier (TOE and organization) are built  around risk. It should be noted that the concept of organization leads to the organization’s  information security management system, which in turn, is based on [information security]  objectives. Risk management is dealing with uncertainty on [information security] objectives.  Some of the objectives can be assigned to particular assets (we avoid here a discussion on  assets, their characteristics, relation to business processes), and typically they are defined with  respect to loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability.  If one identifies a risk related to loss of confidentiality or integrity of an asset, and then finds the  level of risk unacceptable compared to risk criteria, one possible option to protect the assets is  to choose controls to mitigate the risk. If a control appears to be an ICT product, it could be  chosen and then implemented based on two criteria set up by the risk owner:  1. specification of [information security] requirements which allow assessed risk related to the  asset(s) to be mitigated,  2. expression of needs related to the confidence that implementation of security functionality in  the product is done correctly and functionality is sufficient.  The developer responds to the first criterion by designing the security functionalities properly. In  that case, the developer performs its own assessment of risk and its treatment leading to the  required security functionality.  The vendor of the product (it could be the developer) responds to the need related to  confidence by setting up security assurance requirements with clearly defined assurance levels  expressing the scope, rigour and depth of the evaluation.  The ICT product, while implemented in its operational environment, mitigates the risk by  protecting the asset(s) as expected. In terms of [information security] objectives, the uncertainty  is controlled by the control (ICT product).  The relationships between the concepts are shown in Figure 28.  Following the guidance given by the developer/vendor, the risk owner may decide to implement  relevant controls to address the risks related to the operational environment of the product. In  that way the risks identified by the risk owner are addressed completely.  The relationships between the concepts that complement the product itself are shown in Figure 29.

METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  119  B ANNEX: GUIDANCE FOR  THE RISK-BASED SELECTION  OF IMPACT CLASSES  Six risk areas are proposed as generally applicable to all sectors. These include impact on  business operations and functionality; citizens; the type of data processed; reputation and trust;  compliance with contractual requirements; and health and life.  Table 13 shows 5 proposed sectoral impact classes (IC1 to IC5) within the 6 risk areas outlined  above. The number of impact classes has been selected to correspond to the 5 levels of the  Common Security Level (CSL) and the Common Assurance Reference (CAR) that are  presented in Subsection 5.5.2 and in Subsection 5.6.5. The risk areas given in Table 13 are not  exhaustive but may be added, or adapted, to meet the requirements of different sectors.  The impact defined for each class with the risk areas must be regarded as the minimum level  that shall be applied by a sector. However, sectors are permitted to increase the impact class  level definition where they feel this is justified. For example, any impact on personal data, in the  risk area concerning type of data processed, shall be assessed at least at IC2. However, the  sectoral stakeholders may consider that this particular factor is of more concern to their sector,  and the impact on personal data should have an impact level of IC3 or higher.  In addition, sectors could decide to create more specific definitions. For example, a sector may  consider that the definition of IC2 in that risk area should instead be: ‘personal data of fewer  than 10 individuals’. Whilst the definition of IC3 in that risk area should be: ‘special categories of  personal data OR personal data of more than 10 individuals’. Sectoral stakeholders are also  free to add additional risk areas to their assessment.  As Table 13 represents minimum requirements, a reduction in impact class is not foreseen. For  example, the stakeholders may not reduce the IC level if loss of life (IC5) has to be assumed as  an impact. Thus, in other words, cell contents may be shifted to the right, but not to the left.

Sources of information publicly available to identify potential vulnerabilities in the TOE are to  be examined  While examining the evidence provided, the evaluators will use the information in the public  domain to further search for potential vulnerabilities. Where the evaluators have identified  areas of concern, they should consider information publicly available that relates to those  areas of concern.  AVA_VAN.3.3E  Independent, focused vulnerability analysis of the TOE, using the guidance documentation,  functional specification, TOE design, security architecture description and implementation  representation to identify potential vulnerabilities in the TOE, is to be performed.  A focused approach to the identification of vulnerabilities is an analysis of the evidence with  the aim of identifying any potential vulnerabilities evident in the available information. It is an  unstructured analysis, as the approach is not predetermined.  During the conduct of evaluation activities the evaluator may also identify areas of concern.  These are specific portions of the TOE evidence that the evaluator has some reservation  about, although the evidence meets the requirements for the activity with which the evidence  is associated.  4.  The evaluator uses knowledge of the TOE design and operation gained from the TOE  deliverables to conduct a flaw hypothesis to identify potential flaws in the development of the  TOE and potential errors in the method specified for the operation of the TOE.  The following are some examples of the approach a hypothesis may take:  a) consideration of malformed input for interfaces available to an attacker at the external  interfaces;  b) examination of a key security mechanism cited in the description of the security  architecture, such as process separation, hypothesizing internal buffer overflows that may  lead to degradation of separation;  c) search to identify any objects created in the TOE implementation representation that are  then not fully controlled by the TSF and could be used by an attacker to undermine SFRs.  The identification process is iterative, i.e. where the identification of one potential vulnerability  may lead to the identification of another area of concern that requires further investigation.  Subject to the SFRs the TOE is to meet in the operational environment, the evaluator's  independent vulnerability analysis should consider generic potential vulnerabilities under  each of the following headings:  a) generic potential vulnerabilities relevant for the type of TOE being evaluated, as may be  supplied by the evaluation authority;  b) bypassing;  c) tampering;  d) direct attacks;  e) monitoring;  f) misuse.  5.

Note: The properties of self-protection, domain separation,  and non-bypass ability are distinct from security functionality  expressed by Part 2 SFRs because self-protection and non-bypass  ability largely have no directly observable interface at the TSF.  ADV_FSP.4  Complete functional  specification  The developer is required to provide information of all TSFIs -  whether SFR-enforcing, SFR-supporting, SFR-non-interfering - and  each must be described to the same degree, including all of the  direct error messages.  ADV_TDS.3 Basic modular design  A mapping from the TSFI of the functional specification to the lowest  level of decomposition available in the TOE design is to be provided  by the developer.  ADV_IMP.1  Implementation  representation of the TSF  The implementation representation is made available to allow  analysis of other TOE design decompositions (e.g. functional  specification, TOE design), and to gain confidence that the security  functionality described at a higher level in the design actually  appears to be implemented in the TOE.  The implementation representation is expected to be in a form that  captures the detailed internal workings of the TSF. This may be  software source code, firmware source code, hardware diagrams  and/or IC hardware design language code or layout data.

Testing at the level of the TOE subsystems provides  assurance that the TSF subsystems behave and interact as  described in the TOE design and the security architecture  description.  General remarks: There is no general guidance for this level in the standards. This could be subject to the  common definition of technical domains as described in Subsection 5.6.7.

METHODOLOGY FOR SECTORAL CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENTS  September 2021  136  E ANNEX: EXAMPLES OF  ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES  TO PROVIDING EVALUATION  EVIDENCE  This section contains the examples mentioned in Subsection 5.6.6.2 for providing alternative  evidence that may be a substitute for evidence required for the evaluation according to  ISO/IEC 15408 classical CC schemes.  EXAMPLE 1: SKIPPING OR DOWNSCALING THE ASSURANCE COMPONENT ATE  ISO/IEC 15408 is very broad in its requirements to allow evaluations of a broad range of ICT  products from operating systems to smart cards while giving full guidance to the evaluator. For  specific technologies however, it is possible to condense the evaluation tasks specific to such  technologies. An example is the silicon industry which by default applies strong testing and  validation to their products due to their physical properties and potential defects. Hence,  assurance efforts on functional testing in such schemes can be reduced as the manufacturer  will ensure that his products are functional before delivery.  EXAMPLE 2: DEVIATIONS IN TERMINOLOGY  Another example could be that a scheme, although using the ISO/IEC15408 evaluation  concept, decides to define its own easily understandable security functional requirements  catalogue for the scheme. This catalogue could, for example, be in plain English language and  replace the catalogue of ISO/IEC 15408 Part 2. Although such a scheme would not be  compliant with ISO/IEC 15408, it may deliver the same assurance results as a compliant  scheme while making understandable security claims available to its stakeholders.

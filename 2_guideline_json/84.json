This document also specifies the modification of documentation for  providing evidence to demonstrate conformity. Unless otherwise specified in this document, the  test requirements are specified in ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B and ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14.  2 Normative references  This section identifies the normative references cited as ISO/IEC 19790 and ISO/IEC 24759. The  specific editions to be used are ISO/IEC 19790:2012 and ISO/IEC 24759:2017. Please note that  the version 19790:2012 referenced here includes the corrections made in 2015.

For additions to test requirements, new Test  Evidence (TEs) or Vendor Evidence (VEs) will be listed by increasing the “sequence_number.”  Modifications can include a combination of additions using underline and deletions using  strikethrough. If no changes are required, the paragraph will indicate “No change.”  ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B includes security policy requirements in bulleted form but does not  include ways to format the required information. Modifications are addressed by adding  formatting guidance (e.g., tables, images, etc.), adding underlined text, or using strikethrough for  deletion. If no changes are required, the paragraph will indicate “No change.” Additional  guidance may also be included to address requirements presented in SP 800-140, SP 800-140A,  SP 800-140C, SP 800-140D, SP 800-140E, and SP 800-140F.  6 Security requirements  6.1 Documentation requirements  All requirements from ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 and ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B apply and are  required in the security policy as applicable.  ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B uses the same section naming convention as ISO/IEC 19790 section 7 -  Security requirements. For example, Annex B section B.2.1 is named “General” and B.2.2 is  named “Cryptographic module specification,” which is the same as ISO/IEC 19790 section 7.1  and section 7.2, respectively. Therefore, the format of the security policy shall be presented in  the same order as indicated in Annex B, starting with “General” and ending with “Mitigation of  other attacks.” If sections are not applicable, they shall be marked as such in the security policy.

ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B requirements are modified as indicated below:  The additions are intended to provide further guidance on what type of information is expected  for a specific requirement or set of requirements from Annex B.

This document also specifies the modification of documentation for  providing evidence to demonstrate conformity. Unless otherwise specified in this document, the  test requirements are specified in ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B and ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14.  2 Normative references  This section identifies the normative references cited as ISO/IEC 19790 and ISO/IEC 24759. The  specific editions to be used are ISO/IEC 19790:2012 and ISO/IEC 24759:2017. Please note that  the version 19790:2012 referenced here includes the corrections made in 2015.

For additions to test requirements, new Test  Evidence (TEs) or Vendor Evidence (VEs) will be listed by increasing the “sequence_number.”  Modifications can include a combination of additions using underline and deletions using  strikethrough. If no changes are required, the paragraph will indicate “No change.”  ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B includes security policy requirements in bulleted form but does not  include ways to format the required information. Modifications are addressed by adding  formatting guidance (e.g., tables, images, etc.), adding underlined text, or using strikethrough for  deletion. If no changes are required, the paragraph will indicate “No change.” Additional  guidance may also be included to address requirements presented in SP 800-140, SP 800-140A,  SP 800-140C, SP 800-140D, SP 800-140E, and SP 800-140F.  6 Security requirements  6.1 Documentation requirements  All requirements from ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 and ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B apply and are  required in the security policy as applicable.  ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B uses the same section naming convention as ISO/IEC 19790 section 7 -  Security requirements. For example, Annex B section B.2.1 is named “General” and B.2.2 is  named “Cryptographic module specification,” which is the same as ISO/IEC 19790 section 7.1  and section 7.2, respectively. Therefore, the format of the security policy shall be presented in  the same order as indicated in Annex B, starting with “General” and ending with “Mitigation of  other attacks.” If sections are not applicable, they shall be marked as such in the security policy.

ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B requirements are modified as indicated below:  The additions are intended to provide further guidance on what type of information is expected  for a specific requirement or set of requirements from Annex B. They are not intended to cover  all the requirements from Annex B but rather a subset for clarification purposes. The applicable  Annex B requirements are included here in bulleted form for reference.

Therefore, SSPs do not map to  these algorithms.

Recommendations to improve security of communication networks in smart grids 51  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  06  Executive Summary  Smart grids can be described as a new generation of smart power networks that integrate actions coming from all  connected end-users. This infrastructure provides bidirectional communications between end-users and the grid  operator, and therefore extends the attack surface against the power system.  However, one point that has been constantly overlooked and has not received the attention it deserves concerns  the interdependencies and communications between all the assets that make up the new power grids. These  interdependencies in communications are a fundamental pillar, as they represent the means by which all devices  communicate within the smart grid network.  Information transmitted through these intercommunications contains not only customer and consumption data;  but also status checks, instructions to execute, orders for devices to redirect power flow, etc. Therefore, their  protection is essential to protect the privacy of the customers and prevent attacks which could cause blackouts,  power overloads, device malfunctions, data tampering, or even catastrophic cascading effects that could bring down  the power grid itself in more than one country.  For this purpose, this study focuses on the evaluation of these interdependencies, and their architectures and  connections in order to determine their importance, threats, risks, mitigation factors and possible security measures  to implement. To obtain this information, experts in the fields and areas related directly with smart grids were  contacted to gather their know-how and expertise.  The concerns that were expressed by these experts can be sorted into two main categories, technical  recommendations and organizational recommendations:   Regarding smart grid devices, these devices are now exposed to different networks, and therefore their periodic  update becomes essential in order to ensure that they are protected against the latest threats that appear.  Furthermore, these devices should also implement by default security measures to protect them (such as  authentication, encryption or frame counters), as implementing such measures in the deployment phase is  much more costly and does not reach the same level of security.   Regarding the communications interdependencies, the main concern is with the protocols used on the smart  grids. There is an urgent need to harmonize the current situation by establishing common interconnection  protocols to be used by all devices, and ensure that these protocols implement by default enough security  measures to protect the data whilst it is in transit (such as encryption or mutual authentication).   Finally there is the need to align policies, standards and regulations across EU Member States to ensure the  overall security of smart grids. This is now even more important due to the risk that cascading failures can cause;  as smart grid communication networks are no longer limited by physical or geographical barriers, and an attack  on one country could translate into another.  Additionally, due to the global and distributed nature of many of these threats, it becomes necessary for European  organizations, distributors, utilities and the rest of involved stakeholders to share knowledge on these attacks both  on incident management and incident reporting level.  In conclusion, the protection of the intercommunications in smart grid networks is essential in order to ensure the  correct operation of the network and the protection of private and sensitive data. Furthermore, it is necessary in  order to protect against attacks to the power grid, therefore making it a matter of national and European interest.  For this purpose, the following recommendations have been developed:  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  07  Recommendation 1: European Commission should ensure the alignment of policy approaches across EU countries  to establish a common posture for smart grid communication interdependencies. Cyber security has become one  of the main concerns regarding the implementation of smart grids, and especially concerning the networks used for  the interconnection of all the assets that make up this new grid. Therefore, it is inherently necessary to protect these  communication networks, the data that is transmitted through them and the devices connected to them. European  Commission should ensure the alignment of the requirements and standards for smart grid communication  networks, especially regarding the homologation of security devices and protocols.  Recommendation 2: Manufacturers and vendors should foster intercommunication protocol compatibility  between devices from different manufacturers and vendors. Currently, many manufacturers and vendors, due to  the lack of standards, make use of their own proprietary protocols and communication systems for the  intercommunication between their devices. Therefore, when a distributor or utility makes use of these devices, the  rest of the network devices have to be provided by the same vendor, or have to be specifically compatible with  them. Distributors, utilities and other actors involved should make use of devices acquired from various supply lines  without having to be concerned about incompatibilities in the communication among them.  Recommendation 3: European smart grid operators and relevant authorities should develop a set of minimum  security requirements to be applied in all communication interdependencies in smart grids. Security controls must  be defined to reach a minimum level of security that ensures service connectivity continuity and resilience, both in  public and private environments. This could be done by establishing a working group at European level, with  representation of all relevant stakeholders, in order to define a series of recommendations regarding the minimum  security requirements that should always be applied to smart grid devices, intercommunications and  interdependencies.  Recommendation 4: Manufacturers, vendors and asset owners should implement security measures on all  devices and protocols that are part, or make use of the smart grid communication network. Traditionally, grid  devices and assets were usually isolated, or interconnected through private local networks. However, smart grids  bring a new level of interconnection, where devices can be connected to large networks, wireless networks and  even the Internet. This leads to the need to protect these communications against eavesdropping and tampering,  from the origin and up to the destination. This could be achieved by supporting the implementation of security  measures by default on all the protocols used for intercommunication within the smart grid network.  Recommendation 5: Manufacturers, vendors and asset owners should work together on updatable devices and  periodic security update support. Nowadays, it is the norm for software and firmware to receive periodic updates  to fix vulnerabilities, add new security features or fixes, and even add new capabilities. This is quite common on  personal devices and servers, however it is not the case yet  in smart grids. Devices must be designed to be easily  updated, both their software and firmware, in order to ensure that they maintain an acceptable security level.  Manufacturers and vendors should work together on this topic, as they need to design their devices to be easily  updatable, and need to develop an update program to maintain them updated.  Recommendation 6: European Commission, Member States and all relevant smart grid stakeholders should  promote incident reporting and attack patterns sharing. With the implementation of smart grids, many new attack  vectors and network entry points have appeared as a consequence of their intercommunicated and distributed  nature. For this reason, it becomes necessary to share data and attack patterns to help all involved agents protect  their assets and develop countermeasures which can, in turn, be shared to protect the overall smart grid network.  Recommendation 7: European Commission, Member States and all relevant smart grid stakeholders should  promote increased training and awareness campaigns. One of the gripes that threats smart grids is related to the  limited number of qualified professionals; a few of the existing ones lacking adequate training regarding security.  This is due to in new scenarios that have appeared on energy grids regarding the new features that come with the  implementation of smart grid technologies.

Introduction  Smart grids can be described as a new generation smart electric network that integrates actions coming from all  connected end-users. This infrastructure provides bidirectional communications between end-users and the grid  operator, and therefore extends the attack surface against a power system. For instance, consumers such as  households and enterprises are now digitally connected to the ICT infrastructures of Distribution System Operators  (DSOs) through smart meters via a Wide Area Network (WAN) network. Smart meters set the demarcation point  between the DSO Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure and the Customer Premises  Network.  Smart grids in addition to bringing increased automation and control capabilities to the transmission and distribution  grids also add a new layer of system complexity that offer new challenges for insuring the reliability and safety of  operations1. Existing technologies such as Energy Management System (EMS), Distribution Management System  (DMS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) are being updated in order to adapt them to smart  grids, alongside the integration of new technologies. Many of these supporting communication infrastructures,  particularly WAN communications, are provided by telecommunication operators or Internet Service Providers  (ISPs). Therefore these infrastructures will most likely be shared among multiple companies, which bring in multiple  interdependency issues, ranging from the reliability of the whole power system to new cyber security risks.  These are just two use cases which prove that communication networks have become essential elements that allow  the “smart” aspects of the power grids. They provide real-time knowledge of the grid, perform actions  instantaneously when required and gather customer consumption information. These vital assets have to be taken  into account especially as far as security is concerned for several reasons: the data they transport, the increasing  attack surface, the possible cascading effects that an attack can generate in the rest of the grid, etc.  This report focuses on the aspects related to the communication networks and intercommunications between them  in smart grids, identifying vulnerabilities, risks and threat agents. This report makes available a set of  recommendations to mitigate identified risks.  Objectives and Scope  This report presents an analysis of the current situation of smart grid networks, considering the most relevant factors  in this case, including: the role networks play in smart grid domains, the main threats affecting these communication  infrastructure networks and the interdependencies between networks. Therefore, the following objectives have  been set:  1. Review and analyse communication infrastructures in use in smart grids at different domains: end-user  premises (HAN, IAN, and BAN), transmission grids, distribution grid, generation (bulk and DER), electric  vehicle and other power storage facilities.  2. Study connectivity interdependencies for smart grids among different domains in the electricity system  within a Member State (MS) and between MS.  3. Obtain a list of the main threats affecting communication networks in smart grids.  1 Kun L. and Mathews, R. \"Interoperability & Critical Infrastructure Protection: A Review of Activities To Ensure the Reliability  of the U.S. Electric Power Grid\", IEEE-USA, 2007.

Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  13  2. Key aspects of communication networks in smart grids  This section analyses the communication infrastructures in use in smart grids at different domains: end-user  premises, transmission grids, distribution grids and generation.  Figure 2: End-to-End smart grid communications architecture2.  Figure 2 shows an overview of the standard communications architecture of a smart grid. This scenario considers  the communications making use of the Internet due to the physical separation between the different sites of each  section.  Customer premises network (CPN)  The customer premises networks3 are composed of big industries, small and medium business, office buildings,  smart buildings (such as modern office buildings) and standard home users. Due to the different natures of these  sites, three separate networks have been developed in order to group them: Home Area Networks (HAN),  Business/Building Area Networks (BAN) and Industrial Area Networks (IAN).  The Home Area Network (HAN) effectively manages the on-demand power requirements of the end-users. This  network is envisioned to interconnect smart electric appliances such as televisions, washing machines, or energy  management systems. It is the supporting infrastructure for demand-response applications (i.e. switching smart  appliances on or off in order to make an efficient use of electric rates) and advanced energy services provided by  2 IEEE P2030/D.50. “Draft Guide for Smart Grid interoperability of energy technology and information technology and  information technology operation with the Electric Power System (EPS), and end-user applications and loads”, IEEE SA  Standards Board, 2011.  3 ENISA “Smart Grid Security. Annex I. General concepts and dependencies with ICT”, 2012.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  14  DSOs. This network can also provide integration between home automation equipment and energy management  systems, and is directly related to the Smart Home concept.  The Business/Building Area Network (BAN), or Commercial Area Network, is a communication infrastructure  intended to support the needs of regular businesses (e.g. office buildings). The power demand of businesses’  buildings is significantly higher than those from households, and its pattern follows a different curve. Business  Energy Management Services and Building Automation, as well as other advanced energy services need to be  supported by the BAN. On the other hand, a group of HANs is also sometimes called a BAN. In this case, the network  includes all communications in one Building due to its size. The BAN network is directly related with the concept of  Smart Building.  Finally, the Industrial Area Network (IAN) can be defined as the communication infrastructure that allows the  interconnection and support of all machines and devices needed in a particular industry, including regular ICT  hardware and software (i.e. computers, printers and servers) and Industrial Control Systems (i.e. SCADA, Distributed  Control Systems (DCS), Program Logic Controllers (PLC’s)).  Architectures and technologies used in CPN  Figure 3 shows the architecture of the network that connects customer premises with data centres on the smart  grid. It also shows the different technologies that are most commonly used to interconnect the different devices  that make up the network. Note that the PLC mention on Figure 3 refers to “Power Line Communications”, and  does not specify any application protocols.  Figure 3: Basic network architecture4.  Depending on the customer premises’ network type (HAN, IAN or BAN), different technologies can be used. For  example, one Smart Meter configuration could make use of ZigBee for Home Area Networks, Wi-Fi for Business Area  Networks and Z-Wave for Industrial Area Networks; another option is to use the IEC 62056 protocol, based on the  DLMS/COSEM protocol, for these communication networks. Therefore, a combination of different technologies can  be used in order to manage the needs of the grid interdependencies, based on the specific requirements of the area,  infrastructure, etc.  4 AL-OMAR B. et al. \"Role of Information and Communication Technologies in the Smart Grid. Journal of Emerging Trends in  Computing and Information Sciences”, in Journal of Emerging Trends in Computing and Information Sciences, 2012.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  15  Communication networks in the distribution grid  Historically, distribution systems have included little telemetry, and almost all communications within the domain  were performed by humans3. It is considered that “the primary sensor base installed in the distribution domain is  the customer with a telephone, whose call initiates the dispatch of a field crew to restore power”. It was unlikely  for distribution substations to be connected to a central SCADA system, and even then these were not automated  at all. Electrical substations required manual equipment switching and load, energy consumption and abnormal  event data was collected manually. On the other hand, Transmission System Operators (TSOs) have extensive  control over transmission-level equipment, which is now being enhanced with a smarter transmission grid.  However, with the arrival of the smart grids, distribution systems are facing a paradigm shift. As it is acknowledged  by major industry players “distribution networks are under high pressure to meet requirements for converting their  conventional static grids into modern and dynamic smart grids. In particular, the increasing occurrence of  decentralized generation (DER) is influencing this trend, as well as the need to improve the quality and reliability in  both MV and LV networks” (See Figure 2).  Due to this change, there are new requirements on the automation, monitoring, control and protection of  distribution substations and transformer stations/centres. More advanced automation is expected at the  distribution grid with the upcoming smart grids. This “extra” automation is basically Advanced Distribution  Automation (ADA). The goal of the ADA is the real-time adjustment of the distribution system by changing loads,  usually without direct operator intervention, in order to dramatically improve system reliability, quality, and  efficiency. In order to achieve this, substation feeder automation and control will play a central role, and will allow  DSO’s to make the most of DERs, AMIs and Demand-Response strategies, making these three new concepts an  essential part of the ADA toolbox.  The last mile communication infrastructure of the smart grid is a two-way communication network generally  overlaid on top of the power distribution system, which enables features such as: advanced metering services,  distribution automation and substation automation. The underlying communication infrastructures are:  Neighbourhood Area Network (NAN), Field Area Networks (FAN) and Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI),  depending on the devices it interconnects and the applications supported. For instance, FANs are used to connect  distribution substations, distributed/feeder/transformer centre field devices and DERs/micro-grids, including the  utility scale electric storage, to the utility control and operation centre. In addition to these systems, NANs also  include smart meters in households, industries and businesses. Likewise, AMIs can be used interchangeably with  NANs, but only to interconnect smart meters with back-office systems.  The last mile networks (i.e. AMI, NAN, and FAN) as well as DERs/micro-grids and other distribution substation  networks are interconnected with utility control and operations via the backhaul network. This network can be  owned and managed by the utility (i.e. DSO) or by a third party, such as a public telecommunications service  provider. Typically, last mile networks have access to more than one backhaul network. Backhaul networks can use  wired or wireless technologies and enable the aggregation and transportation of customer-related smart grid  telemetry data, substations automation critical operations data, relevant DER and micro-grid field data, and mobile  workforce information.  The distribution substation network is an infrastructure that interconnects all devices within a distribution  substation. It is comprised of LANs that contain the local SCADA, IEDs, RTUs, PMUs and other field devices that need  to be remotely controlled and monitored. At the same time, the distribution substation network provides  connectivity to the backhaul network, either directly or through the FAN network, which in turn can interconnect  several distribution substations before accessing the backhaul. Transformer centre networks can be seen as a  condensed version of a distribution substation network.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  16  The last relevant communication infrastructure supporting power distribution operations and DER/micro-grids is  the feeder network. This network helps to exchange information with field devices (such as switches, capacitor  banks and sensors) and IEDs that are distributed along the power lines, substations and transformer centres. It can  be considered as an overlay on the electrical grid and can use both wireless and wired communication technologies.  Architectures and technologies in the distribution grid  Smart grids have brought many changes to traditional power grids, making use of new technologies and devices to  enable new features that allow better communication, distribution and overall efficiency3. As it has been seen on  the previous section, distribution automation provides DSOs with an increased control over distribution-level  equipment. However, a more advanced automation is expected at the distribution grid with the upcoming smart  grid. Literature refers to this “extra” automation as smart distribution system or Advanced Distribution Automation  (ADA).  Apart from this, distribution networks make use of many existing technologies and protocols, depending on the  needs of each implementation. ANNEX B summarizes some of the most relevant ones, grouped depending on if they  are commonly used on last mile networks or on the backhaul networks. On the other hand, there are others  technologies, not directly related to communications, but that have to be considered when evaluating new  distribution grids. These are:   Fault Detection, Isolation and Restoration (FDIR) systems are focused on improving the reliability of the  distribution networks.   Integrated Volt-VAR Control (IVVC) systems are designed to reduce electric feeder losses improving the overall  voltage distribution and conservation in both peak and non-peak time periods.   Organic Flash Cycle (OFC) systems can potentially increase power generation from thermal energy reservoirs  Communication networks in the transmission grid  Transmission is the bulk transfer of electrical power from generation (and storage) sources to the distribution grid  through multiple substations, which are typically operated by TSOs. The main goal of a TSO3 is to maintain the  stability of the electric grid by balancing generation (supply) and load (demand) across the transmission network.  In today’s electrical grids, the generation, transmission and sub-transmission segments are performing at a high  level and are equipped with automation systems. This has been done by installing Remote Terminal Units (RTUs)  and other control devices in substations and generation plants, connected to a Distributed Control System or to  centralized SCADA/EMS systems.  Therefore, all these recently implemented automated systems and devices in the substations need to communicate  with the central SCADA/EMS systems in order to ensure that they are properly controlled. This requires a new  communication infrastructure to enable this communication and allow remote control and regulation of the systems  as needed. This is especially important in the case of controlling supply and demand, whether automated or manual,  as a failure to control it could potentially cause system overloads or area blackouts.  Additionally, due to the critical nature of these infrastructures, the new communication infrastructures and  networks must be secured against unauthorized tampering. This includes not only physical security but, more  importantly, cyber-security against the new threats that have appeared as a consequence of the implementation of  smart grids (many derived from existing traditional, well known, network threats such as eavesdropping,  interception, etc.).  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  17  Architectures and technologies used in communication networks in the transmission grid  The automation of the transmission power grid requires the use of specific systems and technologies in order to be  controlled. Some of these systems are already in use and are fundamental for the communications of the  transmission grid:   Distribution Management Systems (DMS) are a series of applications to monitor and control the entire  distribution network entirely, and which are becoming more and more important with the advent of smart grids.  These are complemented by SCADA and EMS systems, providing functionalities such as: unbalanced power flow  control, distribution state estimation, integrated volt control, fault identification and location, and service  restoration. Overall, they provide the means to improve the management operations of the network and allow  operators to be able to operate and optimize it in real time.   Energy Management Systems (EMS) are used to analyse and operate the transmission power system reliably  and efficiently. Operators using this system can supervise the network topology, connectivity and load  conditions (including circuit breakers, switch states and control equipment status).   Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems interact with each substation (those that include  HMI and RTU devices) and of the entire network. These systems are designed to manage switching, monitoring  and control these substations. The SCADA/EMS monitors the status of all circuit breakers (open/closed), to  create bus or branch topology configurations of the power system, allowing for optimal power flow calculation,  state estimation, contingency analysis, outage scheduling, voltage and stability analysis, alarm processing, etc.  Moreover, the SCADA/EMS systems also monitor substation metering technology, to retrieve data on line  current and voltage levels at substations.  Apart from these technologies, smart grids will bring a whole range of new specific applications, systems and  technologies designed to improve the transmission grid. The most relevant cases are the High-Voltage Direct Current  (HVDC), Phasor Measurement Units (PMU), Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) and Wide Area Measurement System  (WAMS) technologies, which are described in the following paragraphs:   High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission systems use direct current for the bulk transmission of  electrical power, in contrast with the common alternating current systems. For long-distance transmissions,  HVDC systems can be less expensive and will suffer lower electrical losses.   Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) uses sensors to identify the current carrying capability of a section of the network in  real time to optimise utilisation of existing transmission assets, without the risk of causing overloads.   Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are devices that provide high quality measurements of bus angles and  frequencies using a common time source for synchronisation (i.e. GPS radio clock). PMUs can be autonomous  systems or part of a protective relay or other device in a substation. They are capable of detecting faults early,  increasing the power quality, enabling load shedding and other load control techniques, etc. PMUs are  considered the initial data source for Wide Area Monitoring System (WAMS) applications, essential in regional  transmission grids, local distribution grids and even wide super grids.   Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS) make use of advanced measurement technologies in order to  monitor and control large power grids and super grids. They can be used as a standalone infrastructure or by  complementing other conventional supervision systems, such as SCADA/EMS.  There are several common technologies and protocols that are used for the intercommunication between these  devices and the rest of the transmission grid network. One of the most relevant ones is the IEC 61850 protocol  family, which is applicable to this grid section. Other relevant protocols used on this grid are also on ANNEX A.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  18  Communication network integration between generation, transmission and  distribution grids  According to the distributed nature of the smart grids, there are different parts of them that need to be  interconnected in order to exchange information efficiently. The power grid is operated by many different agents  that are connected to the same grid. There are those that generate power, those that transmit power, and those  that distribute power to end customers. Some of these operators may carry out more than one of these functions.  In order to manage this, the IEC 60870 standard discusses how to exchange information among the smart grid  elements5.  Though there are various proprietary and ad-hoc exchange protocols designed to exchange information among  these elements, it is much more common for actors to exchange data with each other using standardized protocols,  as it is usually more easy and reliable. Some of these standardized protocols are:   IEC 60870-6 Inter-Control Centre Communication.   IEC 61698-13 Common Information Model (CIM) RDF Model exchange format for distribution.   IEC 61670-452 Common Information Model (CIM) RDF Model exchange format for transmission.  Inter-control centre communications depend on the existing low-level communication infrastructure available  between these network elements, such as MPLS, PLC, Satellite, POTS or Leased Lines. The current trend is moving  towards the use of IP technologies, either on top of the already existing infrastructure by investing in IP-enabled  network, or by contracting virtual networks to ISPs.  For non-real time transmission data, the Common Information Model (CIM) is commonly used, and the IEC 61670- 452 standard defines how these data is exported to XML for exchange with other parties. The IEC 61670-5xx series  section of the standard defines C and web service profiles for the different data access services, making web services  the preferred exchange mechanism for CIM data. Nevertheless, it is not uncommon for XML files to be exchanged  using mechanisms other than web services, such as FTP or even plain HTTP POST/PUT requests.  IEC 61968-13 is the distribution equivalent of IEC 61970-452, defined for transmission data, and typically includes  information related to assets, work, construction, distribution and outage management. The IEC working group is,  however, considering merging or replacing this with IEC 61970-452, as there is a significant overlap between both.  Architectures and technologies used in network interconnections  Communications between the generation, transmission and distribution domains are complex and usually require  large communication networks, which make use of many different technologies and protocols to adapt to the  individual needs of each section and area. Therefore, there is an inherent need to ensure proper compatibility  between them in order to ensure the quality, reliability and security of these intercommunications.  A detailed list of some of the most relevant technologies used for the intercommunication within and between these  domains can be found on the table present at ANNEX A of this document as a detailed explanation of each protocol  and technology falls outside the scope of this deliverable. As a notable mention, the IEC 61850 protocol family is  specially adapted for the integration between grid sections.  5 Expert Group on the security and resilience of Communication networks and Information systems for Smart Grids. “Work  Package 2.3 Research Smart Grid communication protocols and infrastructures to incorporate data security measures”, 2012.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  19  3. Telecommunication service providers and interdependencies in  smart grids  Many of the communication infrastructures, particularly WAN communications, are provided by telecommunication  operators or Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Therefore they might be shared by multiple companies. As it was  mentioned on the previous section, one DSO can share the communication infrastructure with a TSO or another  DSO, but also with a public company, or a large enterprise belonging to a completely different sector.  The communication infrastructure is deployed in order to share information in the smart grid, where the amount  and variety of data is large. Therefore the definition of metadata fields is a complex and cumbersome process. The  actors involved in this process can be classified into two categories: those which need the data and those which  develop products to deliver the required data. The first group of actors includes, but is not limited to:   Transmission system operators.   Distribution system operators.   Energy retailers.   Energy services companies.   Billing organizations.   Energy regulators.  They are sometimes referred to as driving actors since metadata is created by analysing their input. The second  group of actors consists of product manufacturers such as smart meter producers, utility companies, enterprise  software developers, B/HAS developers, standard logical model developers, etc. We might refer to them as  implementing actors, since they are the ones that make data usable by defining its format according to the  definitions given by the driving actors. Metadata management is an important part of the early stages of the system  development.  Many actors are involved in metadata management. Examples of data management in the smart grid are: network  models which may include electrical transmission or distribution, customer data required to identify customer  accounts and service locations, geographic information used to derive network models, assets, work orders,  measurements, etc. The Inter-Domain Analysis of Smart Grid Domain Dependencies Using Domain-Link Matrices6  study describes in detail the interdependencies in smart grids.  Along the same lines, “Reducing Cascading Failure Risk by Increasing Infrastructure Network Interdependency”7  analyses the importance of improving the security of the interdependencies in smart grids and the need to reduce  cascade failures. Although increasingly complex networks have been intensively studied for over a decade, the  researchers still focus on the case of an isolated network without external interaction. However, it is known that  modern systems are building and working co-ordinately and therefore, these systems must be designed as  interdependent networks. A major vulnerability of interdependence networks is that the failure of nodes on a  network can lead to failure of child nodes on other networks.  6 SULEIMAN H. et al. “Inter-Domain Analysis of Smart Grid Domain Dependencies Using Domain-Link Matrices”, Smart Grid,  IEEE Transactions, 2012.  7 KORKALI M. et al. “Reducing Cascading Failure Risk by Increasing Infrastructure Network Interdependency”, arXiv, 2015.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  20  When node (substation) or edge (transmission line) failures occur, power re-routes according to Kirchhoff’s and  Ohm’s laws. This re-routing increases flows along parallel paths, which can subsequently trigger long chains of  component failures, potentially leading to a wide-area blackout. As a result of this process, failures propagate non- locally: the next component to fail may be hundreds of miles or tens of edges distant from the previous failure  leading to a cascade of failures. The research of interdependency issues will lead to the development and application  of new system concepts and design approaches towards the mitigation of the risks posed by these  interdependencies on a nationwide scale.  Figure 4 represents an example of how a cascade effect might affect the smart grid. Considering a pair of  interdependent networks (a power grid and a communication network) in which a fraction of the number of nodes  in the power grid are coupled to corresponding nodes in communication network. When a node fails in this model,  the associated edges in both networks immediately fail too.  Figure 4: A disturbance in (1) causes edge failures (2) in the power grid, as well as node and edge failures (3) in the communication  network.  As mentioned in reports “Catastrophic cascade of failures in interdependent networks”8 and “R&D Themes for Cyber  Security in the Smart Grid”9, it is very important for inter-operators to consider and become aware of the risks posed  by the existence of interdependencies in smart grid communication networks. This is needed in order to prevent  the possibility of cascading failures leading towards catastrophic blackouts.  Inter-operator and multiple communication service providers for smart grid  segment networks  Continuing on towards intercommunications and the multiple providers in charge of the specific communication  networks from each domain, it is necessary to consider that each one may make use of different technologies and  8 BULDYREV S.V. et al. “Catastrophic cascade of failures in interdependent networks”, Nature, 2010.  9 GHANSAH I. et al. “R & D Themes for Cyber Security in the Smart Grid”, 2010.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  21  operation methods. This leads to unique interdependencies among these networks that require cyber-security  elements that can impact on the reliability of the rest of the elements of the power system. The correct security  design for each one of the services and domains must be one of the main objectives when securing these  interconnections10.  As previously discussed in the section 2.3, in order to perform the metering and transmission services, operators  must use communication networks, Neighbourhood Area Network (NAN), Field Area Networks (FAN) and Advanced  Metering Infrastructure (AMI) are interconnected by backhaul networks. The backhaul might be owned and  managed by operators and can use wire line or wireless technologies like Wi-Fi, WiMAX, 3G mobile networks and  LTE/4G.  The document titled Advanced Wireless Backhaul for the Smart Grid11 suggests that last mile communication  infrastructures can be implemented as a backhaul network as long as the following stages are fully implemented:   Connect all individual meters to local collection points.   The local collection points have to be backhauled in order to reach a higher capacity level on the aggregation  points.   Aggregation points have to be backhauled to the utility’s network operations’ centre.  Furthermore, the inter-operator communication network has to connect with several of the following domains,  depending on the needs of each individual implementation:   Last mile communications network, which includes all of the individual meters, collection points and  aggregation points.   The distribution substation network, where devices connect with distribution substations that, at the same  time, are connected to the core backhauled network.   Distributed Energy Resources: their network has many other operators that have to be interconnected with  each other and with utilities. Figure 4 on ANNEX D shows that the highest level of the DER architecture (level 5)  contains Transmission and Market Operations, and involves a larger utility environment. Regional Transmission  Organizations (RTOs) and Independent System Operators (ISOs) need to exchange information about the  capabilities and operational status of larger, or aggregated, DER systems. The energy transmissions from the  DERs are at the same time interconnected to the demand and response systems, as well as to the utilities’  network operation centres.  The network operation centres of the utility companies are the main points from where all the information of the  backhauled network in the smart grid begins and flows. These are also the main points where the system operators  (control and data centre) are connected. The service of the operators at this point is to act as resource options for  balancing supply and demand. This demand and response communication needs to be implemented with a high  range of security and tidy protocols. The previous document mentioned12 underlines how the IEC-61968 standard is  considered as an example focused on integration of applications related to transmission, generation, and energy  markets. Also, “Object linking and embedding for Process Control” (OPC) is an integration standard used for process  control integration. It’s a requirement that in the inter-operator communication networks, different operators must  10 ANGELETTI V. et al. “Italian Case Study: socio-economic impact analysis of a cyber-attack to a power plant in an Italian  scenario. Cost and benefit estimation of CIPS standard adoptions”, 2014.  11 Solution Brief, “Advanced Wireless Backhaul for the Smart Grid”, CERAGON, 2014.  12 ENISA. “Communication networks dependencies in Smart Grids”, 2014.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  22  be organized between each other not only in communication network protocols and standards but also in security  incidents.  In the bulk generation, transmission, and distribution domains, various control messages and received messages  from the distributed sensors in the smart grid are frequently conveyed from the control applications in the control  centre to various locations on the smart meter by using a robust communication infrastructure. Demand and  response messages in the smart grid are used to provide an interface to connect a variety of users, devices and  systems together. There are many messages exchanged through the communication system of the smart grid, such  as energy readings from smart meters, triggering events, control messages, device status messages, energy  consumption messages, pricing messages, outage messages, etc. Interfaces are used to exchange energy-related  information and provide connection among home networks and external networks and systems, such as the utility  network. The Internet gateway is considered as an example of such a system, which enables customers’ interactions  by sending and receiving requests via secure web-portals, this will be described in “3.3 The role of the Internet in  smart grids”.  Within the transmission and distribution domains, the IEC Common Information Model (CIM) has been adopted to  allow application software to exchange information about the configuration and the status of an electrical network.  The CIM aims to govern several areas pertaining to the physical infrastructure of the smart meters. Some of the  areas covered include asset measurements, which are received from telemetry and help to identify the current state  of both the assets and the infrastructure. The modern communications infrastructure is used to achieve this task  using two-way communication interfaces (backhaul network). One noteworthy example is the data collection from  Remote Terminal Units within the SCADA network, which is then transferred to the control centre (system operator).  The SCADA database is monitored and updated remotely; therefore database-centric applications are fundamental.  One of the IEC standards, IEC 61970-301, defined the core packages of the CIM with focus on the electricity  transmission needs, such as EMS, SCADA, and other related applications. In addition, IEC 60870-6 is commonly used  to provide data links to exchange measured values among the control centres. It is commonly known as TASE.2 and  the Inter Control Centre Protocol (ICCP).  Smart grids can be quite large and geographically dispersed13; more importantly, regardless of the distance they still  require real-time information in order to automatically manage the different sections of the grid and maintain good  efficiency levels. This however requires that power companies convert their existing legacy grids into the new smart  grids, requiring in many cases large investments and redesigns of entire sections. A trend has already appeared  regarding companies acquiring communication services from third-party communication service providers in order  to reduce these costs.  As far as security is concerned, there are some points to consider regarding power utilities and Communication  Service Providers (CSPs). By using CSPs to meet the connectivity needs of smart grids, these become dependent on  them in order to carry out their work functions. For this reason, it is heavily recommended to not depend on a single  CSP, instead make use of several ones, and consider the following points:   Regarding Risk Management, the risk generated by using a single CSP is considerably lower in case of CSP failure  or attack, when the dependency of the CSP is minimized, allowing that some parts of the smart grids can avoid  being affected.   Geographical effectiveness: The smart grid components can follow different strategies in different places. The  usage of different CSPs provides the flexibility of selecting the most expert CSP according to the required  technologies and features of the place.  13 CEN-CENELEC-ETSI, “SGAM User Manual - Applying, testing & refining the Smart Grid Architecture Model”, Smart Grid  Coordination Group, 2014.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  23   Technologic Variety: Using different CSPs allows using different technologies for different network segments  within the same domain. This reduces the exposure in case of “Zero-day vulnerabilities” and the cost of dealing  with them if they ever occur. Regarding wireless communications, sometimes the usage of different CSPs allows  the use of different working frequencies that enhance the wireless communications’ security.   Isolating different types of traffic and applying different Quality of Service (QoS) levels can be done according  to data needs, and this practise also provides a mechanism of protecting the information regarding internal  power utility processes, or as a “backup” service provider.  However, using different CSPs also has some disadvantages that have to be considered:   This practice can be more difficult to manage for the power utility, such as the security management (encryption,  redundancy, etc.) of the customer data as well as the locations where it is stored (several third-party information  systems).   The operation cost of using multiple CSPs is significantly higher than using just one and it can happen that the  network infrastructure for managing different CSPs is more complex and expensive than if only one CSP was  used.   The number of people that have access to confidential information of the power utility is much higher in a  scenario with more than one CSP. Consequently, the attack surface for information leakage is much bigger.  Finally taking into account the different points of view that have been discussed in this section, the conclusion moves  towards recommending the use of multiple CSPs to provide communications in smart grids, as well as considering  possible measures to mitigate the effects of the disadvantages they imply.  Inter-Member State power infrastructures supporting communication networks  Another important factor that has to be taken into account is the Inter-Member State power infrastructures that  support the communication networks, as they now become an essential part of smart grids due to their delocalized  nature. Smart grids are no longer confined to a single country; now they have become part of a whole grid spanning  throughout Europe, having intercommunication among the different States and reaching a point where a failure or  attack in one of them could adversely affect the rest.  For this purpose, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E)14 has become  involved in this process, supporting not only traditional energy distribution, but also focusing on the  intercommunications among their systems (see Figure 5).  14 BARTOSZEWICZ-BURCZY H. et al. “Polish case study. Scenario based assessment of costs and benefits of adoption of  comprehensive CIP standards”, 2014.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  24  Figure 5: Map of ENTSO-E systems.  ENTSO-E established that the operation of interconnected networks is founded on the principle that each partner is  responsible of its own network (coordination at regional and European levels, interference of national system and  corresponding inter-TSO coordination that requests more and more coordination), but cannot ignore the rest of the  networks. For this purpose, ENTSO-E has developed an Operation Handbook15 that defines the basic interconnection  principles and infrastructure that should be followed in order to establish successful and secure interconnections  between grids. It defines the use of the Electronic Highway (EH), a routed network separate from the Internet that  interconnects TSOs, can be used for real-time and non-real-time communications. This operational handbook  defines a series of points that Transmission System Operators should follow:   A set of minimum requirements to apply.   Up-to-date implementation rules and recommendations.   Common specifications for communications and data exchange.   Operation and maintenance recommendations.  However, the Operation Handbook does not specify the national grid codes, as this remains responsibility of each  country and is usually influenced by market rules. Regarding security, there are a series of recommendations that  have been included in order to protect the systems against attacks, and especially against the risk of cascading  effects on parts of the network or even the whole network itself. These recommendations are:   Connection to the Internet: there should not be any physical or logical connection between the Electronic  Highway (EH) and the Internet. If needed, data exchange between the EH and the outside world should only be  done through clearly defined and fully protected limited channels. This can be achieved by using intermediate  gateways and firewalls crossing TSO boundaries. Operators however should be aware of recent research on  15 ENTSO-E. “Operation Handbook. P6 - Policy 6: Communication Infrastructure”, 2008.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  25  the visibility of control systems assumed to be disconnected from the Internet. Project Shine (16 and17) for  example gave reason to question such assumptions. Operators of increasingly complex systems need to test  and check for the possible visibility of devices.   Private Networks: the Electronic Highway can be considered as a private network, as it is isolated from the rest  of the networks and the Internet. Only protocols specified by the TRM (Electronic Highway Technical Reference  Manual) should be used. Point-to-point connections should be used to interconnect devices through the EH  network.   Dedicated network for data exchange: The EH is the main and preferred communication channel for data  exchanges among TSOs related to operation. The EH should also be used as communication media for data  exchanges among TSOs related to market.   Incorporation of new protocols and applications: it is possible to add new protocols, apart from the ones  predefined on the TRM; however it has to be done following the process defined on it.   Requirement for EH interconnections: several standard requirements have been defined, being the following  the most relevant ones:   Communication redundancy should always be ensured, by using more than one point-to-point lines for each  TSO. This guarantees the stability of the EH backbone.   Speed and availability should also be controlled in order to obtain stable communications.   All data exchanged must be transmitted over the EH from the sender to the recipient uncorrupted, in  sequence and in a timely manner to guarantee integrity.   TSOs responsibilities: the following responsibilities have been established for TSOs for the security operation of  the EH network:   Take appropriate measures to protect the Electronic Highway and each connected TSO against any potential  risks such as operation disruption or data corruption and disclosure of confidential data.   Protect against any unauthorised access to the EH.   Perform periodic malware checks.   Monitor and guarantee the availability of EH components in their domain.   Check physical line and SCADA connection redundancy.   Manage their own network components (such as routers, gateways or physical lines).  Finally, it is important to remember that smart grid assets, even if they are not connected to the Internet, are still  vulnerable. The false belief that devices not connected to the Internet are not vulnerable has been an IT myth for  quite some time, and one that should be quickly dismissed as reality has proved it otherwise. In a recent report  made by the German Government Federal IT Department18, a cyber-intrusion on a steel mill systems caused physical  damage to some of the assets, even though these systems had been isolated from the Internet as much as possible.  16 Project SHINE (SHodan INtelligence Extraction), “Findings report”, 2014.

Therefore, these  companies were in charge and control of all aspects of their systems and, from a security point of view, their main  concern was the physical protection of their assets and installations. Therefore, communications were limited and  were not exposed to external shared networks, much less to the Internet.  The appearance and exponential growth of the Internet gave way to new means of communications, not only  traditional point-to-point ones, which offered a lot of benefits at an affordable cost. Smart grids make use of  intercommunication networks in order to interconnect all the devices that make it up, and therefore the need to  use large communication networks becomes a basic requisite.  Therefore, the Internet has become one of the main means for smart grids to interconnect their devices, as it  provides wide coverage and compatible protocols supported by many different services, enabling direct  communication to devices located geographically apart without the expenses of implementing their own  communication network (which can be prohibitively high in case of large distributed or nation-wide grids).  Furthermore, the use of these communication channels enables smart grids to automatically control and manage  all the devices that are part of it, obtaining improved efficiency for the power generation, transmission and  distribution, and the overall working of the grid itself. An exception to this point is the Electronic highway, which is  focused specially on the use of a private network separated from the Internet for the communications and data  exchange between Transmission System Operators, as it has been defined on Section 3.2.  However, these networks, and especially the Internet which encompasses all of them (except the Electronic Highway  presented in the previous chapter), are not inherently safe against threats and vulnerabilities. On the contrary, these  networks may suffer from a multitude of attacks and are vulnerable to many varied threats to the communications  that pass through them (as described in more detail on Section 4.1); this includes not only intentional attacks, but  also unintentional data damage caused by employees or badly configured devices.  There are also resilience and security concerns regarding the infrastructure of the Internet itself, as they pose a risk  as serious as those that affect the communications that pass through them. These threats were defined by ENISA’s  Internet Infrastructure Security and Resilience Reference Group19, where they were sorted into three main  categories: routing attacks, DNS attacks and Denial of Service attacks (these will also be described in more detail in  Section 4.1).  Therefore their securitization becomes a must. As many of these threats and risks are common to the various  services that make use of the network, smart grid manufacturers, vendors, operators and experts can take this  know-how and existing knowledge in order to adapt and protect and properly configure their own devices against  these threats.  In light of these concerns, the risks to power grids have to be thoroughly considered, as they are critical  infrastructures that maintain many other systems and services, and are a fundamental requirement for the  operation of business, industries and even for the well-being of the population. An even bigger risk appears due to  the interconnected and distributed nature of these systems, the cascade effect: a failure or service outage on one  distributor or one country, if not properly controlled, could affect other distributors and countries.  19 ENISA https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/internet-infrastructure-security-and-resilience-reference-group/threats  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/internet-infrastructure-security-and-resilience-reference-group/threats  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  27  Architectures and technologies used for intercommunications through the Internet  The Internet has become the network of networks, a massive grid that connects the whole world together;  communications from one side of the world to the other takes less than a second. To maintain such large  infrastructures, different architectures and technologies are used; but always following a compatible structure to  ensure the compatibility of all the systems and devices that are connected to it.  The Internet makes use of many different architectures and technologies for the different sections that make it up,  as well as having available a wide range of protocols that can be used to offer different services and functionalities.  The architecture of the Internet is distributed and redundant, there are no established hard point-to-point lines;  connections are established using the most efficient path, and so connections to the same destination can make use  of different intermediate devices and communication lines each time.  When the Internet was initially envisioned, security was not a concern as the scope was limited; therefore the  resulting architecture and protocols proved highly efficient and scalable, but offered no security measures at all by  default. Further iterations of these architectures and protocols began to implement security measures for the  protection of all the communications, transmissions and services offered through the Internet (such as SSL/TLS,  mutual authentication, point-to-point encryption or certificates).  Among all technologies that are available on the Internet, the most relevant ones that are used for communications  among the devices part of the smart grid are:   Internet Protocol (IP): is probably the most used and important communication network protocol used by the  devices part of the smart grid. This protocol is used due to its compatibility and open-source implementation,  allowing different devices from different manufacturers to communicate with ease. Through the use of this  protocol, devices can reliably exchange data and manage operations and activities. This protocol however, is  vulnerable to a wide range of attacks due to its lack of security measures, and therefore it becomes necessary  to implement additional security measures, such as using TLS to encrypt the data, in order to ensure the integrity  and confidentiality of the transmitted information or instructions.   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS): is used to encapsulate various network protocols, and transmit those  using short paths to reach the destination, instead of using a long path the whole way. This protocol is scalable,  and works independently of the protocol that is transmitted.  There are a series of relevant protocols that can also be used on these networks, in conjunction with the previously  listed technologies:   Distributed Network Protocol (DNP): is a set of communication protocols designed specifically for the  communication of devices part of automated systems. It is used mainly in SCADA systems to interconnect the  Master Station with the RTUs and IEDS. It has been designed to be reliable, but lacks security measures.   IEC 61850: is a standard designed to be used to control the automation processes on electrical substations. It  defines data exchange between control systems the substations themselves. It includes many required features  to carry out these functions, including data modelling, data storage (substation configuration language, or SCL),  fast transfer events and reporting schemes. It also includes variations of this protocol for different installations,  such as Hydroelectric Power Plants (IEC 61850-7-410) or Distribution Automation Systems (IEC 61850-7-420).   IEC 60870: defines the systems needed for the supervision and data acquisition of power automation systems.  It has been divided into five parts: transmission frame formats, datalink transmission services, general  application data structure, coding definitions for information elements and basic application functionalities.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  28  Therefore, not all the technologies and protocols used for the communications through the Internet support security  measures by default, and as such it becomes necessary to use additional measures in order to protect them. Some  of the most common security technologies that can be used to protect communications include:   Transport Layer Security (TLS): is a cryptographic protocol designed to protect communications over a network.  This is achieved by using asymmetric cryptography and client certificates to authenticate both the sender and  the recipient and symmetric protocols to carry out data encryption. Its predecessor, SSL v3 is also commonly  used, although its use is not recommended due to several security flaws that have been detected on it.   IEC 62351: is a standard designed to handle the security of several protocols including IEC 60870, IETC 61850,  IEC 61970 and IEC 61968. Among its features, it includes TLS encryption, node authentication, message  authentication and several other specific security profiles.   IEV IEC 61850-90-12: provides definitions, guidelines and recommendations for the engineering of WANs,  especially regarding their protection, control and monitoring. It is based on IEC 61850 and several related  protocol standards. It is mostly used for communications between substations and the control centre.   Internet Protocol Security (IPSec):  comprises of a set of protocols designed specifically to protect IP  communications by applying authentication and encryption to them. It supports mutual authentication, and  works on the Internet Layer (while TLS works on a higher level, on the Application Layer).   Secure Shell (SSH): is a protocol that provides a secure connection to remote machines, by applying encryption  to protect the data. For this communication, the remote machine must have an operational SSH server to which  the client will connect to.   DNP3 Secure: is an upgrade to the standard DNP3 protocol designed to provide additional security measures,  including authentication and data encryption. It is compliant with IEC 62351-5 standard, and in some cases  Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are also used to secure IP networks.   Virtual Private Network (VPN): is not a protocol per-se, it is more of a concept, but it can be considered as a  relevant security measure in order to protect communications. In a VPN the use of point-to-point private  network over a public network or the Internet are specified. A VPN uses tunnelling protocols to make available  private communication, and to also make use of encryption protocols to protect the confidentiality of the data  transmitted.

Threat and risk analysis on communication networks in smart grids  This chapter focuses on security threats, risk factors, incidents and attacks affecting communication networks in  smart grids, with particular interest on those that might imply cascading effects on large part of the population.  Regarding risk factors, some examples include: interconnected networks and systems, communication protocol  vulnerabilities or IT vulnerabilities, legacy communication protocols, communication disruptions, malicious software  and firmware, compromised hardware, increased number of entry points and paths, new sensitive personal data.  Analysis and summary of threats affecting smart grid communications  Starting from “Smart Grid Security: Threats, Vulnerabilities and Solutions”20 and “Smart Grid Threat Landscape and  Good Practice Guide”21, the goal of this section is to combine the most important aspects of these documents, the  experts’ interviews and other relevant documents, in order to reach a complete overview of threats that affect smart  grids nowadays.  Smart grids bring improvements and better capabilities to the traditional power network. These networks provide  electricity on demand using information and communication technologies that enable energy providers to control  the power supply and allow for an efficient power delivery with lower costs. However, this makes networks more  complex and vulnerable to different types of attacks and even unintentional failures due to increased complexity of  systems and levels of cyber fragility. The principal difference between traditional grids and Smart grids is that there  are three new main security objectives that must be taken in account: availability of the service, integrity of  transmitted data and confidentiality of the consumer’s data.  However, due to the recent Smart grid concept and implementation there is very little practical experience on cyber- attacks affecting Smart grids. Besides, industrial cyber security is also a quite new topic and security experts are still  learning it, developing hacking tools and finding new vulnerabilities at an exponential rate. These vulnerabilities  might allow attackers to obtain back-doors, compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the information, and  even make the service unavailable. Therefore, the security of traditional and new Smart grid ICT technologies must  be addressed by the energy sector. This is not only a task for grid operators but also for public bodies,  standardisation organisations, service providers, and any other stakeholder involved. In addition, cyber security  must be considered in all Smart grid domains and at all phases of the system life cycle.  As a result of the experience of a cyber-attack affecting a Smart grid, in the “Smart Grid Security - Annex II”22 by  ENISA it is underlined how physical security and safety is much more stable and well-known by the actors involved  in the Smart grid deployment. For instance, there is abundant statistical data about natural disasters, such as  hurricanes or earthquakes, which makes it much easier for experts to characterise these threats from a risk point of  view. Alternatively, natural disasters are random events while cyber threats depend on people (i.e. attackers): their  motivations, capabilities, interests, etc. Besides, all these factors change over time. As a result, managing risks  deriving from cyber security threats is a real challenge that needs to be addressed and solved. In order to succeed  in such task it is important to first identify potential threats, at all levels, ranging from natural disasters to technical  aspects. When identifying threats, it should not only be considered those targeting infrastructure operations, but  20 ALOULA F. et al. “Smart Grid Security: Threats, Vulnerabilities and Solutions”, International Journal of Smart Grid and Clean  Energy, 2012.  21 ENISA “Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide”, ENISA, 2013.  22 ENISA “Smart Grid Security. Annex II. Security aspects of the smart grid”, 2012.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  30  also those targeting the end consumer (i.e. privacy aspects) as well as national security related factors (i.e.  government personnel, other national facilities, assets, and interests identified by national intelligence, etc.).  On a similar point, it is also relevant to consider the threat posed by unintentional events that could impact on the  security of the systems, assets and intercommunications. While these events cannot be considered as the main topic  of the study, rather more alongside it, they still have to be considered when developing general security  recommendations. The paper “Interoperability & Critical Infrastructure Protection: A Review of Activities to Ensure  the Reliability of the U.S. Power Grid”1 makes a case of the risks posed by unintentional events and incidents and  the threat they present to smart grids.  Therefore, based on the threat domains defined on “Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide”21, the  following table (Figure 6) has been developed and expanded in order to cover all the threats that directly affect  Smart grid intercommunication networks. The details of each one of these attacks can be found on ANNEX B.  Figure 6: Main threats to Smart grid intercommunications.

Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  32  It is important to emphasise the fact that most security vulnerabilities in communication infrastructures require  defining specific security measures to mitigate them such as: automating system data protection, identifying and  enhancing a security perimeter, building comprehensive security through defence-in-depth, and restricting access  to data and services to authenticated users based on operational requirements.  Many of these vulnerabilities result from deficient or non-existent security configuration options in the  organizations’ Smart grid, employees’ mistakes, and workers attrition in system automation. Also, the industry is  not quite aware about the threat environment and attacker capabilities, underestimating the risk that they are  going to have to deal with.  Following on from the previous chapter regarding the analysis of current threats, the  next step is to list known vulnerabilities that could pose a serious risk to Smart grids, according to the ideas  presented on the document by Aloula20:   Vulnerable consumers: The intelligent devices of the Smart grids can process massive amounts of data and  send it to the utility company, consumer, and service providers. As a result, preserving authorized restrictions  on information access and disclosure is fundamental in order to protect proprietary and personal data privacy.  This is particularly necessary to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information that is not open to the public  and individuals and to implement robust transmission methods and protocols. This is extremely important,  due to the fact that transmitted information includes private consumer data, which could potentially reveal  consumer’s activities, devices being used, or consumption habits.   Massive number of devices: Smart grid networks have several intelligent devices that are involved in  managing both electricity supply and network demand. This is due to the great area covered on the grids’  deployment, with many features and services that must be covered. Moreover, the sheer size of the network  makes monitoring and managing it extremely difficult to carry out. On the other hand, a modification or update  on these devices can lead to a great economic cost and many staff working hours due to the need to travel to  the remote device location. These vulnerabilities could result in intelligent devices being used as attack entry  points into the network. If attackers gain access to these machines, they can potentially steal confidential and  private data through them, or even manipulate the transmitted information.   Coexistence of legacy and new devices: It is quite usual that legacy devices are in service along with more  contemporary ones. This coexistence between devices may result in possible incompatibilities at physical and  protocol levels; or even vulnerabilities and threats as a result of possible interdependencies between devices  and networks. These legacy devices could become weak points and even cause severe conflicts with current  power systems, unless specific security measures are implemented on them in order to mitigate these risks.   Implicit trust M2M by default: Several devices in their Machine to Machine (M2M) communications use  implicit trust by default. This is an important weakness due to the interdependency with the other machine  lead to the appearance of additional vulnerabilities. If an attacker gains control of the other machine involved,  or pretends to be it, he could send wrong data to the first machine or receive confidential and private data  from it. Data Spoofing is a threat for Device-to-Device communication in control systems; the state of one  device involves the actions of another. Even more, this implicit trust can be used by attackers to carry out  Man-in-the-Middle attacks, compromising the network interconnection between these devices and even the  rest of the network.   Commercial hardware and software: Commercial hardware and software development is usually done  separately from the operators who will make use of it later. This lack of interaction becomes an issue later  when these operators proceed to implement security measures to protect the devices and the  communications between them, sometimes being unable to fully implement them Therefore, using  commercial assets entails vulnerabilities inherent to the hardware and software such as bugs, weaknesses,  back-doors, failures or even outdated assets, which present a serious vulnerability for smart grid  communications.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  33   Communication protocols: Communications between devices in the Smart grids, especially in the consumer  domain, are done through well-known communication protocols. Besides, these protocols have been a long  time in use and they are widespread. For example, some of the wireless protocols used in Smart grids (i.e.  Bluetooth, ZigBee, Infrared, WiMAX, Wi-Fi, LTE, UMTS or GPRS) are already widely used in other contexts.  Therefore, protocols applied on Smart grids are also an important source of vulnerabilities, and many of these  vulnerabilities are well known by attackers, and they have even developed automated tools for easing these  attacks. Also, many application-level protocols have been designed without adequate levels of intrinsic  security mechanisms.   Human factors: All organisations have information that would put business operations at risk in the event that  it was to be lost or corrupted in some way. Power grid companies are not exempt; most of their workers are  dependent on their computer systems for the success of their businesses and know that cyber threats are  increasing, nationally and internationally. Protecting these systems is costly. Even with the increasing  sophistication of cyber-attacks from outside sources, the greatest proportion of data losses and failures are  still caused by human errors. Many of these can easily be avoided once people become knowledgeable of the  risks to information security and regard them as a personal duty. Despite the evidence that the human element  plays a major part in the risks, most of operators have relied on electronic protection systems to secure  confidentiality, integrity and availability; but this is no longer a safe option. This source of vulnerabilities  includes all those human aspects and conditions that an attacker could take advantage of to successfully  achieve its malicious objectives. This vulnerability depends on the security training employees receive and the  security actions taken by organisations, especially regarding the use of network communications and the  management and configuration of the smart grid assets in order to ensure that their communications are done  securely and reliably.  According to the document Smart Grid Security20, attacks could be classified into three main categories depending  on the target to attack:   Component-wise attacks target field components that have Remote Terminal Units.   Protocol-wise attacks are focused on the communication protocol (reverse engineering, false data injections).   Topology-wise attacks target the topology of the network by carrying out Denial-of-Service.  Sample attacks against Smart grid communication networks and learnt lessons  The previously listed vulnerabilities and risks could be exploited by attackers with different motivations and could  cause different levels of damage and cascade effects to Smart grids. This section includes examples about real life  attacks against Smart grid communication networks and learnt lessons. Most of them have been obtained from  the information gathered from the interviews made with experts who contributed to this document (see Figure  7). For more detailed scenarios and attack cases, please see “Electric Sector Failure Scenarios Common  Vulnerabilities and Mitigations Mapping”23 and TACIT framework for the assessment of risk and impact of cyber- attacks in smart-grids24.  Figure 7: Sample Smart grid attacks.  TARGET ELEMENT ATTACKS LEARNT LESSONS  Attack in Control Centre  System  One of the worst scenarios considered included an attack to the  Control Centre system.

This  could affect several systems in different countries.   Provides privacy and isolation between  different system groups;   Protects devices and provides network  redundancy.  Data theft  Another scenario considered a data theft, where technical  information regarding internal workings and operations was  leaked. This could be caused by malware on the computers, due  to users having too many permissions or the use of weak  encryption or authentication protocols.   Disable unnecessary services and  ports;   Implement secure protocols;   Use stronger encryption;   Optimize of data traffic (only necessary  data).  FTP server attack  This attack is carried out by using brute force to obtain user  access. The attackers broke the password and obtained access,  but this did not have any relevant impact.   Use robust and strong authentication  and encryption methods.   Furthermore, the use of Secure FTP  variants is recommended in order to  avoid sending clear-text passwords  throughout the network.  Man-in-the-Middle  attacks (MITM)  Alter the communication between two network components  which are communicating directly. This process frequently  consists on monitoring the network, intercepting data  transferred and using brute-force decryption.  Public key infrastructures (PKI) can be used in  order to:   Provide mutual authentication (using  secret keys and passwords);   Monitor cryptographic hash function  (latency);   Detect possible MITM attacks.  Internal employee  incidents  This includes employees, contractors or external users, which can  potentially damage an organization from the inside. Their motive  can be varied, including revenge, monetary gain, or espionage. In  addition, employees who are ill-prepared could unknowingly  become a security risk.   Implementation of an access control  and monitoring system capable of  detecting these types of incidents.   Provide training and awareness  courses to inform users of these risks.  Lack of Standardization  There is a lack of common standards about the security of devices  on a Smart grid. In addition, there are too many devices,  considerably dispersed. The consequences of this lack of  standardization include an increase of the vulnerabilities that  could be exploited.  The main objective is to define a standard  (such as NERC CIP) that covers the security  vulnerabilities that affect these devices (user  privileges, data analysis, protection, etc.).  Electric Vehicle  vulnerable connections  Electric Vehicles require additional connections in order to  exchange the necessary data for its proper operation. These  connections use well known protocols by attackers (such as  Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or GPRS).  Experts are working on solutions to these  risks, analysing new protocols and interfaces  used, and defining the appropriate security  measures to protect them.  Social engineering  Social engineering attacks (e.g. Phishing) have increased  exponentially these last years, and have become one of the  biggest concerns for security experts. These attacks focus on the  personnel and their aim is to steal operational or business data,  user credentials, private data, etc.   One the biggest concerns relates to  internal threats. Organizations should  ensure that their employees are aware  of the threats they face in order to  maintain a good level of security.   Awareness campaigns can be used to  train employees.  DDoS and blackouts  The risk of external disruptive events always exists (natural  disasters, malicious attacks, etc.) and will impair or disrupt the  ability to supply electrical energy and could damage the control  The major challenge with these situations is  trying to prevent them and improve existing  mitigation measures and service restoration  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  35  TARGET ELEMENT ATTACKS LEARNT LESSONS  systems.

Authentication  (encryption, weak level)  These weaknesses could potentially be exploited by an attacker  in order to gain access to the system or to internal data. These  situations could act as a previous step for more elaborate attacks  (system damage, information theft, blackouts, etc.).   The physical protection of metering  devices should be robust.   Electric metering devices now have the  computational power needed to  implement cryptographic measures,  although this is not always done.

Security good practices in communication networks for Smart grids  This chapter presents a gap analysis to evaluate which areas require further revision, as well as detecting those  constraints, impairments and incentives that can affect the development and implementation of smart grid  technologies on the different power grid domains. Furthermore, a summary of the good practices that can be  applied to Smart Grid communication networks is defined.  Common security practices currently used by European smart grid operators  This section focuses on presenting the most common security practices that are carried out by smart grid operators  located within the European Member States regarding communication networks. Regarding the overall security for  smart grids, ENISA already published the report “Appropriate security measures for smart grids”25, in order to help  smart grid providers to improve the security and the resilience of their infrastructures and services. This technical  document provides guidance to smart grid stakeholders by providing a set of minimum security measures which  might help in improving the minimum level of their cyber security services.  Regulations/normative used  The European Commission decided to set up a Task Force on smart grids aiming to develop a common EU smart  grid vision and identify key issues that need to be resolved26. The Task Force consists of a steering committee and  three Expert Groups. The high level steering committee includes regulatory bodies, Transmission Systems Operators  (TSOs), Distribution System Operators (DSOs), Distribution Network Operators (DNOs), and consumer and  technology suppliers working jointly to facilitate the smart grid and smart metering development. Therefore, there  is a conscious effort within Europe to harmonize smart metering/grid standards, and to create a single set of  European standards that will be widely adopted. These standards will play a key role to ensure a successful  integration. A significant part of this endeavour targets challenges to the new and existing communication  architectures, and possible solutions to achieve this integration.   Smart metering communication standardization in Europe: Metering standardization (including  automatic/remote meter reading, multiple dynamic tariffs, energy export functions, variable scheduled meter  reading and demand control) is a well-established activity in Europe, where various organizations have been  formed:   CEN: European Committee for Standardization.   CENELEC: European Committee for Electro-technical Standardization.   ETSI: European Telecommunications Standards Institute.  Besides communication network standards for smart metering, these organizations also cover important  standards for other aspects of smart metering. For example, IEC 61968-9 specifies interfaces for meter reading  and control. It specifies the information content of a set of message types that can be used to support many of  the business functions related to meter reading and control (e.g. meter reading, meter control, meter events,  customer data synchronization and customer switching). It also defines a list of functionalities such as  metrology, load control, demand response and relays, as well as a related set of XML-based control messages.   Worldwide standardization: It is worth noting that there are other major smart grid standards worldwide; for  example, in the United States the IEEE P2030, IEEE 1547, ANSI, NIST and future IP for smart grids in the IETF  have been developed. For instance, it is important to mention the development of the ANSI C12 suite of  25 ENISA. “Appropriate security measures for smart grids”, 2012.  26 FAN Z. et al. “Smart Grid Communications: Overview of Research Challenges, Solutions, and Standardization Activities”, IEEE,  2013.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  37  standards in the US, which focus mainly on electricity meters. These standards are now being upgraded to  reflect advances in smart metering, such as C12.19 Standard for Utility Industry End Device Data Tables (data  models and formats for metering data) and the C12.22 Standard for Protocol Specification for Interfacing to  Data Communication Networks (communicating smart metering data across a network).  The IEEE P2030 project addresses smart grid interoperability, aiming to provide guidelines for enabling the  integration of energy technologies with information and communication technologies (ICT) in order to achieve  a seamless operation of the grid components and overall a more reliable and flexible electric power system.  The IEEE 1547 Standard outlines a collection of requirements and specifications (performance, operation,  testing, safety, and maintenance) to interconnect distributed energy resources with the distribution segment  of the electric power system. These are globally needed for the interconnection of distributed energy resources,  including distributed generators and energy storage infrastructure, which are essential in order to achieve a  successful implementation of smart grids.  ANSI/ISA 99 is a Security Guideline and User Resource for Industrial Automation and Control Systems. It  contemplates compliance metrics as a central key issue. Their use can enable a measurement of the increased  security level. This in turn might lead to an implementation of cyber-security standards that are not cost related.  NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum  requirements for US federal information systems. It is a solid reference for industrial and business  organizations. It has also developed an elaborated framework where specific controls are provided for a broad  number of areas, sorted depending on the impact they have on the considered information systems. NIST 800- 53 includes an Appendix where this control framework has been adapted to the ICS requirements, both by  updating existing controls and by adding new ones.  IEC TC57 WG15 has developed cybersecurity standards for power system communications, specifically the IEC  60870-5 series, the IEC 60870-6 series, the IEC 61850 series, the IEC 61970 series, and the IEC 61968 series. The  IEC 62351 standards (some under development or update) consist of:   IEC/TS 62351-3: Security for profiles including TCP/IP.   IEC/TS 62351-4: Security for profiles including MMS.   IEC/TS 62351-5: Security for IEC 60870-5 and derivatives.   IEC/TS 62351-6: Security for IEC 61850 profiles.   IEC/TS 62351-7: Objects for Network Management.   IEC/TS 62351-8: Role-Based Access Control.   IEC/TS 62351-9: Key Management.   IEC/TS 62351-10: Security Architecture.   IEC/TS 62351-11: Security for XML Files.   IEC/TR 62351-12: Resilience and Security Recommendations for Power Systems with DER - under  development.    Other relevant standards: ISO 2700127 is considered as a mature, general purpose standard that provides good  practices and recommendations for information security management and is normally used for the  implementation or management of Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). As information security  is a general concept that affects all sectors and areas, it applies to all branches of an organization (not only  specific security systems or SCADA systems). Its application should be appropriate for smart grids and SCADA  systems.  27 FINARDI U. et al. “Considerations on the implementation of SCADA standards on critical infrastructures of power grids”, CNR  Ceris, 2013.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  38   Common Criteria27 is an international standard for computer security certification. It povides assurance that  the phases of specification, implementation and evaluation of a computer security product has been  conducted in a rigorous, standard and repeatable manner at a level that is proportionate with the target  environment for use.   NERC CIP27 is closely connected to the reliable operations’ support for bulk Electric Systems, providing a  cyber-security framework for the identification and protection of Critical Cyber Assets. The current NERC  framework recognizes the roles of each entity in the operation of the Bulk Electric System, the criticality and  vulnerability of the assets needed to manage Electric System reliability, and the risks to which they are  exposed.  Security protocols most used  To deal with potential security threats within the smart grid, countermeasures and defence strategies have to be  widely deployed and integrated into both the network protocols and the architectures used. For example,  compared with legacy power systems, the smart grid features full-fledged communication protocol stacks to  accomplish the goal of secure and efficient communications in the entire network.  Recently, as described on “Considerations on the implementation of SCADA standards on critical infrastructures of  power grids”28, many efforts have been made within the power community to develop secure protocols for power  grids, most of which are reusing existing protocol suites to achieve secure communications, such as IPsec, Transport  Layer Security (TLS) and IPv634. Apart from existing protocol suites, security extensions for power communication  protocols have also become a primary focus in the literature and standardization e.g. the security extensions for  the two widely-used power grid communication protocols, DNP3 and IEC 61850.  Secure data aggregation protocols have been also proposed for the smart grid, since the bottom-up traffic model  (device-to-centre) can be applied in power systems, such as metering reading in the AMI network and device  monitoring in the SCADA network.  Design of the smart grids  Physical and logical network architecture designs should limit or isolate the different individual domains that form  up the smart grid, leaving only those interconnections needed. For this purpose, normally one of the following two  proposed secure smart grid network architectures is used28:   Trust-based computing architecture.   Role-based network architecture.  Cryptographic primitive based approaches have become one of the major countermeasures applied against attacks  that target network integrity and confidentiality and which can be affect the overall performance. The main topics  regarding this issue are: encryption, authentication and key management for power systems. Some of the research  challenges are:   Trade-off between security and latency.   Emerging physical-layer authentication.   Symmetric key management for time-critical systems.   Key management for advanced metering infrastructure.  28 WANG W. & LU Z. “Cyber security in the Smart Grid: Survey and challenges”, Computer Networks, 2013.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  39  Contracting with network operators  There are not standards or guidelines defined to be used by operators or companies regarding security practices  for contracting services to network operators. However, common sense dictates that the following points should  be considered:   Use of Service Level Agreements (SLA) applied by contract in relation to the requirements that the provider has  to comply with (such as bandwidth, quality of service, coverage or support).   Redundancy in network communications.   Use of different protocols and technologies.   Contracts with different network operators.  Moreover the following “Evaluation criteria on communication technologies”29 should be taken into consideration:  Non-technical:   costs  o OPEX  o CAPEX   operator‘s authority   customer acceptance  Technical:  • availability  • temporal  • local  • max. downtime  • reliability  • performance  • data throughput  • capacity  • coverage  • nodes per cell  • clustering  • latency  • physical medium  • right of use  • licence free  • primary /secondary  • internal consumption  • installation efforts  • integrability  • functional  • multicasting  • scalability  • life span  • standardization  • quality of service  • guaranteed future  • network-security  • technology dissemination  • combinability with other technologies  • network management  • operating efforts  29 Presentation “Challenges Regarding Security & Reliability of the Communications Infrastructure in Smart Grids”, Dr. Markus  Wächter, 2015  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  40  • topology  • distance without repeater  Procurement and certification of the systems  In order to include certification requirements in the procurement process, certifications should focus on the whole  life-cycle of the product not only on the product itself; from the initial design phase and up to their end of life.  Additionally, a certification scheme will need to incorporate the different types of certifications that apply to the  product life-cycle, because product development certification, product certification and operation certification  cannot be subject to the same certification type. Currently, the procurement process includes certification  requirements which only focus on products like smart meters (i.e. secure protocols, physical security, and  cryptography).  Testing the smart grid components  This includes testing all participating components in the smart grid context: system actors, applications, power  system equipment (typically located at process and field level), protection and tele-control devices, network  infrastructure (wired / wireless communication connections, routers, switches, servers) and any type of computers  used. It addresses the security of the individual components, focused on hardware, software, and the functions the  devices should perform and support. The process for testing the smart grid components includes conformity testing,  functional testing and interoperability testing30:   Conformity testing: assess the compliance of the test subject to standardised requirements.   Functional testing: assess the ability of the test subject to provide the required functionality. This functionality  is usually described in a standard referred to during the tests.   Interoperability testing: assess the ability of two or more systems to exchange information and to make mutual  use of the information that has been exchanged.  A more specific form of testing that is commonly carried out in security audits is penetration testing. This type of  testing revolves around the exploitation of possible design flaws and weaknesses to compromise the security of a  device. Such tests do not focus on a specific test book, but rely more on the creativity of the tester, and the time  that there is available to carry out the test. Penetration testing can be incorporated as part of a functional test, by  describing it as a negative test case for a functional requirement. Depending on the nonconformity risks, it can be  decided to perform first, second and third party assessments. However, in practice, only third party certification is  seen as trustworthy for most cyber security specialists.  Gap analysis and identification of areas of improvement  The first step is to develop a gap analysis to detect weak areas and possible improvements to the grid’s security.  According to the results of this analysis the following areas are in need of improvement:  Technical points of attention  There are several domains that require security-related improvements in order to ensure the protection of the grid  itself:   Last mile awareness as part of cyber-security awareness campaigns: The logical security measures on the last  mile of the network have to be taken into consideration. This part of the network is already protected at physical  30 ENISA. “Smart Grid Security Certification in Europe: Challenges and recommendations”, 2014.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  41  level, but in most cases the cyber security is insufficient or inexistent. Smart grids companies should protect the  last-mile communication systems from three dimensions: data, device and communication.   Always use secure communication protocols on SCADA devices: since most SCADA protocols were designed  long before network security was considered as a relevant risk, applying security measures on SCADA protocols  was not considered as a priority. This however is no longer the case, and secure communication protocols have  become a must in order to protect smart grids.   Always use interoperable communication protocols on SCADA devices: SCADA devices designed by different  manufacturers used their own proprietary protocols, that in have been compatible with devices produced by  same manufacturer. Due to the distributed nature of smart grids, these devices must now be compatible, not  only for security but also in order to guarantee the power supply on the grid.   Avoid the use of proprietary/homebrew protocols on SCADA systems and other related assets: related to the  previous point, not only must SCADA systems be compatible with each other; it is also highly recommended for  them to use standardized protocols defined by the whole industry, not individually by each manufacturer.  Organizational needs in the smart grid domain  Service Providers, Customer and Markets domains need specific and properly defined policies and standards  covering all smart grid domains and areas (communications, billing, customer management, account management,  installation and maintenance, micro generation, etc.). There are several possible steps for improvement:   Develop policies to ensure periodic software and firmware updates to SCADA systems: as these systems are  now interconnected, and in many occasions passing through the Internet and other public networks, it becomes  necessary to update them periodically to fix vulnerabilities and add new security measures to ensure the safety  of the smart grid communications.   Foster guidelines regarding smart grid communications officially supported by all MS: the Member States’  competent authorities should harmonize policies regarding the security of smart grid communications in order  to standardize them and ensure a smooth implementation of smart grids in different environments.   Involve vendors and manufacturers in the protection of the devices and network elements: Vendors and  manufactures are not sufficiently involved in the security development process of the smart grid devices, which  is required in order to implement the security measures by default on them. For this purpose, it will be  necessary to establish common regulatory bodies in Europe in charge of establishing a baseline containing a set  of basic features that all manufacturers should always implement on their products.   Cybersecurity awareness campaigns for smart grid company employees: Security incidents could be more  easily avoided if employees are aware of these risks and are prepared against them. For this purpose it is  necessary to offer them awareness campaigns in these topics.  Certifications needed specifically for smart grid security  There are many defined standards for different aspects of the protocols, architectures and smart grid devices.  However there is a lack of alignment in these guidelines, as there is no preferred one, and nowadays manufacturers  and vendors can make use of any of them without any regard about the one used by the rest. This leads to  compatibility problems, especially on the intercommunications and interdependencies between devices, leading to  further problems later on during the deployment of the smart grids. Therefore, the lack of standardized certification  schemes at a European level is a problem that must be worked on and solved in order to improve greatly the security  and efficiency of smart grids.  Issues highlight during the interviews  During the interviews it was underlined the lack of studies regarding interdependencies among smart grid devices  and their intercommunications between the grid implementations of the different European Member States. This  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  42  lack of knowledge leads to the need to further evaluate them in the future. This specifically refers to each individual  implementation, and as such each individual case would have to be evaluated. However, it is still highly  recommended to establish a common baseline throughout Europe in order to avoid current and future  interdependency issues among Member States’ smart grids.  Constraint and incentive analysis for the deployment of security measures  The constraints, impairments and incentives that affect the security measure deployment process on smart grids  can be divided into four mayor groups:  Economic constraints and incentives  Fragmented markets are the main barrier that impedes the smart grid implementation process. Due to the lack of a  harmonized approach, implementation costs rise considerably. Still, there are similarities among countries that can  be used to create consensus, and a combination of schemes could be an acceptable solution on a European level,  which would also impact in lower costs. It will be a challenge to keep cost to a minimum level while still providing  enough security; as security is a topic that penetrates all aspects of a system, and therefore has to be widely  implemented without directly providing justification of the necessary costs and effort. The benefits of the  implementation of security measures are shared among different groups31: such as the firms operating in the country  or the society as a whole, and only a small part concerns the electricity utilities. From a profitability viewpoint,  electric companies have no direct incentive to increase their security levels, as cyber-threats have been irrelevant  to legacy power grids until the arrival of smart grids. This explains their reluctance to perform such huge investments.  Public regulation and support to firms operating in competitive branches of the energy sector is definitely necessary.  Electric supply security is a very important point of the electric service, since our lives and economic activities have  become more and more dependent on this commodity, and a lack of supply would cause huge losses and overall  panic. Technical security measures are usually quite expensive to implement (e.g. communication network  redundancy cost-effective system, security requirements implementation by manufacturers, etc.), and as such need  their cost-effectiveness needs to be evaluated in each case.  Organizational constraints and incentives  Heterogeneity and differences in applicable regulations on the European Member States countries are one of the  main concerns in this case. In particular:   Different national regulations, although a common framework established by the UE already exists.   Different roles of public firms.   Different national market structures.  Cyber-security is not currently at the front-line, as not enough attention is being paid in Europe to cyber-security  and data privacy protection. There is a generalized perception that cyber-security is not a critical aspect of the smart  grids. Furthermore, the governments of several European countries are rushing to develop and deploy their smart  grids. Unfortunately, rushing at this point can be counter-productive, causing the resulting infrastructure to lack the  appropriate security measures. However, the benefits of having aligned standards and recommendations outweigh  its costs. By having the same standards, all European countries will implement their own smart grids following similar  architectures and trends, helping greatly to ensure the compatibility and proper interdependency and  intercommunication of all their systems and services.  31 GARCÍA GUTIÉRREZ F. and RAGAZZI E. “Trial evaluation: conclusive lessons from Essence case studies”, Rapporto tecnico  N.42, 2014  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  43  Technical constraints and incentives  There is a lack of standard reference architectures for smart grids in Europe. There are many standards, but no single  one is considered as the baseline for implementations of these networks, independently of the domain evaluated  (including generation, distribution, transmission and customer premises). For technically-complex devices, their  configuration and management is difficult, especially in implementations with large number of devices. Therefore  this increases the cost of applying new configurations or updates on them in order to fix vulnerabilities.  Manufacturers have to design their devices in a way that they support easier upgrade and management solutions.  This also applies to large intercommunication networks, where their management and protection also requires large  investments. Therefore, while the implementation of security measures is costly, and has considerable technical  implications, its benefit is clear as their protection, and of their interdependencies, ensures the proper operation  and working of the grid and their systems, allowing for more efficient energy distribution and taking advantage of  all the new features and services that smart grid support  Social constraints and incentives  Smart grids can be considered as critical infrastructures, as they are essential in order to maintain vital societal  functions, health & safety and economic status of the people. The disruption or destruction of such infrastructures  could have a serious impact on a Member State, which leads to the need to protect them. This is even more  applicable for the intercommunication networks and interconnections in smart grids, as an attack on them can have  the same nefarious effect as a physical attack against the traditional power infrastructure. Unfortunately, security  awareness and public perceptions on these risks are still low, and requires a lot of work to be changed; for this  purpose, it is recommended to include awareness campaigns on the long term deployment plans in order to ensure  that they are informed and aware of these new needs.  Available communication security guidelines applicable to Smart grids  There are various good practices published for all aspects of communication networks, communication devices,  Smart grid systems and SCADA devices. This section is focused on summarizing those that are relevant to this study,  which mainly concerns those regarding Smart grid devices and architectures, and communication networks in  general.  The documents that have been considered as part of this section are:   Best practices for handling smart grid cyber security32.   Connecting and securing Legacy Electrical substations to the smart grid33.    ENISA Good Practices in Resilient Internet Interconnection34.   ENISA Recommendations for Europe and Member States35.   NESCOR Electric Sector Failure Scenarios Common Vulnerabilities and Mitigations Mapping.   Smart Grid Security: Threats, Vulnerabilities and Solutions20.   ENISA Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide21.   ENISA Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure25.   NIST Guidelines for Smart Grid Cybersecurity36.  32 GHANSAH I. “Best Practices for Handling Smart Grid Cyber Security”, California State University Sacramento, 2014.  33 MACKENZIE H. “Connecting and Securing Legacy Electrical.

Figure 8 displays a list of these categories, with the good practices that apply to each one. These good practices have  been numbered in order to better reference them throughout the document.  Figure 8: Good practices.  CATEGORY GOOD PRACTICES  ASSOCIATED  ATTACKS  Organizational  security policies  (smart grid  communications)  GP01 - Organisational security framework Implementation: describes the implementation  process of the security plans.  Attack in Control  Centre System,  Data Theft,  Authentication  exploiting  GP02 - Password policy: it is necessary to establish a strong and robust password policy. This can  sometimes require employee training regarding how to choose robust passwords and their  impact in their work processes. Awareness against social engineering is also recommended on  this point.  GP03 - Data Policy: data must be classified according to their security level, which has to be  applied throughout the whole lifecycle of the data up to the point where is destroyed. The  classification levels have to be clearly defined as part of the corporate security policy.  GP04 - Incident Response: it is necessary to define the process to manage security incidents. This  includes all stages: detection, investigation, analysis, mitigation, disaster recovery (business  continuity plans), and post evaluation (define measures to prevent future incidents). All attacks  (faster detection  and mitigation) GP05 - Relations with compatible providers: communication channels between providers and  other third parties can be used to receive assistance and share relevant information to prevent  large-scale incidents or attacks.  Annual  assessments  GP06 - Vulnerability assessments in communication networks: vulnerability assessments should  be carried out annually for all critical elements of the smart grid networks to verify their security  level and detect any possible vulnerability. Non-critical devices should still be assessed, although  that need not be done annually.  Exploit attacks  to outdated  elements  Security by Design  GP07 - Security by Design: security considerations need to be included on the initial phases of  the smart grid design, to ensure better compatibility. Failure to do this will most likely lead to  much higher implementation costs.  All attacks  Mutual  authentication  GP08 - Mutual authentication: the origin and destination of all communications must be known.  By using mutual authentication, both the server and the host verify each other’s identity. This is  usually done using TLS or IPsec protocols, or by implementing a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).  MITM,  Information  theft, identity  spoofing  Virtual private  network  GP09 - Virtual Private Networks: these networks should be used to establish a connection within  two devices on the communications’ architecture. These connections establish a secure point-to- point communication through the network by using tunnelling and encryption protocols. It is  especially recommended as a means of connecting remotely to a system.  MITM,  Eavesdropping,  information  theft  Third-party  companies  GP10 - Communication service providers: utilities are not used to manage large complex  communication networks, as their focus is the power grid. For this purpose, it is recommended  to make use of third party telecommunication companies that will be in charge of maintaining  and securing the network communications.  DoS, DNS  attacks,  unauthorized  access  GP11 - Supply Chain Management: system security is only as strong as its weakest link; therefore  when working with third-party providers, it is fundamental to define a management process to  ensure that all security requirements are met.  Social  Engineering,  37 OSCE. “Good Practices Guide on Non-Nuclear Critical Energy Infrastructure Protection (NNCEIP) from Terrorist Attacks  Focusing on Threats Emanating from Cyberspace”, OSCE Publications, 2013.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  45  information  theft  Physical security  GP12 - Physical access rules: physical access to the elements of the network must be restricted;  personnel must only have access to those systems/infrastructures specifically required.  Unauthorized  physical access,  information  theft, deliberate  damage  GP13 - SCADA networks: periodical surveys to verify the physical security of the remote sites  connected to the SCADA network.  Unauthorized  physical access,  deliberate  damage  Software updates  GP14 - Software updates: an update process that ensures that all the elements of the network  are up-to-date and protected against newly discovered vulnerabilities or bugs should be  established.  Attacks related  to exploit  outdated  systems (Data  Theft, DDoS…)  Network Intrusion  Detection/Preven tion Systems  (IDS/IPS)  GP15 - Advanced IDS modes: the use of host-based defence mode and of Domain Specific IDS is  highly recommended to boost the security of the network, especially of the most sensitive  segments. As this cannot be always achieved, it is recommended to complement it by including  a baseline of the operations and expected flows to detect any anomalies.  Unauthorized  access,  information  theft, malicious  code  GP16 - System unification: to improve the defence of the network, it is highly recommended to  unite all IDS/IPS systems in one “group”, allowing operators to gain comprehensive situational  awareness. This approach is more comprehensive in terms of security and event monitoring,  and provides better protection for the overall network.  Employee  awareness,  training and  education  GP17 - Employee awareness, training, and education: employee awareness is fundamental in  order to prevent attacks and fraud. Teaching employees to detect attack patterns, risks, fraud  and social engineering attacks. It is recommended to include this point as part as the corporate  security policy and carry out periodical awareness campaigns.  Social  Engineering  Contingency  readiness  GP18 - n-1 contingency: the system should be distributed in a way that a failure of one device will  not cause a communications outage in a section of the network. This can be achieved with  redundant communication devices that ensure that no device is connected only through one  path.  Denial of Service  Attack, Outages  Malware  protection  GP19 - Manufacturer code and software validation: systems should only run the intended  functions and applications they were designed to. Manufacturers should provide means to  validate the software and firmware installed on the system.  Unauthorized  access,  information  theft, malicious  code  Secure network  segregation  GP20 - Network segmentation: the network should be divided into sections, each one for  different purposes, to protect the systems within. This allows the protection of especially  sensitive network components, such as the AMI segment or the control systems segment. This  helps to limit unauthorized accesses to one segment to gain access to other sections of the  network. Unauthorized  access, malicious  code, network  outage cascade  effect  GP21 - Network assets as segregation elements: network segments have to be separated with  security devices, including firewalls, gateways and filtering routers, to stop users from one  segment to access other segments, except if they are specifically allowed.  GP22 - Use of firewalls and Demilitarized Zones (DMZs): limits within the internal network  segments and the DMZs should be separated though the use of security devices (e.g. firewalls).  These firewalls should be protocol-aware, including support for basic filtering of both protocols  and command codes/instructions.  Secure network  communications  GP23 - Secure smart device communication: smart grid information systems should only make  use of secure communication protocols (such as SSL/TLS). Additional security measures can be  taken in order to further protect these communications.  Information  theft, MIT,  identity theft,  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  46  GP24 - Secure communications used for remote administration: remote management and  administration of the smart network systems must always be done though secure  communications or VPNs connections.  deliberate  information  manipulation  GP25 - Protocol compliance: communications though the network should only use protocols  approved by the provider and which have been verified to work on the network and have security  capabilities.  GP26 - External smart grid information systems: their communications should be always  identified and protected to avoid corruption, tampering or loss.  GP27 - Access control points: Smart grid information system routes all remote accesses through  a limited number of managed access control points.  GP28 - Only use authorized communication channels: communication and information flows  should be defined and limited over the communication link.  GP29 - Secure network proxies: internal and external network connections should be routed via  specifically hardened proxies, located on the DMZ.  GP30 - CSP redundancy: avoid depending on a single CSP, instead make use of several different  ones.  GP31 - Secure communication protocols: In order to protect communications, it is necessary to  use secure protocols.  SCADA security  GP32 - Smart SCADA audits: technical audits on SCADA devices and networks should be carried  out regularly. The focus is to detect vulnerabilities and analyse them to determine the risk level  they pose. This includes managing and overviewing the application of corrective actions.  Information  theft, MIT,  identity theft,  deliberate  information  manipulation  GP33 - SCADA connections knowledge: it is necessary to build up a knowledge base of the SCADA  networks and the devices contained in order to be able to evaluate their strength, detect possible  improvement points and develop recovery plans.  GP34 - Disconnect unnecessary connections to the SCADA network: disconnect or isolate SCADA  network devices and the SCADA network itself from the rest of devices. DMZ areas can be used  for this purpose in various architectures.  GP35 - SCADA backdoor management: any backdoor access to the SCADA network should be  closed unless strictly necessary. If it is not possible to close it, additional security measures should  be taken in order to protect it as much as possible and avoid any potential derived risks.  GP36 - MTUs & RTUs: these devices should be protected, using Secure Architecture Designs and  applying security features provided by the devices, as well as implementing IEC-60870, DNP 3.0  and Modbus protocols.  Wireless Area  Networks  GP37 - Wireless networks: the following security measures can be used to protect networks in  general (including Wi-Fi, ZigBee, WiMAX):   Media Access Control (MAC) address filtering;   AES encryption protocols;   Protection against masquerading parties;   Access Control Lists (ACL);   Trust Centre address configuration (ZigBee only);   IEEE 802.11w-2009 and WPA (Wi-Fi only).  Information  theft, MITM,  identity theft,  session  hijacking,  information  gathering  Advanced  Metering  Infrastructure  GP38 - Metering security standards: adopt an open-reference standard that defines the security  measures that advanced meters should comply with.  Smart Meter  hijacking,  information  theft, malicious  code,  unauthorized  access  GP39 - Traffic control: implement session control and detection mechanisms capable of quickly  halting any suspicious sessions or communications.  GP40 - Network connection only for approved assets: authenticate and validate the identity of  the metering assets on the network and restrict access to any unknown device. This  authentication is also used to provide data integrity.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  47  GP41 - Authentication and integrity checks: validate and authenticate the origin of all system  commands and meter readings to ensure that they have not been tampered with. Configurable  firmware is the most vulnerable if these security checks are not carried out.  GP42 - Meter data encryption: this protects the data against tampering and ensures the privacy  of any personal data transmitted.  GP43 - Consumer non‐repudiation: provide means to ensure that any data obtained is valid and  its origin has been verified.  GP44 - Virtual Home command execution: all commands received from external sources should  be tested firs in a “Virtual Home Command Execution” environment (a form of sandbox), to  ensure that no negative effects occur from its application on the real environment.  GP45 - Head-end: possible security measures to implement are:   Authenticate all commands and reports between the Head-End and the customer  endpoint.   Protect the Head-End systems with the same level of security as other critical assets.   Use strong user authentication on all Head-End systems and log all user actions.   Implement safety logic to prevent rapid changes in pricing information.   Carry out periodic integrity checks and audits.  Denial of Service  protection  GP46 - IP address verification: source IP addresses should always be verified, especially on those  systems located on the edge of the Internet infrastructure, to prevent address spoofing. Denial of Service  attacks,  communication  network outage,  DNS attacks  GP47 - DNS issues: name-server operators should implement measures, such as RRL, to protect  against vulnerabilities that can be used to compromise the organizations’ network.  GP48 - Denial of Service protection: anti-DDoS systems should be established to protect AMI  systems and protect other devices on the network against Denial of Service and replay attacks.  Asset  management  GP49 - Asset inventory: an inventory containing all the assets and devices part of the network  should be created and maintained in order to gain awareness of the whole network, avoiding  missing any system or obscured/legacy section. Furthermore, this inventory should contain the  vulnerabilities that affect each one in order to determine risks and possible threats to the  network.  Unauthorized  access, malicious  code, network  outage  Categorization of good practices on smart grid communication networks  After the study of existing good practices, and sorting them into relevant categories, the next step is to evaluate and  organize them based on their impact, focused on people, technical and organisational aspects. The concepts  evaluated are:   Smart grid domains are related to: people, organizational aspects or technical aspects.   Implementation complexity: rate their implementation difficulty based on the requirements related to the  domains defined previously. The ratings go from “low” (feasible) to “high”(not feasible).   Cause: justification of the rating given to the implementation complexity column.  The table on Figure 9 presents the result of the evaluation carried out following the specifications defined for the  analysis.  Figure 9: Good practices by domain.

Recommendations to improve security of communication networks  in smart grids  This chapter presents a series of recommendations to improve the security level of the communication networks  used for intercommunications in smart grids. These recommendations are intended mainly for operators, vendors,  manufacturers and security tool providers located within European Member States.  The first recommendation will serve as an overview of the rest of recommendations, as a means of establishing the  appropriate focus for them.  Recommendation 1: European Commission should ensure the alignment of policy approaches across EU countries  to establish a common posture for smart grid communication interdependencies. Cyber security has become one  of the main concerns regarding the implementation of smart grids, and especially regarding the networks used for  the interconnection of all the assets that make up this new grid. Therefore, an inherent requirement is to protect  these communication networks, the data that travels through them and the devices connected to them. For this  reason, it is necessary to collaborate with all involved parties (operators, manufacturers, vendors, distributors and  security experts) in order to further develop solutions to fill these requirements. Each European country has a  different regulation and infrastructure regarding power grids, in many cases due to the specific needs of each one.  Furthermore, they tend to make use of different standards for these implementations, architectures and assets in  use. European Commission should promote and support initiatives regarding the improvement of smart grid  intercommunications security according to the recommendations described on this document, which will serve as a  prerequisite to raise the level of smart grid security on both European and National intercommunication networks.  There is the need to harmonize European requirements and standards for smart grid communication networks,  especially regarding the homologation of security devices and protocols.  Recommendation 2: Manufacturers and vendors should foster intercommunication protocol compatibility  between devices from different manufacturers and vendors. Currently, many manufacturers and vendors, due to  the lack of standards, make use of their own proprietary protocols and communication systems for the  intercommunication between their devices. Therefore, this leads to the fact that when a distributor or utility makes  use of these devices, the rest of the network devices have to be provided by the same vendor, or have to be  specifically compatible with them. This, although can be seen as a benefit from the manufacturers’ side, is in fact a  grave problem due to the massive size of the smart grid networks, and the fact that many of the devices currently  in use come from different manufacturers as different specifications are needed for each network segment.  Distributors, utilities and other involved actors should make use of devices from different vendors without having to  worry about incompatibilities in the communications among them. Alternatively, providers could make their  protocols open-source instead of proprietary, to enable other companies to make their devices compatible with  these communications. This has as an additional advantage the fact that by being open source, their implementation  can be reviewed by third parties, which can analyze it and find and fix bug and security vulnerabilities.  Recommendation 3: European smart grid operators and relevant authorities should develop a set of minimum  security requirements to be applied in all communication interdependencies in smart grids. The first step for  improving security of the intercommunications, interdependencies and devices part of the smart grids is to establish  a series of minimum security requirements that have to be met in order to protect the overall grid connectivity.  These security requirements and associated controls must be defined in order to achieve a minimum level of security  that will ensure service continuity and resilience, both in public and private environments. This has to be promoted  at a European level in order to ensure its success. This could be done by establishing a working group at a European  level, with representation of all relevant stakeholders, in order to define a series of recommendations regarding the  minimum security requirements that should always be applied to smart grid devices, intercommunications and  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  52  interdependencies. Alternatively, define guidelines that include the implementation of minimum security  requirements for all devices, interconnections and interdependencies for the deployment of new smart grids.  Recommendation 4: Manufacturers, vendors and asset owners should implement security measures on all devices  and protocols that are part, or make use of the smart grid communication network. Traditionally, grid devices and  assets were usually isolated, or interconnected through private local networks. However, smart grids bring a new  level of interconnection, where devices can be connected to large networks, wireless networks and even the  Internet. This leads to the need to protect these communications against eavesdropping and tampering, from the  origin and up to the destination. For this purpose, security measures need to be applied to the devices and the  protocols used for interconnection, and this needs to be considered from the device design phase onwards in order  to avoid the implementation costs from skyrocketing. This could be achieved by:   Supporting the implementation of security measures by default on all the protocols used for  intercommunications within the smart grid network.   Boosting the implementation of standard security measures by default on all devices that are going to be part  of the smart grid communication network.   Involving manufacturers, vendors and security tool providers in the process for improving security of both  devices and protocols.  Recommendation 5: Manufacturers, vendors and asset owners should work together on updatable devices and  periodic security update support. Nowadays, it is the norm for software and firmware to receive periodic updates  to fix vulnerabilities, add new security features or fixes, and even add new characteristics. This is quite common on  personal devices and servers, where it has become a common practice to establish a periodic update and  maintenance phase to ensure that all systems are always up to date. However, the same cannot be said with smart  devices in traditional grids, and which now translates to smart grids. Firstly, power grid devices where usually  isolated and protected behind physical security measures, and as such it was not needed to update them unless if  there was a critical bug. Furthermore, these devices are normally running non-stop 24x7x365, and stopping them  requires a considerable amount of time and resources. Devices must be designed to be easily updated, both their  software and firmware, in order to ensure that they maintain an acceptable security level. There is no direct  alternative in this case as the devices will be interconnected to the main smart grid network, and sometimes even  to the Internet, and any security vulnerability found in them has to be fixed. Although it is possible to that in some  cases these vulnerabilities can be fixed by applying specific configuration or mitigation features, not all vulnerabilities  can be fixed this way. Manufacturers and vendors should work together on this topic, as they need to design their  devices to be easily updatable, and need to develop an update program to maintain them updated.  Recommendation 6: European Commission, Member States and all relevant smart grid stakeholders should  promote incident reporting and attack patterns sharing. Attacks against electrical grids have not been very common  in the past, as many systems where isolated and gaining access to one did not grant an entry point to the rest of the  system. However, with the implementation of smart grids, many new attack vectors and network entry points have  appeared as a consequence of their intercommunicated and distributed nature. Even more, it is just a matter of time  that large attacks focus on them and begin threatening their stability. For this reason, it becomes necessary to share  data and attack patterns to help all involved agents to protect their assets and develop countermeasures which can,  in turn, be shared to protect the overall smart grid network. This can be achieved by facilitating incident reporting  intercommunications to share attack patterns and trends among European agencies, Member State agencies and  other relevant stakeholders. Foster attack data sharing between companies and involved stakeholders to prevent  future attacks. Establish sharing mechanisms among organizations and countries in order to share data related to  attacks suffered, threats and attack trends.  Recommendation 7: European Commission, Member States and all relevant smart grid stakeholders should  promote increased training and awareness campaigns. One of the gripes that threats smart grids is also the lack of  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  53  qualified professionals, and many of the existing ones lacking adequate training and awareness regarding security in  the new scenarios that have appeared on energy grids due to the new features that come with the implementation  of smart grid technologies. There are a number of actions that could be put in places:   Specific training courses to teach operators and manufacturers to implement security measures and to  mitigate risks that are inherently part of the smart grid systems.   Awareness campaigns to inform professionals about the latest threats and risks that affect smart grids and  related technologies, as well as possible solution or mitigation actions.

Recommendations to improve security of communication networks in smart grids 51  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  06  Executive Summary  Smart grids can be described as a new generation of smart power networks that integrate actions coming from all  connected end-users. This infrastructure provides bidirectional communications between end-users and the grid  operator, and therefore extends the attack surface against the power system.  However, one point that has been constantly overlooked and has not received the attention it deserves concerns  the interdependencies and communications between all the assets that make up the new power grids. These  interdependencies in communications are a fundamental pillar, as they represent the means by which all devices  communicate within the smart grid network.  Information transmitted through these intercommunications contains not only customer and consumption data;  but also status checks, instructions to execute, orders for devices to redirect power flow, etc. Therefore, their  protection is essential to protect the privacy of the customers and prevent attacks which could cause blackouts,  power overloads, device malfunctions, data tampering, or even catastrophic cascading effects that could bring down  the power grid itself in more than one country.  For this purpose, this study focuses on the evaluation of these interdependencies, and their architectures and  connections in order to determine their importance, threats, risks, mitigation factors and possible security measures  to implement. To obtain this information, experts in the fields and areas related directly with smart grids were  contacted to gather their know-how and expertise.  The concerns that were expressed by these experts can be sorted into two main categories, technical  recommendations and organizational recommendations:   Regarding smart grid devices, these devices are now exposed to different networks, and therefore their periodic  update becomes essential in order to ensure that they are protected against the latest threats that appear.  Furthermore, these devices should also implement by default security measures to protect them (such as  authentication, encryption or frame counters), as implementing such measures in the deployment phase is  much more costly and does not reach the same level of security.   Regarding the communications interdependencies, the main concern is with the protocols used on the smart  grids. There is an urgent need to harmonize the current situation by establishing common interconnection  protocols to be used by all devices, and ensure that these protocols implement by default enough security  measures to protect the data whilst it is in transit (such as encryption or mutual authentication).   Finally there is the need to align policies, standards and regulations across EU Member States to ensure the  overall security of smart grids. This is now even more important due to the risk that cascading failures can cause;  as smart grid communication networks are no longer limited by physical or geographical barriers, and an attack  on one country could translate into another.  Additionally, due to the global and distributed nature of many of these threats, it becomes necessary for European  organizations, distributors, utilities and the rest of involved stakeholders to share knowledge on these attacks both  on incident management and incident reporting level.  In conclusion, the protection of the intercommunications in smart grid networks is essential in order to ensure the  correct operation of the network and the protection of private and sensitive data. Furthermore, it is necessary in  order to protect against attacks to the power grid, therefore making it a matter of national and European interest.  For this purpose, the following recommendations have been developed:  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  07  Recommendation 1: European Commission should ensure the alignment of policy approaches across EU countries  to establish a common posture for smart grid communication interdependencies. Cyber security has become one  of the main concerns regarding the implementation of smart grids, and especially concerning the networks used for  the interconnection of all the assets that make up this new grid. Therefore, it is inherently necessary to protect these  communication networks, the data that is transmitted through them and the devices connected to them. European  Commission should ensure the alignment of the requirements and standards for smart grid communication  networks, especially regarding the homologation of security devices and protocols.  Recommendation 2: Manufacturers and vendors should foster intercommunication protocol compatibility  between devices from different manufacturers and vendors. Currently, many manufacturers and vendors, due to  the lack of standards, make use of their own proprietary protocols and communication systems for the  intercommunication between their devices. Therefore, when a distributor or utility makes use of these devices, the  rest of the network devices have to be provided by the same vendor, or have to be specifically compatible with  them. Distributors, utilities and other actors involved should make use of devices acquired from various supply lines  without having to be concerned about incompatibilities in the communication among them.  Recommendation 3: European smart grid operators and relevant authorities should develop a set of minimum  security requirements to be applied in all communication interdependencies in smart grids. Security controls must  be defined to reach a minimum level of security that ensures service connectivity continuity and resilience, both in  public and private environments. This could be done by establishing a working group at European level, with  representation of all relevant stakeholders, in order to define a series of recommendations regarding the minimum  security requirements that should always be applied to smart grid devices, intercommunications and  interdependencies.  Recommendation 4: Manufacturers, vendors and asset owners should implement security measures on all  devices and protocols that are part, or make use of the smart grid communication network. Traditionally, grid  devices and assets were usually isolated, or interconnected through private local networks. However, smart grids  bring a new level of interconnection, where devices can be connected to large networks, wireless networks and  even the Internet. This leads to the need to protect these communications against eavesdropping and tampering,  from the origin and up to the destination. This could be achieved by supporting the implementation of security  measures by default on all the protocols used for intercommunication within the smart grid network.  Recommendation 5: Manufacturers, vendors and asset owners should work together on updatable devices and  periodic security update support. Nowadays, it is the norm for software and firmware to receive periodic updates  to fix vulnerabilities, add new security features or fixes, and even add new capabilities. This is quite common on  personal devices and servers, however it is not the case yet  in smart grids.

Manufacturers and vendors should work together on this topic, as they need to design their devices to be easily  updatable, and need to develop an update program to maintain them updated.  Recommendation 6: European Commission, Member States and all relevant smart grid stakeholders should  promote incident reporting and attack patterns sharing. With the implementation of smart grids, many new attack  vectors and network entry points have appeared as a consequence of their intercommunicated and distributed  nature. For this reason, it becomes necessary to share data and attack patterns to help all involved agents protect  their assets and develop countermeasures which can, in turn, be shared to protect the overall smart grid network.  Recommendation 7: European Commission, Member States and all relevant smart grid stakeholders should  promote increased training and awareness campaigns. One of the gripes that threats smart grids is related to the  limited number of qualified professionals; a few of the existing ones lacking adequate training regarding security.  This is due to in new scenarios that have appeared on energy grids regarding the new features that come with the  implementation of smart grid technologies.

Introduction  Smart grids can be described as a new generation smart electric network that integrates actions coming from all  connected end-users. This infrastructure provides bidirectional communications between end-users and the grid  operator, and therefore extends the attack surface against a power system. For instance, consumers such as  households and enterprises are now digitally connected to the ICT infrastructures of Distribution System Operators  (DSOs) through smart meters via a Wide Area Network (WAN) network. Smart meters set the demarcation point  between the DSO Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure and the Customer Premises  Network.  Smart grids in addition to bringing increased automation and control capabilities to the transmission and distribution  grids also add a new layer of system complexity that offer new challenges for insuring the reliability and safety of  operations1. Existing technologies such as Energy Management System (EMS), Distribution Management System  (DMS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) are being updated in order to adapt them to smart  grids, alongside the integration of new technologies. Many of these supporting communication infrastructures,  particularly WAN communications, are provided by telecommunication operators or Internet Service Providers  (ISPs). Therefore these infrastructures will most likely be shared among multiple companies, which bring in multiple  interdependency issues, ranging from the reliability of the whole power system to new cyber security risks.  These are just two use cases which prove that communication networks have become essential elements that allow  the “smart” aspects of the power grids. They provide real-time knowledge of the grid, perform actions  instantaneously when required and gather customer consumption information. These vital assets have to be taken  into account especially as far as security is concerned for several reasons: the data they transport, the increasing  attack surface, the possible cascading effects that an attack can generate in the rest of the grid, etc.  This report focuses on the aspects related to the communication networks and intercommunications between them  in smart grids, identifying vulnerabilities, risks and threat agents. This report makes available a set of  recommendations to mitigate identified risks.  Objectives and Scope  This report presents an analysis of the current situation of smart grid networks, considering the most relevant factors  in this case, including: the role networks play in smart grid domains, the main threats affecting these communication  infrastructure networks and the interdependencies between networks. Therefore, the following objectives have  been set:  1. Review and analyse communication infrastructures in use in smart grids at different domains: end-user  premises (HAN, IAN, and BAN), transmission grids, distribution grid, generation (bulk and DER), electric  vehicle and other power storage facilities.  2. Study connectivity interdependencies for smart grids among different domains in the electricity system  within a Member State (MS) and between MS.  3. Obtain a list of the main threats affecting communication networks in smart grids.  1 Kun L. and Mathews, R. \"Interoperability & Critical Infrastructure Protection: A Review of Activities To Ensure the Reliability  of the U.S. Electric Power Grid\", IEEE-USA, 2007.

Methodology  This study was carried out using a five-step methodology (shown in Figure 1) which begins at the initial  information gathering from official sources and experts in the field and ends in the development of a report  summarizing the findings and the recommendations to the target audience.  Figure 1: Methodology used to carry out the study.  1. Identification of experts: the first step was to identify the experts in the field of smart grid security.  In order to obtain varied and well-balanced results, experts from academic, industry and government  sectors were selected. Expert representatives from at least half of the EU member states were  included in this list.  2. Desktop Research: initial research of already published documents in order to get as much  information about communication dependencies as possible. Develop a questionnaire which includes  the questions needed to achieve the project objectives.  3. Collecting Experts’ and stakeholders’ point of view: During this step, a questionnaire was used  internally to guide the interviews with experts. These interviews were carried out during a 6-week  period in order to obtain experts’ and stakeholders’ point of view.  4. Analysis: the fourth step was to analyse all the data obtained, including the results of the interviews,  gathering initial conclusions.  5. Conclusions and recommendations: the last step was to further analyse and contrast these results  with the experience of the consortium and external sources.

Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  13  2. Key aspects of communication networks in smart grids  This section analyses the communication infrastructures in use in smart grids at different domains: end-user  premises, transmission grids, distribution grids and generation.  Figure 2: End-to-End smart grid communications architecture2.  Figure 2 shows an overview of the standard communications architecture of a smart grid. This scenario considers  the communications making use of the Internet due to the physical separation between the different sites of each  section.  Customer premises network (CPN)  The customer premises networks3 are composed of big industries, small and medium business, office buildings,  smart buildings (such as modern office buildings) and standard home users. Due to the different natures of these  sites, three separate networks have been developed in order to group them: Home Area Networks (HAN),  Business/Building Area Networks (BAN) and Industrial Area Networks (IAN).  The Home Area Network (HAN) effectively manages the on-demand power requirements of the end-users. This  network is envisioned to interconnect smart electric appliances such as televisions, washing machines, or energy  management systems. It is the supporting infrastructure for demand-response applications (i.e. switching smart  appliances on or off in order to make an efficient use of electric rates) and advanced energy services provided by  2 IEEE P2030/D.50. “Draft Guide for Smart Grid interoperability of energy technology and information technology and  information technology operation with the Electric Power System (EPS), and end-user applications and loads”, IEEE SA  Standards Board, 2011.  3 ENISA “Smart Grid Security. Annex I. General concepts and dependencies with ICT”, 2012.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  14  DSOs. This network can also provide integration between home automation equipment and energy management  systems, and is directly related to the Smart Home concept.  The Business/Building Area Network (BAN), or Commercial Area Network, is a communication infrastructure  intended to support the needs of regular businesses (e.g. office buildings). The power demand of businesses’  buildings is significantly higher than those from households, and its pattern follows a different curve. Business  Energy Management Services and Building Automation, as well as other advanced energy services need to be  supported by the BAN. On the other hand, a group of HANs is also sometimes called a BAN. In this case, the network  includes all communications in one Building due to its size. The BAN network is directly related with the concept of  Smart Building.  Finally, the Industrial Area Network (IAN) can be defined as the communication infrastructure that allows the  interconnection and support of all machines and devices needed in a particular industry, including regular ICT  hardware and software (i.e. computers, printers and servers) and Industrial Control Systems (i.e. SCADA, Distributed  Control Systems (DCS), Program Logic Controllers (PLC’s)).  Architectures and technologies used in CPN  Figure 3 shows the architecture of the network that connects customer premises with data centres on the smart  grid. It also shows the different technologies that are most commonly used to interconnect the different devices  that make up the network. Note that the PLC mention on Figure 3 refers to “Power Line Communications”, and  does not specify any application protocols.  Figure 3: Basic network architecture4.  Depending on the customer premises’ network type (HAN, IAN or BAN), different technologies can be used. For  example, one Smart Meter configuration could make use of ZigBee for Home Area Networks, Wi-Fi for Business Area  Networks and Z-Wave for Industrial Area Networks; another option is to use the IEC 62056 protocol, based on the  DLMS/COSEM protocol, for these communication networks. Therefore, a combination of different technologies can  be used in order to manage the needs of the grid interdependencies, based on the specific requirements of the area,  infrastructure, etc.  4 AL-OMAR B. et al. \"Role of Information and Communication Technologies in the Smart Grid. Journal of Emerging Trends in  Computing and Information Sciences”, in Journal of Emerging Trends in Computing and Information Sciences, 2012.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  15  Communication networks in the distribution grid  Historically, distribution systems have included little telemetry, and almost all communications within the domain  were performed by humans3. It is considered that “the primary sensor base installed in the distribution domain is  the customer with a telephone, whose call initiates the dispatch of a field crew to restore power”. It was unlikely  for distribution substations to be connected to a central SCADA system, and even then these were not automated  at all. Electrical substations required manual equipment switching and load, energy consumption and abnormal  event data was collected manually. On the other hand, Transmission System Operators (TSOs) have extensive  control over transmission-level equipment, which is now being enhanced with a smarter transmission grid.  However, with the arrival of the smart grids, distribution systems are facing a paradigm shift. As it is acknowledged  by major industry players “distribution networks are under high pressure to meet requirements for converting their  conventional static grids into modern and dynamic smart grids. In particular, the increasing occurrence of  decentralized generation (DER) is influencing this trend, as well as the need to improve the quality and reliability in  both MV and LV networks” (See Figure 2).  Due to this change, there are new requirements on the automation, monitoring, control and protection of  distribution substations and transformer stations/centres. More advanced automation is expected at the  distribution grid with the upcoming smart grids. This “extra” automation is basically Advanced Distribution  Automation (ADA). The goal of the ADA is the real-time adjustment of the distribution system by changing loads,  usually without direct operator intervention, in order to dramatically improve system reliability, quality, and  efficiency. In order to achieve this, substation feeder automation and control will play a central role, and will allow  DSO’s to make the most of DERs, AMIs and Demand-Response strategies, making these three new concepts an  essential part of the ADA toolbox.  The last mile communication infrastructure of the smart grid is a two-way communication network generally  overlaid on top of the power distribution system, which enables features such as: advanced metering services,  distribution automation and substation automation. The underlying communication infrastructures are:  Neighbourhood Area Network (NAN), Field Area Networks (FAN) and Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI),  depending on the devices it interconnects and the applications supported. For instance, FANs are used to connect  distribution substations, distributed/feeder/transformer centre field devices and DERs/micro-grids, including the  utility scale electric storage, to the utility control and operation centre. In addition to these systems, NANs also  include smart meters in households, industries and businesses. Likewise, AMIs can be used interchangeably with  NANs, but only to interconnect smart meters with back-office systems.  The last mile networks (i.e. AMI, NAN, and FAN) as well as DERs/micro-grids and other distribution substation  networks are interconnected with utility control and operations via the backhaul network. This network can be  owned and managed by the utility (i.e. DSO) or by a third party, such as a public telecommunications service  provider. Typically, last mile networks have access to more than one backhaul network. Backhaul networks can use  wired or wireless technologies and enable the aggregation and transportation of customer-related smart grid  telemetry data, substations automation critical operations data, relevant DER and micro-grid field data, and mobile  workforce information.  The distribution substation network is an infrastructure that interconnects all devices within a distribution  substation. It is comprised of LANs that contain the local SCADA, IEDs, RTUs, PMUs and other field devices that need  to be remotely controlled and monitored. At the same time, the distribution substation network provides  connectivity to the backhaul network, either directly or through the FAN network, which in turn can interconnect  several distribution substations before accessing the backhaul. Transformer centre networks can be seen as a  condensed version of a distribution substation network.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  16  The last relevant communication infrastructure supporting power distribution operations and DER/micro-grids is  the feeder network. This network helps to exchange information with field devices (such as switches, capacitor  banks and sensors) and IEDs that are distributed along the power lines, substations and transformer centres. It can  be considered as an overlay on the electrical grid and can use both wireless and wired communication technologies.  Architectures and technologies in the distribution grid  Smart grids have brought many changes to traditional power grids, making use of new technologies and devices to  enable new features that allow better communication, distribution and overall efficiency3. As it has been seen on  the previous section, distribution automation provides DSOs with an increased control over distribution-level  equipment. However, a more advanced automation is expected at the distribution grid with the upcoming smart  grid. Literature refers to this “extra” automation as smart distribution system or Advanced Distribution Automation  (ADA).  Apart from this, distribution networks make use of many existing technologies and protocols, depending on the  needs of each implementation. ANNEX B summarizes some of the most relevant ones, grouped depending on if they  are commonly used on last mile networks or on the backhaul networks. On the other hand, there are others  technologies, not directly related to communications, but that have to be considered when evaluating new  distribution grids. These are:   Fault Detection, Isolation and Restoration (FDIR) systems are focused on improving the reliability of the  distribution networks.   Integrated Volt-VAR Control (IVVC) systems are designed to reduce electric feeder losses improving the overall  voltage distribution and conservation in both peak and non-peak time periods.   Organic Flash Cycle (OFC) systems can potentially increase power generation from thermal energy reservoirs  Communication networks in the transmission grid  Transmission is the bulk transfer of electrical power from generation (and storage) sources to the distribution grid  through multiple substations, which are typically operated by TSOs. The main goal of a TSO3 is to maintain the  stability of the electric grid by balancing generation (supply) and load (demand) across the transmission network.  In today’s electrical grids, the generation, transmission and sub-transmission segments are performing at a high  level and are equipped with automation systems. This has been done by installing Remote Terminal Units (RTUs)  and other control devices in substations and generation plants, connected to a Distributed Control System or to  centralized SCADA/EMS systems.  Therefore, all these recently implemented automated systems and devices in the substations need to communicate  with the central SCADA/EMS systems in order to ensure that they are properly controlled. This requires a new  communication infrastructure to enable this communication and allow remote control and regulation of the systems  as needed. This is especially important in the case of controlling supply and demand, whether automated or manual,  as a failure to control it could potentially cause system overloads or area blackouts.  Additionally, due to the critical nature of these infrastructures, the new communication infrastructures and  networks must be secured against unauthorized tampering. This includes not only physical security but, more  importantly, cyber-security against the new threats that have appeared as a consequence of the implementation of  smart grids (many derived from existing traditional, well known, network threats such as eavesdropping,  interception, etc.).  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  17  Architectures and technologies used in communication networks in the transmission grid  The automation of the transmission power grid requires the use of specific systems and technologies in order to be  controlled. Some of these systems are already in use and are fundamental for the communications of the  transmission grid:   Distribution Management Systems (DMS) are a series of applications to monitor and control the entire  distribution network entirely, and which are becoming more and more important with the advent of smart grids.  These are complemented by SCADA and EMS systems, providing functionalities such as: unbalanced power flow  control, distribution state estimation, integrated volt control, fault identification and location, and service  restoration. Overall, they provide the means to improve the management operations of the network and allow  operators to be able to operate and optimize it in real time.   Energy Management Systems (EMS) are used to analyse and operate the transmission power system reliably  and efficiently. Operators using this system can supervise the network topology, connectivity and load  conditions (including circuit breakers, switch states and control equipment status).   Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems interact with each substation (those that include  HMI and RTU devices) and of the entire network. These systems are designed to manage switching, monitoring  and control these substations. The SCADA/EMS monitors the status of all circuit breakers (open/closed), to  create bus or branch topology configurations of the power system, allowing for optimal power flow calculation,  state estimation, contingency analysis, outage scheduling, voltage and stability analysis, alarm processing, etc.  Moreover, the SCADA/EMS systems also monitor substation metering technology, to retrieve data on line  current and voltage levels at substations.  Apart from these technologies, smart grids will bring a whole range of new specific applications, systems and  technologies designed to improve the transmission grid. The most relevant cases are the High-Voltage Direct Current  (HVDC), Phasor Measurement Units (PMU), Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) and Wide Area Measurement System  (WAMS) technologies, which are described in the following paragraphs:   High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission systems use direct current for the bulk transmission of  electrical power, in contrast with the common alternating current systems. For long-distance transmissions,  HVDC systems can be less expensive and will suffer lower electrical losses.   Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) uses sensors to identify the current carrying capability of a section of the network in  real time to optimise utilisation of existing transmission assets, without the risk of causing overloads.   Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are devices that provide high quality measurements of bus angles and  frequencies using a common time source for synchronisation (i.e. GPS radio clock). PMUs can be autonomous  systems or part of a protective relay or other device in a substation. They are capable of detecting faults early,  increasing the power quality, enabling load shedding and other load control techniques, etc. PMUs are  considered the initial data source for Wide Area Monitoring System (WAMS) applications, essential in regional  transmission grids, local distribution grids and even wide super grids.   Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS) make use of advanced measurement technologies in order to  monitor and control large power grids and super grids. They can be used as a standalone infrastructure or by  complementing other conventional supervision systems, such as SCADA/EMS.  There are several common technologies and protocols that are used for the intercommunication between these  devices and the rest of the transmission grid network. One of the most relevant ones is the IEC 61850 protocol  family, which is applicable to this grid section. Other relevant protocols used on this grid are also on ANNEX A.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  18  Communication network integration between generation, transmission and  distribution grids  According to the distributed nature of the smart grids, there are different parts of them that need to be  interconnected in order to exchange information efficiently. The power grid is operated by many different agents  that are connected to the same grid. There are those that generate power, those that transmit power, and those  that distribute power to end customers. Some of these operators may carry out more than one of these functions.  In order to manage this, the IEC 60870 standard discusses how to exchange information among the smart grid  elements5.  Though there are various proprietary and ad-hoc exchange protocols designed to exchange information among  these elements, it is much more common for actors to exchange data with each other using standardized protocols,  as it is usually more easy and reliable. Some of these standardized protocols are:   IEC 60870-6 Inter-Control Centre Communication.   IEC 61698-13 Common Information Model (CIM) RDF Model exchange format for distribution.   IEC 61670-452 Common Information Model (CIM) RDF Model exchange format for transmission.  Inter-control centre communications depend on the existing low-level communication infrastructure available  between these network elements, such as MPLS, PLC, Satellite, POTS or Leased Lines. The current trend is moving  towards the use of IP technologies, either on top of the already existing infrastructure by investing in IP-enabled  network, or by contracting virtual networks to ISPs.  For non-real time transmission data, the Common Information Model (CIM) is commonly used, and the IEC 61670- 452 standard defines how these data is exported to XML for exchange with other parties. The IEC 61670-5xx series  section of the standard defines C and web service profiles for the different data access services, making web services  the preferred exchange mechanism for CIM data. Nevertheless, it is not uncommon for XML files to be exchanged  using mechanisms other than web services, such as FTP or even plain HTTP POST/PUT requests.  IEC 61968-13 is the distribution equivalent of IEC 61970-452, defined for transmission data, and typically includes  information related to assets, work, construction, distribution and outage management. The IEC working group is,  however, considering merging or replacing this with IEC 61970-452, as there is a significant overlap between both.  Architectures and technologies used in network interconnections  Communications between the generation, transmission and distribution domains are complex and usually require  large communication networks, which make use of many different technologies and protocols to adapt to the  individual needs of each section and area. Therefore, there is an inherent need to ensure proper compatibility  between them in order to ensure the quality, reliability and security of these intercommunications.  A detailed list of some of the most relevant technologies used for the intercommunication within and between these  domains can be found on the table present at ANNEX A of this document as a detailed explanation of each protocol  and technology falls outside the scope of this deliverable. As a notable mention, the IEC 61850 protocol family is  specially adapted for the integration between grid sections.  5 Expert Group on the security and resilience of Communication networks and Information systems for Smart Grids. “Work  Package 2.3 Research Smart Grid communication protocols and infrastructures to incorporate data security measures”, 2012.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  19  3. Telecommunication service providers and interdependencies in  smart grids  Many of the communication infrastructures, particularly WAN communications, are provided by telecommunication  operators or Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Therefore they might be shared by multiple companies. As it was  mentioned on the previous section, one DSO can share the communication infrastructure with a TSO or another  DSO, but also with a public company, or a large enterprise belonging to a completely different sector.  The communication infrastructure is deployed in order to share information in the smart grid, where the amount  and variety of data is large. Therefore the definition of metadata fields is a complex and cumbersome process. The  actors involved in this process can be classified into two categories: those which need the data and those which  develop products to deliver the required data. The first group of actors includes, but is not limited to:   Transmission system operators.   Distribution system operators.   Energy retailers.   Energy services companies.   Billing organizations.   Energy regulators.  They are sometimes referred to as driving actors since metadata is created by analysing their input. The second  group of actors consists of product manufacturers such as smart meter producers, utility companies, enterprise  software developers, B/HAS developers, standard logical model developers, etc. We might refer to them as  implementing actors, since they are the ones that make data usable by defining its format according to the  definitions given by the driving actors. Metadata management is an important part of the early stages of the system  development.  Many actors are involved in metadata management. Examples of data management in the smart grid are: network  models which may include electrical transmission or distribution, customer data required to identify customer  accounts and service locations, geographic information used to derive network models, assets, work orders,  measurements, etc. The Inter-Domain Analysis of Smart Grid Domain Dependencies Using Domain-Link Matrices6  study describes in detail the interdependencies in smart grids.  Along the same lines, “Reducing Cascading Failure Risk by Increasing Infrastructure Network Interdependency”7  analyses the importance of improving the security of the interdependencies in smart grids and the need to reduce  cascade failures. Although increasingly complex networks have been intensively studied for over a decade, the  researchers still focus on the case of an isolated network without external interaction. However, it is known that  modern systems are building and working co-ordinately and therefore, these systems must be designed as  interdependent networks. A major vulnerability of interdependence networks is that the failure of nodes on a  network can lead to failure of child nodes on other networks.  6 SULEIMAN H. et al. “Inter-Domain Analysis of Smart Grid Domain Dependencies Using Domain-Link Matrices”, Smart Grid,  IEEE Transactions, 2012.  7 KORKALI M. et al. “Reducing Cascading Failure Risk by Increasing Infrastructure Network Interdependency”, arXiv, 2015.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  20  When node (substation) or edge (transmission line) failures occur, power re-routes according to Kirchhoff’s and  Ohm’s laws. This re-routing increases flows along parallel paths, which can subsequently trigger long chains of  component failures, potentially leading to a wide-area blackout. As a result of this process, failures propagate non- locally: the next component to fail may be hundreds of miles or tens of edges distant from the previous failure  leading to a cascade of failures. The research of interdependency issues will lead to the development and application  of new system concepts and design approaches towards the mitigation of the risks posed by these  interdependencies on a nationwide scale.  Figure 4 represents an example of how a cascade effect might affect the smart grid. Considering a pair of  interdependent networks (a power grid and a communication network) in which a fraction of the number of nodes  in the power grid are coupled to corresponding nodes in communication network. When a node fails in this model,  the associated edges in both networks immediately fail too.  Figure 4: A disturbance in (1) causes edge failures (2) in the power grid, as well as node and edge failures (3) in the communication  network.  As mentioned in reports “Catastrophic cascade of failures in interdependent networks”8 and “R&D Themes for Cyber  Security in the Smart Grid”9, it is very important for inter-operators to consider and become aware of the risks posed  by the existence of interdependencies in smart grid communication networks. This is needed in order to prevent  the possibility of cascading failures leading towards catastrophic blackouts.  Inter-operator and multiple communication service providers for smart grid  segment networks  Continuing on towards intercommunications and the multiple providers in charge of the specific communication  networks from each domain, it is necessary to consider that each one may make use of different technologies and  8 BULDYREV S.V. et al. “Catastrophic cascade of failures in interdependent networks”, Nature, 2010.  9 GHANSAH I. et al. “R & D Themes for Cyber Security in the Smart Grid”, 2010.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  21  operation methods. This leads to unique interdependencies among these networks that require cyber-security  elements that can impact on the reliability of the rest of the elements of the power system. The correct security  design for each one of the services and domains must be one of the main objectives when securing these  interconnections10.  As previously discussed in the section 2.3, in order to perform the metering and transmission services, operators  must use communication networks, Neighbourhood Area Network (NAN), Field Area Networks (FAN) and Advanced  Metering Infrastructure (AMI) are interconnected by backhaul networks. The backhaul might be owned and  managed by operators and can use wire line or wireless technologies like Wi-Fi, WiMAX, 3G mobile networks and  LTE/4G.  The document titled Advanced Wireless Backhaul for the Smart Grid11 suggests that last mile communication  infrastructures can be implemented as a backhaul network as long as the following stages are fully implemented:   Connect all individual meters to local collection points.   The local collection points have to be backhauled in order to reach a higher capacity level on the aggregation  points.   Aggregation points have to be backhauled to the utility’s network operations’ centre.  Furthermore, the inter-operator communication network has to connect with several of the following domains,  depending on the needs of each individual implementation:   Last mile communications network, which includes all of the individual meters, collection points and  aggregation points.   The distribution substation network, where devices connect with distribution substations that, at the same  time, are connected to the core backhauled network.   Distributed Energy Resources: their network has many other operators that have to be interconnected with  each other and with utilities. Figure 4 on ANNEX D shows that the highest level of the DER architecture (level 5)  contains Transmission and Market Operations, and involves a larger utility environment. Regional Transmission  Organizations (RTOs) and Independent System Operators (ISOs) need to exchange information about the  capabilities and operational status of larger, or aggregated, DER systems. The energy transmissions from the  DERs are at the same time interconnected to the demand and response systems, as well as to the utilities’  network operation centres.  The network operation centres of the utility companies are the main points from where all the information of the  backhauled network in the smart grid begins and flows. These are also the main points where the system operators  (control and data centre) are connected. The service of the operators at this point is to act as resource options for  balancing supply and demand. This demand and response communication needs to be implemented with a high  range of security and tidy protocols. The previous document mentioned12 underlines how the IEC-61968 standard is  considered as an example focused on integration of applications related to transmission, generation, and energy  markets. Also, “Object linking and embedding for Process Control” (OPC) is an integration standard used for process  control integration. It’s a requirement that in the inter-operator communication networks, different operators must  10 ANGELETTI V. et al. “Italian Case Study: socio-economic impact analysis of a cyber-attack to a power plant in an Italian  scenario. Cost and benefit estimation of CIPS standard adoptions”, 2014.  11 Solution Brief, “Advanced Wireless Backhaul for the Smart Grid”, CERAGON, 2014.  12 ENISA. “Communication networks dependencies in Smart Grids”, 2014.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  22  be organized between each other not only in communication network protocols and standards but also in security  incidents.  In the bulk generation, transmission, and distribution domains, various control messages and received messages  from the distributed sensors in the smart grid are frequently conveyed from the control applications in the control  centre to various locations on the smart meter by using a robust communication infrastructure. Demand and  response messages in the smart grid are used to provide an interface to connect a variety of users, devices and  systems together. There are many messages exchanged through the communication system of the smart grid, such  as energy readings from smart meters, triggering events, control messages, device status messages, energy  consumption messages, pricing messages, outage messages, etc. Interfaces are used to exchange energy-related  information and provide connection among home networks and external networks and systems, such as the utility  network. The Internet gateway is considered as an example of such a system, which enables customers’ interactions  by sending and receiving requests via secure web-portals, this will be described in “3.3 The role of the Internet in  smart grids”.  Within the transmission and distribution domains, the IEC Common Information Model (CIM) has been adopted to  allow application software to exchange information about the configuration and the status of an electrical network.  The CIM aims to govern several areas pertaining to the physical infrastructure of the smart meters. Some of the  areas covered include asset measurements, which are received from telemetry and help to identify the current state  of both the assets and the infrastructure. The modern communications infrastructure is used to achieve this task  using two-way communication interfaces (backhaul network). One noteworthy example is the data collection from  Remote Terminal Units within the SCADA network, which is then transferred to the control centre (system operator).  The SCADA database is monitored and updated remotely; therefore database-centric applications are fundamental.  One of the IEC standards, IEC 61970-301, defined the core packages of the CIM with focus on the electricity  transmission needs, such as EMS, SCADA, and other related applications. In addition, IEC 60870-6 is commonly used  to provide data links to exchange measured values among the control centres. It is commonly known as TASE.2 and  the Inter Control Centre Protocol (ICCP).  Smart grids can be quite large and geographically dispersed13; more importantly, regardless of the distance they still  require real-time information in order to automatically manage the different sections of the grid and maintain good  efficiency levels. This however requires that power companies convert their existing legacy grids into the new smart  grids, requiring in many cases large investments and redesigns of entire sections. A trend has already appeared  regarding companies acquiring communication services from third-party communication service providers in order  to reduce these costs.  As far as security is concerned, there are some points to consider regarding power utilities and Communication  Service Providers (CSPs). By using CSPs to meet the connectivity needs of smart grids, these become dependent on  them in order to carry out their work functions. For this reason, it is heavily recommended to not depend on a single  CSP, instead make use of several ones, and consider the following points:   Regarding Risk Management, the risk generated by using a single CSP is considerably lower in case of CSP failure  or attack, when the dependency of the CSP is minimized, allowing that some parts of the smart grids can avoid  being affected.   Geographical effectiveness: The smart grid components can follow different strategies in different places. The  usage of different CSPs provides the flexibility of selecting the most expert CSP according to the required  technologies and features of the place.  13 CEN-CENELEC-ETSI, “SGAM User Manual - Applying, testing & refining the Smart Grid Architecture Model”, Smart Grid  Coordination Group, 2014.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  23   Technologic Variety: Using different CSPs allows using different technologies for different network segments  within the same domain. This reduces the exposure in case of “Zero-day vulnerabilities” and the cost of dealing  with them if they ever occur. Regarding wireless communications, sometimes the usage of different CSPs allows  the use of different working frequencies that enhance the wireless communications’ security.   Isolating different types of traffic and applying different Quality of Service (QoS) levels can be done according  to data needs, and this practise also provides a mechanism of protecting the information regarding internal  power utility processes, or as a “backup” service provider.  However, using different CSPs also has some disadvantages that have to be considered:   This practice can be more difficult to manage for the power utility, such as the security management (encryption,  redundancy, etc.) of the customer data as well as the locations where it is stored (several third-party information  systems).   The operation cost of using multiple CSPs is significantly higher than using just one and it can happen that the  network infrastructure for managing different CSPs is more complex and expensive than if only one CSP was  used.   The number of people that have access to confidential information of the power utility is much higher in a  scenario with more than one CSP. Consequently, the attack surface for information leakage is much bigger.  Finally taking into account the different points of view that have been discussed in this section, the conclusion moves  towards recommending the use of multiple CSPs to provide communications in smart grids, as well as considering  possible measures to mitigate the effects of the disadvantages they imply.  Inter-Member State power infrastructures supporting communication networks  Another important factor that has to be taken into account is the Inter-Member State power infrastructures that  support the communication networks, as they now become an essential part of smart grids due to their delocalized  nature. Smart grids are no longer confined to a single country; now they have become part of a whole grid spanning  throughout Europe, having intercommunication among the different States and reaching a point where a failure or  attack in one of them could adversely affect the rest.  For this purpose, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E)14 has become  involved in this process, supporting not only traditional energy distribution, but also focusing on the  intercommunications among their systems (see Figure 5).  14 BARTOSZEWICZ-BURCZY H. et al. “Polish case study. Scenario based assessment of costs and benefits of adoption of  comprehensive CIP standards”, 2014.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  24  Figure 5: Map of ENTSO-E systems.  ENTSO-E established that the operation of interconnected networks is founded on the principle that each partner is  responsible of its own network (coordination at regional and European levels, interference of national system and  corresponding inter-TSO coordination that requests more and more coordination), but cannot ignore the rest of the  networks. For this purpose, ENTSO-E has developed an Operation Handbook15 that defines the basic interconnection  principles and infrastructure that should be followed in order to establish successful and secure interconnections  between grids. It defines the use of the Electronic Highway (EH), a routed network separate from the Internet that  interconnects TSOs, can be used for real-time and non-real-time communications. This operational handbook  defines a series of points that Transmission System Operators should follow:   A set of minimum requirements to apply.   Up-to-date implementation rules and recommendations.   Common specifications for communications and data exchange.   Operation and maintenance recommendations.  However, the Operation Handbook does not specify the national grid codes, as this remains responsibility of each  country and is usually influenced by market rules. Regarding security, there are a series of recommendations that  have been included in order to protect the systems against attacks, and especially against the risk of cascading  effects on parts of the network or even the whole network itself. These recommendations are:   Connection to the Internet: there should not be any physical or logical connection between the Electronic  Highway (EH) and the Internet. If needed, data exchange between the EH and the outside world should only be  done through clearly defined and fully protected limited channels. This can be achieved by using intermediate  gateways and firewalls crossing TSO boundaries. Operators however should be aware of recent research on  15 ENTSO-E. “Operation Handbook. P6 - Policy 6: Communication Infrastructure”, 2008.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  25  the visibility of control systems assumed to be disconnected from the Internet. Project Shine (16 and17) for  example gave reason to question such assumptions. Operators of increasingly complex systems need to test  and check for the possible visibility of devices.   Private Networks: the Electronic Highway can be considered as a private network, as it is isolated from the rest  of the networks and the Internet. Only protocols specified by the TRM (Electronic Highway Technical Reference  Manual) should be used. Point-to-point connections should be used to interconnect devices through the EH  network.   Dedicated network for data exchange: The EH is the main and preferred communication channel for data  exchanges among TSOs related to operation. The EH should also be used as communication media for data  exchanges among TSOs related to market.   Incorporation of new protocols and applications: it is possible to add new protocols, apart from the ones  predefined on the TRM; however it has to be done following the process defined on it.   Requirement for EH interconnections: several standard requirements have been defined, being the following  the most relevant ones:   Communication redundancy should always be ensured, by using more than one point-to-point lines for each  TSO. This guarantees the stability of the EH backbone.   Speed and availability should also be controlled in order to obtain stable communications.   All data exchanged must be transmitted over the EH from the sender to the recipient uncorrupted, in  sequence and in a timely manner to guarantee integrity.   TSOs responsibilities: the following responsibilities have been established for TSOs for the security operation of  the EH network:   Take appropriate measures to protect the Electronic Highway and each connected TSO against any potential  risks such as operation disruption or data corruption and disclosure of confidential data.   Protect against any unauthorised access to the EH.   Perform periodic malware checks.   Monitor and guarantee the availability of EH components in their domain.   Check physical line and SCADA connection redundancy.   Manage their own network components (such as routers, gateways or physical lines).  Finally, it is important to remember that smart grid assets, even if they are not connected to the Internet, are still  vulnerable. The false belief that devices not connected to the Internet are not vulnerable has been an IT myth for  quite some time, and one that should be quickly dismissed as reality has proved it otherwise. In a recent report  made by the German Government Federal IT Department18, a cyber-intrusion on a steel mill systems caused physical  damage to some of the assets, even though these systems had been isolated from the Internet as much as possible.  16 Project SHINE (SHodan INtelligence Extraction), “Findings report”, 2014.

Therefore, these  companies were in charge and control of all aspects of their systems and, from a security point of view, their main  concern was the physical protection of their assets and installations. Therefore, communications were limited and  were not exposed to external shared networks, much less to the Internet.  The appearance and exponential growth of the Internet gave way to new means of communications, not only  traditional point-to-point ones, which offered a lot of benefits at an affordable cost. Smart grids make use of  intercommunication networks in order to interconnect all the devices that make it up, and therefore the need to  use large communication networks becomes a basic requisite.  Therefore, the Internet has become one of the main means for smart grids to interconnect their devices, as it  provides wide coverage and compatible protocols supported by many different services, enabling direct  communication to devices located geographically apart without the expenses of implementing their own  communication network (which can be prohibitively high in case of large distributed or nation-wide grids).  Furthermore, the use of these communication channels enables smart grids to automatically control and manage  all the devices that are part of it, obtaining improved efficiency for the power generation, transmission and  distribution, and the overall working of the grid itself. An exception to this point is the Electronic highway, which is  focused specially on the use of a private network separated from the Internet for the communications and data  exchange between Transmission System Operators, as it has been defined on Section 3.2.  However, these networks, and especially the Internet which encompasses all of them (except the Electronic Highway  presented in the previous chapter), are not inherently safe against threats and vulnerabilities. On the contrary, these  networks may suffer from a multitude of attacks and are vulnerable to many varied threats to the communications  that pass through them (as described in more detail on Section 4.1); this includes not only intentional attacks, but  also unintentional data damage caused by employees or badly configured devices.  There are also resilience and security concerns regarding the infrastructure of the Internet itself, as they pose a risk  as serious as those that affect the communications that pass through them. These threats were defined by ENISA’s  Internet Infrastructure Security and Resilience Reference Group19, where they were sorted into three main  categories: routing attacks, DNS attacks and Denial of Service attacks (these will also be described in more detail in  Section 4.1).  Therefore their securitization becomes a must. As many of these threats and risks are common to the various  services that make use of the network, smart grid manufacturers, vendors, operators and experts can take this  know-how and existing knowledge in order to adapt and protect and properly configure their own devices against  these threats.  In light of these concerns, the risks to power grids have to be thoroughly considered, as they are critical  infrastructures that maintain many other systems and services, and are a fundamental requirement for the  operation of business, industries and even for the well-being of the population. An even bigger risk appears due to  the interconnected and distributed nature of these systems, the cascade effect: a failure or service outage on one  distributor or one country, if not properly controlled, could affect other distributors and countries.  19 ENISA https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/internet-infrastructure-security-and-resilience-reference-group/threats  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/internet-infrastructure-security-and-resilience-reference-group/threats  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  27  Architectures and technologies used for intercommunications through the Internet  The Internet has become the network of networks, a massive grid that connects the whole world together;  communications from one side of the world to the other takes less than a second. To maintain such large  infrastructures, different architectures and technologies are used; but always following a compatible structure to  ensure the compatibility of all the systems and devices that are connected to it.  The Internet makes use of many different architectures and technologies for the different sections that make it up,  as well as having available a wide range of protocols that can be used to offer different services and functionalities.  The architecture of the Internet is distributed and redundant, there are no established hard point-to-point lines;  connections are established using the most efficient path, and so connections to the same destination can make use  of different intermediate devices and communication lines each time.  When the Internet was initially envisioned, security was not a concern as the scope was limited; therefore the  resulting architecture and protocols proved highly efficient and scalable, but offered no security measures at all by  default. Further iterations of these architectures and protocols began to implement security measures for the  protection of all the communications, transmissions and services offered through the Internet (such as SSL/TLS,  mutual authentication, point-to-point encryption or certificates).  Among all technologies that are available on the Internet, the most relevant ones that are used for communications  among the devices part of the smart grid are:   Internet Protocol (IP): is probably the most used and important communication network protocol used by the  devices part of the smart grid. This protocol is used due to its compatibility and open-source implementation,  allowing different devices from different manufacturers to communicate with ease. Through the use of this  protocol, devices can reliably exchange data and manage operations and activities. This protocol however, is  vulnerable to a wide range of attacks due to its lack of security measures, and therefore it becomes necessary  to implement additional security measures, such as using TLS to encrypt the data, in order to ensure the integrity  and confidentiality of the transmitted information or instructions.   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS): is used to encapsulate various network protocols, and transmit those  using short paths to reach the destination, instead of using a long path the whole way. This protocol is scalable,  and works independently of the protocol that is transmitted.  There are a series of relevant protocols that can also be used on these networks, in conjunction with the previously  listed technologies:   Distributed Network Protocol (DNP): is a set of communication protocols designed specifically for the  communication of devices part of automated systems. It is used mainly in SCADA systems to interconnect the  Master Station with the RTUs and IEDS. It has been designed to be reliable, but lacks security measures.   IEC 61850: is a standard designed to be used to control the automation processes on electrical substations. It  defines data exchange between control systems the substations themselves. It includes many required features  to carry out these functions, including data modelling, data storage (substation configuration language, or SCL),  fast transfer events and reporting schemes. It also includes variations of this protocol for different installations,  such as Hydroelectric Power Plants (IEC 61850-7-410) or Distribution Automation Systems (IEC 61850-7-420).   IEC 60870: defines the systems needed for the supervision and data acquisition of power automation systems.  It has been divided into five parts: transmission frame formats, datalink transmission services, general  application data structure, coding definitions for information elements and basic application functionalities.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  28  Therefore, not all the technologies and protocols used for the communications through the Internet support security  measures by default, and as such it becomes necessary to use additional measures in order to protect them. Some  of the most common security technologies that can be used to protect communications include:   Transport Layer Security (TLS): is a cryptographic protocol designed to protect communications over a network.  This is achieved by using asymmetric cryptography and client certificates to authenticate both the sender and  the recipient and symmetric protocols to carry out data encryption. Its predecessor, SSL v3 is also commonly  used, although its use is not recommended due to several security flaws that have been detected on it.   IEC 62351: is a standard designed to handle the security of several protocols including IEC 60870, IETC 61850,  IEC 61970 and IEC 61968. Among its features, it includes TLS encryption, node authentication, message  authentication and several other specific security profiles.   IEV IEC 61850-90-12: provides definitions, guidelines and recommendations for the engineering of WANs,  especially regarding their protection, control and monitoring. It is based on IEC 61850 and several related  protocol standards. It is mostly used for communications between substations and the control centre.   Internet Protocol Security (IPSec):  comprises of a set of protocols designed specifically to protect IP  communications by applying authentication and encryption to them. It supports mutual authentication, and  works on the Internet Layer (while TLS works on a higher level, on the Application Layer).   Secure Shell (SSH): is a protocol that provides a secure connection to remote machines, by applying encryption  to protect the data. For this communication, the remote machine must have an operational SSH server to which  the client will connect to.   DNP3 Secure: is an upgrade to the standard DNP3 protocol designed to provide additional security measures,  including authentication and data encryption. It is compliant with IEC 62351-5 standard, and in some cases  Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are also used to secure IP networks.   Virtual Private Network (VPN): is not a protocol per-se, it is more of a concept, but it can be considered as a  relevant security measure in order to protect communications. In a VPN the use of point-to-point private  network over a public network or the Internet are specified. A VPN uses tunnelling protocols to make available  private communication, and to also make use of encryption protocols to protect the confidentiality of the data  transmitted.

Threat and risk analysis on communication networks in smart grids  This chapter focuses on security threats, risk factors, incidents and attacks affecting communication networks in  smart grids, with particular interest on those that might imply cascading effects on large part of the population.  Regarding risk factors, some examples include: interconnected networks and systems, communication protocol  vulnerabilities or IT vulnerabilities, legacy communication protocols, communication disruptions, malicious software  and firmware, compromised hardware, increased number of entry points and paths, new sensitive personal data.  Analysis and summary of threats affecting smart grid communications  Starting from “Smart Grid Security: Threats, Vulnerabilities and Solutions”20 and “Smart Grid Threat Landscape and  Good Practice Guide”21, the goal of this section is to combine the most important aspects of these documents, the  experts’ interviews and other relevant documents, in order to reach a complete overview of threats that affect smart  grids nowadays.  Smart grids bring improvements and better capabilities to the traditional power network. These networks provide  electricity on demand using information and communication technologies that enable energy providers to control  the power supply and allow for an efficient power delivery with lower costs. However, this makes networks more  complex and vulnerable to different types of attacks and even unintentional failures due to increased complexity of  systems and levels of cyber fragility. The principal difference between traditional grids and Smart grids is that there  are three new main security objectives that must be taken in account: availability of the service, integrity of  transmitted data and confidentiality of the consumer’s data.  However, due to the recent Smart grid concept and implementation there is very little practical experience on cyber- attacks affecting Smart grids. Besides, industrial cyber security is also a quite new topic and security experts are still  learning it, developing hacking tools and finding new vulnerabilities at an exponential rate. These vulnerabilities  might allow attackers to obtain back-doors, compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the information, and  even make the service unavailable. Therefore, the security of traditional and new Smart grid ICT technologies must  be addressed by the energy sector. This is not only a task for grid operators but also for public bodies,  standardisation organisations, service providers, and any other stakeholder involved. In addition, cyber security  must be considered in all Smart grid domains and at all phases of the system life cycle.  As a result of the experience of a cyber-attack affecting a Smart grid, in the “Smart Grid Security - Annex II”22 by  ENISA it is underlined how physical security and safety is much more stable and well-known by the actors involved  in the Smart grid deployment. For instance, there is abundant statistical data about natural disasters, such as  hurricanes or earthquakes, which makes it much easier for experts to characterise these threats from a risk point of  view. Alternatively, natural disasters are random events while cyber threats depend on people (i.e. attackers): their  motivations, capabilities, interests, etc. Besides, all these factors change over time. As a result, managing risks  deriving from cyber security threats is a real challenge that needs to be addressed and solved. In order to succeed  in such task it is important to first identify potential threats, at all levels, ranging from natural disasters to technical  aspects. When identifying threats, it should not only be considered those targeting infrastructure operations, but  20 ALOULA F. et al. “Smart Grid Security: Threats, Vulnerabilities and Solutions”, International Journal of Smart Grid and Clean  Energy, 2012.  21 ENISA “Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide”, ENISA, 2013.  22 ENISA “Smart Grid Security. Annex II. Security aspects of the smart grid”, 2012.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  30  also those targeting the end consumer (i.e. privacy aspects) as well as national security related factors (i.e.  government personnel, other national facilities, assets, and interests identified by national intelligence, etc.).  On a similar point, it is also relevant to consider the threat posed by unintentional events that could impact on the  security of the systems, assets and intercommunications. While these events cannot be considered as the main topic  of the study, rather more alongside it, they still have to be considered when developing general security  recommendations. The paper “Interoperability & Critical Infrastructure Protection: A Review of Activities to Ensure  the Reliability of the U.S. Power Grid”1 makes a case of the risks posed by unintentional events and incidents and  the threat they present to smart grids.  Therefore, based on the threat domains defined on “Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide”21, the  following table (Figure 6) has been developed and expanded in order to cover all the threats that directly affect  Smart grid intercommunication networks. The details of each one of these attacks can be found on ANNEX B.  Figure 6: Main threats to Smart grid intercommunications.

Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  32  It is important to emphasise the fact that most security vulnerabilities in communication infrastructures require  defining specific security measures to mitigate them such as: automating system data protection, identifying and  enhancing a security perimeter, building comprehensive security through defence-in-depth, and restricting access  to data and services to authenticated users based on operational requirements.  Many of these vulnerabilities result from deficient or non-existent security configuration options in the  organizations’ Smart grid, employees’ mistakes, and workers attrition in system automation. Also, the industry is  not quite aware about the threat environment and attacker capabilities, underestimating the risk that they are  going to have to deal with.  Following on from the previous chapter regarding the analysis of current threats, the  next step is to list known vulnerabilities that could pose a serious risk to Smart grids, according to the ideas  presented on the document by Aloula20:   Vulnerable consumers: The intelligent devices of the Smart grids can process massive amounts of data and  send it to the utility company, consumer, and service providers. As a result, preserving authorized restrictions  on information access and disclosure is fundamental in order to protect proprietary and personal data privacy.  This is particularly necessary to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information that is not open to the public  and individuals and to implement robust transmission methods and protocols. This is extremely important,  due to the fact that transmitted information includes private consumer data, which could potentially reveal  consumer’s activities, devices being used, or consumption habits.   Massive number of devices: Smart grid networks have several intelligent devices that are involved in  managing both electricity supply and network demand. This is due to the great area covered on the grids’  deployment, with many features and services that must be covered. Moreover, the sheer size of the network  makes monitoring and managing it extremely difficult to carry out. On the other hand, a modification or update  on these devices can lead to a great economic cost and many staff working hours due to the need to travel to  the remote device location. These vulnerabilities could result in intelligent devices being used as attack entry  points into the network. If attackers gain access to these machines, they can potentially steal confidential and  private data through them, or even manipulate the transmitted information.   Coexistence of legacy and new devices: It is quite usual that legacy devices are in service along with more  contemporary ones. This coexistence between devices may result in possible incompatibilities at physical and  protocol levels; or even vulnerabilities and threats as a result of possible interdependencies between devices  and networks. These legacy devices could become weak points and even cause severe conflicts with current  power systems, unless specific security measures are implemented on them in order to mitigate these risks.   Implicit trust M2M by default: Several devices in their Machine to Machine (M2M) communications use  implicit trust by default. This is an important weakness due to the interdependency with the other machine  lead to the appearance of additional vulnerabilities. If an attacker gains control of the other machine involved,  or pretends to be it, he could send wrong data to the first machine or receive confidential and private data  from it. Data Spoofing is a threat for Device-to-Device communication in control systems; the state of one  device involves the actions of another. Even more, this implicit trust can be used by attackers to carry out  Man-in-the-Middle attacks, compromising the network interconnection between these devices and even the  rest of the network.   Commercial hardware and software: Commercial hardware and software development is usually done  separately from the operators who will make use of it later. This lack of interaction becomes an issue later  when these operators proceed to implement security measures to protect the devices and the  communications between them, sometimes being unable to fully implement them Therefore, using  commercial assets entails vulnerabilities inherent to the hardware and software such as bugs, weaknesses,  back-doors, failures or even outdated assets, which present a serious vulnerability for smart grid  communications.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  33   Communication protocols: Communications between devices in the Smart grids, especially in the consumer  domain, are done through well-known communication protocols. Besides, these protocols have been a long  time in use and they are widespread. For example, some of the wireless protocols used in Smart grids (i.e.  Bluetooth, ZigBee, Infrared, WiMAX, Wi-Fi, LTE, UMTS or GPRS) are already widely used in other contexts.  Therefore, protocols applied on Smart grids are also an important source of vulnerabilities, and many of these  vulnerabilities are well known by attackers, and they have even developed automated tools for easing these  attacks. Also, many application-level protocols have been designed without adequate levels of intrinsic  security mechanisms.   Human factors: All organisations have information that would put business operations at risk in the event that  it was to be lost or corrupted in some way. Power grid companies are not exempt; most of their workers are  dependent on their computer systems for the success of their businesses and know that cyber threats are  increasing, nationally and internationally. Protecting these systems is costly. Even with the increasing  sophistication of cyber-attacks from outside sources, the greatest proportion of data losses and failures are  still caused by human errors. Many of these can easily be avoided once people become knowledgeable of the  risks to information security and regard them as a personal duty. Despite the evidence that the human element  plays a major part in the risks, most of operators have relied on electronic protection systems to secure  confidentiality, integrity and availability; but this is no longer a safe option. This source of vulnerabilities  includes all those human aspects and conditions that an attacker could take advantage of to successfully  achieve its malicious objectives. This vulnerability depends on the security training employees receive and the  security actions taken by organisations, especially regarding the use of network communications and the  management and configuration of the smart grid assets in order to ensure that their communications are done  securely and reliably.  According to the document Smart Grid Security20, attacks could be classified into three main categories depending  on the target to attack:   Component-wise attacks target field components that have Remote Terminal Units.   Protocol-wise attacks are focused on the communication protocol (reverse engineering, false data injections).   Topology-wise attacks target the topology of the network by carrying out Denial-of-Service.  Sample attacks against Smart grid communication networks and learnt lessons  The previously listed vulnerabilities and risks could be exploited by attackers with different motivations and could  cause different levels of damage and cascade effects to Smart grids. This section includes examples about real life  attacks against Smart grid communication networks and learnt lessons. Most of them have been obtained from  the information gathered from the interviews made with experts who contributed to this document (see Figure  7). For more detailed scenarios and attack cases, please see “Electric Sector Failure Scenarios Common  Vulnerabilities and Mitigations Mapping”23 and TACIT framework for the assessment of risk and impact of cyber- attacks in smart-grids24.  Figure 7: Sample Smart grid attacks.  TARGET ELEMENT ATTACKS LEARNT LESSONS  Attack in Control Centre  System  One of the worst scenarios considered included an attack to the  Control Centre system.

This  could affect several systems in different countries.   Provides privacy and isolation between  different system groups;   Protects devices and provides network  redundancy.  Data theft  Another scenario considered a data theft, where technical  information regarding internal workings and operations was  leaked. This could be caused by malware on the computers, due  to users having too many permissions or the use of weak  encryption or authentication protocols.   Disable unnecessary services and  ports;   Implement secure protocols;   Use stronger encryption;   Optimize of data traffic (only necessary  data).  FTP server attack  This attack is carried out by using brute force to obtain user  access. The attackers broke the password and obtained access,  but this did not have any relevant impact.   Use robust and strong authentication  and encryption methods.   Furthermore, the use of Secure FTP  variants is recommended in order to  avoid sending clear-text passwords  throughout the network.  Man-in-the-Middle  attacks (MITM)  Alter the communication between two network components  which are communicating directly. This process frequently  consists on monitoring the network, intercepting data  transferred and using brute-force decryption.  Public key infrastructures (PKI) can be used in  order to:   Provide mutual authentication (using  secret keys and passwords);   Monitor cryptographic hash function  (latency);   Detect possible MITM attacks.  Internal employee  incidents  This includes employees, contractors or external users, which can  potentially damage an organization from the inside. Their motive  can be varied, including revenge, monetary gain, or espionage. In  addition, employees who are ill-prepared could unknowingly  become a security risk.   Implementation of an access control  and monitoring system capable of  detecting these types of incidents.   Provide training and awareness  courses to inform users of these risks.  Lack of Standardization  There is a lack of common standards about the security of devices  on a Smart grid. In addition, there are too many devices,  considerably dispersed. The consequences of this lack of  standardization include an increase of the vulnerabilities that  could be exploited.  The main objective is to define a standard  (such as NERC CIP) that covers the security  vulnerabilities that affect these devices (user  privileges, data analysis, protection, etc.).  Electric Vehicle  vulnerable connections  Electric Vehicles require additional connections in order to  exchange the necessary data for its proper operation. These  connections use well known protocols by attackers (such as  Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or GPRS).  Experts are working on solutions to these  risks, analysing new protocols and interfaces  used, and defining the appropriate security  measures to protect them.  Social engineering  Social engineering attacks (e.g. Phishing) have increased  exponentially these last years, and have become one of the  biggest concerns for security experts. These attacks focus on the  personnel and their aim is to steal operational or business data,  user credentials, private data, etc.   One the biggest concerns relates to  internal threats. Organizations should  ensure that their employees are aware  of the threats they face in order to  maintain a good level of security.   Awareness campaigns can be used to  train employees.  DDoS and blackouts  The risk of external disruptive events always exists (natural  disasters, malicious attacks, etc.) and will impair or disrupt the  ability to supply electrical energy and could damage the control  The major challenge with these situations is  trying to prevent them and improve existing  mitigation measures and service restoration  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  35  TARGET ELEMENT ATTACKS LEARNT LESSONS  systems.

Authentication  (encryption, weak level)  These weaknesses could potentially be exploited by an attacker  in order to gain access to the system or to internal data. These  situations could act as a previous step for more elaborate attacks  (system damage, information theft, blackouts, etc.).   The physical protection of metering  devices should be robust.   Electric metering devices now have the  computational power needed to  implement cryptographic measures,  although this is not always done.

Security good practices in communication networks for Smart grids  This chapter presents a gap analysis to evaluate which areas require further revision, as well as detecting those  constraints, impairments and incentives that can affect the development and implementation of smart grid  technologies on the different power grid domains. Furthermore, a summary of the good practices that can be  applied to Smart Grid communication networks is defined.  Common security practices currently used by European smart grid operators  This section focuses on presenting the most common security practices that are carried out by smart grid operators  located within the European Member States regarding communication networks. Regarding the overall security for  smart grids, ENISA already published the report “Appropriate security measures for smart grids”25, in order to help  smart grid providers to improve the security and the resilience of their infrastructures and services. This technical  document provides guidance to smart grid stakeholders by providing a set of minimum security measures which  might help in improving the minimum level of their cyber security services.  Regulations/normative used  The European Commission decided to set up a Task Force on smart grids aiming to develop a common EU smart  grid vision and identify key issues that need to be resolved26. The Task Force consists of a steering committee and  three Expert Groups. The high level steering committee includes regulatory bodies, Transmission Systems Operators  (TSOs), Distribution System Operators (DSOs), Distribution Network Operators (DNOs), and consumer and  technology suppliers working jointly to facilitate the smart grid and smart metering development. Therefore, there  is a conscious effort within Europe to harmonize smart metering/grid standards, and to create a single set of  European standards that will be widely adopted. These standards will play a key role to ensure a successful  integration. A significant part of this endeavour targets challenges to the new and existing communication  architectures, and possible solutions to achieve this integration.   Smart metering communication standardization in Europe: Metering standardization (including  automatic/remote meter reading, multiple dynamic tariffs, energy export functions, variable scheduled meter  reading and demand control) is a well-established activity in Europe, where various organizations have been  formed:   CEN: European Committee for Standardization.   CENELEC: European Committee for Electro-technical Standardization.   ETSI: European Telecommunications Standards Institute.  Besides communication network standards for smart metering, these organizations also cover important  standards for other aspects of smart metering. For example, IEC 61968-9 specifies interfaces for meter reading  and control. It specifies the information content of a set of message types that can be used to support many of  the business functions related to meter reading and control (e.g. meter reading, meter control, meter events,  customer data synchronization and customer switching). It also defines a list of functionalities such as  metrology, load control, demand response and relays, as well as a related set of XML-based control messages.   Worldwide standardization: It is worth noting that there are other major smart grid standards worldwide; for  example, in the United States the IEEE P2030, IEEE 1547, ANSI, NIST and future IP for smart grids in the IETF  have been developed. For instance, it is important to mention the development of the ANSI C12 suite of  25 ENISA. “Appropriate security measures for smart grids”, 2012.  26 FAN Z. et al. “Smart Grid Communications: Overview of Research Challenges, Solutions, and Standardization Activities”, IEEE,  2013.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  37  standards in the US, which focus mainly on electricity meters. These standards are now being upgraded to  reflect advances in smart metering, such as C12.19 Standard for Utility Industry End Device Data Tables (data  models and formats for metering data) and the C12.22 Standard for Protocol Specification for Interfacing to  Data Communication Networks (communicating smart metering data across a network).  The IEEE P2030 project addresses smart grid interoperability, aiming to provide guidelines for enabling the  integration of energy technologies with information and communication technologies (ICT) in order to achieve  a seamless operation of the grid components and overall a more reliable and flexible electric power system.  The IEEE 1547 Standard outlines a collection of requirements and specifications (performance, operation,  testing, safety, and maintenance) to interconnect distributed energy resources with the distribution segment  of the electric power system. These are globally needed for the interconnection of distributed energy resources,  including distributed generators and energy storage infrastructure, which are essential in order to achieve a  successful implementation of smart grids.  ANSI/ISA 99 is a Security Guideline and User Resource for Industrial Automation and Control Systems. It  contemplates compliance metrics as a central key issue. Their use can enable a measurement of the increased  security level. This in turn might lead to an implementation of cyber-security standards that are not cost related.  NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum  requirements for US federal information systems. It is a solid reference for industrial and business  organizations. It has also developed an elaborated framework where specific controls are provided for a broad  number of areas, sorted depending on the impact they have on the considered information systems. NIST 800- 53 includes an Appendix where this control framework has been adapted to the ICS requirements, both by  updating existing controls and by adding new ones.  IEC TC57 WG15 has developed cybersecurity standards for power system communications, specifically the IEC  60870-5 series, the IEC 60870-6 series, the IEC 61850 series, the IEC 61970 series, and the IEC 61968 series. The  IEC 62351 standards (some under development or update) consist of:   IEC/TS 62351-3: Security for profiles including TCP/IP.   IEC/TS 62351-4: Security for profiles including MMS.   IEC/TS 62351-5: Security for IEC 60870-5 and derivatives.   IEC/TS 62351-6: Security for IEC 61850 profiles.   IEC/TS 62351-7: Objects for Network Management.   IEC/TS 62351-8: Role-Based Access Control.   IEC/TS 62351-9: Key Management.   IEC/TS 62351-10: Security Architecture.   IEC/TS 62351-11: Security for XML Files.   IEC/TR 62351-12: Resilience and Security Recommendations for Power Systems with DER - under  development.    Other relevant standards: ISO 2700127 is considered as a mature, general purpose standard that provides good  practices and recommendations for information security management and is normally used for the  implementation or management of Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). As information security  is a general concept that affects all sectors and areas, it applies to all branches of an organization (not only  specific security systems or SCADA systems). Its application should be appropriate for smart grids and SCADA  systems.  27 FINARDI U. et al. “Considerations on the implementation of SCADA standards on critical infrastructures of power grids”, CNR  Ceris, 2013.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  38   Common Criteria27 is an international standard for computer security certification. It povides assurance that  the phases of specification, implementation and evaluation of a computer security product has been  conducted in a rigorous, standard and repeatable manner at a level that is proportionate with the target  environment for use.   NERC CIP27 is closely connected to the reliable operations’ support for bulk Electric Systems, providing a  cyber-security framework for the identification and protection of Critical Cyber Assets. The current NERC  framework recognizes the roles of each entity in the operation of the Bulk Electric System, the criticality and  vulnerability of the assets needed to manage Electric System reliability, and the risks to which they are  exposed.  Security protocols most used  To deal with potential security threats within the smart grid, countermeasures and defence strategies have to be  widely deployed and integrated into both the network protocols and the architectures used. For example,  compared with legacy power systems, the smart grid features full-fledged communication protocol stacks to  accomplish the goal of secure and efficient communications in the entire network.  Recently, as described on “Considerations on the implementation of SCADA standards on critical infrastructures of  power grids”28, many efforts have been made within the power community to develop secure protocols for power  grids, most of which are reusing existing protocol suites to achieve secure communications, such as IPsec, Transport  Layer Security (TLS) and IPv634. Apart from existing protocol suites, security extensions for power communication  protocols have also become a primary focus in the literature and standardization e.g. the security extensions for  the two widely-used power grid communication protocols, DNP3 and IEC 61850.  Secure data aggregation protocols have been also proposed for the smart grid, since the bottom-up traffic model  (device-to-centre) can be applied in power systems, such as metering reading in the AMI network and device  monitoring in the SCADA network.  Design of the smart grids  Physical and logical network architecture designs should limit or isolate the different individual domains that form  up the smart grid, leaving only those interconnections needed. For this purpose, normally one of the following two  proposed secure smart grid network architectures is used28:   Trust-based computing architecture.   Role-based network architecture.  Cryptographic primitive based approaches have become one of the major countermeasures applied against attacks  that target network integrity and confidentiality and which can be affect the overall performance. The main topics  regarding this issue are: encryption, authentication and key management for power systems. Some of the research  challenges are:   Trade-off between security and latency.   Emerging physical-layer authentication.   Symmetric key management for time-critical systems.   Key management for advanced metering infrastructure.  28 WANG W. & LU Z. “Cyber security in the Smart Grid: Survey and challenges”, Computer Networks, 2013.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  39  Contracting with network operators  There are not standards or guidelines defined to be used by operators or companies regarding security practices  for contracting services to network operators. However, common sense dictates that the following points should  be considered:   Use of Service Level Agreements (SLA) applied by contract in relation to the requirements that the provider has  to comply with (such as bandwidth, quality of service, coverage or support).   Redundancy in network communications.   Use of different protocols and technologies.   Contracts with different network operators.  Moreover the following “Evaluation criteria on communication technologies”29 should be taken into consideration:  Non-technical:   costs  o OPEX  o CAPEX   operator‘s authority   customer acceptance  Technical:  • availability  • temporal  • local  • max. downtime  • reliability  • performance  • data throughput  • capacity  • coverage  • nodes per cell  • clustering  • latency  • physical medium  • right of use  • licence free  • primary /secondary  • internal consumption  • installation efforts  • integrability  • functional  • multicasting  • scalability  • life span  • standardization  • quality of service  • guaranteed future  • network-security  • technology dissemination  • combinability with other technologies  • network management  • operating efforts  29 Presentation “Challenges Regarding Security & Reliability of the Communications Infrastructure in Smart Grids”, Dr. Markus  Wächter, 2015  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  40  • topology  • distance without repeater  Procurement and certification of the systems  In order to include certification requirements in the procurement process, certifications should focus on the whole  life-cycle of the product not only on the product itself; from the initial design phase and up to their end of life.  Additionally, a certification scheme will need to incorporate the different types of certifications that apply to the  product life-cycle, because product development certification, product certification and operation certification  cannot be subject to the same certification type. Currently, the procurement process includes certification  requirements which only focus on products like smart meters (i.e. secure protocols, physical security, and  cryptography).  Testing the smart grid components  This includes testing all participating components in the smart grid context: system actors, applications, power  system equipment (typically located at process and field level), protection and tele-control devices, network  infrastructure (wired / wireless communication connections, routers, switches, servers) and any type of computers  used. It addresses the security of the individual components, focused on hardware, software, and the functions the  devices should perform and support. The process for testing the smart grid components includes conformity testing,  functional testing and interoperability testing30:   Conformity testing: assess the compliance of the test subject to standardised requirements.   Functional testing: assess the ability of the test subject to provide the required functionality. This functionality  is usually described in a standard referred to during the tests.   Interoperability testing: assess the ability of two or more systems to exchange information and to make mutual  use of the information that has been exchanged.  A more specific form of testing that is commonly carried out in security audits is penetration testing. This type of  testing revolves around the exploitation of possible design flaws and weaknesses to compromise the security of a  device. Such tests do not focus on a specific test book, but rely more on the creativity of the tester, and the time  that there is available to carry out the test. Penetration testing can be incorporated as part of a functional test, by  describing it as a negative test case for a functional requirement. Depending on the nonconformity risks, it can be  decided to perform first, second and third party assessments. However, in practice, only third party certification is  seen as trustworthy for most cyber security specialists.  Gap analysis and identification of areas of improvement  The first step is to develop a gap analysis to detect weak areas and possible improvements to the grid’s security.  According to the results of this analysis the following areas are in need of improvement:  Technical points of attention  There are several domains that require security-related improvements in order to ensure the protection of the grid  itself:   Last mile awareness as part of cyber-security awareness campaigns: The logical security measures on the last  mile of the network have to be taken into consideration. This part of the network is already protected at physical  30 ENISA. “Smart Grid Security Certification in Europe: Challenges and recommendations”, 2014.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  41  level, but in most cases the cyber security is insufficient or inexistent. Smart grids companies should protect the  last-mile communication systems from three dimensions: data, device and communication.   Always use secure communication protocols on SCADA devices: since most SCADA protocols were designed  long before network security was considered as a relevant risk, applying security measures on SCADA protocols  was not considered as a priority. This however is no longer the case, and secure communication protocols have  become a must in order to protect smart grids.   Always use interoperable communication protocols on SCADA devices: SCADA devices designed by different  manufacturers used their own proprietary protocols, that in have been compatible with devices produced by  same manufacturer. Due to the distributed nature of smart grids, these devices must now be compatible, not  only for security but also in order to guarantee the power supply on the grid.   Avoid the use of proprietary/homebrew protocols on SCADA systems and other related assets: related to the  previous point, not only must SCADA systems be compatible with each other; it is also highly recommended for  them to use standardized protocols defined by the whole industry, not individually by each manufacturer.  Organizational needs in the smart grid domain  Service Providers, Customer and Markets domains need specific and properly defined policies and standards  covering all smart grid domains and areas (communications, billing, customer management, account management,  installation and maintenance, micro generation, etc.). There are several possible steps for improvement:   Develop policies to ensure periodic software and firmware updates to SCADA systems: as these systems are  now interconnected, and in many occasions passing through the Internet and other public networks, it becomes  necessary to update them periodically to fix vulnerabilities and add new security measures to ensure the safety  of the smart grid communications.   Foster guidelines regarding smart grid communications officially supported by all MS: the Member States’  competent authorities should harmonize policies regarding the security of smart grid communications in order  to standardize them and ensure a smooth implementation of smart grids in different environments.   Involve vendors and manufacturers in the protection of the devices and network elements: Vendors and  manufactures are not sufficiently involved in the security development process of the smart grid devices, which  is required in order to implement the security measures by default on them. For this purpose, it will be  necessary to establish common regulatory bodies in Europe in charge of establishing a baseline containing a set  of basic features that all manufacturers should always implement on their products.   Cybersecurity awareness campaigns for smart grid company employees: Security incidents could be more  easily avoided if employees are aware of these risks and are prepared against them. For this purpose it is  necessary to offer them awareness campaigns in these topics.  Certifications needed specifically for smart grid security  There are many defined standards for different aspects of the protocols, architectures and smart grid devices.  However there is a lack of alignment in these guidelines, as there is no preferred one, and nowadays manufacturers  and vendors can make use of any of them without any regard about the one used by the rest. This leads to  compatibility problems, especially on the intercommunications and interdependencies between devices, leading to  further problems later on during the deployment of the smart grids. Therefore, the lack of standardized certification  schemes at a European level is a problem that must be worked on and solved in order to improve greatly the security  and efficiency of smart grids.  Issues highlight during the interviews  During the interviews it was underlined the lack of studies regarding interdependencies among smart grid devices  and their intercommunications between the grid implementations of the different European Member States. This  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  42  lack of knowledge leads to the need to further evaluate them in the future. This specifically refers to each individual  implementation, and as such each individual case would have to be evaluated. However, it is still highly  recommended to establish a common baseline throughout Europe in order to avoid current and future  interdependency issues among Member States’ smart grids.  Constraint and incentive analysis for the deployment of security measures  The constraints, impairments and incentives that affect the security measure deployment process on smart grids  can be divided into four mayor groups:  Economic constraints and incentives  Fragmented markets are the main barrier that impedes the smart grid implementation process. Due to the lack of a  harmonized approach, implementation costs rise considerably. Still, there are similarities among countries that can  be used to create consensus, and a combination of schemes could be an acceptable solution on a European level,  which would also impact in lower costs. It will be a challenge to keep cost to a minimum level while still providing  enough security; as security is a topic that penetrates all aspects of a system, and therefore has to be widely  implemented without directly providing justification of the necessary costs and effort. The benefits of the  implementation of security measures are shared among different groups31: such as the firms operating in the country  or the society as a whole, and only a small part concerns the electricity utilities. From a profitability viewpoint,  electric companies have no direct incentive to increase their security levels, as cyber-threats have been irrelevant  to legacy power grids until the arrival of smart grids. This explains their reluctance to perform such huge investments.  Public regulation and support to firms operating in competitive branches of the energy sector is definitely necessary.  Electric supply security is a very important point of the electric service, since our lives and economic activities have  become more and more dependent on this commodity, and a lack of supply would cause huge losses and overall  panic. Technical security measures are usually quite expensive to implement (e.g. communication network  redundancy cost-effective system, security requirements implementation by manufacturers, etc.), and as such need  their cost-effectiveness needs to be evaluated in each case.  Organizational constraints and incentives  Heterogeneity and differences in applicable regulations on the European Member States countries are one of the  main concerns in this case. In particular:   Different national regulations, although a common framework established by the UE already exists.   Different roles of public firms.   Different national market structures.  Cyber-security is not currently at the front-line, as not enough attention is being paid in Europe to cyber-security  and data privacy protection. There is a generalized perception that cyber-security is not a critical aspect of the smart  grids. Furthermore, the governments of several European countries are rushing to develop and deploy their smart  grids. Unfortunately, rushing at this point can be counter-productive, causing the resulting infrastructure to lack the  appropriate security measures. However, the benefits of having aligned standards and recommendations outweigh  its costs. By having the same standards, all European countries will implement their own smart grids following similar  architectures and trends, helping greatly to ensure the compatibility and proper interdependency and  intercommunication of all their systems and services.  31 GARCÍA GUTIÉRREZ F. and RAGAZZI E. “Trial evaluation: conclusive lessons from Essence case studies”, Rapporto tecnico  N.42, 2014  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  43  Technical constraints and incentives  There is a lack of standard reference architectures for smart grids in Europe. There are many standards, but no single  one is considered as the baseline for implementations of these networks, independently of the domain evaluated  (including generation, distribution, transmission and customer premises). For technically-complex devices, their  configuration and management is difficult, especially in implementations with large number of devices. Therefore  this increases the cost of applying new configurations or updates on them in order to fix vulnerabilities.  Manufacturers have to design their devices in a way that they support easier upgrade and management solutions.  This also applies to large intercommunication networks, where their management and protection also requires large  investments. Therefore, while the implementation of security measures is costly, and has considerable technical  implications, its benefit is clear as their protection, and of their interdependencies, ensures the proper operation  and working of the grid and their systems, allowing for more efficient energy distribution and taking advantage of  all the new features and services that smart grid support  Social constraints and incentives  Smart grids can be considered as critical infrastructures, as they are essential in order to maintain vital societal  functions, health & safety and economic status of the people. The disruption or destruction of such infrastructures  could have a serious impact on a Member State, which leads to the need to protect them. This is even more  applicable for the intercommunication networks and interconnections in smart grids, as an attack on them can have  the same nefarious effect as a physical attack against the traditional power infrastructure. Unfortunately, security  awareness and public perceptions on these risks are still low, and requires a lot of work to be changed; for this  purpose, it is recommended to include awareness campaigns on the long term deployment plans in order to ensure  that they are informed and aware of these new needs.  Available communication security guidelines applicable to Smart grids  There are various good practices published for all aspects of communication networks, communication devices,  Smart grid systems and SCADA devices. This section is focused on summarizing those that are relevant to this study,  which mainly concerns those regarding Smart grid devices and architectures, and communication networks in  general.  The documents that have been considered as part of this section are:   Best practices for handling smart grid cyber security32.   Connecting and securing Legacy Electrical substations to the smart grid33.    ENISA Good Practices in Resilient Internet Interconnection34.   ENISA Recommendations for Europe and Member States35.   NESCOR Electric Sector Failure Scenarios Common Vulnerabilities and Mitigations Mapping.   Smart Grid Security: Threats, Vulnerabilities and Solutions20.   ENISA Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide21.   ENISA Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure25.   NIST Guidelines for Smart Grid Cybersecurity36.  32 GHANSAH I. “Best Practices for Handling Smart Grid Cyber Security”, California State University Sacramento, 2014.  33 MACKENZIE H. “Connecting and Securing Legacy Electrical.

Figure 8 displays a list of these categories, with the good practices that apply to each one. These good practices have  been numbered in order to better reference them throughout the document.  Figure 8: Good practices.  CATEGORY GOOD PRACTICES  ASSOCIATED  ATTACKS  Organizational  security policies  (smart grid  communications)  GP01 - Organisational security framework Implementation: describes the implementation  process of the security plans.  Attack in Control  Centre System,  Data Theft,  Authentication  exploiting  GP02 - Password policy: it is necessary to establish a strong and robust password policy. This can  sometimes require employee training regarding how to choose robust passwords and their  impact in their work processes. Awareness against social engineering is also recommended on  this point.  GP03 - Data Policy: data must be classified according to their security level, which has to be  applied throughout the whole lifecycle of the data up to the point where is destroyed. The  classification levels have to be clearly defined as part of the corporate security policy.  GP04 - Incident Response: it is necessary to define the process to manage security incidents. This  includes all stages: detection, investigation, analysis, mitigation, disaster recovery (business  continuity plans), and post evaluation (define measures to prevent future incidents). All attacks  (faster detection  and mitigation) GP05 - Relations with compatible providers: communication channels between providers and  other third parties can be used to receive assistance and share relevant information to prevent  large-scale incidents or attacks.  Annual  assessments  GP06 - Vulnerability assessments in communication networks: vulnerability assessments should  be carried out annually for all critical elements of the smart grid networks to verify their security  level and detect any possible vulnerability. Non-critical devices should still be assessed, although  that need not be done annually.  Exploit attacks  to outdated  elements  Security by Design  GP07 - Security by Design: security considerations need to be included on the initial phases of  the smart grid design, to ensure better compatibility. Failure to do this will most likely lead to  much higher implementation costs.  All attacks  Mutual  authentication  GP08 - Mutual authentication: the origin and destination of all communications must be known.  By using mutual authentication, both the server and the host verify each other’s identity. This is  usually done using TLS or IPsec protocols, or by implementing a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).  MITM,  Information  theft, identity  spoofing  Virtual private  network  GP09 - Virtual Private Networks: these networks should be used to establish a connection within  two devices on the communications’ architecture. These connections establish a secure point-to- point communication through the network by using tunnelling and encryption protocols. It is  especially recommended as a means of connecting remotely to a system.  MITM,  Eavesdropping,  information  theft  Third-party  companies  GP10 - Communication service providers: utilities are not used to manage large complex  communication networks, as their focus is the power grid. For this purpose, it is recommended  to make use of third party telecommunication companies that will be in charge of maintaining  and securing the network communications.  DoS, DNS  attacks,  unauthorized  access  GP11 - Supply Chain Management: system security is only as strong as its weakest link; therefore  when working with third-party providers, it is fundamental to define a management process to  ensure that all security requirements are met.  Social  Engineering,  37 OSCE. “Good Practices Guide on Non-Nuclear Critical Energy Infrastructure Protection (NNCEIP) from Terrorist Attacks  Focusing on Threats Emanating from Cyberspace”, OSCE Publications, 2013.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  45  information  theft  Physical security  GP12 - Physical access rules: physical access to the elements of the network must be restricted;  personnel must only have access to those systems/infrastructures specifically required.  Unauthorized  physical access,  information  theft, deliberate  damage  GP13 - SCADA networks: periodical surveys to verify the physical security of the remote sites  connected to the SCADA network.  Unauthorized  physical access,  deliberate  damage  Software updates  GP14 - Software updates: an update process that ensures that all the elements of the network  are up-to-date and protected against newly discovered vulnerabilities or bugs should be  established.  Attacks related  to exploit  outdated  systems (Data  Theft, DDoS…)  Network Intrusion  Detection/Preven tion Systems  (IDS/IPS)  GP15 - Advanced IDS modes: the use of host-based defence mode and of Domain Specific IDS is  highly recommended to boost the security of the network, especially of the most sensitive  segments. As this cannot be always achieved, it is recommended to complement it by including  a baseline of the operations and expected flows to detect any anomalies.  Unauthorized  access,  information  theft, malicious  code  GP16 - System unification: to improve the defence of the network, it is highly recommended to  unite all IDS/IPS systems in one “group”, allowing operators to gain comprehensive situational  awareness. This approach is more comprehensive in terms of security and event monitoring,  and provides better protection for the overall network.  Employee  awareness,  training and  education  GP17 - Employee awareness, training, and education: employee awareness is fundamental in  order to prevent attacks and fraud. Teaching employees to detect attack patterns, risks, fraud  and social engineering attacks. It is recommended to include this point as part as the corporate  security policy and carry out periodical awareness campaigns.  Social  Engineering  Contingency  readiness  GP18 - n-1 contingency: the system should be distributed in a way that a failure of one device will  not cause a communications outage in a section of the network. This can be achieved with  redundant communication devices that ensure that no device is connected only through one  path.  Denial of Service  Attack, Outages  Malware  protection  GP19 - Manufacturer code and software validation: systems should only run the intended  functions and applications they were designed to. Manufacturers should provide means to  validate the software and firmware installed on the system.  Unauthorized  access,  information  theft, malicious  code  Secure network  segregation  GP20 - Network segmentation: the network should be divided into sections, each one for  different purposes, to protect the systems within. This allows the protection of especially  sensitive network components, such as the AMI segment or the control systems segment. This  helps to limit unauthorized accesses to one segment to gain access to other sections of the  network. Unauthorized  access, malicious  code, network  outage cascade  effect  GP21 - Network assets as segregation elements: network segments have to be separated with  security devices, including firewalls, gateways and filtering routers, to stop users from one  segment to access other segments, except if they are specifically allowed.  GP22 - Use of firewalls and Demilitarized Zones (DMZs): limits within the internal network  segments and the DMZs should be separated though the use of security devices (e.g. firewalls).  These firewalls should be protocol-aware, including support for basic filtering of both protocols  and command codes/instructions.  Secure network  communications  GP23 - Secure smart device communication: smart grid information systems should only make  use of secure communication protocols (such as SSL/TLS). Additional security measures can be  taken in order to further protect these communications.  Information  theft, MIT,  identity theft,  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  46  GP24 - Secure communications used for remote administration: remote management and  administration of the smart network systems must always be done though secure  communications or VPNs connections.  deliberate  information  manipulation  GP25 - Protocol compliance: communications though the network should only use protocols  approved by the provider and which have been verified to work on the network and have security  capabilities.  GP26 - External smart grid information systems: their communications should be always  identified and protected to avoid corruption, tampering or loss.  GP27 - Access control points: Smart grid information system routes all remote accesses through  a limited number of managed access control points.  GP28 - Only use authorized communication channels: communication and information flows  should be defined and limited over the communication link.  GP29 - Secure network proxies: internal and external network connections should be routed via  specifically hardened proxies, located on the DMZ.  GP30 - CSP redundancy: avoid depending on a single CSP, instead make use of several different  ones.  GP31 - Secure communication protocols: In order to protect communications, it is necessary to  use secure protocols.  SCADA security  GP32 - Smart SCADA audits: technical audits on SCADA devices and networks should be carried  out regularly. The focus is to detect vulnerabilities and analyse them to determine the risk level  they pose. This includes managing and overviewing the application of corrective actions.  Information  theft, MIT,  identity theft,  deliberate  information  manipulation  GP33 - SCADA connections knowledge: it is necessary to build up a knowledge base of the SCADA  networks and the devices contained in order to be able to evaluate their strength, detect possible  improvement points and develop recovery plans.  GP34 - Disconnect unnecessary connections to the SCADA network: disconnect or isolate SCADA  network devices and the SCADA network itself from the rest of devices. DMZ areas can be used  for this purpose in various architectures.  GP35 - SCADA backdoor management: any backdoor access to the SCADA network should be  closed unless strictly necessary. If it is not possible to close it, additional security measures should  be taken in order to protect it as much as possible and avoid any potential derived risks.  GP36 - MTUs & RTUs: these devices should be protected, using Secure Architecture Designs and  applying security features provided by the devices, as well as implementing IEC-60870, DNP 3.0  and Modbus protocols.  Wireless Area  Networks  GP37 - Wireless networks: the following security measures can be used to protect networks in  general (including Wi-Fi, ZigBee, WiMAX):   Media Access Control (MAC) address filtering;   AES encryption protocols;   Protection against masquerading parties;   Access Control Lists (ACL);   Trust Centre address configuration (ZigBee only);   IEEE 802.11w-2009 and WPA (Wi-Fi only).  Information  theft, MITM,  identity theft,  session  hijacking,  information  gathering  Advanced  Metering  Infrastructure  GP38 - Metering security standards: adopt an open-reference standard that defines the security  measures that advanced meters should comply with.  Smart Meter  hijacking,  information  theft, malicious  code,  unauthorized  access  GP39 - Traffic control: implement session control and detection mechanisms capable of quickly  halting any suspicious sessions or communications.  GP40 - Network connection only for approved assets: authenticate and validate the identity of  the metering assets on the network and restrict access to any unknown device. This  authentication is also used to provide data integrity.  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  47  GP41 - Authentication and integrity checks: validate and authenticate the origin of all system  commands and meter readings to ensure that they have not been tampered with. Configurable  firmware is the most vulnerable if these security checks are not carried out.  GP42 - Meter data encryption: this protects the data against tampering and ensures the privacy  of any personal data transmitted.  GP43 - Consumer non‐repudiation: provide means to ensure that any data obtained is valid and  its origin has been verified.  GP44 - Virtual Home command execution: all commands received from external sources should  be tested firs in a “Virtual Home Command Execution” environment (a form of sandbox), to  ensure that no negative effects occur from its application on the real environment.  GP45 - Head-end: possible security measures to implement are:   Authenticate all commands and reports between the Head-End and the customer  endpoint.   Protect the Head-End systems with the same level of security as other critical assets.   Use strong user authentication on all Head-End systems and log all user actions.   Implement safety logic to prevent rapid changes in pricing information.   Carry out periodic integrity checks and audits.  Denial of Service  protection  GP46 - IP address verification: source IP addresses should always be verified, especially on those  systems located on the edge of the Internet infrastructure, to prevent address spoofing. Denial of Service  attacks,  communication  network outage,  DNS attacks  GP47 - DNS issues: name-server operators should implement measures, such as RRL, to protect  against vulnerabilities that can be used to compromise the organizations’ network.  GP48 - Denial of Service protection: anti-DDoS systems should be established to protect AMI  systems and protect other devices on the network against Denial of Service and replay attacks.  Asset  management  GP49 - Asset inventory: an inventory containing all the assets and devices part of the network  should be created and maintained in order to gain awareness of the whole network, avoiding  missing any system or obscured/legacy section. Furthermore, this inventory should contain the  vulnerabilities that affect each one in order to determine risks and possible threats to the  network.  Unauthorized  access, malicious  code, network  outage  Categorization of good practices on smart grid communication networks  After the study of existing good practices, and sorting them into relevant categories, the next step is to evaluate and  organize them based on their impact, focused on people, technical and organisational aspects. The concepts  evaluated are:   Smart grid domains are related to: people, organizational aspects or technical aspects.   Implementation complexity: rate their implementation difficulty based on the requirements related to the  domains defined previously. The ratings go from “low” (feasible) to “high”(not feasible).   Cause: justification of the rating given to the implementation complexity column.  The table on Figure 9 presents the result of the evaluation carried out following the specifications defined for the  analysis.  Figure 9: Good practices by domain.

Recommendations to improve security of communication networks  in smart grids  This chapter presents a series of recommendations to improve the security level of the communication networks  used for intercommunications in smart grids. These recommendations are intended mainly for operators, vendors,  manufacturers and security tool providers located within European Member States.  The first recommendation will serve as an overview of the rest of recommendations, as a means of establishing the  appropriate focus for them.  Recommendation 1: European Commission should ensure the alignment of policy approaches across EU countries  to establish a common posture for smart grid communication interdependencies. Cyber security has become one  of the main concerns regarding the implementation of smart grids, and especially regarding the networks used for  the interconnection of all the assets that make up this new grid. Therefore, an inherent requirement is to protect  these communication networks, the data that travels through them and the devices connected to them. For this  reason, it is necessary to collaborate with all involved parties (operators, manufacturers, vendors, distributors and  security experts) in order to further develop solutions to fill these requirements. Each European country has a  different regulation and infrastructure regarding power grids, in many cases due to the specific needs of each one.  Furthermore, they tend to make use of different standards for these implementations, architectures and assets in  use. European Commission should promote and support initiatives regarding the improvement of smart grid  intercommunications security according to the recommendations described on this document, which will serve as a  prerequisite to raise the level of smart grid security on both European and National intercommunication networks.  There is the need to harmonize European requirements and standards for smart grid communication networks,  especially regarding the homologation of security devices and protocols.  Recommendation 2: Manufacturers and vendors should foster intercommunication protocol compatibility  between devices from different manufacturers and vendors. Currently, many manufacturers and vendors, due to  the lack of standards, make use of their own proprietary protocols and communication systems for the  intercommunication between their devices. Therefore, this leads to the fact that when a distributor or utility makes  use of these devices, the rest of the network devices have to be provided by the same vendor, or have to be  specifically compatible with them. This, although can be seen as a benefit from the manufacturers’ side, is in fact a  grave problem due to the massive size of the smart grid networks, and the fact that many of the devices currently  in use come from different manufacturers as different specifications are needed for each network segment.  Distributors, utilities and other involved actors should make use of devices from different vendors without having to  worry about incompatibilities in the communications among them. Alternatively, providers could make their  protocols open-source instead of proprietary, to enable other companies to make their devices compatible with  these communications. This has as an additional advantage the fact that by being open source, their implementation  can be reviewed by third parties, which can analyze it and find and fix bug and security vulnerabilities.  Recommendation 3: European smart grid operators and relevant authorities should develop a set of minimum  security requirements to be applied in all communication interdependencies in smart grids. The first step for  improving security of the intercommunications, interdependencies and devices part of the smart grids is to establish  a series of minimum security requirements that have to be met in order to protect the overall grid connectivity.  These security requirements and associated controls must be defined in order to achieve a minimum level of security  that will ensure service continuity and resilience, both in public and private environments. This has to be promoted  at a European level in order to ensure its success. This could be done by establishing a working group at a European  level, with representation of all relevant stakeholders, in order to define a series of recommendations regarding the  minimum security requirements that should always be applied to smart grid devices, intercommunications and  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  52  interdependencies. Alternatively, define guidelines that include the implementation of minimum security  requirements for all devices, interconnections and interdependencies for the deployment of new smart grids.  Recommendation 4: Manufacturers, vendors and asset owners should implement security measures on all devices  and protocols that are part, or make use of the smart grid communication network. Traditionally, grid devices and  assets were usually isolated, or interconnected through private local networks. However, smart grids bring a new  level of interconnection, where devices can be connected to large networks, wireless networks and even the  Internet. This leads to the need to protect these communications against eavesdropping and tampering, from the  origin and up to the destination. For this purpose, security measures need to be applied to the devices and the  protocols used for interconnection, and this needs to be considered from the device design phase onwards in order  to avoid the implementation costs from skyrocketing. This could be achieved by:   Supporting the implementation of security measures by default on all the protocols used for  intercommunications within the smart grid network.   Boosting the implementation of standard security measures by default on all devices that are going to be part  of the smart grid communication network.   Involving manufacturers, vendors and security tool providers in the process for improving security of both  devices and protocols.  Recommendation 5: Manufacturers, vendors and asset owners should work together on updatable devices and  periodic security update support. Nowadays, it is the norm for software and firmware to receive periodic updates  to fix vulnerabilities, add new security features or fixes, and even add new characteristics. This is quite common on  personal devices and servers, where it has become a common practice to establish a periodic update and  maintenance phase to ensure that all systems are always up to date. However, the same cannot be said with smart  devices in traditional grids, and which now translates to smart grids. Firstly, power grid devices where usually  isolated and protected behind physical security measures, and as such it was not needed to update them unless if  there was a critical bug. Furthermore, these devices are normally running non-stop 24x7x365, and stopping them  requires a considerable amount of time and resources. Devices must be designed to be easily updated, both their  software and firmware, in order to ensure that they maintain an acceptable security level. There is no direct  alternative in this case as the devices will be interconnected to the main smart grid network, and sometimes even  to the Internet, and any security vulnerability found in them has to be fixed. Although it is possible to that in some  cases these vulnerabilities can be fixed by applying specific configuration or mitigation features, not all vulnerabilities  can be fixed this way. Manufacturers and vendors should work together on this topic, as they need to design their  devices to be easily updatable, and need to develop an update program to maintain them updated.  Recommendation 6: European Commission, Member States and all relevant smart grid stakeholders should  promote incident reporting and attack patterns sharing. Attacks against electrical grids have not been very common  in the past, as many systems where isolated and gaining access to one did not grant an entry point to the rest of the  system. However, with the implementation of smart grids, many new attack vectors and network entry points have  appeared as a consequence of their intercommunicated and distributed nature. Even more, it is just a matter of time  that large attacks focus on them and begin threatening their stability. For this reason, it becomes necessary to share  data and attack patterns to help all involved agents to protect their assets and develop countermeasures which can,  in turn, be shared to protect the overall smart grid network. This can be achieved by facilitating incident reporting  intercommunications to share attack patterns and trends among European agencies, Member State agencies and  other relevant stakeholders. Foster attack data sharing between companies and involved stakeholders to prevent  future attacks. Establish sharing mechanisms among organizations and countries in order to share data related to  attacks suffered, threats and attack trends.  Recommendation 7: European Commission, Member States and all relevant smart grid stakeholders should  promote increased training and awareness campaigns. One of the gripes that threats smart grids is also the lack of  Communication network interdependencies in Smart Grids  Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks Links and Components  53  qualified professionals, and many of the existing ones lacking adequate training and awareness regarding security in  the new scenarios that have appeared on energy grids due to the new features that come with the implementation  of smart grid technologies. There are a number of actions that could be put in places:   Specific training courses to teach operators and manufacturers to implement security measures and to  mitigate risks that are inherently part of the smart grid systems.   Awareness campaigns to inform professionals about the latest threats and risks that affect smart grids and  related technologies, as well as possible solution or mitigation actions.

In this section, key goals are set for each core priority for  the period 2015-2017.  1.2.2 Core operational activities 2015  This section presents the core activities for 2015. Budget and resources are presented at the work package  level in section 4.14 and deliverables are summarised in section 4.15.  1.2.3 Administration and Support Department, Directorate and General management activities  This section of the document summarises the activities of the Administration and Support Department (ASD)  and the Executive Director. Budget and resources requirements are also identified here.  1.3 Key Performance Indicators and Key Impact Indicators  The terms Key Performance Indicator (KPI) and Key Impact Indicator (KII) are defined as follows:  Key performance indicators (KPIs) are quantifiable metrics used to evaluate objectives to reflect the  performance of an organisation. KPIs measure the agency’s performance during the budgetary/fiscal year.  KPIs differ depending on the nature of the organisation. Different layers and dimensions should be taken  into consideration. KPIs can constitute both quantitative and qualitative measures; however, the most useful  and common types are quantitative based. These include amongst others a focus on metrics such as  number of MS targeted, and number of hits to the website etc.  Key impact indicators (KIIs) are indicators used to evaluate long-term performance and eventually linked to  the strategy foundation stone of an organisation.  In this  Work Programmeme document, the Agency proposes a number of Key Impact Indicators for each  work package. Measuring the subsequent impact however is a difficult and time-consuming activity, due  to the fact that the impact of ENISA’s work on its stakeholder communities is often indirect and involves a  number of intermediate parties in the implementation process. This is particularly true for those deliverables  which essentially propose recommendations to various stakeholders (these are ENISA studies).  1. Introduction  1.1 Introduction  This document consists of two major components:  ● A multi-annual planning for the years 2015 to 2017.  ●  The ENISA  Work Programmeme for 2015.  The multi-annual planning has been derived from the ENISA Strategy document, which has been developed  together with the ENISA Management Board. As such, the planning is based on four strategic objectives  (which are presented in section 3.1). This approach ensures that future ENISA  Work Programmemes reflect  the strategic objectives of the Agency.  The  Work Programmeme itself reflects the conclusions of the ENISA Management Board meeting of  November 2013 with some minor adjustments for consistency and to facilitate smooth implementation,  the results of the meetings of the ad-hoc working group on 27.02.2014 and 21.05.2014 and the comments  made during the Management Board editorial meeting held on 11.09.14.

Strategic objectives and multi-annual planning  4.2.  SO1 – To develop and maintain a high level of expertise of EU actors taking into  account evolutions in Network and Information Security (NIS)  4.2.1. Overview  Justification  Ensuring adequate levels of protection for modern IT systems in any context requires recognising and  adapting to changes in the evolving threat environment. Whilst it is clearly not possible to foresee all future  threats (security practices have often been dramatically changed as a result of so called ‘black swan’  events, which are notoriously difficult to predict), it is possible to predict the evolution of certain threats with  a reasonable degree of accuracy based on past data.  The Agency will support the MS and the Commission in their efforts to improve CIIP by fostering a common  approach across the MS and by ensuring that good practice and lessons learnt are shared and properly  deployed in an effective manner. The Agency will work with the MS, the Commission and the private sector  in capacity building across the EU. In particular, the Agency will support the development of voluntary  baseline security requirements for CIIP sectors and harmonise efforts in the area of mandatory incident  reporting taking under consideration existing national and international frameworks (e.g. NIST). The  approach will not be limited to securing Internet related services, but will take into consideration other  networks and services as appropriate. This is also an area in which public private partnership is likely to  bring significant gains and ENISA will continue to support this approach.  Where technology is concerned, information security has traditionally been viewed as an approach for  securing the interaction of people, process and technology. Of these three factors, it is mainly technological  evolution that impacts the way in which people’s behaviour and process change. A large part of modern  information security therefore boils down to adapting current methods to emerging technologies, and  business models.  As a centre of excellence and expertise in the field of NIS, ENISA will use the expertise of its staff to advise  its’ stakeholders about trends in the digital world that affect security and to suggest good practices to  be taken in order to successfully mitigate the associated risks at an early stage of end-user adoption. In  particular, ENISA will seek to identify the consequences of deploying new technologies and approaches in  order to enable the opportunities that such developments bring to be realised.  Specific Policy Context  Each work package description contains a section highlighting the specific policy context for the activities  foreseen.  Overall Goals  Ensuring adequate levels of protection for modern IT systems in any context requires recognising and  adapting to changes in the evolving threat environment. Whilst it is clearly not possible to foresee all  future threats it is possible to predict the evolution of certain threats with a reasonable degree of accuracy  based on past data.  ● ENISA can support its stakeholders by compiling existing data on threat evolution and tailoring this data  to the needs of specific stakeholder communities.  4. Core operational activities  4.1 Introduction  From 2015 onwards ENISAs core operational activities are aligned with the strategic objectives from the  strategy and the multi annual planning. The strategic objectives effectively replace the structure of “work  streams (WS)” from previous years and are as follows:  ● SO1: To develop and maintain a high level of expertise of EU actors taking into account evolutions in  Network and Information Security (NIS).  ● SO2: To assist the Member States and the Commission in enhancing capacity building throughout the EU.  ● SO3: To assist the Member States and the Commission in developing and implementing the policies  necessary to meet the legal and regulatory requirements of Network and Information Security.  ● SO4: To enhance cooperation both between the Member States of the EU and between related NIS  communities.  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  2120  4. Core operational activities  Description of tasks  The main goal of this work package is to develop the current cyber threat landscape. This information is  important in the identification of NIS gaps and security needs for a wide spectrum of stakeholders.  The agency will collect, collate and analyse existing publicly available material on threats, risks, and trends  in NIS and emerging technologies application areas. Non publicly available material can be given to  ENISA via relevant stakeholders (e.g. NLOs). The data will be used for developing the annual ENISA Threat  Landscape Report. In this process, ENISA will seek contributions from relevant stakeholders to enhance  quality, accuracy and speed of assessed information. As was the case for the ENISA reports of previous  years ENISA will use the ENISA Threats Landscape Stakeholders forum (with participation by the CERT-EU,  EU institutions, national agencies, etc.) to support this activity and seek input.  In addition, in this work package ENISA will identify two emerging technology/application areas and  perform detailed threat and risk assessments. The emerging technology/application areas will be crucial for  society and the economy in the coming 2-4 years. Examples will be from sectors like internet infrastructures,  banking and finance, health, transport, energy and public administration and could cover areas like  Software Defined Networks or Security of mobile networks (“Mobile Security”). Such areas will be identified  from the emerging technology trends but also from assessed threat trends. Hence, their importance for  security and privacy will be considered a given.  In both areas of work ENISA will identify and consult with relevant stakeholder communities. The Agency will  co-operate with stakeholders on improving its data collection framework, on analysing the collected data  and on performing the sectorial risk assessments.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Annual Threat Analysis/Landscape Report (Q4, 2015).  D2: Risk Assessment on two emerging technology/application areas (Q4, 2015).  ● The collection and analysis of security data is an important part of ENISA’s existing mandate and is not  limited to incident-related data. It is the intention of the Agency to develop this capacity in the future,  both for data describing security incidents and other data that could be of use to MS in order to  improve MS understanding of the NIS trends.  ● ENISA will assist the Commission and MS in defining and implementing a framework for training  professionals in NIS to meet the requirements of industry at all levels. The goal will be to align training  goals with career paths for security professionals and to provide a more global background in NIS for  professionals in other areas.  4.2.2. Work Packages  The following work packages constitute this Strategic Objective:  WPK 1.1 – NIS Threats Analysis  This WPK main goal is to develop the current cyber threat landscape. This information is important in the  identification of NIS gaps and security needs for a wide spectrum of stakeholders.  WPK 1.2 – Improving the Protection of Critical Information Infrastructures  In this WPK ENISA aims at providing advice and assistance on request to targeted stakeholders of Critical  Information Infrastructures (CIIs).  WPK 1.3 – Securing emerging Technologies and Services  This WPK aims to develop good practices on emerging smart infrastructures and services and work with  relevant stakeholders to deploy them at an early stage of adoption.  WPK 1.4 – Short- and mid-term sharing of information regarding issues in NIS  This WPK aims at defining and implementing a framework that will allow the Agency to provide timely and  high quality responses to NIS developments.  4.2.3. WPK 1.1: NIS Threats Analysis  Desired Impact  ● Engage 10 public and 10 private stakeholders in the Threat Analysis/Landscape process. These  stakeholder should participate in the validation of the work.  ● Engage 10 public and 10 private stakeholders in the risk assessment of each emerging technologies/ sector. These stakeholder should participate in the validation of the work.  ● 5 MS use by 2016 ENISA’s Threat Analysis/Landscape process in their national risk management processes.  ● 10 private stakeholders use by 2016 ENISA’s Threat Analysis/Landscape process in their corporate risk  management processes.  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  22 23  4. Core operational activities  4.2.4. WPK 1.2: Improving the protection of Critical Information Infrastructures  Desired Impact  ● By 2017, 8 MS use ENISA’s findings and good practices in their national CIIP strategies. engaging 8  public and 8 private stakeholders (ISP, IXPs, Telcos) in the development of the methodology on internet  interconnections.  ● By 2016, 5 MS use ENISA’s government cloud good practices on in their national strategy.  ● 5 MS and 5 private stakeholders use ENISA’s recommendations on finance in their corporate/national  risk assessment and management approach.  ● 5 MS and 5 private stakeholders use ENISA’s recommendations on eHealth in their corporate/national  risk assessment and management approach.  Description of tasks  In this work package ENISA aims at providing advice and assistance on request to targeted stakeholders  of Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs).  More specifically ENISA will take stock of MS policies, regulations and strategies including international  frameworks (e.g. US NIST) and identify gaps related to CIIs. The Agency will co-operate with public  and private stakeholders to identify good practices, collect and analyse requirements and issue  recommendations for improving the way MS address the protection of CIIs.  In the area of Internet Interconnections, ENISA will continue developing its methodology for the identification  of critical communication networks, links, and components. ENISA will consider existing outputs from  projects and initiatives on the security and resilience of Internet interconnections. In co-operation with ISPs  and other public stakeholders ENISA will validate the methodology and develop a maturity assessment  mechanism. This mechanism would allow MS themselves to assess their situation within their borders. The  Agency will also assess whether this methodology can be extended to other CIIs and work with targeted  stakeholders to customise it to their needs and requirements.  In the area of ICS-SCADA security, ENISA will co-operate with EuroScsie and other related expert groups to  take stock of and analyse the cyber security maturity levels in critical sectors (e.g. transport, energy, water  supply, etc.). Using ENISA’s work (among others) policy makers in MS and EU Institutions can create the right  secure framework for the implementation and deployment of more efficient IC-SCADA systems. Through  co-operation with the public and private sector ENISA will identify, share and develop good practices,  information on gaps in policies, as well as regulations and strategies at national as well as EU level. The  Agency will continue promoting its work on the security of ICS-SCADA devices.  In the area of Smart Grids, ENISA will continue its work on minimum security measures and national  governance security models of Smart Grids. The Agency will promote its existing minimum security measures  and further co-operate with public and private stakeholders to improve their existing security governance  models for Smart Grids. It should be noted that smart grid area covers more than ICS; so for this activity  more areas are considered: smart cities, smart energy etc. ENISA will also continue contributing to DG  ENER’s Smart Grid Task Force and all relevant EU initiatives (e.g. CEN/CENELEC/ETSI, ERNCIP, DENSEK, etc.).  Finally the Agency will contribute to national and EU efforts (e.g. SOGIS) related to better alignment of  certification policies and strategies at EU level. Such alignment would remove barriers across EU MS and  allow European industry to become more competitive and innovative.  Stakeholder impact  The primary beneficiaries of this work package will be policy makers and organisations from public and  private sectors, who will receive integrated and consolidated information about the European NIS threat  landscape and how it is evolving:  ● Public and private organisations will be able to use the ENISA Threat Landscape in their own risk and  threat assessment in order to develop more effective security strategies, thus improving their Return of  Security Investment (ROSI).  ● EU Commission DG CONNECT will be able to use the ENISA output to adjust the scope of their RandD  related activities.  Public and private organisations may capitalise on the ENISA output to propose innovative RandD activities,  products or services.  Resources  ● (see chapter 4.14)  Legal base and policy context  ● ENISA regulation, article 3, particularly 3.1.(b) and 3.1.(c).  ● Commission proposes Action Plan to enable further growth of Security industry2 COM(2012) 417:  The Commission has produced a “COMMISSION STAFF WORKING PAPER on Security Industrial  Policy”3 SWD(2012) 233 final, and “COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN  PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE”4 COM(2012)  417 final. The Commission proposes to create a true internal market for the security industry by inter alia:  ‒ introducing checks on the societal impact of new security technologies at the research stage. To  reduce the gap between research and market, especially in European and international procurement,  the Commission will use novel funding schemes foreseen in Horizon 2020 such as Pre-commercial  Procurement, to test and validate results stemming from EU security research projects. This approach  should unite industry, public authorities and end users from the beginning of research projects. Border  security and aviation security are the most promising areas.  ‒ novel funding schemes such as Pre-commercial Procurement to test and validate results stemming  from EU security research projects.  ● COUNCIL RESOLUTION, 18/12/ 2009, on a collaborative European approach to Network and  Information Security, (2009/C 321/01)5. In this resolution the Council recognises the potential role of  ENISA to build a NIS scenario in Europe. It also underlines that the major goals of NIS are to support:  ‒ Quality of Information handling.  ‒ Collection of statistical data on NIS in MS and EU institutions.  ‒ Raise awareness and good practices and guidance.  EU policy development and implementation support to European Commission and MS, bridging gap  between technology and policy, and following EU priorities.  2 http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newsroom/cf/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=6117andlang=enandtpa_id=0andtitle=Security-industry%3A-Commission-proposes- programme-to-enable-further-growth-  3 ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/security/files/commission_staff_working_paper_-_security_industrial_policy_-_com(2012)_417_final_en.pdf  4 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0417:FIN:EN:PDF  5 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:321:0001:0004:EN:PDF  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  24 25  4. Core operational activities  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Stock Taking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs (Q3, 2015).  D2: Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks, Links, and Components  (Q4, 2015).  D3: Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security of Devises in Critical Sectors (Q4, 2015).  D4: Recommendations and Good Practices for the use of Cloud Computing in the area of Finance Sector  (Q4, 2015).  D5: Good Practices and Recommendations on resilience and security of eHealth Infrastructures and  Services (Q4, 2015).  Stakeholder impact  ● Cloud Computing  ‒ A number of governmental clouds are being set-up. A single framework for governmental cloud  computing, (1) allows MS to share and exchange knowledge on best-practices, (2) allows providers to  cater for different MS more easily, without having to adjust the cloud technology to different requests  in different countries, ultimately lowering the costs, (3) allows MS to move computing workloads to  other countries in failover and backup scenarios.  ‒ By setting a single set of security requirements for procurement by public sector across the EU, the  MS can improve procurement of cloud computing in the private sector as well, making it more easy  for SMEs to procure cloud computing services in line with national security requirements, and also to  procure cloud computing services across the EU’s single digital market.  ● Finance  ‒ Banks would benefit from having an independent analysis and set of guidelines about inter-banking  communications and transactions.  ‒ Industry would be able to use a neutral, not vendor specific discussion platform with an improved  exchange of good security and resilience practices in the area of telecommunications.  ● Smart Grids and ICS-SCADA  ENISA’s recommendations on minimum security measures for smart grids are expected to provide all the  relevant stakeholders with a tool for:  ‒ Allying of the varying levels of security and resilience of the market operators with a consistent  minimum framework.  ‒ Providing an indication of a minimum level of security and resilience in the MS, by avoiding the  creation of the “weakest link”.  ‒ Ensuring a minimum level of harmonisation on security and resilience requirements across MS and  thus reducing compliance and operational costs.  ‒ Setting the basis for a minimum auditable framework of controls across Europe.  ‒ Facilitating the establishment of common preparedness, recovery and response measures and paving  the way for mutual aid assistance across operators during crisis.  ‒ Contributing to achieve an adequate level of transparency in the internal market.  In the area of cloud computing, ENISA will actively contribute to EU Commission’s EU Cloud Computing  Strategy by delivering targeted advice on cyber security matters (e.g. certification, minimum security  measures, procurements, SLAs and others). The Agency will continue its work in the area of governmental  clouds, assist MS to develop their national governmental strategy and deploy ENISA’s good practice  guide. ENISA will also work with public and private sector to widely promote its work on the certification  of cloud computing components and services. The Agency aims at establishing ENISA’s meta certification  framework as the key model used by the users, SMEs and leading players in the market. ENISA does not  aim at developing an EU wide certification scheme, but just a mapping scheme that would allow cloud  users to select the most appropriate, existing certification scheme fitting their needs. That would especially  help SMEs to select the most sophisticated offer from the market.  In the area of finance, ENISA, through consultation with public and private stakeholders, will identify policy,  technical and regulatory barriers and challenges for using cloud, either as an infrastructure or as a service,  in the finance sector. The Agency will issue recommendations for policy makers, EU MS and industry to  mitigating the barriers and challenges. Aiming at removing such barriers ENISA will help the EU industry to  become more competitive and innovative. Also the Agency will consult with public and private stakeholders  to better understand the security and privacy challenges related with third party payments providers.  Finally in the area of eHealth, ENISA will identify all relevant public and private stakeholders, engage them  in a working group to take stock and assess the security and resilience of major eHealth infrastructures and  services. The Agency will then develop good practices and recommendations for policy makers, industry  and EU MS on the resilience and security of eHealth infrastructures and services.

WPK 1.4: Short- and mid-term sharing of information regarding issues in NIS  Desired Impact  ● Improve information flows between the CERT EU, ENISA and the CERT community.  ● Provide timely information to stakeholders, e.g. CISO, CIO level, in a coordinated manner.  Description of tasks  The objective of this work package is to define and implement a framework that will allow the Agency to  provide timely and high quality responses to NIS developments. In cases of NIS issues and occurrences  that reach a certain level of public and media attention it is crucial, that the Agency can give sufficient  information and, where appropriate, guidelines for dealing with the issue in very short time. Such guidelines  will not address immediate response, but will concentrate on medium to long term preparatory measures.  Also through ability to provide an ad-hoc news items with opinions and advice on relevant NIS issues  (called “Flash Notes”) the Agency will have a relevant and appreciated form of “added value by outreach”.  For each area ENISA will identify relevant public and private stakeholders, engage them at the operational  level making sure that the timing of the information flow meets their needs.  Over the last years ENISA’s news items with opinions and advice on relevant NIS issues (called “Flash  Notes”) proved to be a relevant and appreciated form of “added value by outreach” for the Agency. It is  ENISA’s intention to continue to provide these notes as a reliable and continuous service to its stakeholders  by identifying “Flash Notes” (to be renamed in the future “Info Notes”) again as an explicit deliverable. The  overall goal for each Note should be to highlight fundamental facts and shortcomings behind specific NIS  issues and occurrences, to give advice to its key stakeholders (in accordance to the agencies’ mandate)  and to provide an independent and “calm” opinion.  Description of tasks  The objective of this work package is to develop good practices on emerging smart infrastructures6 and  services and work with relevant stakeholders to deploy them at an early stage of adoption.  The main areas of work of this work package are:  ● Intelligent transportation systems used in the context of smart cities.  ● Big Data and corresponding services used for offering critical services.  ● Smart Home Environments.  For each area ENISA will identify all relevant public and private stakeholders, engage them in working  groups and jointly take stock of and analyse the current situation in terms of cyber security and resilience.  The Agency will also identify EU and national funded projects on these topics, liaise with them, assess their  findings and deliverables, and further engage them in the corresponding expert groups. Special emphasis  will be given to the resilience and robustness of such smart infrastructure and services.  Based on the consultation with stakeholders and desk-top analysis and research, ENISA will develop good  practices and issue recommendations addressing policy makers, developers and service providers. The aim  of the reports is to provide smart infrastructure service providers and developers with good security and  resilience practices when designing and deploying such services in order to minimise the exposure of such  network and services to all relevant cyber threat categories. The early adoption of these recommendations  and good practices will boost the trust and confidence of potential users of such infrastructures and pave  the way for the wide deployment of them. In such a way ENISA will help the EU industry to become more  competitive and innovative. Drawing from the knowledge and expertise on each area the Agency will  issue recommendations to MS and EU Commission on additional measures, including RandD, needed to  address specific aspects of these smart infrastructures and services.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Good Practices and Recommendations on the Security and Resilience of Intelligent transportation  systems (Q4, 2015).  D2: Good Practices and Recommendations on the Security and Resilience of Big Data Services (Q4, 2015).  D3: Good Practices and Recommendations on the Security and Resilience of Smart Home Environments  (Q4, 2015).  Stakeholder impact  ● Identify NIS issues and challenges in the area the areas mentioned above.  ● Develop good practices that stakeholders could use to either improve their current operations or dosing  more secure systems and services.  ● Issue targeted recommendations to policy makers and MS and work with them to address them in the  most practical and cost effective way.  6 An infrastructure can be defined as ‘smart’ when investments in human and social capital and traditional (transport) and modern (ICT) communication  infrastructure support sustainable economic development and a high quality of life, with a wise management of natural resources, through participatory  action and engagement.

In  particular, the Agency will work together with national bodies that have been mandated to carry out this  task within the MS, with private sector representatives and with European Commission to ensure that the  approach is coherent across the EU. In that respect ENISA will continue supporting national regulatory  authorities (e.g. NRAs and DPAs) and the Commission in the harmonised implementation of EU regulations  related to incident reporting across the EU. Such de-facto, bottom – up harmonisation based on good  practices and guidelines will reduce the cost of operation of the private sector in the EU.  Where private sector capacity building is concerned, ENISA will continue to ensure that this is aligned with  public sector objectives. The Agency will also assist industry in ensuring that capacity building efforts are  correctly integrated into the organisational structures of the benefited organisations.  By supporting initiatives such as the EU cybersecurity month, the implementation of an NIS driving  licence and MS’ efforts to introduce NIS topics into educational for a at all levels, ENISA will contribute  to increasing the level of participation of the EU citizen in activities aiming to improve the level of NIS  throughout the Union.  In 2015, the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) will be further developed. The ECSM’2015 organisation  follows up on the actions required in order to translate into practice the principle of shared responsibility  in NIS security, as stated in section 1.2 of the Cybersecurity Strategy: “All relevant actors, whether public  authorities, the private sector or individual citizens, need to recognise this shared responsibility, take action  to protect themselves and if necessary ensure a coordinated response to strengthen cyber security.”  Specific Policy Context  Each work package description contains a section highlighting the specific policy context for the activities  foreseen.  Overall Goals  ENISA will work together with MS and EU institutions to assist them in capacity building across the EU in  terms of government, private sector and wider public sector. In particular the Agency will work together  with national bodies (NRAs, CERTs, etc.) that have been mandated to carry out this task within the MS, with  private sector representatives and with European Commission to ensure that the approach is coherent  across the EU. The Agency will continue to support the Commission and the MS in the implementation  of methods and tools for ensuring adequate privacy protection and adherence to EU Data Protection  legislation. By supporting initiatives such as the EU cybersecurity month, the implementation of an NIS  driving licence and MS’ efforts to introduce NIS topics into educational for a at all levels, ENISA will  contribute to increasing the level of participation of the EU citizen in activities aiming to improve the level of  NIS throughout the Union.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Establish necessary procedures, workflows, tools, etc. to enable ENISA to carry out the Info Notes  service (Q2/2015).  D2: Info Notes on a specific NIS issue (ongoing service with pilot from Q2/2014; conclusions on first year of  activity in Q4/2015).  Stakeholder impact  The impact on stakeholders will be as follows:  ● More effective information flows between the CERT EU, ENISA and the CERT community.  ● Timely information provided to key stakeholders on NIS incidents and significant developments in the  field.

Work Packages  The following work packages constitute this Strategic Objective:  WPK 2.1 – Assist in public sector capacity building  This Work Package aims at helping operational bodies and communities (namely CERTs, but other  communities where appropriate) to develop and extend the necessary capabilities in order to meet the  ever growing challenges to secure their networks.  WPK 2.2 – Assist in private sector capacity building  This WPK aims at helping private sector developing their capacities in the area of cyber security (e.g. in the  area of Network and Information Security driving licence).  WPK 2.3 – Assist in improving awareness of the general public  This WPK aims at further developing ENISA’s multi-stakeholder facilitation approach and public-private  activities.  4.3.3. WPK 2.1: Assist in public sector capacity building  Desired Impact  ● By 2017, 8 MS use ENISA’s recommendations and good practices on National Cyber Security Strategies.  ● By 2017, continued CERT training will be provided to a minimum of 20 participants of different  organisations in 5 MS.  ● By 2017, Improved operational practices of CERTs in at least 15 MS (on-going support with best practices  development).  ● More streamlined CERT exercise and training material with CERT and other operational communities’  services and methodologies.  Description of tasks  This Work Package aims at helping the EU MS and other ENISA stakeholders, such as the EU bodies, to  develop and extend the necessary capabilities in order to meet the ever growing challenges to secure  their networks. A special emphasis in this WPK is laid on supporting operational bodies and communities  (namely CERTs, but other communities where appropriate) by concrete advice (like good practice material)  and concrete actions (like CERT training).  Part of the activities in this work package aim at maintaining and extending the collection of good practice  in various areas of capability building: guidelines for national strategies and exercises, good practice  collection and training material for operational communities like CERTs.  The Agency will support and advise MS on the development and implementation of National Cyber  Security Strategies (NCSS) including identifying the key elements to consider, the most appropriate process  to follow and the suitable assessment methods to adopt. The second big part is an active support of MS  in capability building, namely by rolling-out training for IT specialists (CERTs, etc.) and supporting MS to carry  out national exercises.  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  34 35  4. Core operational activities  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: ENISA report “Status of Privacy and Network and Information Security course curricula in MSs” (Q4/2015).  D2: Further development of ENISA application “NIS self-assessment” (dissemination material) (Q4/2015).  D3: On-request support for MS decision making (Q4/2015).  Stakeholder impact  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this work package will be the policy makers, standardisation  bodies and the end user organisations from public and private sectors, in particular in the area of EU NIS  education.  Resources  ● (see chapter 4.14)  Legal base and policy context  ● ENISA regulation, article 3, particularly 3.1.(c)(v).  ● Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace – JOIN(2013) 1  final – 7/2/2013 (Section 2.1).  ● EC proposal for an NIS Directive.  4.3.5. WPK 2.3: Assist in improving awareness of the general public  Desired Impact  ● Engage the 28 EU MS or representatives from the EU 28 MS for ECSM and general NIS messages for  citizens.  ● Collaboration, for better coordination, with at least 3 international stakeholders (ECSM).  ● Engage at least 5 representatives from at least 3MSs in the development of basic cyber hygiene  guidelines for recognizing and using trustworthy security and privacy products for the general public.  Description of tasks  In 2015, the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) will be further developed following its basic principles,  namely:  ● Support the multi-stakeholder governance approach.  ● Encourage common public-private activities.  ● Assess the impact of activities, optimising and adapting to new challenges.  4.3.4. WPK 2.2: Assist in private sector capacity building  Desired Impact  ● 10 public- private stakeholders from MS follow up on the recommendations from the Roadmap on the  NIS in Education.  ● Further develop an effective work process to involve more universities and certifications providers (NIS in  Education).  Description of tasks  The EU Cyber Security Strategy “An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace” suggests the development of a  roadmap for a “Network and Information Security driving licence” as a voluntary certification programme  to promote enhanced skills and competence of IT professionals. Based on this requirement ENISA has  carried out a consultation to involve the stakeholders and guide the drive for quality results released in  late 2014 in a roadmap report. It describes pilot courses, comparative curricula analysis and the main  message that e-skills and certifications are an essential path to follow.  ENISA is well equipped to further respond to this thematic challenge taking into consideration the  brokerage achieved in the NIS environment for example with NIS in education for the last 4 years. The  main objective of this work is to further provide brokerage services between stakeholders in order to  implement the recommendations from the roadmap with emphasis in areas of work where ENISA is active  already for a number of years and also where established collaborations with the academic community  (e.g. NIS in education) exist. At the same time during 2014 ENISA has developed a quiz to test user’s  knowledge of ENISA recommendations. In the course of 2015 ENISA will continue to build upon this basis  using the feedback received by the users.  ENISA will also support MS in their own decision making process, by providing advice and referencing the  appropriate ENISA studies in the area. This will be done on an on-demand basis.  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  36 37  4. Core operational activities  4.4.  SO3 – To assist the Member States and the Commission in developing  and implementing the policies necessary to meet the legal and regulatory  requirements of Network and Information Security  4.4.1. Overview  Justification  ENISA will continue to provide the Commission and the MS with high quality information, data and advice  to support policy making having an EU dimension.  In the area of privacy and data protection, ENISA will help the Commission and MS to move the privacy  and data protection debate towards implementation strategies and new business models, building on EU  data protection laws. We will provide feedback to those working on the legislative framework as to what  is feasible and what is not feasible from an operational perspective. The Agency will also identify existing  methods and tools that could be used to implement the proposals of the regulation and suggesting  which methods and tools could provide the best cost/benefit based on current operational experience.  In addition, ENISA will identify ‘gaps’, where current methods and tools do not fulfil the requirements of the  legal proposal.  Since its creation ENISA has tracked the development of standards in the area of Network and Information  Security, maintaining close contacts and collaboration with International Standardisation Organisations.  In 2015, the Agency will monitor NIS standards EU wide and globally. This approach enables ENISA to  keep its activities up-to-date with the latest developments as well as informing its stakeholders on new NIS  standardisation activities and to flag opportunities and/or risks as they develop. The collaboration with  CSCG will continue, with an aim to improving the links between Standardisation Organisations in the area  of NIS and industry and in particular EU SMEs.  Research and development will play a key role in deciding how successful the EU is in adapting to future  NIS and cyber security challenges. ENISA will continue to support such efforts by acting in an advisory role  to the Commission for future Frame Work Programmeme initiatives in this area. The strategic approach will  be to assist the Commission in selecting projects that are both aligned with the policy framework and  produce clear added value for the target stakeholder communities. ENISA will also continue to liaise with  academia and to provide a bridge between academic communities and its own stakeholder communities.  In the areas of interest to the ENISA  Work Programme the Agency will continue to collaborate with and to  support EU funded RandD projects (H2020). The main aim of this activity is to align the objectives of policy  initiatives in the area of NIS and the relevant EU funded RandD projects (H2020).  Specific Policy Context  Each work package description contains a section highlighting the specific policy context for the activities  foreseen.  The ECSM’2015 organisation follows up on the actions required in order to translate into practice the  principle of shared responsibility in NIS security, as stated in section 1.2 of the Cybersecurity Strategy: “All  relevant actors, whether public authorities, the private sector or individual citizens, need to recognise this  shared responsibility, take action to protect themselves and if necessary ensure a coordinated response to  strengthen cyber security.”  In addition, following the concept of shared NIS responsibility, ENISA will engage in 2015 in basic cyber  hygiene by the development of guidelines that will allow the web users (general public) to recognize and  use tools for online privacy and security. The ultimate scope will be the development of a citizens’ web  portal, listing existing up-to-date and trustworthy open source/freeware tools that will be easily applied  by the non-expert user who wishes to protect himself/herself online (ex. in web browsing, email, instant  messaging, e-payment systems, etc). The envisaged future deployment of such a portal will be a self- sustained platform of privacy tools supported, under ENISA’s auspices, by a greater online community of  privacy experts from different sectors (academia, Data Protection Authorities, NGOS, etc).  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Provide guidance and support for European Cyber-Security Month (dissemination material, Q4 2015).  D2: Basic Cyber hygiene: guidelines for recognizing and using trustworthy security and privacy products for  the general public (Q4/2015).  Stakeholder impact  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this work will be the EU citizens, targeted by different categories.  ENISA’s role will be to provide technical guidance on priorities and suitable subject matter and to promote  stakeholder involvement. These stakeholders are expected to reap the following benefits:  ● Receive targeted information on the security dimension in the use of ICTs.  ● Develop knowledge and corresponding ICT skills by being part of a best practice sharing community.  ● Improve and enhanced contacts with stakeholders of similar interests and profiles.  Resources  ● (see chapter 4.14)  Legal base and policy context  ● ENISA Regulation in particular 3.1.(c) (iv) and (v) supporting voluntary cooperation.  ● ENISA Stakeholder Strategy.  ● Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace – JOIN(2013) 1  final – 7/2/2013 (Section 2.1).  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  38 39  4. Core operational activities  4.4.3. WPK 3.1: Provide information and advice to support policy development  Desired Impact  ● Engage at least 5 key sector actors in launching and establishment of a forum that brings together  3 communities, namely: trust service providers from the EU Trusted List, conformity assessment bodies  and supervisory authorities. The degree of activity of the relevant key sector actors in the forum is of  importance to its success.  ● Validations by at least 5 representatives from different MS of the contribution to the implementation of  the Regulation on electronic identification and trusted services for electronic transactions.  Description of tasks  In order to remove existing barriers for cross-border e-ID based services, a new Regulation (914/2014)  on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market has been  published on the 28th August 2014. ENISA has contributed to the work on its implementing measures.  The new Regulation strengthens the provisions for interoperability and mutual recognition of electronic  identification schemes across borders, enhances current rules for electronic signatures and provides a  legal framework for other types of trust services.  ENISA has contributed to this area since 2013 by providing recommendations in the areas of:  ● Mechanisms for reporting security breaches by the trust service providers to the competent bodies.  ● Minimum security measures and good security practices for trust services providers.  ● Common audit schemes for trust services providers in MS.  In 2015 ENISA will continue to support activities in this field by the following actions:  ● Studying technological measures used by trust services.  ● Review and verification against the Regulation 910/2014 of definitions used in the context of TSPs in other  sources. This action will include clarification and specification of definitions used in the Regulation.  ● Review and evaluation of the technologies and standards related to TSPs and elDs (also developed  under mandate M-460 and in frame of the new Regulation).  ENISA in collaboration with the Commission will also launch the creation of a forum that brings together  3 communities, namely: trust service providers from the EU Trusted List, conformity assessment bodies and  supervisory authorities. A report on the establishment work of the forum of trust service providers, conformity  assessment bodies and supervisory authorities will be included as a separate section in the report of  WPK3.3 D3 of the APF’2015.  Finally, ENISA will collaborate with FESA in the area of exchange of information on the supervision of TSPs.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Analysis of standards related to eID and/or TSPs (Report, Q4/2015).  D2: Report analysing the terminology and definitions used by eIDAS (including recommended technological  means used by TSPs) (Report, Q4/2015).  Overall Goals  ● ENISA will continue to provide the Commission and the MS with high quality information, data and  advice to support policy making having an EU dimension.  ● The Agency will also take into consideration policy and legislative requirements that are not directly  related to cyber security, but which have a bearing on how cyber security principles are integrated.  ● ENISA will continue to support research and development by acting in an advisory role to the  Commission for future Frame Work Programmeme initiatives in this area.  ● ENISA will work together with the public sector, standards organisations and industry representatives to  identify ways for improving the process for agreeing on suitable NIS standards and for promoting their  uptake in a cross-border environment.  ● ENISA will continue its work on Privacy enhancing technologies.  4.4.2. Work Packages  The following work packages constitute this Strategic Objective:  WPK 3.1 – Provide information and advice to support policy development  This WPK aims at supporting work on regulation especially in the area of eID.  WPK 3.2 – Assist EU MS and Commission in the implementation of EU NIS regulations  This WPK aims at supporting EU MS in implementing regulation, especially in the area of reporting  according to Article 13a of the Telecoms Directive.  WPK 3.3 – Assist EU MS and Commission in the implementation of NIS measures of EU data protection  regulation  This WPK aims at supporting developing and implementing regulation in the area of Data Protection and  Privacy.  WPK 3.4 – RandD, Innovation and Standardisation  This WPK aims at supporting work on Standardisation (i.e. collaborating with standardisation bodies) and  Research and Development (especially in the area of H2020).  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  4140  4. Core operational activities  4.4.4. WPK 3.2: Assist EU MS and Commission in the implementation of EU NIS regulations  Desired Impact  ● By 2017, 12 MS make direct use of the outcomes of article 13 a work by explicitly referencing it or by  adopting it at nationally level.  ● By 2017, 10 MS implement recommendations by ENISA on implementing and enforcing article 4.  ● By 2017, 10 MS implement ENISA’s recommendations on article 15.  Description of tasks  This Work Package focuses on assisting regulatory authorities and Commission in the implementation of  EU regulations related to incident reporting. It builds on successful work done in this area for several years  namely in the area of article 13 a.  The main tasks of this Work Package are to support:  ● NRAs and EU MS on the implementation of Article 13a (security breach notification) and article 4  (personal data breach notification) and the development of synergies among the two.  ● NRAs and EU MS on the implementation of article 15 of new Regulation on electronic identification and  trusted services (eIDAS).  ● the Commission and MS on the implementation of the proposal for NIS Directive.  ENISA will continue collecting and analysing annual, national reports of security breaches from NRAs  in accordance with Article 13a of the Framework Directive on electronic communications. The Agency,  in co-operation with experts from NRAs and private sector (e.g. NIS Platform), will analyse the reports,  compare them with previous years, identify good practices and lessons learnt and where needed make  recommendations to NRAs and private sector to mitigate these threats in the future. Also the Agency will  assess the impact of incident reporting schemes (mostly art 13 a and art 4) from technical and socio- economic point of view. ENISA will identify lessons learnt, evaluate the value for money of such schemes  and issue recommendations for targeted stakeholders.  Additionally, ENISA will continue bringing NRAs, DPAs and the Commission together to agree on a  harmonised implementation of the security and data breach articles (art. 13a and art. 4). In that respect  the Agency will assess the two incident reporting schemes (article 13a and article 4), identify common  elements (e.g. parameters and thresholds) and propose to NRAs and DPAs the most harmonised and cost  efficient way of implementing the two articles avoiding at the same time potential overlaps. A harmonised  implementation of these articles will simplify the internal business processes of the affected private sector  and reduce the cost of compliance to them.  ENISA has already contributed to the area of electronic identification and trusted services (eIDAS) by  providing recommendations on incident reporting by the trust service providers to the competent bodies.  In 2015, ENISA will continue its efforts to bring together all relevant stakeholders from MS including  the competent regulatory bodies of MS and debate with them on the development of a consistent  implementation scheme/framework of article 15 and relevant minimum security measures. The Agency will  build on the work of FESA and relevant standardisation bodies (e.g. ETSI) and will expand it to cover all  relevant stakeholders. This work with ENISA’s support will properly define the scope of incident reporting,  Stakeholder impact  ● Supporting the implementation of the Regulation on electronic identification and trusted services, which  will enable the achievement of a harmonized market.  ● Supporting the EU MS on the provision of secure eGovernment services in all levels of public  administration.

WPK 3.3: Assist EU MS and Commission in the implementation of NIS measures of  EU data protection regulation  Desired Impact  ● At least 5 representatives from different MSs contributing to ENISA guidelines and best practice  recommendations regarding Privacy Enhancing Technologies.  ● At least 10 actors in the field validating the results of the studies.  ● More than 80 participants in APF’15 (researchers, policy makers and industry participants).  Description of tasks  In 2015, ENISA will intensify its efforts in the field of privacy and trust. The approach is three-fold:  Firstly, based on the outcome of the best practice guide for privacy enhancing technologies in 2014, the  readiness of the industry, as well as the public and private sectors for the adoption and evolution of  privacy technologies will be analysed. This will help to understand why in the current practice of web  services PETs are rarely used. Special attention will be paid to technologies for data minimization that still  allow for complex business models, e.g., privacy enhanced location based services. The report will study  the technical possibility as well as economic incentives which could help further market penetration of such  services.  Secondly, privacy enhancing technologies are mentioned in several policy documents, e.g., the draft data  protection regulation proposal. They are based on complex cryptographic building blocks. The security  of these building blocks is constantly challenged by new attacks. Furthermore, new building blocks are  invented by the research community. For system developers it is hard to keep track with this development. In  the past ENISA provided recommendations for algorithms and parameters of such building blocks. ENISA  will, in its work in this field, point to already established EU policies and processes.  Thirdly, emerging technologies in the areas of online information sharing, data merging and data mining  create new possibilities for the processing of personal data and, thus, new privacy risks. To this end, ENISA  will provide a state-of-the art analysis of the data protection threats, risks and protection measures in the  emerging big and open data landscape exploiting, as in the past, synergies between security technologies  and data protection. Data protection legislation more and more mentions technological protection  the parameters and thresholds as well as the affected services. It will also consider the requirements of  Article 7a of the eIDAS Regulation. The Agency will also try to exploit all possible implementation and  conceptual synergies with article 13a and article 4.  Subject to the approval of the NIS Directive, ENISA can assist the Commission and MS in the implementation  of the NIS Directive. In areas where the Agency is called for to take action it can develop the constituency,  debate about the scope and the key objectives of the actions, identify the key elements and players to  engage and facilitate in the implementation of the next steps by always leveraging existing knowledge  and expertise (e.g. incident reporting, minimum security measures, NCSS, exercises, etc.)  Outcomes and deadlines  D1 – Analysis of Annual 2014 Incident Reports (report) (Q3, 2015).  D2 – Recommendations on addressing root causes of specific incidents (report) (Q3, 2015).  D3 – Guidelines on Minimum Security Measures for Trusted Service Providers7 (workshops, report) (Q4, 2015).  D4 – Impact assessment on the effectiveness of incident reporting schemes (e.g. Art13a and Art 4);  (Q4, 2015).  D5 – Guidelines on Incident Reporting Scheme for Article 15 (report, Q4 2015).  Stakeholder impact  Telecommunications Sector  ● NRAs, DPAs and the EDPS will have practical references and technical guidelines to implement the  legislation.  ● Within the area of Article 13a, the industry, NRAs and the European Commission will be able to develop  a better understanding of the significant incidents at European level as well as a comparison with earlier  years and recommendations, which will support mitigation decisions and actions.  ● EU Commission (DG CONNECT, HOME and JUSTICE) will achieve harmonization of incident reporting,  breach notifications and security measures, following international standards and can in this way forego  further detailing of the legislative text.  ● Industry (network providers, ISPs, cloud providers, etc.) will be able to adopt a single framework of  incident reporting/breach notification and security measures, so there is a level playing field across the  EU countries and no complications for working cross borders.  Regulation on electronic identification and trusted services  ● NRAs and DPAs will be able to implement an efficient reporting scheme very similar to the Article 13a  scheme currently in place, and in this way lay the basis for a coherent and holistic picture of security  incidents across key service providers.  A single reporting scheme will allow trust service providers to more easily operate across borders,  effectively paving the road for a single market of trust service providers across the EU. In turn this facilitates  cross border online services, such as eCommerce and eGovernment.  7 In the next years work in this area will be extended to other market actors (in relation to the proposal for NIS Directive);  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  44 45  4.

WPK 3.4: R&D, Innovation and Standardisation  Desired Impact  ● Support at least 10 key sector actors involved in EU funded R&D programs (H2020) in the area of NIS in  defining priorities.  ● Engage at least 5 MS representatives from at least 3 MSs in the work of the ETSI CEN CENELEC Cyber  Security Coordination Group (CSCG).  ● Engage at least 5 MS representatives through at least 1 workshop organized in collaboration with the  research (H2020) and standardization communities.  Description of tasks  Since its creation ENISA tracks the development of standards in the area of Network and Information  Security maintaining close contacts and collaboration with International Standardisation Organisations.  In 2015, the Agency will monitor NIS standards EU wide and globally. This approach enables ENISA to  keep its activities up-to-date with the latest developments as well as informing its stakeholders on new NIS  standardisation activities and to flag opportunities and/or risks as they develop.  Since 2012 ENISA contributes actively to the creation and work of the ETSI CEN-CENELEC Cyber Security  Coordination Group (CSCG). This collaboration with CSCG will continue and ENISA will try to further exploit  synergies between CSCG and its  Work Programmeme. The Agency will also involve standards bodies in  the different work packages in as far as this is appropriate. In the context of the CSCG activities one of  the areas that further work is required is in improving the links between Standardisation Organisations in  the area of NIS and industry and in particular EU SMEs. ENISA will work in 2015 in identifying core set of  cybersecurity standards (comparing it against the relevant NIS policy developments).  In the areas of interest to the ENISA  Work Programme the Agency will continue to collaborate with and  to support EU funded R&D projects (H2020). The main aim of this activity is to align the objectives of policy  initiatives in the area of NIS and the relevant EU funded R&D projects (H2020). Such collaboration may be  in the form of:  mechanisms. The policy makers are partially aware of protection mechanisms whereas the research  community might lag on requirements legislation. ENISA will bring together policy makers, researchers and  data privacy practitioners to debate about the challenges of data protection and privacy. This would be in  the form of the third annual privacy forum.  In 2014 ENISA produced a report entitled “Indicative list of appropriate cryptographic protection measures”  aiming to support the Commission publication of an indicative list of measures in the light of Article 4 of  the EC regulation 611/2013. This report will be used by the Commission as a main reference document  for the publication of a list of appropriate technological protection measures pursuant to Article 4(3) of  Commission Regulation (EU) No 611/2013 (hereinafter referred to as the “List”). Based on the latest scientific  evidence at the moment of publication, technological breakthroughs may occur that compromise the  recommended protection measures. Therefore it is important that ENISA performs an annual review of  the aforementioned report with a view, among others, to keep the list up to date, pointing to already  established EU policies and processes. Such a report should serve as a reference material, with technical  protective measures for personal data, for the interested reader at MS level or in private sector. As was  the case in previous years, in the context of this work ENISA will collaborate with well recognised experts  in the field (also ensuring high quality peer reviews). In addition, ENISA will involve experts in the fields from  National Authorities (BSI, ANSSI, etc.).  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Readiness analysis for the adoption and evolution of privacy enhancing technologies (Q4 2015).  D2: Building blocks for PETs update (Q4 2015).  D3: Annual Privacy Forum 2015, APF’2015 (Q4 2015).  D4: State-of-the-art analysis of data protection in big data architectures (Q4 2015).  D5: 2015 edition of the annual report on ‘Indicative list of appropriate cryptographic protection measures’  (Q4 2015).  Stakeholder impact  ● Supporting the development of clear guidelines for service provider in the light of the new data  protection Regulation in close collaboration with DPAs, NRAs, Article 29 and EDPS, European Commission  (DG JUS, DG CONNECT and DG HOME), covering topics such privacy seals, personal data protection –  data security, etc.  ● Supporting the implementation of digital agenda, data protection Regulation for Industry Providers  (network operators, service providers) etc.  ● Harmonisation of practices regarding data security and data protection across MS and service  providers (i.e. minimum security requirements).

In this resolution the Council recognises the potential role of  ENISA to build a NIS scenario in Europe. It also underlines that the major goals of NIS are to support:  ‒ Security standards.  ‒ Raise awareness and good practices and guidance.  ‒ Serve as EU Centre of expertise in EU related Network and Information Security matters.  ● Commission proposes Action Plan to enable further growth of Security industry37 COM(2012) 417: The  COM has produced a “COMMISSION STAFF WORKING PAPER on Security Industrial Policy”38 SWD(2012)  233 final, and “COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE  COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE”39 COM(2012) 417 final. The  Commission proposes to create a true internal market for the security industry by inter alia:  ‒ harmonising standards and certification procedures for security technologies.  ‒ introducing checks on the societal impact of new security technologies at the research stage. To  reduce the gap between research and market, especially in European and international procurement,  the Commission will use novel funding schemes foreseen in Horizon 2020 such as Pre-commercial  Procurement, to test and validate results stemming from EU security research projects. This approach  should unite industry, public authorities and end users from the beginning of research projects. Border  security and aviation security are the most promising areas.  ‒ novel funding schemes such as Pre-commercial Procurement to test and validate results stemming  from EU security research projects.  ‒ The priority will be to overcome fragmentation of the EU security market, by harmonising standards  and certification procedures for security technologies. European standardisation organisations will  be asked to establish concrete and detailed standardisation roadmaps on the next generation of  technologies. In this context, to achieve mutual recognition of certification systems, the Commission  intends to issue two legislative proposals, to establish an EU wide harmonised certification system for  airport screening (detection) equipment, and an EU wide harmonised certification system for alarm  systems.  ‒ The Commission will introduce checks on the societal impact of new security technologies at the  research stage. In addition, the Commission will issue a mandate to European standardisation  organisations to develop a standard for the integration of privacy issues, from design to production  process phases.  ● Participation in the panel of reviewers that are supporting the Commission in reviewing the progress of a  project and steering the project’s future work.  ● Participation in the advisory/steering board of selective projects accepted by the Commission for funding.  Obviously ENISA may contribute to only a small number of projects. In this context, emphasis will be  given to the areas of important to the ENISA  Work Programme as presented in this document.  ● Contributions to the various consultations launched by the Commission in the areas of interest to ENISA.  Such consultations may be conducted in the context of setting the research priorities for future calls for  proposals or in the context policy initiatives launched or about to be launched by the Commission.  As was the case in previous years, ENISA will continue to support the Commission by providing experts at  the evaluations of the calls of proposals that are published in the context EU funded R&D programs. In this  context, emphasis will be given to the areas of important to the ENISA  Work Programme as presented in  this document. It should be envisaged that ENISA may contribute up to 2 experts for the evaluation of calls  of proposals during 2015.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Good Practice Guide for aligning Policy, Industry and Research (Q4/2015).  D2 Standardisation Gaps in Cyber Security (Q4/2015).  D3: Guide to standardisation for the SME Community (Q4 2015).  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  48 49  4. Core operational activities  4.5.3. WPK 4.1: Support for EU cooperation initiatives amongst NIS–related communities in the  context of the EU CSS  Desired Impact  ● At least 2 new operational communities will be identified and contacted for the purpose of identifying  a mutually satisfactory ways to collaborate (CERTs, LEA, EU Financial service, Data Protection, CIIP  community, etc.)  ● By 2016, at least 15 MS are familiar with practices in addressing different sector regulation challenges of  managing cyber security issues.  Description of tasks  This WPK deals with leveraging on the good experiences ENISA made in supporting the CERTs, the CERT  communities and Law Enforcement communities to find mutually satisfactory ways to collaborate.  ENISA will develop and provide guidance based on best practice for cooperation between key  stakeholder communities (CERTs, CIIP community, Law Enforcement, Financial Services; Data Protection, etc.).  The Agency will continue its work and support of the TRANSITS training in the area of CERTs in order to build  communities through a ‘learning by doing’ approach. ENISA will also continue to support the collaboration  between CERT and law enforcement communities, based on the recent policy and technical developments  in this area in MS. This work will include a close collaboration with other institutions which are active in this  field, namely the EC3. Activities agreed upon in the collaboration agreement between ENISA and EC3  will be further developed, for example in the area of encouraging more operational and systematic flows  of information between CERTs and law enforcement communities, the exchange of specific knowledge  and expertise, elaboration of general situational reports, reports resulting from strategic analyses and best  practice, strengthening capacity building through training and awareness raising in order to safeguard  network and information security at EU level. For better coordination and in order to avoid overlaps ENISA  will stay engaged in the EC3 programme board. The very well established, commonly organised ENISA- EC3 workshop will be continued.  To achieve this, previous work will be leveraged (where applicable) and experiences made will be used  to reach out to other communities, for the purpose of supporting CERTs to collaborating with them, and  helping them build up their capabilities. Emphasis will be given to the cross border collaboration aspects.  Where possible, synergies with other ENISA collaboration- and community-supporting efforts like the NIS  platform will be extended and, where needed, developed.  4.5.  SO4 – To enhance cooperation both between the Member States of the EU and  between related NIS communities  4.5.1. Overview  Justification  The work packages in this area are designed to enhance cooperation between MS and NIS communities.  ENISA will continue in its efforts to build up targeted NIS communities to meet policy goals. In some cases  (e.g. The NIS Platform, as referenced by the EU Cyber Security Strategy), ENISA will support other institutions  in creating such communities, whilst in other areas it will seek to build such communities itself when  requested to do so by the Commission or the MS.  In the area of exercises, ENISA continues to support the MS in ‘learning by doing’. Since the inception of  this stream of work in 2010 the pan-European exercise has moved to increasing levels of sophistication.  In 2015 ENISA will facilitate the planning of the next pan European Cyber Exercise efforts, initiating the  planning process for Cyber Europe 2016 and organising focused exercises, such as communications  checks etc. In addition, the Agency will further enhance its methodology, seminars, trainings and technical  capabilities on the organisation and management of large-scale cyber crisis exercises.  Specific Policy Context  Each work package description contains a section highlighting the specific policy context for the activities  foreseen.  Overall Goals  ● ENISA will continue in its efforts to build up targeted NIS communities to meet policy goals. In some  cases (e.g. The NIS Platform, as referenced by the EU Cyber Security Strategy), ENISA will support other  institutions in creating such communities, whilst in other areas it will seek to build such communities itself  when requested to do so by the Commission or the MS.  ● ENISA will build on the work it has carried out in the area of the pan-European exercise, the EU-US  exercise and support of the TRANSITS training in the area of CERTs in order to build communities through  a ‘learn by doing’ approach.  4.5.2.

ENISA will follow up to any decision taken by its Management Board and facilitate the actual planning of the exercise with representatives  (planners) from the involved parties (EU MS and US).  Pan-European cyber-exercises management  In 2014, ENISA organised the third pan-European cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2014 (CE2014) was  more ambitious than previous efforts, e.g., technical depth, scenarios, stakeholders involved, objectives,  procedures to be tested, complexity etc. The exercise lasted until the end of 2014. In 2015 ENISA will  perform an in depth analysis of the evaluation data gathered from the exercise. This will result in the  detailed evaluation report that will be shared with the participating countries.  In addition, in 2015 ENISA will facilitate the planning of the next pan European Cyber Exercise efforts,  initiating the planning process for Cyber Europe 2016 and organising focused exercises, such as  communications checks etc. The lessons learned from CE2014 will help to draw the roadmap for the next  exercise Cyber Europe 2016.  Enhance the capacity to support and organise cyber exercises  ENISA will further enhance its methodology, seminars, trainings and technical capabilities on the  organisation and management of large-scale cyber crisis exercises.  The Agency will continue enhancing its capabilities for managing complex, distributed exercises, by building  on previous efforts in tools and methods and by facilitating strategic partnerships. The maintenance and  improvement of the Cyber Exercise Platform (CEP) will be one of the main tasks.  EU-US cyber security exercise  In 2014 ENISA supported the Commission and the MS in their efforts towards planning an EU-US cyber  security exercise. The effort was focused mainly on exploratory discussions between involved parties: the  Commission, EU MS and the US.  In 2015, ENISA will continue to support the efforts in the area of pan-European exercises and will prepare  initial background work analysing the options for a potential EU-US cyber exercise that would be  proposed at EU political level and submit to the ENISA Management Board for decision. ENISA will follow  up to any decision taken by its Management Board and facilitate the actual planning of the exercise  with representatives (planners) from the involved parties (EU MS and US). If the exercise is decided by the  Management Board, after it is conducted ENISA will support the production of an after-action report.  Promote, maintain and improve EU cyber-crisis cooperation plans and procedures (e.g., EU SOPs),  including bringing closer the cyber crisis cooperation community  ENISA will continue to support MS in the maintenance and training of operational procedures for cyber  crisis cooperation. ENISA will analyse the EU cross border cyber crisis cooperation procedures and plans,  given the inputs from previous efforts, such as cyber exercises, reports such as the work of the ECCCF  working group, etc. Also ENISA will continue to consult with all EU MS on the actions, plans and tools  needed for improving the cross border cooperation and will also propose mechanisms for a possible  implementation, closely involving MS.  ENISA will continue the effort to bring the cyber crisis cooperation community closer in order increase the  trust building the potential synergies. To that end in 2015 ENISA will organise the next event in the series of  the International Conferences on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises.  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  54 55  4. Core operational activities  4.9. Corporate Communication  To be effective, ENISA needs to communicate the findings and recommendations of its documented output  to a wide range of stakeholders across Europe. In 2015, the focus of corporate communications will be on  increasing the outreach and impact through media relations, agency branding, marketing advocacy, and  web communications, to help ensure that ENISA’s work reaches the right audiences and has a real impact  in making Europe’s information society even more secure.  In addition to its annual High Level Event in Brussels, the Agency will continue to progressively build  digital relations with all EU MS relevant authorities, as to make the cooperation even closer in terms of  communicating results across Europe, and being a hub of exchange of the latest reports that are useful for  other EU MS.  The Agency will continue developing various tools and channels such as info graphics, the web site, social  media, and social networking, videos.  4.10. Dissemination activities  Dissemination activities are the responsibility of the project managers, who will work closely with the NLO  contact point and the spokesman.  4.11. Quality Management System and Project Office  The Quality Management System (QMS) of the Agency aims at responding to a mix of regulatory and  stakeholder requirements in an effort to improve organisational performance and compliance. Scheduled  annual activities associated with the promulgation and maintenance of standard operating procedures  (SOP) and a methodology, support the operational processes of the Agency. The primary goal of the QMS  is to improve performance across the Agency, while reducing operational costs and enhancing stakeholder  satisfaction. The methodology is based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, and it features SMART goals  and KPIs. Change management is carried out by the process owners and the Quality Control Advisor.  In 2015 the Agency will re-engineer selected operational processes, align organisational requirements with  actual implementation and pursue process improvements across the board. Measuring the performance  of recently designed processes, e.g. the ENISA Project Management Guide, for the purpose of proposing  suitable adjustments will be a priority. A risk assessment methodology will be implemented for Agency-wide  risks. A set of tools such as electronic signatures, electronic workflows and enterprise resource management  tools are likely to be further integrated to facilitate collaboration. Regular presentations and updates are  made available to provide guidance and promote the performance of the quality management system.  ENISA will also create a project office in COD in order to better coordinate the increasing number of  activities that cut across a number of operational areas within the Department. Such activities include the  preparation of briefings on global issues and coordinating the coherence of recommendations across  the Department.  4.6. Management Board, Executive Board and PSG Secretariat  This covers all activities that are required to support ENISA’s formal bodies, the Management Board (MB)  and the Permanent Stakeholders Group (PSG) as well as Executive Board in their functions.  For the MB, ordinary meeting will be organised during 2015 and informal meetings will be held, one  with the PSG, if appropriate. The existing electronic newsletter will be continued throughout 2015, as will  support for the MB Portal. For the PSG also, two formal meetings will be organised.  For the Executive Board, formal meetings will be organised during 2015.  ENISA will continue to explore additional ways of supporting the Agency’s statutory bodies in the most  effective way, including the possible use of new technologies and modifications to existing processes as  required.  4.7. National Liaison Officer Network  Since 2014, ENISA has initiated a number of activities with the aim to strengthen cooperation within the  National Liaison Officers’ (NLO) Network. NLOs are key actors for the Agency’s daily work and interaction,  assuring in terms of outreach effective liaison to the MS and dissemination of ENISA activities. It expands  the NLO-Network with contact points from governmental and public agencies/organisations (e.g. CERTs  and Regulatory Bodies/Agencies, etc.).  In 2015, ENISA will build upon these efforts and improve its cooperation with the NLO Network, the first  Point of Contact for ENISA in the MS. In particular, the Agency will continue working on the following  actions:  ● An NLO meeting will be organised (possibly in conjunction with a MB meeting) where possible  improvements of the collaboration will be discussed.  ● Information will be send to the members of the NLO network at regular intervals on upcoming ENISA  project related tenders, vacancy notices, and events organised by ENISA or where the Agency  contributes to (for example co-organiser, etc.).  ● Organisation of at least one Ad hoc meeting on a specific topic of interest that will be identified in  collaboration with the NLOs.  ● Maintaining an information dbase containing all relevant information on active ENISA project (e.g. unit  responsible for the project, relevant tender results, etc.).  4.8. EU Relations  The Agency will carry out the bulk of its EU relations work with the statutory stakeholders; Commission,  EU Parliament, Council (working groups) and MS, by using senior management for developing relations.  This approach will take due account of the management structure of the Agency so that the level of  participation in any particular meeting is appropriate. A similar approach is taken for speaking  engagements.  In general, contacts at the highest level will be managed by the ED with the Heads of Department as  backups depending on the subject to be discussed.

Core operational activities  5.2. Administration and Support Department  The Administration and Support Department (ASD) consists of Finance, Accounting and Procurement Unit  (FAP), Human Resources Section (HR), IT Unit (ITU), and the team supporting the Department.  The Administration and Support Department is responsible for ensuring that the management of the Agency  is in line with the regulatory framework established by the competent EU Institutions, the Management  Board, and the Executive Director. The regulatory framework is composed of the Financial Regulation and  the Staff Regulations and their respective implementing rules, as well as administrative procedures, the  internal control framework and other control mechanisms put in place to ensure compliance with the rules.  The ASD monitors the Agency control and risk framework. Constant upgrading of the internal systems and  revision of the operating standards set the grounds for continuous optimisation of the internal processes  and procedures. Benchmarking with other organisations, as well as recommendations of the European  Court of Auditors and the Internal Audit Service are used as internal performance indicators and relevant  possibilities of improvement are considered.  The Head of ASD develops the Agency strategy for the Administration and Support activities in line with  the  Work Programme and with the required compliance with the above mentioned bodies and rules.  He is also the main contact point as regards administrative matters, with external stakeholders such as  European Commission Services and DG’s, European Parliament, Council, ENISA Executive Board, ENISA  Management Board, Hellenic Authorities, etc. The Head of Department is supported by the Legal Officer  and two assistants who also support the Units in the Department.  5.3.

Activity Based Budget (ABB)  The  Work Programmeme 2015 activities consist of well-defined actions to which resources are allocated  and converted into outcomes. Core activities are those aiming to creating the impact in the core field  of NIS, required by the Regulation of ENISA and interpreted in the current Policy and Legal context.  Administration and Support Activities, on the other hand, aim to provide strategic and overall management  orientations, support the core activities with infrastructure and competence, and ensure compliance with  the regulatory framework.  The purpose of ABB is to ensure that resource allocation is consistent with the activities of the Agency, as  described in the annual WP.  To this regard, resources engaged in Administration and Support Activities are re-allocated to Core  and Horizontal Operational Activities in a way that the effort and the respective human resources costs  engaged to the support of the Operational Activities (e.g. procurement procedures to award a contracts  related to a WPK/Deliverables) are attributed to the latter.  While the European Commission job screening methodology used for benchmarking resources employed  across EU Agencies is looking at human resources allocated to functions and gives weight to job profiles  and descriptions (Operational, Neutral, Administration), the ABB concept allocates the Administrative and  Support resources according to their contribution to the Agency’s work. Therefore the figures in table 5.4  refer to the Administration and Support resources necessary to ensure the smooth operation of the Agency,  with focus to the strategic as well as day to day management of the Agency and compliance to the legal  and regulatory framework (e.g. risk management, internal controls, engagement with European Court of  Auditors and Internal Audit Service, statutory reporting).  10 Remark: Full time equivalents (FTE) and costs of activities are reported on Activity Based Budget basis – see section 5.5  5.3.4. ASA 3 Human Resources  The activities of Human Resources section (HR) consist in managing rights and obligations of ENISA Staff,  recruitment and training.  ● Management of Individual staff Rights and Obligations, according to the stipulations of the Staff  Regulation (SR).  ● Recruitment procedures.  ● Entitlements and leave management.  ● Drafting Internal HR Policies and Implementing Rules of the SR.  ● Medical Services and Health in work environment.  ● Training plan and career development.  ● Management of Interim services.  ● Work environment and welfare.  5.3.5. ASA 4 Information and Communication Technology  IT Unit delivers quality IT systems and services to the Agency, across its two fully functional offices, as well as  to a highly mobile user-base. The IT team uses ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) Framework as a source of good  practise in service management. Both human and financial resources are organised according to ITIL, as  shown in the table below.  The IT team also provides infrastructure services for operational systems, e.g. Cyber Exercise Platform.  The activities of IT include help desk, operations and monitoring, services management and infrastructure  management, solutions and development. Activities have been aligned with ITIL, including budget lines,  as follows:  ● Service Strategy and Development.  ● Service Transition.  ● Service Security.  ● Service Operations.  ● Services External.  ● Service Support.  5.3.6.

In this section, key goals are set for each core priority for  the period 2015-2017.  1.2.2 Core operational activities 2015  This section presents the core activities for 2015. Budget and resources are presented at the work package  level in section 4.14 and deliverables are summarised in section 4.15.  1.2.3 Administration and Support Department, Directorate and General management activities  This section of the document summarises the activities of the Administration and Support Department (ASD)  and the Executive Director. Budget and resources requirements are also identified here.  1.3 Key Performance Indicators and Key Impact Indicators  The terms Key Performance Indicator (KPI) and Key Impact Indicator (KII) are defined as follows:  Key performance indicators (KPIs) are quantifiable metrics used to evaluate objectives to reflect the  performance of an organisation. KPIs measure the agency’s performance during the budgetary/fiscal year.  KPIs differ depending on the nature of the organisation. Different layers and dimensions should be taken  into consideration. KPIs can constitute both quantitative and qualitative measures; however, the most useful  and common types are quantitative based. These include amongst others a focus on metrics such as  number of MS targeted, and number of hits to the website etc.  Key impact indicators (KIIs) are indicators used to evaluate long-term performance and eventually linked to  the strategy foundation stone of an organisation.  In this  Work Programmeme document, the Agency proposes a number of Key Impact Indicators for each  work package. Measuring the subsequent impact however is a difficult and time-consuming activity, due  to the fact that the impact of ENISA’s work on its stakeholder communities is often indirect and involves a  number of intermediate parties in the implementation process. This is particularly true for those deliverables  which essentially propose recommendations to various stakeholders (these are ENISA studies).  1. Introduction  1.1 Introduction  This document consists of two major components:  ● A multi-annual planning for the years 2015 to 2017.  ●  The ENISA  Work Programmeme for 2015.  The multi-annual planning has been derived from the ENISA Strategy document, which has been developed  together with the ENISA Management Board. As such, the planning is based on four strategic objectives  (which are presented in section 3.1). This approach ensures that future ENISA  Work Programmemes reflect  the strategic objectives of the Agency.  The  Work Programmeme itself reflects the conclusions of the ENISA Management Board meeting of  November 2013 with some minor adjustments for consistency and to facilitate smooth implementation,  the results of the meetings of the ad-hoc working group on 27.02.2014 and 21.05.2014 and the comments  made during the Management Board editorial meeting held on 11.09.14.

Strategic objectives and multi-annual planning  4.2.  SO1 – To develop and maintain a high level of expertise of EU actors taking into  account evolutions in Network and Information Security (NIS)  4.2.1. Overview  Justification  Ensuring adequate levels of protection for modern IT systems in any context requires recognising and  adapting to changes in the evolving threat environment. Whilst it is clearly not possible to foresee all future  threats (security practices have often been dramatically changed as a result of so called ‘black swan’  events, which are notoriously difficult to predict), it is possible to predict the evolution of certain threats with  a reasonable degree of accuracy based on past data.  The Agency will support the MS and the Commission in their efforts to improve CIIP by fostering a common  approach across the MS and by ensuring that good practice and lessons learnt are shared and properly  deployed in an effective manner. The Agency will work with the MS, the Commission and the private sector  in capacity building across the EU. In particular, the Agency will support the development of voluntary  baseline security requirements for CIIP sectors and harmonise efforts in the area of mandatory incident  reporting taking under consideration existing national and international frameworks (e.g. NIST). The  approach will not be limited to securing Internet related services, but will take into consideration other  networks and services as appropriate. This is also an area in which public private partnership is likely to  bring significant gains and ENISA will continue to support this approach.  Where technology is concerned, information security has traditionally been viewed as an approach for  securing the interaction of people, process and technology. Of these three factors, it is mainly technological  evolution that impacts the way in which people’s behaviour and process change. A large part of modern  information security therefore boils down to adapting current methods to emerging technologies, and  business models.  As a centre of excellence and expertise in the field of NIS, ENISA will use the expertise of its staff to advise  its’ stakeholders about trends in the digital world that affect security and to suggest good practices to  be taken in order to successfully mitigate the associated risks at an early stage of end-user adoption. In  particular, ENISA will seek to identify the consequences of deploying new technologies and approaches in  order to enable the opportunities that such developments bring to be realised.  Specific Policy Context  Each work package description contains a section highlighting the specific policy context for the activities  foreseen.  Overall Goals  Ensuring adequate levels of protection for modern IT systems in any context requires recognising and  adapting to changes in the evolving threat environment. Whilst it is clearly not possible to foresee all  future threats it is possible to predict the evolution of certain threats with a reasonable degree of accuracy  based on past data.  ● ENISA can support its stakeholders by compiling existing data on threat evolution and tailoring this data  to the needs of specific stakeholder communities.  4. Core operational activities  4.1 Introduction  From 2015 onwards ENISAs core operational activities are aligned with the strategic objectives from the  strategy and the multi annual planning. The strategic objectives effectively replace the structure of “work  streams (WS)” from previous years and are as follows:  ● SO1: To develop and maintain a high level of expertise of EU actors taking into account evolutions in  Network and Information Security (NIS).  ● SO2: To assist the Member States and the Commission in enhancing capacity building throughout the EU.  ● SO3: To assist the Member States and the Commission in developing and implementing the policies  necessary to meet the legal and regulatory requirements of Network and Information Security.  ● SO4: To enhance cooperation both between the Member States of the EU and between related NIS  communities.  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  2120  4. Core operational activities  Description of tasks  The main goal of this work package is to develop the current cyber threat landscape. This information is  important in the identification of NIS gaps and security needs for a wide spectrum of stakeholders.  The agency will collect, collate and analyse existing publicly available material on threats, risks, and trends  in NIS and emerging technologies application areas. Non publicly available material can be given to  ENISA via relevant stakeholders (e.g. NLOs). The data will be used for developing the annual ENISA Threat  Landscape Report. In this process, ENISA will seek contributions from relevant stakeholders to enhance  quality, accuracy and speed of assessed information. As was the case for the ENISA reports of previous  years ENISA will use the ENISA Threats Landscape Stakeholders forum (with participation by the CERT-EU,  EU institutions, national agencies, etc.) to support this activity and seek input.  In addition, in this work package ENISA will identify two emerging technology/application areas and  perform detailed threat and risk assessments. The emerging technology/application areas will be crucial for  society and the economy in the coming 2-4 years. Examples will be from sectors like internet infrastructures,  banking and finance, health, transport, energy and public administration and could cover areas like  Software Defined Networks or Security of mobile networks (“Mobile Security”). Such areas will be identified  from the emerging technology trends but also from assessed threat trends. Hence, their importance for  security and privacy will be considered a given.  In both areas of work ENISA will identify and consult with relevant stakeholder communities. The Agency will  co-operate with stakeholders on improving its data collection framework, on analysing the collected data  and on performing the sectorial risk assessments.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Annual Threat Analysis/Landscape Report (Q4, 2015).  D2: Risk Assessment on two emerging technology/application areas (Q4, 2015).  ● The collection and analysis of security data is an important part of ENISA’s existing mandate and is not  limited to incident-related data. It is the intention of the Agency to develop this capacity in the future,  both for data describing security incidents and other data that could be of use to MS in order to  improve MS understanding of the NIS trends.  ● ENISA will assist the Commission and MS in defining and implementing a framework for training  professionals in NIS to meet the requirements of industry at all levels. The goal will be to align training  goals with career paths for security professionals and to provide a more global background in NIS for  professionals in other areas.  4.2.2. Work Packages  The following work packages constitute this Strategic Objective:  WPK 1.1 – NIS Threats Analysis  This WPK main goal is to develop the current cyber threat landscape. This information is important in the  identification of NIS gaps and security needs for a wide spectrum of stakeholders.  WPK 1.2 – Improving the Protection of Critical Information Infrastructures  In this WPK ENISA aims at providing advice and assistance on request to targeted stakeholders of Critical  Information Infrastructures (CIIs).  WPK 1.3 – Securing emerging Technologies and Services  This WPK aims to develop good practices on emerging smart infrastructures and services and work with  relevant stakeholders to deploy them at an early stage of adoption.  WPK 1.4 – Short- and mid-term sharing of information regarding issues in NIS  This WPK aims at defining and implementing a framework that will allow the Agency to provide timely and  high quality responses to NIS developments.  4.2.3. WPK 1.1: NIS Threats Analysis  Desired Impact  ● Engage 10 public and 10 private stakeholders in the Threat Analysis/Landscape process. These  stakeholder should participate in the validation of the work.  ● Engage 10 public and 10 private stakeholders in the risk assessment of each emerging technologies/ sector. These stakeholder should participate in the validation of the work.  ● 5 MS use by 2016 ENISA’s Threat Analysis/Landscape process in their national risk management processes.  ● 10 private stakeholders use by 2016 ENISA’s Threat Analysis/Landscape process in their corporate risk  management processes.  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  22 23  4. Core operational activities  4.2.4. WPK 1.2: Improving the protection of Critical Information Infrastructures  Desired Impact  ● By 2017, 8 MS use ENISA’s findings and good practices in their national CIIP strategies. engaging 8  public and 8 private stakeholders (ISP, IXPs, Telcos) in the development of the methodology on internet  interconnections.  ● By 2016, 5 MS use ENISA’s government cloud good practices on in their national strategy.  ● 5 MS and 5 private stakeholders use ENISA’s recommendations on finance in their corporate/national  risk assessment and management approach.  ● 5 MS and 5 private stakeholders use ENISA’s recommendations on eHealth in their corporate/national  risk assessment and management approach.  Description of tasks  In this work package ENISA aims at providing advice and assistance on request to targeted stakeholders  of Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs).  More specifically ENISA will take stock of MS policies, regulations and strategies including international  frameworks (e.g. US NIST) and identify gaps related to CIIs. The Agency will co-operate with public  and private stakeholders to identify good practices, collect and analyse requirements and issue  recommendations for improving the way MS address the protection of CIIs.  In the area of Internet Interconnections, ENISA will continue developing its methodology for the identification  of critical communication networks, links, and components. ENISA will consider existing outputs from  projects and initiatives on the security and resilience of Internet interconnections. In co-operation with ISPs  and other public stakeholders ENISA will validate the methodology and develop a maturity assessment  mechanism. This mechanism would allow MS themselves to assess their situation within their borders. The  Agency will also assess whether this methodology can be extended to other CIIs and work with targeted  stakeholders to customise it to their needs and requirements.  In the area of ICS-SCADA security, ENISA will co-operate with EuroScsie and other related expert groups to  take stock of and analyse the cyber security maturity levels in critical sectors (e.g. transport, energy, water  supply, etc.). Using ENISA’s work (among others) policy makers in MS and EU Institutions can create the right  secure framework for the implementation and deployment of more efficient IC-SCADA systems. Through  co-operation with the public and private sector ENISA will identify, share and develop good practices,  information on gaps in policies, as well as regulations and strategies at national as well as EU level. The  Agency will continue promoting its work on the security of ICS-SCADA devices.  In the area of Smart Grids, ENISA will continue its work on minimum security measures and national  governance security models of Smart Grids. The Agency will promote its existing minimum security measures  and further co-operate with public and private stakeholders to improve their existing security governance  models for Smart Grids. It should be noted that smart grid area covers more than ICS; so for this activity  more areas are considered: smart cities, smart energy etc. ENISA will also continue contributing to DG  ENER’s Smart Grid Task Force and all relevant EU initiatives (e.g. CEN/CENELEC/ETSI, ERNCIP, DENSEK, etc.).  Finally the Agency will contribute to national and EU efforts (e.g. SOGIS) related to better alignment of  certification policies and strategies at EU level. Such alignment would remove barriers across EU MS and  allow European industry to become more competitive and innovative.  Stakeholder impact  The primary beneficiaries of this work package will be policy makers and organisations from public and  private sectors, who will receive integrated and consolidated information about the European NIS threat  landscape and how it is evolving:  ● Public and private organisations will be able to use the ENISA Threat Landscape in their own risk and  threat assessment in order to develop more effective security strategies, thus improving their Return of  Security Investment (ROSI).  ● EU Commission DG CONNECT will be able to use the ENISA output to adjust the scope of their RandD  related activities.  Public and private organisations may capitalise on the ENISA output to propose innovative RandD activities,  products or services.  Resources  ● (see chapter 4.14)  Legal base and policy context  ● ENISA regulation, article 3, particularly 3.1.(b) and 3.1.(c).  ● Commission proposes Action Plan to enable further growth of Security industry2 COM(2012) 417:  The Commission has produced a “COMMISSION STAFF WORKING PAPER on Security Industrial  Policy”3 SWD(2012) 233 final, and “COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN  PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE”4 COM(2012)  417 final. The Commission proposes to create a true internal market for the security industry by inter alia:  ‒ introducing checks on the societal impact of new security technologies at the research stage. To  reduce the gap between research and market, especially in European and international procurement,  the Commission will use novel funding schemes foreseen in Horizon 2020 such as Pre-commercial  Procurement, to test and validate results stemming from EU security research projects. This approach  should unite industry, public authorities and end users from the beginning of research projects. Border  security and aviation security are the most promising areas.  ‒ novel funding schemes such as Pre-commercial Procurement to test and validate results stemming  from EU security research projects.  ● COUNCIL RESOLUTION, 18/12/ 2009, on a collaborative European approach to Network and  Information Security, (2009/C 321/01)5. In this resolution the Council recognises the potential role of  ENISA to build a NIS scenario in Europe. It also underlines that the major goals of NIS are to support:  ‒ Quality of Information handling.  ‒ Collection of statistical data on NIS in MS and EU institutions.  ‒ Raise awareness and good practices and guidance.  EU policy development and implementation support to European Commission and MS, bridging gap  between technology and policy, and following EU priorities.  2 http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newsroom/cf/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=6117andlang=enandtpa_id=0andtitle=Security-industry%3A-Commission-proposes- programme-to-enable-further-growth-  3 ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/security/files/commission_staff_working_paper_-_security_industrial_policy_-_com(2012)_417_final_en.pdf  4 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0417:FIN:EN:PDF  5 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:321:0001:0004:EN:PDF  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  24 25  4. Core operational activities  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Stock Taking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIs (Q3, 2015).  D2: Methodology for the identification of Critical Communication Networks, Links, and Components  (Q4, 2015).  D3: Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security of Devises in Critical Sectors (Q4, 2015).  D4: Recommendations and Good Practices for the use of Cloud Computing in the area of Finance Sector  (Q4, 2015).  D5: Good Practices and Recommendations on resilience and security of eHealth Infrastructures and  Services (Q4, 2015).  Stakeholder impact  ● Cloud Computing  ‒ A number of governmental clouds are being set-up. A single framework for governmental cloud  computing, (1) allows MS to share and exchange knowledge on best-practices, (2) allows providers to  cater for different MS more easily, without having to adjust the cloud technology to different requests  in different countries, ultimately lowering the costs, (3) allows MS to move computing workloads to  other countries in failover and backup scenarios.  ‒ By setting a single set of security requirements for procurement by public sector across the EU, the  MS can improve procurement of cloud computing in the private sector as well, making it more easy  for SMEs to procure cloud computing services in line with national security requirements, and also to  procure cloud computing services across the EU’s single digital market.  ● Finance  ‒ Banks would benefit from having an independent analysis and set of guidelines about inter-banking  communications and transactions.  ‒ Industry would be able to use a neutral, not vendor specific discussion platform with an improved  exchange of good security and resilience practices in the area of telecommunications.  ● Smart Grids and ICS-SCADA  ENISA’s recommendations on minimum security measures for smart grids are expected to provide all the  relevant stakeholders with a tool for:  ‒ Allying of the varying levels of security and resilience of the market operators with a consistent  minimum framework.  ‒ Providing an indication of a minimum level of security and resilience in the MS, by avoiding the  creation of the “weakest link”.  ‒ Ensuring a minimum level of harmonisation on security and resilience requirements across MS and  thus reducing compliance and operational costs.  ‒ Setting the basis for a minimum auditable framework of controls across Europe.  ‒ Facilitating the establishment of common preparedness, recovery and response measures and paving  the way for mutual aid assistance across operators during crisis.  ‒ Contributing to achieve an adequate level of transparency in the internal market.  In the area of cloud computing, ENISA will actively contribute to EU Commission’s EU Cloud Computing  Strategy by delivering targeted advice on cyber security matters (e.g. certification, minimum security  measures, procurements, SLAs and others). The Agency will continue its work in the area of governmental  clouds, assist MS to develop their national governmental strategy and deploy ENISA’s good practice  guide. ENISA will also work with public and private sector to widely promote its work on the certification  of cloud computing components and services. The Agency aims at establishing ENISA’s meta certification  framework as the key model used by the users, SMEs and leading players in the market. ENISA does not  aim at developing an EU wide certification scheme, but just a mapping scheme that would allow cloud  users to select the most appropriate, existing certification scheme fitting their needs. That would especially  help SMEs to select the most sophisticated offer from the market.  In the area of finance, ENISA, through consultation with public and private stakeholders, will identify policy,  technical and regulatory barriers and challenges for using cloud, either as an infrastructure or as a service,  in the finance sector. The Agency will issue recommendations for policy makers, EU MS and industry to  mitigating the barriers and challenges. Aiming at removing such barriers ENISA will help the EU industry to  become more competitive and innovative. Also the Agency will consult with public and private stakeholders  to better understand the security and privacy challenges related with third party payments providers.  Finally in the area of eHealth, ENISA will identify all relevant public and private stakeholders, engage them  in a working group to take stock and assess the security and resilience of major eHealth infrastructures and  services. The Agency will then develop good practices and recommendations for policy makers, industry  and EU MS on the resilience and security of eHealth infrastructures and services.

WPK 1.4: Short- and mid-term sharing of information regarding issues in NIS  Desired Impact  ● Improve information flows between the CERT EU, ENISA and the CERT community.  ● Provide timely information to stakeholders, e.g. CISO, CIO level, in a coordinated manner.  Description of tasks  The objective of this work package is to define and implement a framework that will allow the Agency to  provide timely and high quality responses to NIS developments. In cases of NIS issues and occurrences  that reach a certain level of public and media attention it is crucial, that the Agency can give sufficient  information and, where appropriate, guidelines for dealing with the issue in very short time. Such guidelines  will not address immediate response, but will concentrate on medium to long term preparatory measures.  Also through ability to provide an ad-hoc news items with opinions and advice on relevant NIS issues  (called “Flash Notes”) the Agency will have a relevant and appreciated form of “added value by outreach”.  For each area ENISA will identify relevant public and private stakeholders, engage them at the operational  level making sure that the timing of the information flow meets their needs.  Over the last years ENISA’s news items with opinions and advice on relevant NIS issues (called “Flash  Notes”) proved to be a relevant and appreciated form of “added value by outreach” for the Agency. It is  ENISA’s intention to continue to provide these notes as a reliable and continuous service to its stakeholders  by identifying “Flash Notes” (to be renamed in the future “Info Notes”) again as an explicit deliverable. The  overall goal for each Note should be to highlight fundamental facts and shortcomings behind specific NIS  issues and occurrences, to give advice to its key stakeholders (in accordance to the agencies’ mandate)  and to provide an independent and “calm” opinion.  Description of tasks  The objective of this work package is to develop good practices on emerging smart infrastructures6 and  services and work with relevant stakeholders to deploy them at an early stage of adoption.  The main areas of work of this work package are:  ● Intelligent transportation systems used in the context of smart cities.  ● Big Data and corresponding services used for offering critical services.  ● Smart Home Environments.  For each area ENISA will identify all relevant public and private stakeholders, engage them in working  groups and jointly take stock of and analyse the current situation in terms of cyber security and resilience.  The Agency will also identify EU and national funded projects on these topics, liaise with them, assess their  findings and deliverables, and further engage them in the corresponding expert groups. Special emphasis  will be given to the resilience and robustness of such smart infrastructure and services.  Based on the consultation with stakeholders and desk-top analysis and research, ENISA will develop good  practices and issue recommendations addressing policy makers, developers and service providers. The aim  of the reports is to provide smart infrastructure service providers and developers with good security and  resilience practices when designing and deploying such services in order to minimise the exposure of such  network and services to all relevant cyber threat categories. The early adoption of these recommendations  and good practices will boost the trust and confidence of potential users of such infrastructures and pave  the way for the wide deployment of them. In such a way ENISA will help the EU industry to become more  competitive and innovative. Drawing from the knowledge and expertise on each area the Agency will  issue recommendations to MS and EU Commission on additional measures, including RandD, needed to  address specific aspects of these smart infrastructures and services.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Good Practices and Recommendations on the Security and Resilience of Intelligent transportation  systems (Q4, 2015).  D2: Good Practices and Recommendations on the Security and Resilience of Big Data Services (Q4, 2015).  D3: Good Practices and Recommendations on the Security and Resilience of Smart Home Environments  (Q4, 2015).  Stakeholder impact  ● Identify NIS issues and challenges in the area the areas mentioned above.  ● Develop good practices that stakeholders could use to either improve their current operations or dosing  more secure systems and services.  ● Issue targeted recommendations to policy makers and MS and work with them to address them in the  most practical and cost effective way.  6 An infrastructure can be defined as ‘smart’ when investments in human and social capital and traditional (transport) and modern (ICT) communication  infrastructure support sustainable economic development and a high quality of life, with a wise management of natural resources, through participatory  action and engagement.  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  30 31  4. Core operational activities  4.3.  SO2 – To assist the Member States and the Commission in enhancing capacity  building throughout the EU  4.3.1. Overview  Justification  ENISA will work together with MS and EU institutions to assist them in capacity building across the EU. In  particular, the Agency will work together with national bodies that have been mandated to carry out this  task within the MS, with private sector representatives and with European Commission to ensure that the  approach is coherent across the EU. In that respect ENISA will continue supporting national regulatory  authorities (e.g. NRAs and DPAs) and the Commission in the harmonised implementation of EU regulations  related to incident reporting across the EU. Such de-facto, bottom – up harmonisation based on good  practices and guidelines will reduce the cost of operation of the private sector in the EU.  Where private sector capacity building is concerned, ENISA will continue to ensure that this is aligned with  public sector objectives. The Agency will also assist industry in ensuring that capacity building efforts are  correctly integrated into the organisational structures of the benefited organisations.  By supporting initiatives such as the EU cybersecurity month, the implementation of an NIS driving  licence and MS’ efforts to introduce NIS topics into educational for a at all levels, ENISA will contribute  to increasing the level of participation of the EU citizen in activities aiming to improve the level of NIS  throughout the Union.  In 2015, the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) will be further developed. The ECSM’2015 organisation  follows up on the actions required in order to translate into practice the principle of shared responsibility  in NIS security, as stated in section 1.2 of the Cybersecurity Strategy: “All relevant actors, whether public  authorities, the private sector or individual citizens, need to recognise this shared responsibility, take action  to protect themselves and if necessary ensure a coordinated response to strengthen cyber security.”  Specific Policy Context  Each work package description contains a section highlighting the specific policy context for the activities  foreseen.  Overall Goals  ENISA will work together with MS and EU institutions to assist them in capacity building across the EU in  terms of government, private sector and wider public sector. In particular the Agency will work together  with national bodies (NRAs, CERTs, etc.) that have been mandated to carry out this task within the MS, with  private sector representatives and with European Commission to ensure that the approach is coherent  across the EU. The Agency will continue to support the Commission and the MS in the implementation  of methods and tools for ensuring adequate privacy protection and adherence to EU Data Protection  legislation. By supporting initiatives such as the EU cybersecurity month, the implementation of an NIS  driving licence and MS’ efforts to introduce NIS topics into educational for a at all levels, ENISA will  contribute to increasing the level of participation of the EU citizen in activities aiming to improve the level of  NIS throughout the Union.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Establish necessary procedures, workflows, tools, etc. to enable ENISA to carry out the Info Notes  service (Q2/2015).  D2: Info Notes on a specific NIS issue (ongoing service with pilot from Q2/2014; conclusions on first year of  activity in Q4/2015).  Stakeholder impact  The impact on stakeholders will be as follows:  ● More effective information flows between the CERT EU, ENISA and the CERT community.  ● Timely information provided to key stakeholders on NIS incidents and significant developments in the  field.  Resources  ● (see chapter 4.14)  Legal base and policy context  ● ENISA Regulation article 3, in particular 3.1.(a), 3.1.(b)(vi), 3.1.(c)(iv) on assistance, on analysis, and of  maintaining the awareness.  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  32 33  4. Core operational activities  ENISA will continue supporting MS in the development of their capabilities in the area of national Public  Private Partnerships. The Agency, building on its work in the area of PPPs and Trusted Information Sharing,  will provide targeted and customised assistance (e.g. in a form of a seminar, training). ENISA will also  continue supporting the Commission in the management of the NIS platform by engaging more targeted  public and private stakeholders (especially experts from small industry players), assisting in the formation  of virtual groups of experts, and contribute its expertise to position papers developed within the working  groups of the NIS platform. The last component of this Work Package is planning forward by looking back:  how successful have specific measures or even specific documents been in the past and throughout the  year. The results of this on-going impact assessment will (in the spirit of multi-annual planning) support the  development of ENISA  Work Programmemes for future years.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Support and Advise Member States on the establishment and evaluation of National Cyber Security  Strategies (NCSS) (Q4/2015).  D2: Assistance in National CERTS training and education (ongoing).  D3: Maintaining CERT good practice and training library (Q4/2015).  D4: Building upon the evaluation update ENISA’s methods in CERT capacity building and propose a  roadmap (Q4/2015).  D5: Impact evaluation on the usefulness of the ENISA guidelines on capacity building. (Q4/2015).

Work Packages  The following work packages constitute this Strategic Objective:  WPK 2.1 – Assist in public sector capacity building  This Work Package aims at helping operational bodies and communities (namely CERTs, but other  communities where appropriate) to develop and extend the necessary capabilities in order to meet the  ever growing challenges to secure their networks.  WPK 2.2 – Assist in private sector capacity building  This WPK aims at helping private sector developing their capacities in the area of cyber security (e.g. in the  area of Network and Information Security driving licence).  WPK 2.3 – Assist in improving awareness of the general public  This WPK aims at further developing ENISA’s multi-stakeholder facilitation approach and public-private  activities.  4.3.3. WPK 2.1: Assist in public sector capacity building  Desired Impact  ● By 2017, 8 MS use ENISA’s recommendations and good practices on National Cyber Security Strategies.  ● By 2017, continued CERT training will be provided to a minimum of 20 participants of different  organisations in 5 MS.  ● By 2017, Improved operational practices of CERTs in at least 15 MS (on-going support with best practices  development).  ● More streamlined CERT exercise and training material with CERT and other operational communities’  services and methodologies.  Description of tasks  This Work Package aims at helping the EU MS and other ENISA stakeholders, such as the EU bodies, to  develop and extend the necessary capabilities in order to meet the ever growing challenges to secure  their networks. A special emphasis in this WPK is laid on supporting operational bodies and communities  (namely CERTs, but other communities where appropriate) by concrete advice (like good practice material)  and concrete actions (like CERT training).  Part of the activities in this work package aim at maintaining and extending the collection of good practice  in various areas of capability building: guidelines for national strategies and exercises, good practice  collection and training material for operational communities like CERTs.  The Agency will support and advise MS on the development and implementation of National Cyber  Security Strategies (NCSS) including identifying the key elements to consider, the most appropriate process  to follow and the suitable assessment methods to adopt. The second big part is an active support of MS  in capability building, namely by rolling-out training for IT specialists (CERTs, etc.) and supporting MS to carry  out national exercises.  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  34 35  4. Core operational activities  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: ENISA report “Status of Privacy and Network and Information Security course curricula in MSs” (Q4/2015).  D2: Further development of ENISA application “NIS self-assessment” (dissemination material) (Q4/2015).  D3: On-request support for MS decision making (Q4/2015).  Stakeholder impact  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this work package will be the policy makers, standardisation  bodies and the end user organisations from public and private sectors, in particular in the area of EU NIS  education.  Resources  ● (see chapter 4.14)  Legal base and policy context  ● ENISA regulation, article 3, particularly 3.1.(c)(v).  ● Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace – JOIN(2013) 1  final – 7/2/2013 (Section 2.1).  ● EC proposal for an NIS Directive.  4.3.5. WPK 2.3: Assist in improving awareness of the general public  Desired Impact  ● Engage the 28 EU MS or representatives from the EU 28 MS for ECSM and general NIS messages for  citizens.  ● Collaboration, for better coordination, with at least 3 international stakeholders (ECSM).  ● Engage at least 5 representatives from at least 3MSs in the development of basic cyber hygiene  guidelines for recognizing and using trustworthy security and privacy products for the general public.  Description of tasks  In 2015, the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) will be further developed following its basic principles,  namely:  ● Support the multi-stakeholder governance approach.  ● Encourage common public-private activities.  ● Assess the impact of activities, optimising and adapting to new challenges.  4.3.4. WPK 2.2: Assist in private sector capacity building  Desired Impact  ● 10 public- private stakeholders from MS follow up on the recommendations from the Roadmap on the  NIS in Education.  ● Further develop an effective work process to involve more universities and certifications providers (NIS in  Education).  Description of tasks  The EU Cyber Security Strategy “An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace” suggests the development of a  roadmap for a “Network and Information Security driving licence” as a voluntary certification programme  to promote enhanced skills and competence of IT professionals. Based on this requirement ENISA has  carried out a consultation to involve the stakeholders and guide the drive for quality results released in  late 2014 in a roadmap report. It describes pilot courses, comparative curricula analysis and the main  message that e-skills and certifications are an essential path to follow.  ENISA is well equipped to further respond to this thematic challenge taking into consideration the  brokerage achieved in the NIS environment for example with NIS in education for the last 4 years. The  main objective of this work is to further provide brokerage services between stakeholders in order to  implement the recommendations from the roadmap with emphasis in areas of work where ENISA is active  already for a number of years and also where established collaborations with the academic community  (e.g. NIS in education) exist. At the same time during 2014 ENISA has developed a quiz to test user’s  knowledge of ENISA recommendations. In the course of 2015 ENISA will continue to build upon this basis  using the feedback received by the users.  ENISA will also support MS in their own decision making process, by providing advice and referencing the  appropriate ENISA studies in the area. This will be done on an on-demand basis.  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  36 37  4. Core operational activities  4.4.  SO3 – To assist the Member States and the Commission in developing  and implementing the policies necessary to meet the legal and regulatory  requirements of Network and Information Security  4.4.1. Overview  Justification  ENISA will continue to provide the Commission and the MS with high quality information, data and advice  to support policy making having an EU dimension.  In the area of privacy and data protection, ENISA will help the Commission and MS to move the privacy  and data protection debate towards implementation strategies and new business models, building on EU  data protection laws. We will provide feedback to those working on the legislative framework as to what  is feasible and what is not feasible from an operational perspective. The Agency will also identify existing  methods and tools that could be used to implement the proposals of the regulation and suggesting  which methods and tools could provide the best cost/benefit based on current operational experience.  In addition, ENISA will identify ‘gaps’, where current methods and tools do not fulfil the requirements of the  legal proposal.  Since its creation ENISA has tracked the development of standards in the area of Network and Information  Security, maintaining close contacts and collaboration with International Standardisation Organisations.  In 2015, the Agency will monitor NIS standards EU wide and globally. This approach enables ENISA to  keep its activities up-to-date with the latest developments as well as informing its stakeholders on new NIS  standardisation activities and to flag opportunities and/or risks as they develop. The collaboration with  CSCG will continue, with an aim to improving the links between Standardisation Organisations in the area  of NIS and industry and in particular EU SMEs.  Research and development will play a key role in deciding how successful the EU is in adapting to future  NIS and cyber security challenges. ENISA will continue to support such efforts by acting in an advisory role  to the Commission for future Frame Work Programmeme initiatives in this area. The strategic approach will  be to assist the Commission in selecting projects that are both aligned with the policy framework and  produce clear added value for the target stakeholder communities. ENISA will also continue to liaise with  academia and to provide a bridge between academic communities and its own stakeholder communities.  In the areas of interest to the ENISA  Work Programme the Agency will continue to collaborate with and to  support EU funded RandD projects (H2020). The main aim of this activity is to align the objectives of policy  initiatives in the area of NIS and the relevant EU funded RandD projects (H2020).  Specific Policy Context  Each work package description contains a section highlighting the specific policy context for the activities  foreseen.  The ECSM’2015 organisation follows up on the actions required in order to translate into practice the  principle of shared responsibility in NIS security, as stated in section 1.2 of the Cybersecurity Strategy: “All  relevant actors, whether public authorities, the private sector or individual citizens, need to recognise this  shared responsibility, take action to protect themselves and if necessary ensure a coordinated response to  strengthen cyber security.”  In addition, following the concept of shared NIS responsibility, ENISA will engage in 2015 in basic cyber  hygiene by the development of guidelines that will allow the web users (general public) to recognize and  use tools for online privacy and security. The ultimate scope will be the development of a citizens’ web  portal, listing existing up-to-date and trustworthy open source/freeware tools that will be easily applied  by the non-expert user who wishes to protect himself/herself online (ex. in web browsing, email, instant  messaging, e-payment systems, etc). The envisaged future deployment of such a portal will be a self- sustained platform of privacy tools supported, under ENISA’s auspices, by a greater online community of  privacy experts from different sectors (academia, Data Protection Authorities, NGOS, etc).  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Provide guidance and support for European Cyber-Security Month (dissemination material, Q4 2015).  D2: Basic Cyber hygiene: guidelines for recognizing and using trustworthy security and privacy products for  the general public (Q4/2015).  Stakeholder impact  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this work will be the EU citizens, targeted by different categories.  ENISA’s role will be to provide technical guidance on priorities and suitable subject matter and to promote  stakeholder involvement. These stakeholders are expected to reap the following benefits:  ● Receive targeted information on the security dimension in the use of ICTs.  ● Develop knowledge and corresponding ICT skills by being part of a best practice sharing community.  ● Improve and enhanced contacts with stakeholders of similar interests and profiles.  Resources  ● (see chapter 4.14)  Legal base and policy context  ● ENISA Regulation in particular 3.1.(c) (iv) and (v) supporting voluntary cooperation.  ● ENISA Stakeholder Strategy.  ● Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace – JOIN(2013) 1  final – 7/2/2013 (Section 2.1).  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  38 39  4. Core operational activities  4.4.3. WPK 3.1: Provide information and advice to support policy development  Desired Impact  ● Engage at least 5 key sector actors in launching and establishment of a forum that brings together  3 communities, namely: trust service providers from the EU Trusted List, conformity assessment bodies  and supervisory authorities. The degree of activity of the relevant key sector actors in the forum is of  importance to its success.  ● Validations by at least 5 representatives from different MS of the contribution to the implementation of  the Regulation on electronic identification and trusted services for electronic transactions.  Description of tasks  In order to remove existing barriers for cross-border e-ID based services, a new Regulation (914/2014)  on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market has been  published on the 28th August 2014. ENISA has contributed to the work on its implementing measures.  The new Regulation strengthens the provisions for interoperability and mutual recognition of electronic  identification schemes across borders, enhances current rules for electronic signatures and provides a  legal framework for other types of trust services.  ENISA has contributed to this area since 2013 by providing recommendations in the areas of:  ● Mechanisms for reporting security breaches by the trust service providers to the competent bodies.  ● Minimum security measures and good security practices for trust services providers.  ● Common audit schemes for trust services providers in MS.  In 2015 ENISA will continue to support activities in this field by the following actions:  ● Studying technological measures used by trust services.  ● Review and verification against the Regulation 910/2014 of definitions used in the context of TSPs in other  sources. This action will include clarification and specification of definitions used in the Regulation.  ● Review and evaluation of the technologies and standards related to TSPs and elDs (also developed  under mandate M-460 and in frame of the new Regulation).  ENISA in collaboration with the Commission will also launch the creation of a forum that brings together  3 communities, namely: trust service providers from the EU Trusted List, conformity assessment bodies and  supervisory authorities. A report on the establishment work of the forum of trust service providers, conformity  assessment bodies and supervisory authorities will be included as a separate section in the report of  WPK3.3 D3 of the APF’2015.  Finally, ENISA will collaborate with FESA in the area of exchange of information on the supervision of TSPs.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Analysis of standards related to eID and/or TSPs (Report, Q4/2015).  D2: Report analysing the terminology and definitions used by eIDAS (including recommended technological  means used by TSPs) (Report, Q4/2015).  Overall Goals  ● ENISA will continue to provide the Commission and the MS with high quality information, data and  advice to support policy making having an EU dimension.  ● The Agency will also take into consideration policy and legislative requirements that are not directly  related to cyber security, but which have a bearing on how cyber security principles are integrated.  ● ENISA will continue to support research and development by acting in an advisory role to the  Commission for future Frame Work Programmeme initiatives in this area.  ● ENISA will work together with the public sector, standards organisations and industry representatives to  identify ways for improving the process for agreeing on suitable NIS standards and for promoting their  uptake in a cross-border environment.  ● ENISA will continue its work on Privacy enhancing technologies.  4.4.2.

WPK 3.2: Assist EU MS and Commission in the implementation of EU NIS regulations  Desired Impact  ● By 2017, 12 MS make direct use of the outcomes of article 13 a work by explicitly referencing it or by  adopting it at nationally level.  ● By 2017, 10 MS implement recommendations by ENISA on implementing and enforcing article 4.  ● By 2017, 10 MS implement ENISA’s recommendations on article 15.  Description of tasks  This Work Package focuses on assisting regulatory authorities and Commission in the implementation of  EU regulations related to incident reporting. It builds on successful work done in this area for several years  namely in the area of article 13 a.  The main tasks of this Work Package are to support:  ● NRAs and EU MS on the implementation of Article 13a (security breach notification) and article 4  (personal data breach notification) and the development of synergies among the two.  ● NRAs and EU MS on the implementation of article 15 of new Regulation on electronic identification and  trusted services (eIDAS).  ● the Commission and MS on the implementation of the proposal for NIS Directive.  ENISA will continue collecting and analysing annual, national reports of security breaches from NRAs  in accordance with Article 13a of the Framework Directive on electronic communications. The Agency,  in co-operation with experts from NRAs and private sector (e.g. NIS Platform), will analyse the reports,  compare them with previous years, identify good practices and lessons learnt and where needed make  recommendations to NRAs and private sector to mitigate these threats in the future. Also the Agency will  assess the impact of incident reporting schemes (mostly art 13 a and art 4) from technical and socio- economic point of view. ENISA will identify lessons learnt, evaluate the value for money of such schemes  and issue recommendations for targeted stakeholders.  Additionally, ENISA will continue bringing NRAs, DPAs and the Commission together to agree on a  harmonised implementation of the security and data breach articles (art. 13a and art. 4). In that respect  the Agency will assess the two incident reporting schemes (article 13a and article 4), identify common  elements (e.g. parameters and thresholds) and propose to NRAs and DPAs the most harmonised and cost  efficient way of implementing the two articles avoiding at the same time potential overlaps. A harmonised  implementation of these articles will simplify the internal business processes of the affected private sector  and reduce the cost of compliance to them.  ENISA has already contributed to the area of electronic identification and trusted services (eIDAS) by  providing recommendations on incident reporting by the trust service providers to the competent bodies.  In 2015, ENISA will continue its efforts to bring together all relevant stakeholders from MS including  the competent regulatory bodies of MS and debate with them on the development of a consistent  implementation scheme/framework of article 15 and relevant minimum security measures. The Agency will  build on the work of FESA and relevant standardisation bodies (e.g. ETSI) and will expand it to cover all  relevant stakeholders. This work with ENISA’s support will properly define the scope of incident reporting,  Stakeholder impact  ● Supporting the implementation of the Regulation on electronic identification and trusted services, which  will enable the achievement of a harmonized market.  ● Supporting the EU MS on the provision of secure eGovernment services in all levels of public  administration.

WPK 3.3: Assist EU MS and Commission in the implementation of NIS measures of  EU data protection regulation  Desired Impact  ● At least 5 representatives from different MSs contributing to ENISA guidelines and best practice  recommendations regarding Privacy Enhancing Technologies.  ● At least 10 actors in the field validating the results of the studies.  ● More than 80 participants in APF’15 (researchers, policy makers and industry participants).  Description of tasks  In 2015, ENISA will intensify its efforts in the field of privacy and trust. The approach is three-fold:  Firstly, based on the outcome of the best practice guide for privacy enhancing technologies in 2014, the  readiness of the industry, as well as the public and private sectors for the adoption and evolution of  privacy technologies will be analysed. This will help to understand why in the current practice of web  services PETs are rarely used. Special attention will be paid to technologies for data minimization that still  allow for complex business models, e.g., privacy enhanced location based services. The report will study  the technical possibility as well as economic incentives which could help further market penetration of such  services.  Secondly, privacy enhancing technologies are mentioned in several policy documents, e.g., the draft data  protection regulation proposal. They are based on complex cryptographic building blocks. The security  of these building blocks is constantly challenged by new attacks. Furthermore, new building blocks are  invented by the research community. For system developers it is hard to keep track with this development. In  the past ENISA provided recommendations for algorithms and parameters of such building blocks. ENISA  will, in its work in this field, point to already established EU policies and processes.  Thirdly, emerging technologies in the areas of online information sharing, data merging and data mining  create new possibilities for the processing of personal data and, thus, new privacy risks. To this end, ENISA  will provide a state-of-the art analysis of the data protection threats, risks and protection measures in the  emerging big and open data landscape exploiting, as in the past, synergies between security technologies  and data protection. Data protection legislation more and more mentions technological protection  the parameters and thresholds as well as the affected services. It will also consider the requirements of  Article 7a of the eIDAS Regulation. The Agency will also try to exploit all possible implementation and  conceptual synergies with article 13a and article 4.  Subject to the approval of the NIS Directive, ENISA can assist the Commission and MS in the implementation  of the NIS Directive. In areas where the Agency is called for to take action it can develop the constituency,  debate about the scope and the key objectives of the actions, identify the key elements and players to  engage and facilitate in the implementation of the next steps by always leveraging existing knowledge  and expertise (e.g. incident reporting, minimum security measures, NCSS, exercises, etc.)  Outcomes and deadlines  D1 – Analysis of Annual 2014 Incident Reports (report) (Q3, 2015).  D2 – Recommendations on addressing root causes of specific incidents (report) (Q3, 2015).  D3 – Guidelines on Minimum Security Measures for Trusted Service Providers7 (workshops, report) (Q4, 2015).  D4 – Impact assessment on the effectiveness of incident reporting schemes (e.g. Art13a and Art 4);  (Q4, 2015).  D5 – Guidelines on Incident Reporting Scheme for Article 15 (report, Q4 2015).  Stakeholder impact  Telecommunications Sector  ● NRAs, DPAs and the EDPS will have practical references and technical guidelines to implement the  legislation.  ● Within the area of Article 13a, the industry, NRAs and the European Commission will be able to develop  a better understanding of the significant incidents at European level as well as a comparison with earlier  years and recommendations, which will support mitigation decisions and actions.  ● EU Commission (DG CONNECT, HOME and JUSTICE) will achieve harmonization of incident reporting,  breach notifications and security measures, following international standards and can in this way forego  further detailing of the legislative text.  ● Industry (network providers, ISPs, cloud providers, etc.) will be able to adopt a single framework of  incident reporting/breach notification and security measures, so there is a level playing field across the  EU countries and no complications for working cross borders.  Regulation on electronic identification and trusted services  ● NRAs and DPAs will be able to implement an efficient reporting scheme very similar to the Article 13a  scheme currently in place, and in this way lay the basis for a coherent and holistic picture of security  incidents across key service providers.  A single reporting scheme will allow trust service providers to more easily operate across borders,  effectively paving the road for a single market of trust service providers across the EU. In turn this facilitates  cross border online services, such as eCommerce and eGovernment.  7 In the next years work in this area will be extended to other market actors (in relation to the proposal for NIS Directive);  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  44 45  4.

WPK 3.4: R&D, Innovation and Standardisation  Desired Impact  ● Support at least 10 key sector actors involved in EU funded R&D programs (H2020) in the area of NIS in  defining priorities.  ● Engage at least 5 MS representatives from at least 3 MSs in the work of the ETSI CEN CENELEC Cyber  Security Coordination Group (CSCG).  ● Engage at least 5 MS representatives through at least 1 workshop organized in collaboration with the  research (H2020) and standardization communities.  Description of tasks  Since its creation ENISA tracks the development of standards in the area of Network and Information  Security maintaining close contacts and collaboration with International Standardisation Organisations.  In 2015, the Agency will monitor NIS standards EU wide and globally. This approach enables ENISA to  keep its activities up-to-date with the latest developments as well as informing its stakeholders on new NIS  standardisation activities and to flag opportunities and/or risks as they develop.  Since 2012 ENISA contributes actively to the creation and work of the ETSI CEN-CENELEC Cyber Security  Coordination Group (CSCG). This collaboration with CSCG will continue and ENISA will try to further exploit  synergies between CSCG and its  Work Programmeme. The Agency will also involve standards bodies in  the different work packages in as far as this is appropriate. In the context of the CSCG activities one of  the areas that further work is required is in improving the links between Standardisation Organisations in  the area of NIS and industry and in particular EU SMEs. ENISA will work in 2015 in identifying core set of  cybersecurity standards (comparing it against the relevant NIS policy developments).  In the areas of interest to the ENISA  Work Programme the Agency will continue to collaborate with and  to support EU funded R&D projects (H2020). The main aim of this activity is to align the objectives of policy  initiatives in the area of NIS and the relevant EU funded R&D projects (H2020). Such collaboration may be  in the form of:  mechanisms. The policy makers are partially aware of protection mechanisms whereas the research  community might lag on requirements legislation. ENISA will bring together policy makers, researchers and  data privacy practitioners to debate about the challenges of data protection and privacy. This would be in  the form of the third annual privacy forum.  In 2014 ENISA produced a report entitled “Indicative list of appropriate cryptographic protection measures”  aiming to support the Commission publication of an indicative list of measures in the light of Article 4 of  the EC regulation 611/2013. This report will be used by the Commission as a main reference document  for the publication of a list of appropriate technological protection measures pursuant to Article 4(3) of  Commission Regulation (EU) No 611/2013 (hereinafter referred to as the “List”). Based on the latest scientific  evidence at the moment of publication, technological breakthroughs may occur that compromise the  recommended protection measures. Therefore it is important that ENISA performs an annual review of  the aforementioned report with a view, among others, to keep the list up to date, pointing to already  established EU policies and processes. Such a report should serve as a reference material, with technical  protective measures for personal data, for the interested reader at MS level or in private sector. As was  the case in previous years, in the context of this work ENISA will collaborate with well recognised experts  in the field (also ensuring high quality peer reviews). In addition, ENISA will involve experts in the fields from  National Authorities (BSI, ANSSI, etc.).  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Readiness analysis for the adoption and evolution of privacy enhancing technologies (Q4 2015).  D2: Building blocks for PETs update (Q4 2015).  D3: Annual Privacy Forum 2015, APF’2015 (Q4 2015).  D4: State-of-the-art analysis of data protection in big data architectures (Q4 2015).

In this resolution the Council recognises the potential role of  ENISA to build a NIS scenario in Europe. It also underlines that the major goals of NIS are to support:  ‒ Security standards.  ‒ Raise awareness and good practices and guidance.  ‒ Serve as EU Centre of expertise in EU related Network and Information Security matters.  ● Commission proposes Action Plan to enable further growth of Security industry37 COM(2012) 417: The  COM has produced a “COMMISSION STAFF WORKING PAPER on Security Industrial Policy”38 SWD(2012)  233 final, and “COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE  COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE”39 COM(2012) 417 final. The  Commission proposes to create a true internal market for the security industry by inter alia:  ‒ harmonising standards and certification procedures for security technologies.  ‒ introducing checks on the societal impact of new security technologies at the research stage. To  reduce the gap between research and market, especially in European and international procurement,  the Commission will use novel funding schemes foreseen in Horizon 2020 such as Pre-commercial  Procurement, to test and validate results stemming from EU security research projects. This approach  should unite industry, public authorities and end users from the beginning of research projects. Border  security and aviation security are the most promising areas.  ‒ novel funding schemes such as Pre-commercial Procurement to test and validate results stemming  from EU security research projects.  ‒ The priority will be to overcome fragmentation of the EU security market, by harmonising standards  and certification procedures for security technologies. European standardisation organisations will  be asked to establish concrete and detailed standardisation roadmaps on the next generation of  technologies. In this context, to achieve mutual recognition of certification systems, the Commission  intends to issue two legislative proposals, to establish an EU wide harmonised certification system for  airport screening (detection) equipment, and an EU wide harmonised certification system for alarm  systems.  ‒ The Commission will introduce checks on the societal impact of new security technologies at the  research stage. In addition, the Commission will issue a mandate to European standardisation  organisations to develop a standard for the integration of privacy issues, from design to production  process phases.  ● Participation in the panel of reviewers that are supporting the Commission in reviewing the progress of a  project and steering the project’s future work.  ● Participation in the advisory/steering board of selective projects accepted by the Commission for funding.  Obviously ENISA may contribute to only a small number of projects. In this context, emphasis will be  given to the areas of important to the ENISA  Work Programme as presented in this document.  ● Contributions to the various consultations launched by the Commission in the areas of interest to ENISA.  Such consultations may be conducted in the context of setting the research priorities for future calls for  proposals or in the context policy initiatives launched or about to be launched by the Commission.  As was the case in previous years, ENISA will continue to support the Commission by providing experts at  the evaluations of the calls of proposals that are published in the context EU funded R&D programs. In this  context, emphasis will be given to the areas of important to the ENISA  Work Programme as presented in  this document. It should be envisaged that ENISA may contribute up to 2 experts for the evaluation of calls  of proposals during 2015.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Good Practice Guide for aligning Policy, Industry and Research (Q4/2015).  D2 Standardisation Gaps in Cyber Security (Q4/2015).  D3: Guide to standardisation for the SME Community (Q4 2015).  Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning  48 49  4. Core operational activities  4.5.3. WPK 4.1: Support for EU cooperation initiatives amongst NIS–related communities in the  context of the EU CSS  Desired Impact  ● At least 2 new operational communities will be identified and contacted for the purpose of identifying  a mutually satisfactory ways to collaborate (CERTs, LEA, EU Financial service, Data Protection, CIIP  community, etc.)  ● By 2016, at least 15 MS are familiar with practices in addressing different sector regulation challenges of  managing cyber security issues.  Description of tasks  This WPK deals with leveraging on the good experiences ENISA made in supporting the CERTs, the CERT  communities and Law Enforcement communities to find mutually satisfactory ways to collaborate.  ENISA will develop and provide guidance based on best practice for cooperation between key  stakeholder communities (CERTs, CIIP community, Law Enforcement, Financial Services; Data Protection, etc.).  The Agency will continue its work and support of the TRANSITS training in the area of CERTs in order to build  communities through a ‘learning by doing’ approach. ENISA will also continue to support the collaboration  between CERT and law enforcement communities, based on the recent policy and technical developments  in this area in MS. This work will include a close collaboration with other institutions which are active in this  field, namely the EC3. Activities agreed upon in the collaboration agreement between ENISA and EC3  will be further developed, for example in the area of encouraging more operational and systematic flows  of information between CERTs and law enforcement communities, the exchange of specific knowledge  and expertise, elaboration of general situational reports, reports resulting from strategic analyses and best  practice, strengthening capacity building through training and awareness raising in order to safeguard  network and information security at EU level. For better coordination and in order to avoid overlaps ENISA  will stay engaged in the EC3 programme board. The very well established, commonly organised ENISA- EC3 workshop will be continued.  To achieve this, previous work will be leveraged (where applicable) and experiences made will be used  to reach out to other communities, for the purpose of supporting CERTs to collaborating with them, and  helping them build up their capabilities. Emphasis will be given to the cross border collaboration aspects.  Where possible, synergies with other ENISA collaboration- and community-supporting efforts like the NIS  platform will be extended and, where needed, developed.  4.5.  SO4 – To enhance cooperation both between the Member States of the EU and  between related NIS communities  4.5.1. Overview  Justification  The work packages in this area are designed to enhance cooperation between MS and NIS communities.  ENISA will continue in its efforts to build up targeted NIS communities to meet policy goals. In some cases  (e.g. The NIS Platform, as referenced by the EU Cyber Security Strategy), ENISA will support other institutions  in creating such communities, whilst in other areas it will seek to build such communities itself when  requested to do so by the Commission or the MS.  In the area of exercises, ENISA continues to support the MS in ‘learning by doing’. Since the inception of  this stream of work in 2010 the pan-European exercise has moved to increasing levels of sophistication.  In 2015 ENISA will facilitate the planning of the next pan European Cyber Exercise efforts, initiating the  planning process for Cyber Europe 2016 and organising focused exercises, such as communications  checks etc. In addition, the Agency will further enhance its methodology, seminars, trainings and technical  capabilities on the organisation and management of large-scale cyber crisis exercises.  Specific Policy Context  Each work package description contains a section highlighting the specific policy context for the activities  foreseen.  Overall Goals  ● ENISA will continue in its efforts to build up targeted NIS communities to meet policy goals. In some  cases (e.g. The NIS Platform, as referenced by the EU Cyber Security Strategy), ENISA will support other  institutions in creating such communities, whilst in other areas it will seek to build such communities itself  when requested to do so by the Commission or the MS.  ● ENISA will build on the work it has carried out in the area of the pan-European exercise, the EU-US  exercise and support of the TRANSITS training in the area of CERTs in order to build communities through  a ‘learn by doing’ approach.  4.5.2.

ENISA will follow up to any decision taken by its Management Board and facilitate the actual planning of the exercise with representatives  (planners) from the involved parties (EU MS and US).  Pan-European cyber-exercises management  In 2014, ENISA organised the third pan-European cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2014 (CE2014) was  more ambitious than previous efforts, e.g., technical depth, scenarios, stakeholders involved, objectives,  procedures to be tested, complexity etc. The exercise lasted until the end of 2014. In 2015 ENISA will  perform an in depth analysis of the evaluation data gathered from the exercise. This will result in the  detailed evaluation report that will be shared with the participating countries.  In addition, in 2015 ENISA will facilitate the planning of the next pan European Cyber Exercise efforts,  initiating the planning process for Cyber Europe 2016 and organising focused exercises, such as  communications checks etc. The lessons learned from CE2014 will help to draw the roadmap for the next  exercise Cyber Europe 2016.  Enhance the capacity to support and organise cyber exercises  ENISA will further enhance its methodology, seminars, trainings and technical capabilities on the  organisation and management of large-scale cyber crisis exercises.  The Agency will continue enhancing its capabilities for managing complex, distributed exercises, by building  on previous efforts in tools and methods and by facilitating strategic partnerships. The maintenance and  improvement of the Cyber Exercise Platform (CEP) will be one of the main tasks.  EU-US cyber security exercise  In 2014 ENISA supported the Commission and the MS in their efforts towards planning an EU-US cyber  security exercise. The effort was focused mainly on exploratory discussions between involved parties: the  Commission, EU MS and the US.  In 2015, ENISA will continue to support the efforts in the area of pan-European exercises and will prepare  initial background work analysing the options for a potential EU-US cyber exercise that would be  proposed at EU political level and submit to the ENISA Management Board for decision. ENISA will follow  up to any decision taken by its Management Board and facilitate the actual planning of the exercise  with representatives (planners) from the involved parties (EU MS and US). If the exercise is decided by the  Management Board, after it is conducted ENISA will support the production of an after-action report.  Promote, maintain and improve EU cyber-crisis cooperation plans and procedures (e.g., EU SOPs),  including bringing closer the cyber crisis cooperation community  ENISA will continue to support MS in the maintenance and training of operational procedures for cyber  crisis cooperation. ENISA will analyse the EU cross border cyber crisis cooperation procedures and plans,  given the inputs from previous efforts, such as cyber exercises, reports such as the work of the ECCCF  working group, etc. Also ENISA will continue to consult with all EU MS on the actions, plans and tools  needed for improving the cross border cooperation and will also propose mechanisms for a possible  implementation, closely involving MS.  ENISA will continue the effort to bring the cyber crisis cooperation community closer in order increase the  trust building the potential synergies. To that end in 2015 ENISA will organise the next event in the series of  the International Conferences on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises.

Corporate Communication  To be effective, ENISA needs to communicate the findings and recommendations of its documented output  to a wide range of stakeholders across Europe. In 2015, the focus of corporate communications will be on  increasing the outreach and impact through media relations, agency branding, marketing advocacy, and  web communications, to help ensure that ENISA’s work reaches the right audiences and has a real impact  in making Europe’s information society even more secure.  In addition to its annual High Level Event in Brussels, the Agency will continue to progressively build  digital relations with all EU MS relevant authorities, as to make the cooperation even closer in terms of  communicating results across Europe, and being a hub of exchange of the latest reports that are useful for  other EU MS.  The Agency will continue developing various tools and channels such as info graphics, the web site, social  media, and social networking, videos.  4.10. Dissemination activities  Dissemination activities are the responsibility of the project managers, who will work closely with the NLO  contact point and the spokesman.  4.11. Quality Management System and Project Office  The Quality Management System (QMS) of the Agency aims at responding to a mix of regulatory and  stakeholder requirements in an effort to improve organisational performance and compliance. Scheduled  annual activities associated with the promulgation and maintenance of standard operating procedures  (SOP) and a methodology, support the operational processes of the Agency. The primary goal of the QMS  is to improve performance across the Agency, while reducing operational costs and enhancing stakeholder  satisfaction. The methodology is based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, and it features SMART goals  and KPIs. Change management is carried out by the process owners and the Quality Control Advisor.  In 2015 the Agency will re-engineer selected operational processes, align organisational requirements with  actual implementation and pursue process improvements across the board. Measuring the performance  of recently designed processes, e.g. the ENISA Project Management Guide, for the purpose of proposing  suitable adjustments will be a priority. A risk assessment methodology will be implemented for Agency-wide  risks. A set of tools such as electronic signatures, electronic workflows and enterprise resource management  tools are likely to be further integrated to facilitate collaboration. Regular presentations and updates are  made available to provide guidance and promote the performance of the quality management system.  ENISA will also create a project office in COD in order to better coordinate the increasing number of  activities that cut across a number of operational areas within the Department. Such activities include the  preparation of briefings on global issues and coordinating the coherence of recommendations across  the Department.  4.6. Management Board, Executive Board and PSG Secretariat  This covers all activities that are required to support ENISA’s formal bodies, the Management Board (MB)  and the Permanent Stakeholders Group (PSG) as well as Executive Board in their functions.  For the MB, ordinary meeting will be organised during 2015 and informal meetings will be held, one  with the PSG, if appropriate. The existing electronic newsletter will be continued throughout 2015, as will  support for the MB Portal. For the PSG also, two formal meetings will be organised.  For the Executive Board, formal meetings will be organised during 2015.  ENISA will continue to explore additional ways of supporting the Agency’s statutory bodies in the most  effective way, including the possible use of new technologies and modifications to existing processes as  required.  4.7. National Liaison Officer Network  Since 2014, ENISA has initiated a number of activities with the aim to strengthen cooperation within the  National Liaison Officers’ (NLO) Network. NLOs are key actors for the Agency’s daily work and interaction,  assuring in terms of outreach effective liaison to the MS and dissemination of ENISA activities. It expands  the NLO-Network with contact points from governmental and public agencies/organisations (e.g. CERTs  and Regulatory Bodies/Agencies, etc.).  In 2015, ENISA will build upon these efforts and improve its cooperation with the NLO Network, the first  Point of Contact for ENISA in the MS. In particular, the Agency will continue working on the following  actions:  ● An NLO meeting will be organised (possibly in conjunction with a MB meeting) where possible  improvements of the collaboration will be discussed.  ● Information will be send to the members of the NLO network at regular intervals on upcoming ENISA  project related tenders, vacancy notices, and events organised by ENISA or where the Agency  contributes to (for example co-organiser, etc.).  ● Organisation of at least one Ad hoc meeting on a specific topic of interest that will be identified in  collaboration with the NLOs.  ● Maintaining an information dbase containing all relevant information on active ENISA project (e.g. unit  responsible for the project, relevant tender results, etc.).  4.8. EU Relations  The Agency will carry out the bulk of its EU relations work with the statutory stakeholders; Commission,  EU Parliament, Council (working groups) and MS, by using senior management for developing relations.  This approach will take due account of the management structure of the Agency so that the level of  participation in any particular meeting is appropriate. A similar approach is taken for speaking  engagements.  In general, contacts at the highest level will be managed by the ED with the Heads of Department as  backups depending on the subject to be discussed.

Article 14 Requests  Article 14 requests are a mechanism that allow the MS or EU institutions to make direct requests to ENISA  for carrying out particular activities. This mechanism has become increasingly popular in the last few years  and has grown in significance to the extent that the Agency believes that it needs to be explicitly planned  for in the annual  Work Programmeme.  Although, by definition, it is not possible to predict the exact nature of the requests that the Agency will  receive in 2015, based on past experience the allocated resources are indicated in chapter 4.14.  4.13. Data Protection Officer  The main tasks of the Data Protection Officer (DPO) include:  1. inform and advise ENISA of its obligations pursuant to Regulation 45/2001/EC and to document this  activity and the responses received  2. monitor the implementation and application of ENISA’s policies in relation to the protection of personal  data  3. monitor the implementation and application of Regulation 45/2001/EC at ENISA, including the  requirements for data security, information of data subjects and their requests in exercising their rights  under the Regulation, as well as the requirements for prior check or prior consultation with EDPS  4. monitor the documentation, notification and communication of personal data in the context of ENISA’s  operations  5. act as ENISA’s contact point for EDPS on issues related to the processing of personal data; to  co-operate and consult with EPDS whenever needed.

The Administration and Support Department is responsible for ensuring that the management of the Agency  is in line with the regulatory framework established by the competent EU Institutions, the Management  Board, and the Executive Director. The regulatory framework is composed of the Financial Regulation and  the Staff Regulations and their respective implementing rules, as well as administrative procedures, the  internal control framework and other control mechanisms put in place to ensure compliance with the rules.  The ASD monitors the Agency control and risk framework. Constant upgrading of the internal systems and  revision of the operating standards set the grounds for continuous optimisation of the internal processes  and procedures. Benchmarking with other organisations, as well as recommendations of the European  Court of Auditors and the Internal Audit Service are used as internal performance indicators and relevant  possibilities of improvement are considered.  The Head of ASD develops the Agency strategy for the Administration and Support activities in line with  the  Work Programme and with the required compliance with the above mentioned bodies and rules.  He is also the main contact point as regards administrative matters, with external stakeholders such as  European Commission Services and DG’s, European Parliament, Council, ENISA Executive Board, ENISA  Management Board, Hellenic Authorities, etc. The Head of Department is supported by the Legal Officer  and two assistants who also support the Units in the Department.  5.3.

Activity Based Budget (ABB)  The  Work Programmeme 2015 activities consist of well-defined actions to which resources are allocated  and converted into outcomes. Core activities are those aiming to creating the impact in the core field  of NIS, required by the Regulation of ENISA and interpreted in the current Policy and Legal context.  Administration and Support Activities, on the other hand, aim to provide strategic and overall management  orientations, support the core activities with infrastructure and competence, and ensure compliance with  the regulatory framework.  The purpose of ABB is to ensure that resource allocation is consistent with the activities of the Agency, as  described in the annual WP.  To this regard, resources engaged in Administration and Support Activities are re-allocated to Core  and Horizontal Operational Activities in a way that the effort and the respective human resources costs  engaged to the support of the Operational Activities (e.g. procurement procedures to award a contracts  related to a WPK/Deliverables) are attributed to the latter.  While the European Commission job screening methodology used for benchmarking resources employed  across EU Agencies is looking at human resources allocated to functions and gives weight to job profiles  and descriptions (Operational, Neutral, Administration), the ABB concept allocates the Administrative and  Support resources according to their contribution to the Agency’s work. Therefore the figures in table 5.4  refer to the Administration and Support resources necessary to ensure the smooth operation of the Agency,  with focus to the strategic as well as day to day management of the Agency and compliance to the legal  and regulatory framework (e.g. risk management, internal controls, engagement with European Court of  Auditors and Internal Audit Service, statutory reporting).  10 Remark: Full time equivalents (FTE) and costs of activities are reported on Activity Based Budget basis – see section 5.5  5.3.4. ASA 3 Human Resources  The activities of Human Resources section (HR) consist in managing rights and obligations of ENISA Staff,  recruitment and training.  ● Management of Individual staff Rights and Obligations, according to the stipulations of the Staff  Regulation (SR).  ● Recruitment procedures.  ● Entitlements and leave management.  ● Drafting Internal HR Policies and Implementing Rules of the SR.  ● Medical Services and Health in work environment.  ● Training plan and career development.  ● Management of Interim services.  ● Work environment and welfare.  5.3.5. ASA 4 Information and Communication Technology  IT Unit delivers quality IT systems and services to the Agency, across its two fully functional offices, as well as  to a highly mobile user-base. The IT team uses ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) Framework as a source of good  practise in service management.

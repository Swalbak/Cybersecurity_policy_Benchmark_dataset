Key points and Recommedations 31  Annex A: List of Security Domains and Objectives 35  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  05  Executive Summary  It is of utmost importance that providers of electronic communications take appropriate measures to  address major security concerns.  In this concise document the focus is on security measures the providers of electronic communications  have deployed to protect their networks for the provision of services, but equally important, the personal  and operational data of their customers.  The inputs for this report were obtained directly from providers by means of a survey and a few  accompanying interviews. The providers were asked to assess to what degree they have implemented  measures earlier recommended by ENISA.  Some of the main findings are the following:   The majority (63%) of providers have detailed information security policies in place that are  reviewed periodically. The documented security policy does not necessarily mean that there is a  single and comprehensive document for security policy.   Quite a high number of 60% of providers can differentiate between security incidents caused  internally and those caused by third parties.   The basic level of access control is implemented by the vast majority of electronic communication  providers. However, there is a discrepancy between having the policy document and effectiveness  of its implementation.   The European providers generally display a high operational maturity having personnel assigned  with responsibilities for key network and information systems. However, there is still room for  improvement about keeping a proper documentation and tracking of incidents on the critical  systems.   Intrusion detection systems are the most widely used incident detection capabilities with 67% of  providers having them in place.   While 88% of operators communicate and report incidents to third parties (government,  customers), only 50% have documented policies on incident reporting.  All-in-all, most of the providers report a very good level of using ENISA recommendations on security  requirements, while virtually all providers have deployed a good level of basic security controls. In some  security domains, the level of maturity reported is high as well as the sophistication of implemented  controls. Security of systems and facilities is an example of a security domain with a relatively high  maturity of measures adopted. For other domains, though, there is an ample room for improvement, and  in particular, the availability of specific policies and operational documentation is lower than desired.  A key conclusion is that while all IT security basics are covered, the achievement of the next level of  maturity is impeded mostly by lack of sustainability mechanisms, i.e. repeatable processes and the  regularly maintained documentation.  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  06  The main recommendation for the providers based on the reported deployment of security measures is to  pay additional attention to sustainability and efficiency. This is best achieved by the adoption of Service  Management frameworks and creating a series of processes that include measurement and periodic  reviews of security controls and capabilities in all domains.   All security controls are subject to degradation due to either threat advances, i.e. new exploitation  techniques like Zero-day vulnerabilities, or due to system configuration changes that happen for  reasons of software upgrades, additional business functions assumed by the same information  systems, personnel changes, etc. The way to ensure the efficiency of security control is the  introduction of periodic review and testing. Data collected from the surveys support the  conclusion that little effort is directed to periodic verification of the controls efficiency.   To support and facilitate the developments of the above it is recommended to adopt management  frameworks. The most common service management framework used by many e-communication  providers worldwide is ITIL1. In particular, Continual Service Improvement (CSI) is suggested for  adoption if adopting the whole framework is not a business viable option. CSI process is designed  to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of IT processes and services, and can be easily  expanded to cover security-related processes.  1 Information Technology Infrastructure Library, is a set of practices for IT service management (ITSM) that focuses on  aligning IT services with the needs of business. In its current form (known as ITIL V3), ITIL is published as a series of  five core volumes, each of which covers a different ITSM lifecycle stage.

Introduction  New regulatory requirements in the area of security and integrity of networks have been introduced in 2009 by  the Article 13a of the Framework Directive. On 14 September 2016 The European Commission presented a draft of  the legal overhaul of the telecoms regulatory package. The proposed Directive establishing the European  Electronic Communication Code brings also changes to the Article 13a, which is in the draft numbered as Article 40  under the heading “Security of networks and services”.2  In order to support the implementation of the Article 13a, ENISA has set up a group of experts comprising National  Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) from EU Member States plus EFTA countries. ENISA has also established a reference  group of experts from within providers of electronic communication networks and services which serves as a  forum for discussing their experience, ideas as well as ENISA draft reports.  Objectives of the report  The aim of this document is to provide an overview of good practices as regards security measures that are  deployed by electronic communication providers in Europe. In particular, the document aims to:  • Identify the implemented security measures and approaches within e-communication  providers in order to mitigate the main types of incidents in the telecommunications sector and  align the findings with earlier ENISA work in this area;  • Identify lessons learned from the above mentioned practices, security measures and  approaches;  • Identify security measures and approaches other than proposed by ENISA;  • Issue recommendations and good practices for e-communication providers.  • Provide support to NRAs and policy makers for tracking progress on security measures  adopted and for regulatory improvements.  Target audience  The intended target audience for this document are especially the electronic communication providers and  the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs). Both categories of stakeholders will get an overview on how  much the providers have progressed in implementation of security measures in individual security  domains. The document will provide support to NRAs as regards areas where they need to try to  encourage or commit providers to take more action. While not in every EU country electronic  communication infrastructure is labeled as critical, the protection of such infrastructure should be of  utmost importance. Constantly evolving threats and risks, if not directly targeting the communication  infrastructure, use it as a media to access infrastructure parts that have been labeled as parts of European  Critical Infrastructure (ECI). As important stakeholders NRAs strive to improve overall security practices  among electronic communication providers.  2 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposed-directive-establishing-european-electronic- communications-code  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposed-directive-establishing-european-electronic-communications-code https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposed-directive-establishing-european-electronic-communications-code  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  08  Last but not least the document may be useful also for policy makers at the level of the EU and the  Member States while preparing the review of the existing telecoms regulatory package.  Previous work undertaken by ENISA  ENISA has commissioned a number of reports and documents relating to the topic of security measures.  Among these, the following are the most significant:  Technical Guideline on Security Measures (version 2.0., October 2014)3  This document serves as a  guidance to NRAs on the implementation of Article 13a and in particular on the security measures that  providers of public communications networks must take to ensure security and integrity of these  networks. The document lists the minimum security measures NRAs should take into account when  evaluating the compliance of public communications network providers with paragraph 1 and 2 of Article  13a.  Guideline on Security measures for Article 4 and Article 13a4  - The document provides a guidance to  national competent authorities about the supervision of security measures in Article 13a of the Framework  Directive (2009/140/EC) and Article 4 of the e-Privacy directive (2002/58/EC). In particular, it lists security  measures national competent authorities should take into account when evaluating the compliance of  public communications network and service providers with paragraph 1 of Article 4 and paragraph 1 and 2  of Article 13a.  Technical Guideline on Threats and Assets5  - The document provides NRAs with a glossary of terms to  communicate about the most significant threats and network assets involved in disruptions in electronic  communications networks and services. The threats and assets described in this document are based on  past incidents, as reported by the NRAs to ENISA and the European Commission.  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU6  - The  document aims to assess the real impact of the Article 13a. The evaluation focused on five key areas: the  new security measures implemented in the member states, the transparency resulting from the incident  reporting process, the learning process resulting from incidents, the level of collaboration between the  stakeholders and the harmonization of the procedures within the European Union.  Methodology  Two main tools were employed in this project to become familiar with the security measures of the e- communication providers, an online survey and accompanying interviews with some of the providers who  have already responded to the survey. The aim was to get insights into how the providers assess their own  level of achievements in implementing the recommended set of security measures.  1.4.1 Online Survey  A survey consisting of 20 questions was commissioned for the delivery of this document. The core of the  survey was based on earlier ENISA documents relating to security measures, especially on the list of  security domains, objectives and measures and the level of sophistication of the measures. The document  Technical Guideline on Security Measures mentioned above includes a list of 25 security objectives  grouped in 7 security domains while each objective lists the respective security measures to reach the  3  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/technical-guideline-on-minimum-security-measures  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-for-article-4-and-article-13a  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/technical-guideline-on-threats-and-assets  6 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/impact-evaluation-article13a  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  09  security objectives (see Annex A:). The security measures are categorized into three levels of increasing  sophistication. This categorization was also used for the survey, which was conducted for this report. The  respondents were asked to attach sophistication levels to the security measures implemented. Not all the  security objectives and measures were included in the survey to keep it concise and manageable for the  respondents.  For most of the questions respondents were asked about the perceived level of sophistication  (implementation) of these measures. All main security objectives were covered by the survey apart from  Human resources security which was partly grouped with Governance and risk management. To keep the  survey concise and manageable for the respondents, not all of 25 security measures were included. On the  other hand, the survey touched upon specific measures against DDoS attacks, for SS7 protocol as well as  upon the security standards followed. For most of the questions the respondents had the option to provide  further details and clarifications.  The respondents included electronic communication providers from Europe, the vast majority of them  being from the EU Member States. The pool of respondents came from ENISA and their contractor’s  contacts among providers. The survey was conducted in the summer months of 2016. In total, 48  European providers responded to the online survey. The sample consisted of a variety of operators and  Internet service providers, the most of which provide their services over both fixed and mobile networks.  Their networks are rather sophisticated and the majority of them claims to have deployed fibre optics. The  main findings of the survey are analysed in the following chapter Error! Reference source not found..  Figure 1: Networks used for provision of services by the operators surveyed  1.4.2 Interviews  While the survey generated a good overview of the measures adopted and their perceived level of  sophistication, it was complemented by several interviews with selected stakeholders. The aim was to  better understand the rationale behind the approaches of individual providers and gather insights into  other areas not properly covered by the survey. The interviews were either conducted in person or via  electronic means while the interviewees had received the questionnaire in advance  75%  46%  90%  58%  77%  19%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  Fixed-line Cable Fibre-optics Mobile Wireless Access  Satellite  Networks for provision of services  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  10  Structure of the report  Chapter 2 provides in its charts and commentaries a more detailed overview of implemented security  measures, which is the core of this document. These measures are aligned according to the list of security  domains and objectives present in earlier documents of ENISA (see Error! Reference source not found.). In  ost cases, the sophistication of these measures is identified. The security domain of Human resources  security was loosely aligned with Governance and risk management and not all of security objectives  (measures) were subject of this exercise.  Chapter 3 draws conclusions on the findings and suggests areas for improvements and further steps to be  taken by the providers. Per each security domain a conclusion is drawn (on a three-grade scale) as regards  the maturity of the measures implemented. This chapter also includes some recommendations for the  providers of electronic communication.  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  11  2. Security measures adopted: status and level of sophistication  This chapter analyses the security measures adopted by electronic communication providers drawing on  the results of the survey and the accompanying interviews. It focuses mostly on the level of sophistication  (usually three-grade scale) of these measures as perceived by the operators. The security measures are  mainly introduced to protect the main assets of the operators, which are private and traffic data of  customers and the infrastructure that enables the provision of services. At the same time, anything that  impacts and threatens (the integrity) of customer data is considered as one of the main risks and threats as  the reputation of the company may be seriously damaged. As mentioned earlier, the structure of security  domains and security objectives from earlier ENISA documents serves as a basis for the analysis with a few  additional topics that are treated independently from the original list of security domains and objectives.  These additional topics are the compliance with international security standards and practices as well as  security measures employed against DDoS attacks and for SS7 protocol.  In the following analysis, we refer to sophistication levels of the measures. These broadly correspond to  three level applied in earlier ENISA documents and are cumulative, i.e. the level 2 includes all features of  level 1 and level 3 includes all features of levels 1 and 2.  Sophistication level 1 (basic):  • Basic security measures that could be implemented to reach the security objective.  • Evidence that basic measures are in place.  Sophistication level 2 (industry standard):  • Industry standard security measures to reach the objective and an ad-hoc review of the  implementation, following changes or incidents.  • Evidence of industry standard measures and evidence of reviews of the implementation  following changes or incidents  Sophistication level 3 (state of the art):  • State of the art (advanced) security measures, and continuous monitoring of  implementation, structural review of implementation, taking into account changes,  incidents, tests and exercises, to proactively improve the implementation of security  measures.  • Evidence of state of the art (advanced) implementation, evidence of a structural review  process, and evidence of pro-active steps to improve the implementation of security  measures  Governance and risk management  2.1.1 Information security policy  The information security policy is the first security objective covered by the above mentioned “Governance  and risk management” security domain. Almost two thirds of the operators claim they have reached the  third (highest) level of sophistication, i.e. that they have detailed information security policies in place that  are reviewed periodically. That could either mean that they consider their own information security  policies to be up to date and approved by senior management and/or that the review process is  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  12  documented taking into account violations, exceptions, past incidents, past tests/exercises as well as  incidents that affect other providers in the communications sector.  Figure 2: Information security policies as applied by European operators  While policy reviews indicate a higher information security maturity within the providers it is unclear why  the high-level policy number is relatively low. The high-level policy is a document stating information  security requirements for the organization at a corporate level and it is a key element of security  governance. The upper level document is usually followed by a series of more specific policies. There is a  number of public resources that can aid providers in creation of not only high level but also specific  policies. 7 8  The documented security policy does not necessarily mean a single and comprehensive document for  security policy. For example, one operator confirmed that they have specific information security policies  for information classification/management, access management, secure development of applications and  services and secure infrastructure Implementation. As regards the review of security policies, this includes,  for example, the evaluation of the current information security policies in line with the framework of the  ISO 27001 standard.  For the implementation of appropriate security policies the operators need to have a skilled work force at  their disposal. Usually the security roles are divided between separate divisions managed by CTO or CSO,  while very rarely there are only IT-security specific roles. Some operators have established security  committees (with their members coming from various departments) that oversee the implementation of  security policies. As regards the enhancement of IT security skills of employees, they often receive e- learning trainings on password policies, malware etc.  7 https://www.sans.org/security-resources/policies/  8 http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Security/Policy/Sample_Policies/  63% 58% 63%  2% 4%  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80%  High level information  security policy for communication networks and  services  Detailed information  security policy for critcal assets and  business processes  Detailed information  security policy reviewed  periodically  None Other  Information security policy in place  https://www.sans.org/security-resources/policies/ http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Security/Policy/Sample_Policies/  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  13  2.1.2 Risk management  The list of risks is an effective way to raise management awareness so they can make established  acceptable risk levels and quantities. Risk lists can be decentralized i.e. maintained by respective  departments of the provider if the central risk management function is not established.  Almost two thirds of operators keep a list of main risks for security and continuity of their networks and  services and their key personnel is aware of the main risks. A slightly lower share of operators have a  documented risk management methodology and tools and periodically review this methodology and tools  taking into account changes and past incidents.  Similarly, to the high-level security policy document, maintaining the list of risks is rather a low effort  exercise. Ideally, the deployment of risk management measures should be somewhat higher to indicate  that risk management receives appropriate attention.  Figure 3: Risk management framework  The providers often align business continuity management with security standards like ISO 22301 and  BCI (Business Continuity Institute) Good Practice Guidelines. Also, as with the previous topic of  information security policies, there are specific tools for different areas (IT or telecommunication  network) with different levels of sophistication.  2.1.3 Security requirements for contracts with third parties  The telecommunication providers need to implement a policy on security requirements in order to  procure and manage third-party networks and services like, for example, IT services, software, call- centres, shared facilities, interconnections etc.  Around 60% of providers include these requirements into the contracts and maintain and update  respective policies while keeping track of security incidents related to or caused by third parties. While  there is not much indication on the quality and coverage provided by the third party security policies,  the ability of 60,42% of providers to differentiate between security incidents caused internally and  externally can be considered as a very good achievement.  65%  56% 60%  6% 6%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  List of main risks in place  Documented risk management  methodology and tools  Risk management methodology and tools periodcally  reviewed  None Other  Risk management  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  14  Figure 4: Security requirements in contracts with third parties  When deciding whether to include security requirements in individual contracts with third parties, the  providers take into account, for example, the criticality of the systems/services or costs. It is important  to note that the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)9 defines the responsibilities for  entities that collect personal data (collectors) and process personal data (processors). As many of the  eCommunication providers deal with personal data in one or the other way, the GDPR will heavily affect  the majority of them. In case their role falls under definition of data collectors, it will be their  responsibility to track and inform about data breaches even if they are caused by the contracted third  parties.  Security of systems and facilities  2.2.1 Physical and environmental security of network and information systems and facilities  This particular area relates, inter alia, to the need for the providers to house critical and sensitive  information in secure areas and to protect them by defined security parameters along with appropriate  security barriers and entry controls. It also means that “physical protection against damage from fire,  flood, earthquake, explosion, civil unrest, and other forms of natural or man-made disaster should be  designed and applied.”10  For example, there are specific rules for building datacenters when the operators need to take into  account the surrounding area like the altitude or the close presence of a gas station.  9 http://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3e485e15-11bd-11e6-ba9a- 01aa75ed71a1/language-en  10 ISO27002, Chapter 9.1.4  60% 58% 60%  6% 4%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  Security requirements  included in contracts  Security policy for contracts with third parties  Keeping track of security incidents caused by third  parties  None Other  Security requirements in contracts with third parties  http://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3e485e15-11bd-11e6-ba9a-01aa75ed71a1/language-en http://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3e485e15-11bd-11e6-ba9a-01aa75ed71a1/language-en  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  15  Figure 5: Physical and environmental security  The vast majority of the providers (more than 80%) have measures in place to prevent an unauthorized  access to facilities which includes door and cabinet locks, burglar and fire alarms, fire extinguishers etc.  Almost two thirds of them implement a policy for physical security measures and physical and  environmental controls including industry standards.  These standards include electronic control of entrance and audit trail, segmentation of spaces according to  authorization levels, automated fire extinguishers with halocarbon gases and so on. Also, approximately  the same number (62.50%) of providers also evaluate and, when necessary, review and update the policies  for physical security measures and environmental controls in the light of changes and past incidents. These  figures can be considered as sufficiently high.  2.2.2 Access control measures  The electronic communication providers should have in place appropriate (logical) access controls for  access to network and information systems. This access should be controlled on the basis of business and  security requirements. The access control rules are categorized based on the criticality of data and also on  their life-cycle (when the data is stored, when it is destroyed).  The first grade (sophistication level) of access control rests with the access logs showing unique identifiers  for users and systems as well as an overview of authentication and access control methods for systems and  users. In almost 92% cases users have unique IDs and are authenticated for accessing the systems. In  around 40% of cases the providers protect passwords using standard cryptographic methods, shared  secrets and private keys before storing them on removable media without any additional access control.  The second sophistication level means that the providers have an access control policy in place including  description or responsibilities, groups, access rights and procedures for granting and revoking access. Also,  different types of authentication measures exist for different types of access. There is also a log of access  control policy violations and exceptions which is approved by security officers. Almost 80% of providers  claim to have such a policy in place that defines roles, responsibilities and procedures for access to  network and information systems. In more than 70% cases the authentication mechanisms differ  depending on the type of resource and access level and/or access is monitored and there is a process  dealing with exceptions and responding to access violations.  81%  65% 63%  2%  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%  Measures in place (door locks, alarms, fire  extinguishers etc.) to prevent unauthorized access  Documented policy and/or Industry standard controls  (electronic control of entrance, automated fire  extuinguishers)  Regular review of physical and environmental controls  Other  Physical and enivronmental security  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  16  The most mature handling of access controls is to evaluate the effectiveness of access control policies and  procedures and to review and, if needed, to revise them. Slightly less than a half of providers are doing  cross checks on access control mechanisms and more than 80% of providers review the access control  policy periodically.  Figure 6: Access control measures  The basic level of access control is implemented by vast majority of electronic communication providers.  However, there is a discrepancy between verifying the policy document and effectiveness of its  implementation. Checks on access control effectiveness should be stated in policy and executed at least as  often as access control policy review itself.  The following figure gives more detailed technical insights on the access controls implemented. The figure  covers both low-profile and high-profile security measures. It shows, for example, surprisingly quite a high  share (more than 58%) of operators claiming to implement certificate authentication with private key  protected by password, while over 31% go without password protection for the certificate authentication.  It is important to highlight the significant use of biometric authentication technology that was reported by  29.17% of eCommunication providers.  Responses of the surveyed and interviewed operators on the alignment of the technical access controls  with access control policy indicate a comparatively high maturity of the access control measures  implemented. A relatively wide use of biometric technology for authentication confirms that conclusion.  While the use of certificates without password protection can be explained by operational needs and no  password complexity enforcement by limited capabilities of embedded OS on the communication  92%  40%  79%  73%  71%  48%  81%  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%  Users have unique IDs and are authenticated for system access.  Passwords, shared secrets, and private keys are encrypted before stored on removable media, but no additional access  control is implemented.  There is a policy that defines roles, responsibilities, and procedures to access network and information systems.  Authentication mechanism differs based on type of resource and access level.  Access is monitored and there is a process to deal with exceptions and respond to access violations.  Cross checks on access control mechanisms are performed and effectiveness of policy is evaluated regularly.  Access control policy is reviewed periodically and revised as needed.  Access control measures implemented  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  17  equipment, both of these areas should be marked for improvement. And while the technical capability to  enforce password complexity may not be available on specific devices, the policy should clearly state the  access control security requirements11. Fulfilment of these requirements should be verified regularly.  Figure 7: Types of access control measures implemented  2.2.3 Integrity of network and information systems  The measures concerning integrity of network and information systems are those that provide protection  against malware, viruses and other common threats that can compromise the functionality of the systems.  Nine out of ten surveyed operators have implemented the basic level of integrity. That means that  software and data in network and information systems are protected by input controls, firewalls,  encryption and signing. Security critical data are protected by separate storage, encryption, hashing etc.  and malware detection systems are in place and they are up to date.  The second stage of maturity of measures in this area concerns proper documentation of software and  data in network and systems, availability of tools for detection of anomalous usage and behaviour of  systems and logs of intrusion detection and anomaly detection systems. 75% of operators have deployed  these mechanisms to detect whether the network or information systems have been tampered with or  altered.  11 https://www.sans.org/security-resources/policies/general#password-construction-guidelines  23%  94%  31%  54%  31%  58%  29%  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%  Passwords without complexity enforcement  Passwords with complexity enforcement  Hardware event or time-based one-time password token  Software event or time-based one-time password token  Certificate authentication without private key protected by password  Certificate authentication with private key protected by password  Biometric authentication (finger, palm, face, iris reader, etc.)  Technical access controls implemented  https://www.sans.org/security-resources/policies/general#password-construction-guidelines  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  18  State of the art measures, which are the highest on the sophistication scale, are implemented by 27% of  operators. These measures aimed at protection of the integrity of the systems include file-level and binary  integrity controls. Also, integrity controls are monitored and evaluated for effectiveness and revised if  needed. The controls may not be in place in all systems - depending on risk assessment.  Figure 8: Integrity of network and information systems  The integrity controls implemented range from basic ones like firewalls to automated restoration of the  system desired state in a case the integrity being compromised. Some 75% of operators have integrity  controlled at the firewall level, while almost 69% have implemented intrusion detection systems and  62,5% have intrusion prevention systems in place.  In addition to that it is worth noting a relatively high level of implementation of file level integrity controls  on critical systems (48%), while the SIEM implementation could be highlighted as the main area for  improvement. There is a discrepancy between implementation of configuration files integrity (25%) and  file-level integrity controls on critical systems (see above).  Some 23% of operators claim that they have deployed automated mechanisms for restoring the systems to  the desired level in case their integrity is compromised.  90%  75%  27%  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%  Input controls and firewalls are implemented and/or Passwords, shared secrets, private keys are not disclosed  Anti-malware measures are implemented and/or Defense in depth is implemented.

The vast majority (90%) of electronic communication providers have  assigned responsibilities for key network and information systems.  Over half (54%) of them have introduced respective policies to make sure that all critical systems are  operated and managed according to pre-defined procedures. These policies are regularly reviewed and  updated. Some providers align the operational procedures with business continuity and information  security programs, where critical services and systems are identified.  The European providers generally display a high operational maturity having the personnel with assigned  responsibilities for the key network and information systems. However, proper documentation  maintenance and incident tracking on the critical systems should be improved.  75%  69%  63%  58%  48%  8%  23%  25%  23%  0% 20% 40% 60% 80%  Integrity is controlled at the firewall level  Intrusion detection systems  Intrusion prevention systems  Security and event management system (SIEM)  File-level integrity controls on critical systems  File-level integrity controls on all systems  Binaries are signed and verified at deployment  Configuration files integrity check is implemented  Automated system is implemented that restores desited state of the system if integrity is compromised  Integrity controls implemented  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  20  Figure 10: Operational procedures for critical network and information systems  2.3.2 Change management procedures  The change management procedures are established in order to minimise the likelihood of disruptions and  errors resulting from the changes. The main goal of change management is to ensure reliable and timely  implementation of change requestes with minimal operational efforts. The change management  procedure (along with many others) is described in IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL)12. According to the ENISA  Annual incident report, in 2015 human errors was the root cause category involving most users affected,  around 2.6 million user connections on average per incident. Over 81% of providers follow predefined  procedures when making changes to critical systems. Around 65% of providers document change  management proceduress while these are reviewed by 56,25% of them taking account of changes and past  incidents.

Advancement of threats and their growing sophistication requires  companies to invest in incident management and response in addition to the introduction of preventive  measures. Three quarters of the surveyed providers claim that their personnel are trained to be able to  respond to incidents and that they record all major incidents.  A slightly lower number (approx. 73%) of providers have developed incident response policies that define  roles and responsibilities and contain specific procedures depending on type of incident. Over 62% of  providers implement the measures that are highest on the sophistication scale. This means they create  incident management reports for all major incidents and they review and evaluate them periodically to  update incident management procedures.  Incident management records and reports are created for major incidents when considered relevant.  Within the scope of information security, incident management is more mature for continuity-related  incidents (more frequent) and less mature for personal data-related incidents (less frequent).  It is interesting to note that the percentage of respondents with more advanced incident management  procedures, periodic review and improvement of incident management procedures, roughly corresponds  to the number of providers that implemented SIEM and Intrusion Detection/Preventions systems.  Figure 12: Incident management procedures implemented  2.4.2 Incident detection capabilities  Almost 69% of providers have implemented incident detection systems and processes. For 73% of them  incident detection is a continuous managed process that involves detection of incidents and their  forwarding to appropriate personnel for resolution. About 65% of providers review their incident detection  systems periodically while using network and information changes as well as past incidents to improve  incident detection capabilities.

It is likely to be attributed to the existence of  written policies and procedures that are not necessarily supported by operational capabilities.  Figure 13: Level of incident detection capability implemented  Incident management records and reports are created for major incidents when considered relevant.  Within the scope of Information Security, incident management is more mature for continuity-related  incidents (more frequent) and less mature for personal data related incidents (less frequent).  Intrusion detection systems are the most widely used incident detection capabilities with two thirds of the  providers stating they have them in place. 60% of providers do manual log review of firewall and network  devices and the same number of providers have this process automated. In-house Security Operation  Centre is the case for 56% of operators, while only 10% have this facility outsourced. User behaviour  monitoring system is used by 58% of providers while around 23% of them have implemented business  process aware incident detection, both of which can be considered as a very good achievement.  69% 73%  65%  6%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  Incident detection systems and  processes implemented  Incidents detected and forwarded to  appropriate personnel for  resolution  Incident detection systems periodically  evaluated and reviewed  None  Incident detection capabilities  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  23  Figure 14: Typical features of incident detection capability  2.4.3 Incident reporting and communication procedures  The providers are recommended to establish and maintain sound procedures for incident reporting and  communication that take into account national regulations on incident reporting to government  authorities. A total of 87.5% of providers communicate and report incidents to third parties like  government authorities and their customers. Only 50% of them have their own policies in place on incident  reporting which includes reasons and motivation for communication, the incident type, reports’ content,  communication channels and communication roles, templates for incident reporting etc. Even lower  number (48%) of providers carry out a regular review of the reporting and communication plans.  60%  60%  67%  58%  56%  52%  10%  35%  27%  23%  58%  0% 20% 40% 60% 80%  Firewall and network devices log review performed manually  Automated firewall and network devices log review  Intrusion detection systems  Intrusion prevention systems  Security incident and event management (SIEM)  In-house Security Operation Center (SOC)  Outsourced Security Operations Center (SOC)  User behavior monitoring system  Automated response based on detected deviation from normal behaviour  Business process aware incident detection  Fraud detection software and systems  Typical features of incident detection capabilty  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  24  Figure 15: Incident reporting and communication procedures  Notification to NRAs and customers is usually carried out under the requirements of Article 13a, which  were transposed to national legislation. The communication procedures are focused on service  interruption incidents, which are related to impact on customers, services provided and the resulting  reputation of the company.  Business continuity management  2.5.1 Disaster recovery capabilities  Disaster recovery capabilities serve to restore network and communication services following natural and  other major disasters. More than 85% of providers have implemented basic measures in this regard as  failover sites in other regions or backups of critical data in remote locations.  About 60% of surveyed providers have documented policies for deploying these capabilities, which may  include list of disasters with a potential to impact upon service provision as well as a list of disaster recover  capabilities available internally or provided by third parties.  Roughly 40% of providers have set up state of the art disaster recovery capabilities like full redundancy and  failover mechanisms. They also review their disaster recovery capabilities regularly. All numbers indicate  an overall high maturity of operators in disaster recovery capabilities.  One of the operators has provided valuable insights to their disaster recovery measures: “In addition to DR  for some services, the network architecture is defined to incorporate, when relevant, redundancy  capabilities. For example, some network platforms are implemented in a balanced/distributed architecture  (i.e., all the network traffic is distributed between all the identical platforms). In case of failure of one of  those platforms, the traffic is automatically re-routed. This can be considered an Active-Active architecture,  instead of the Active-Passive architecture of the DR.”  88%  50% 48%  2% 4%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  Incidents reported to third parties when  necessary  Own policies on incident reporting  Periodic review and update of the  reporting plans  None Other  Incident reporting and communication procedures  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  25  Figure 16: Disaster recovery capabilities  Monitoring, auditing and testing  2.6.1 Monitoring and logging of critical network and communication systems  Systems should be monitored and information security events should be recorded. Operator logs and fault  logging should be used to ensure information system problems are identified. Around 90% of providers  indicate that they carry out logs and monitoring reports of critical network and information systems.  A much lower number (58%) of providers have also implemented policies for monitoring and logging  including minimum logging and monitoring requirements. A very high share 63% of operators have set up  tools for automated collection and analysis of monitoring data and logs.

Rigorous testing of systems and network equipment saves a significant  amount of time by reducing troubleshooting times and improves network availability. Just like with  monitoring approximately nine out of ten providers produce test reports of the network and information  systems, which includes tests following big changes or the introduction of new systems. A majority of  62,5% claim to have policies and procedures in place as well as tools for automated testing. 54% of them  review and update testing policies and procedures.

This covers,  inter alia, also penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. The security assessment is a tool that  ensures intended functionality of security controls. Only two thirds of operators carry out regular security  scans and testing especially when introducing new systems or following changes. While it is possible to use  an availability as an excuse this number can be improved by performing security assessments of sliding  schedule or combined with failover testing.  A somewhat lower number (58%) of providers have in place documented procedures/policies concerning  the types of assets, the circumstances, frequency, confidentiality levels for assessments and test results  etc. as one of the surveyed providers put it: “We have policies for secure development of applications and  services and secure infrastructure implementation that include security testing checklists and risk  evaluation matrixes.” Some 56% of providers undertake regular review and update of these procedures.  Figure 19: Security assessments of network and information systems  Security standards, frameworks and guidelines  The security measures used in ENISA documents have been often adapted from various existing  international network and information security standards, guidelines and good practices. These standards,  that may be either mandated or recommended to the providers, provide them with guidance, terminology,  structure for supervision and auditing, baseline etc. Standards of ISO, especially ISO/IEC 27001  “Information security management systems” are the most widely used with 75% of providers claiming to  adhere to the ISO 27001. On the positive side it is worth to mention the proliferation of standards and  frameworks the practicality of which has been proven by the number of adopters in various industries,  including those other than the electronic communication providers. ISO 27000 group of standards and  parts of ITIL Service Management Framework have been reported with the highest adoption rate. ENISA’s  Technical Guideline is used by 17% providers. It was designed rather as a “soft approach” guideline only  and is probably seen as a driver for adoption of more detailed and more specific frameworks and  standards. It is also surprising to see such a high level of providers indicating the adoption of ISO 27001  standard, that contains Information Security Management System (ISMS) performance evaluation and  67%  58% 56%  8%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  Critical systems undergo security scans and testing  Documented policy/procedures for security assessments  Regular review of procedures  None  Security assessments of network and information systems  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  28  improvement requirements, while a significantly lower number in reality carries out periodic review of  efficiency of various security controls.

There are  many types of DDoS attacks, for example:  - Transport protocol based attacks aim to overload the target system with large volume of TCP, UDP, or  ICMP requests forcing the loss of similar requests from legitimate sources thus rendering the target  system non-responsive.  - Bandwidth exhaustion attack is similar to the above with the difference that malicious agents try to  overload the target with large amounts of bogus data.  - Application level attacks exploit application limitation to process requests in volumes and sizes  generated by malicious agents. While specific application may be under DDoS attack, other  applications running on the same infrastructure may also be affected as application competes for  computational and memory resources in an attempt to handle the requests volume.  Slightly more than a half of the providers indicate use of configurations (traffic limitation) to counter DDoS  attacks as well as close monitoring. Approximately a half of them use specialized hardware (i.e. Arbor  Networks) and less than 10% rely on upstream providers for DDoS mitigation. According to ENISA Annual  Incident Report for 2015 the incidents caused by malicious actions (e.g. DDoS), although there were not  many of them, had most impact in terms of duration, which lasted on average almost two days per  incident.13  Based on the low percentage of incidents the conclusion is that the defenses employed by providers are  sufficiently effective. At the time of writing, however, DDoS attacks had been on the rise with the use of  Internet of Things (IoT) devices as malicious agents.14 Those attacks are characterized by a significantly  increased volume of traffic so deployed defenses should be evaluated for the capability to withstand the  new attack levels.  Figure 21: Measures against DDoS attacks  13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/annual-incident-reports-2015  14 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2016/  48%  6% 4%  38%  4%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  Basic n/a None Product Upstream  Measures against DDoS attacks  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/annual-incident-reports-2015 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2016/  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  30  Measures for the SS7 protocol  SS7 protocol based attacks present a significant threat not only to the service providers but also to the  users to the point where the attacker can not only track the user location and access the information on  the connected mobile device, but also redirect the calls.15 16 17 Security measures are required to protect  attackers from:  1) Accessing private data residing on user’s mobile device;  2) Committing fraud e.g. transfer of funds;  3) Disrupt normal operation of the network.  Due to the age of the SS7 protocol (it was designed in the 70s) the majority of the security issues lie in the  architecture and configuration design and are not easy to resolve.  SS7 protection is a topic with a high diversity of security measures implemented. About 40% of  respondents indicated deployment of the SS7 firewalls with additional less than 10% relying on access  controls to prevent unauthorized access to the SS7 network. The rest of answers range from monitoring,  SS7 intrusion and fraud detection systems to administrative/procedural controls. As no data is available to  determine the widespread occurrence of SS7 specific security incidents it is difficult to reach a conclusion  on the subject given the variety of methods employed.

Key points and Recommedations  All-in-all, approximately 60% of providers report a very good level of compliance with ENISA security  requirements, while virtually all providers have deployed a good level of basic security controls. In some  security domains, the level of maturity reported is high as well as the sophistication of implemented  controls. Security of systems and facilities is an example of a security domain with a relatively high  maturity of measures adopted. For other domains, though, there is an ample room for improvement, in  particular as regards the availability of specific policies and operational documentation is lower than  desired.  With a growing sophistication of attacks the basic level of security controls may not provide sufficient  protection and the higher level of security controls maturity is essential. Many providers seem to realize  the necessity of qualitative security control improvement and have deployed sophisticated technical  controls. A key conclusion seems to be that while all IT security basics are covered, the achievement of the  next level of maturity is impeded mostly by lack of sustainability mechanisms, i.e. repeatable processes  and the regularly maintained documentation.  A general quantitative breakdown based on self-assessment indicates that approximately 25% of providers  have advanced capabilities in one or more security domains, and approximately 60% have satisfactory  capabilities in all domains. Below are the quick conclusions drawn per each security domain. A three-grade  maturity scale is applied for the conclusions on individual security domains.  Satisfactory High Very High  Providers indicated presence  and functionality of basic  security controls.  Providers indicated presence of  advanced security controls and  ad-hoc processes in place,  usually in reaction to a security  event.  Providers indicated proactive  security posture with  combination of advanced and  basic security controls verified  regularly according to well  established policies and  processes.  The main recommendation for the providers based on the analysis of the deployment of their security  measures is to pay additional attention to the sustainability and efficiency. This is best achieved by the  adoption of Service Management frameworks and by creating a system that includes measurement and  periodic reviews of security controls and capabilities in all domains.  Governance and risk management  Domain Maturity level:  [Satisfactory] High Very High  Around 60% of respondents report good practices for security governance and risk management. The  maturity level of the whole domain is ranked as satisfactory because high-level governance documents and  their periodic review is a relatively low effort exercise. Therefore; it is expected that at least the basic level  of maturity is reported by at least 90% of respondents. Only 56% of providers employ the risk  management methodology, while registering the risks is a first step towards effective risk management  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  32  program and is reported by 65% of providers. It is surprising that there is not a higher number of providers  taking the next step of addressing risks with mitigation techniques.  Domain recommendations:    Improve governance by utilizing templates provided as references in the section Error! Reference  ource not found. to develop necessary company-wide topics for all aspects of security.   The starting point for proper risk management should be ISO 2700518 standard to turn risk  management from ad-hoc human-driven activity into the properly managed business process.   Select and adopt ISO or any other risk management framework that allows to build the processes  to regularly and systematically address risks registered in the lists of risks.  Security of systems and facilities  Domain Maturity level:  Satisfactory [High] Very High  High level of implementation of soft- and hardware based tokens for multi-factor authentication as well as  a significant presence of biometric authentication would make security of systems and facilities one of the  domains that demonstrates a very high maturity. Unfortunately, this significant achievement is offset by  only a very basic set of integrity controls. Preventing unauthorized changes to the systems is as important  as proper access control. Undesired changes are not necessarily a consequence of an attack, but often a  result of a simple human error.  The detection of the binary or configuration file modification by integrity  controls provides an additional layer of system security. In this respect it is noteworthy that some of the  eCommunication providers have realized the significance and deployed system-level file integrity controls  on critical systems and even built capability to automatically restore system to desired state in the case the  said state has been altered.  Domain recommendations:   Improve integrity controls by a wider adoption of file and filesystem-level integrity controls.   Pay a particular attention to automated restore of desired configuration for critical systems and  integrity control of binary and configuration files deployed on them.  Operation management  Domain Maturity level:  [Satisfactory] High Very High  The operation management domain is a perfect illustration to the overall conclusion summarized at the  beginning of this chapter. 81% of providers follow predefined procedures for change management and  90% have the responsibilities assigned. With all basics covered the number of respondents who document  18 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=56742  http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=56742  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  33  their change management procedures falls to 65%, and even further when it comes to a periodic review of  change management procedures – this is done by only 56% of respondents. This is aligned with another  data point – low percentage of respondents who are utilizing ITIL framework. Service management  frameworks allow for a better service delivery that in turn leads to higher customer satisfaction and  reduced incident costs.  Domain recommendations:   Adopt Service Management framework (e.g. ITIL) in particular where it describes change  management.   Keep in mind that change management process is tightly connected to both problem and incident  management.   Document de-facto processes, nominate process owners with assigned responsibility for periodic  review and update of operation management documentation.  Incident Management  Domain Maturity level:  [Satisfactory] High Very High  This domain too that has well developed detection capabilities that are followed by incidents being  assigned to appropriate personnel for resolution. However, when confronted with a list of specific controls  that are part of their incident management capability, the providers emphasize the detection capability  while review and update of procedures lack behind. The same value around 60% is reported for everything  from fraud detection capabilities to automated log reviews. It is interesting to see that half of respondents  run in-house Security Operation Centers, but 60% indicate that they review the logs manually with only  56% having Security Information and Events Management (SIEM) systems deployed.  Process-based  incident detection is reported in only 23%. On the positive side it is necessary to mention that slightly  above a quarter of respondents (27%) indicated that they are using automated response based on  detected deviation from normal behavior and 35% have user behavior monitoring.  Therefore the same  conclusion as before:  The majority of eCommunication providers have stopped at basics of incident  management with less than half (48%) reviewing and updating their incident reporting plans.  Domain recommendations:   Adopt Service Management framework (e.g. ITIL) in particular where incident response procedure  is connected to root-cause analysis activities and subsequent problem management process.   Analyze de-facto as well as documented processes for the possibility of introducing high-level  incident detection controls, define incident response trigger points at process level.   Assign process-based incident detection controls review to the process owner.  Business continuity management  Domain Maturity level:  Satisfactory [High] Very High  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  34  High maturity domain together with Security of Systems and Facilities with 40% stating they have state-of- art disaster recovery capabilities and regularly update them. A significant number of providers (85%)  indicate availability of remote backups and geographically dispersed fail over sites.  Domain recommendations:   Introduce regular testing and update of policies and procedures as part of semi-annual business  continuity testing.  Monitoring, auditing and testing  Domain Maturity level:  Satisfactory [High] Very High  Another high maturity domain with a majority of respondents (90%) monitoring and testing critical system  and networks. Standard 60% have policies in place for both monitoring and testing. Main room for  improvement is security scan that lags below pre-deployment tests while it should be an integral part of  testing procedure.  Domain recommendations:   Make security testing part of pre-deployment testing procedure. Connect pre-deployment security  testing with integrity controls, introduce integrity monitoring of the systems and networks.   Reduce manual log analysis efforts by employing automated log review capabilities and integrate  this capability with SIEM systems.   Pay a particular attention to the effectiveness of automated capabilities (scanning and log review)  to ensure the capability is aligned with current business requirements as is capable to address the  ever changing threat landscape.   Consider the adoption of Continual Service Improvement (CSI) if adopting the whole ITIL  framework is not a business viable option.

Key points and Recommedations 31  Annex A: List of Security Domains and Objectives 35  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  05  Executive Summary  It is of utmost importance that providers of electronic communications take appropriate measures to  address major security concerns.  In this concise document the focus is on security measures the providers of electronic communications  have deployed to protect their networks for the provision of services, but equally important, the personal  and operational data of their customers.  The inputs for this report were obtained directly from providers by means of a survey and a few  accompanying interviews. The providers were asked to assess to what degree they have implemented  measures earlier recommended by ENISA.  Some of the main findings are the following:   The majority (63%) of providers have detailed information security policies in place that are  reviewed periodically. The documented security policy does not necessarily mean that there is a  single and comprehensive document for security policy.   Quite a high number of 60% of providers can differentiate between security incidents caused  internally and those caused by third parties.   The basic level of access control is implemented by the vast majority of electronic communication  providers. However, there is a discrepancy between having the policy document and effectiveness  of its implementation.   The European providers generally display a high operational maturity having personnel assigned  with responsibilities for key network and information systems. However, there is still room for  improvement about keeping a proper documentation and tracking of incidents on the critical  systems.   Intrusion detection systems are the most widely used incident detection capabilities with 67% of  providers having them in place.   While 88% of operators communicate and report incidents to third parties (government,  customers), only 50% have documented policies on incident reporting.  All-in-all, most of the providers report a very good level of using ENISA recommendations on security  requirements, while virtually all providers have deployed a good level of basic security controls. In some  security domains, the level of maturity reported is high as well as the sophistication of implemented  controls. Security of systems and facilities is an example of a security domain with a relatively high  maturity of measures adopted. For other domains, though, there is an ample room for improvement, and  in particular, the availability of specific policies and operational documentation is lower than desired.  A key conclusion is that while all IT security basics are covered, the achievement of the next level of  maturity is impeded mostly by lack of sustainability mechanisms, i.e. repeatable processes and the  regularly maintained documentation.  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  06  The main recommendation for the providers based on the reported deployment of security measures is to  pay additional attention to sustainability and efficiency. This is best achieved by the adoption of Service  Management frameworks and creating a series of processes that include measurement and periodic  reviews of security controls and capabilities in all domains.   All security controls are subject to degradation due to either threat advances, i.e. new exploitation  techniques like Zero-day vulnerabilities, or due to system configuration changes that happen for  reasons of software upgrades, additional business functions assumed by the same information  systems, personnel changes, etc. The way to ensure the efficiency of security control is the  introduction of periodic review and testing. Data collected from the surveys support the  conclusion that little effort is directed to periodic verification of the controls efficiency.   To support and facilitate the developments of the above it is recommended to adopt management  frameworks. The most common service management framework used by many e-communication  providers worldwide is ITIL1. In particular, Continual Service Improvement (CSI) is suggested for  adoption if adopting the whole framework is not a business viable option. CSI process is designed  to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of IT processes and services, and can be easily  expanded to cover security-related processes.  1 Information Technology Infrastructure Library, is a set of practices for IT service management (ITSM) that focuses on  aligning IT services with the needs of business. In its current form (known as ITIL V3), ITIL is published as a series of  five core volumes, each of which covers a different ITSM lifecycle stage.

Introduction  New regulatory requirements in the area of security and integrity of networks have been introduced in 2009 by  the Article 13a of the Framework Directive. On 14 September 2016 The European Commission presented a draft of  the legal overhaul of the telecoms regulatory package. The proposed Directive establishing the European  Electronic Communication Code brings also changes to the Article 13a, which is in the draft numbered as Article 40  under the heading “Security of networks and services”.2  In order to support the implementation of the Article 13a, ENISA has set up a group of experts comprising National  Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) from EU Member States plus EFTA countries. ENISA has also established a reference  group of experts from within providers of electronic communication networks and services which serves as a  forum for discussing their experience, ideas as well as ENISA draft reports.  Objectives of the report  The aim of this document is to provide an overview of good practices as regards security measures that are  deployed by electronic communication providers in Europe. In particular, the document aims to:  • Identify the implemented security measures and approaches within e-communication  providers in order to mitigate the main types of incidents in the telecommunications sector and  align the findings with earlier ENISA work in this area;  • Identify lessons learned from the above mentioned practices, security measures and  approaches;  • Identify security measures and approaches other than proposed by ENISA;  • Issue recommendations and good practices for e-communication providers.  • Provide support to NRAs and policy makers for tracking progress on security measures  adopted and for regulatory improvements.  Target audience  The intended target audience for this document are especially the electronic communication providers and  the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs). Both categories of stakeholders will get an overview on how  much the providers have progressed in implementation of security measures in individual security  domains. The document will provide support to NRAs as regards areas where they need to try to  encourage or commit providers to take more action. While not in every EU country electronic  communication infrastructure is labeled as critical, the protection of such infrastructure should be of  utmost importance. Constantly evolving threats and risks, if not directly targeting the communication  infrastructure, use it as a media to access infrastructure parts that have been labeled as parts of European  Critical Infrastructure (ECI). As important stakeholders NRAs strive to improve overall security practices  among electronic communication providers.  2 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposed-directive-establishing-european-electronic- communications-code  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposed-directive-establishing-european-electronic-communications-code https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposed-directive-establishing-european-electronic-communications-code  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  08  Last but not least the document may be useful also for policy makers at the level of the EU and the  Member States while preparing the review of the existing telecoms regulatory package.  Previous work undertaken by ENISA  ENISA has commissioned a number of reports and documents relating to the topic of security measures.  Among these, the following are the most significant:  Technical Guideline on Security Measures (version 2.0., October 2014)3  This document serves as a  guidance to NRAs on the implementation of Article 13a and in particular on the security measures that  providers of public communications networks must take to ensure security and integrity of these  networks. The document lists the minimum security measures NRAs should take into account when  evaluating the compliance of public communications network providers with paragraph 1 and 2 of Article  13a.  Guideline on Security measures for Article 4 and Article 13a4  - The document provides a guidance to  national competent authorities about the supervision of security measures in Article 13a of the Framework  Directive (2009/140/EC) and Article 4 of the e-Privacy directive (2002/58/EC). In particular, it lists security  measures national competent authorities should take into account when evaluating the compliance of  public communications network and service providers with paragraph 1 of Article 4 and paragraph 1 and 2  of Article 13a.  Technical Guideline on Threats and Assets5  - The document provides NRAs with a glossary of terms to  communicate about the most significant threats and network assets involved in disruptions in electronic  communications networks and services. The threats and assets described in this document are based on  past incidents, as reported by the NRAs to ENISA and the European Commission.  Impact evaluation on the implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU6  - The  document aims to assess the real impact of the Article 13a. The evaluation focused on five key areas: the  new security measures implemented in the member states, the transparency resulting from the incident  reporting process, the learning process resulting from incidents, the level of collaboration between the  stakeholders and the harmonization of the procedures within the European Union.  Methodology  Two main tools were employed in this project to become familiar with the security measures of the e- communication providers, an online survey and accompanying interviews with some of the providers who  have already responded to the survey. The aim was to get insights into how the providers assess their own  level of achievements in implementing the recommended set of security measures.  1.4.1 Online Survey  A survey consisting of 20 questions was commissioned for the delivery of this document. The core of the  survey was based on earlier ENISA documents relating to security measures, especially on the list of  security domains, objectives and measures and the level of sophistication of the measures. The document  Technical Guideline on Security Measures mentioned above includes a list of 25 security objectives  grouped in 7 security domains while each objective lists the respective security measures to reach the  3  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/technical-guideline-on-minimum-security-measures  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-for-article-4-and-article-13a  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/technical-guideline-on-threats-and-assets  6 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/impact-evaluation-article13a  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  09  security objectives (see Annex A:). The security measures are categorized into three levels of increasing  sophistication. This categorization was also used for the survey, which was conducted for this report. The  respondents were asked to attach sophistication levels to the security measures implemented. Not all the  security objectives and measures were included in the survey to keep it concise and manageable for the  respondents.  For most of the questions respondents were asked about the perceived level of sophistication  (implementation) of these measures. All main security objectives were covered by the survey apart from  Human resources security which was partly grouped with Governance and risk management. To keep the  survey concise and manageable for the respondents, not all of 25 security measures were included. On the  other hand, the survey touched upon specific measures against DDoS attacks, for SS7 protocol as well as  upon the security standards followed. For most of the questions the respondents had the option to provide  further details and clarifications.  The respondents included electronic communication providers from Europe, the vast majority of them  being from the EU Member States. The pool of respondents came from ENISA and their contractor’s  contacts among providers. The survey was conducted in the summer months of 2016. In total, 48  European providers responded to the online survey. The sample consisted of a variety of operators and  Internet service providers, the most of which provide their services over both fixed and mobile networks.  Their networks are rather sophisticated and the majority of them claims to have deployed fibre optics. The  main findings of the survey are analysed in the following chapter Error! Reference source not found..  Figure 1: Networks used for provision of services by the operators surveyed  1.4.2 Interviews  While the survey generated a good overview of the measures adopted and their perceived level of  sophistication, it was complemented by several interviews with selected stakeholders. The aim was to  better understand the rationale behind the approaches of individual providers and gather insights into  other areas not properly covered by the survey. The interviews were either conducted in person or via  electronic means while the interviewees had received the questionnaire in advance  75%  46%  90%  58%  77%  19%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  Fixed-line Cable Fibre-optics Mobile Wireless Access  Satellite  Networks for provision of services  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  10  Structure of the report  Chapter 2 provides in its charts and commentaries a more detailed overview of implemented security  measures, which is the core of this document. These measures are aligned according to the list of security  domains and objectives present in earlier documents of ENISA (see Error! Reference source not found.). In  ost cases, the sophistication of these measures is identified. The security domain of Human resources  security was loosely aligned with Governance and risk management and not all of security objectives  (measures) were subject of this exercise.  Chapter 3 draws conclusions on the findings and suggests areas for improvements and further steps to be  taken by the providers. Per each security domain a conclusion is drawn (on a three-grade scale) as regards  the maturity of the measures implemented. This chapter also includes some recommendations for the  providers of electronic communication.  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  11  2. Security measures adopted: status and level of sophistication  This chapter analyses the security measures adopted by electronic communication providers drawing on  the results of the survey and the accompanying interviews. It focuses mostly on the level of sophistication  (usually three-grade scale) of these measures as perceived by the operators. The security measures are  mainly introduced to protect the main assets of the operators, which are private and traffic data of  customers and the infrastructure that enables the provision of services. At the same time, anything that  impacts and threatens (the integrity) of customer data is considered as one of the main risks and threats as  the reputation of the company may be seriously damaged. As mentioned earlier, the structure of security  domains and security objectives from earlier ENISA documents serves as a basis for the analysis with a few  additional topics that are treated independently from the original list of security domains and objectives.  These additional topics are the compliance with international security standards and practices as well as  security measures employed against DDoS attacks and for SS7 protocol.  In the following analysis, we refer to sophistication levels of the measures. These broadly correspond to  three level applied in earlier ENISA documents and are cumulative, i.e. the level 2 includes all features of  level 1 and level 3 includes all features of levels 1 and 2.  Sophistication level 1 (basic):  • Basic security measures that could be implemented to reach the security objective.  • Evidence that basic measures are in place.  Sophistication level 2 (industry standard):  • Industry standard security measures to reach the objective and an ad-hoc review of the  implementation, following changes or incidents.  • Evidence of industry standard measures and evidence of reviews of the implementation  following changes or incidents  Sophistication level 3 (state of the art):  • State of the art (advanced) security measures, and continuous monitoring of  implementation, structural review of implementation, taking into account changes,  incidents, tests and exercises, to proactively improve the implementation of security  measures.  • Evidence of state of the art (advanced) implementation, evidence of a structural review  process, and evidence of pro-active steps to improve the implementation of security  measures  Governance and risk management  2.1.1 Information security policy  The information security policy is the first security objective covered by the above mentioned “Governance  and risk management” security domain. Almost two thirds of the operators claim they have reached the  third (highest) level of sophistication, i.e. that they have detailed information security policies in place that  are reviewed periodically. That could either mean that they consider their own information security  policies to be up to date and approved by senior management and/or that the review process is  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  12  documented taking into account violations, exceptions, past incidents, past tests/exercises as well as  incidents that affect other providers in the communications sector.  Figure 2: Information security policies as applied by European operators  While policy reviews indicate a higher information security maturity within the providers it is unclear why  the high-level policy number is relatively low. The high-level policy is a document stating information  security requirements for the organization at a corporate level and it is a key element of security  governance. The upper level document is usually followed by a series of more specific policies. There is a  number of public resources that can aid providers in creation of not only high level but also specific  policies. 7 8  The documented security policy does not necessarily mean a single and comprehensive document for  security policy. For example, one operator confirmed that they have specific information security policies  for information classification/management, access management, secure development of applications and  services and secure infrastructure Implementation. As regards the review of security policies, this includes,  for example, the evaluation of the current information security policies in line with the framework of the  ISO 27001 standard.  For the implementation of appropriate security policies the operators need to have a skilled work force at  their disposal. Usually the security roles are divided between separate divisions managed by CTO or CSO,  while very rarely there are only IT-security specific roles. Some operators have established security  committees (with their members coming from various departments) that oversee the implementation of  security policies. As regards the enhancement of IT security skills of employees, they often receive e- learning trainings on password policies, malware etc.  7 https://www.sans.org/security-resources/policies/  8 http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Security/Policy/Sample_Policies/  63% 58% 63%  2% 4%  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80%  High level information  security policy for communication networks and  services  Detailed information  security policy for critcal assets and  business processes  Detailed information  security policy reviewed  periodically  None Other  Information security policy in place  https://www.sans.org/security-resources/policies/ http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Security/Policy/Sample_Policies/  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  13  2.1.2 Risk management  The list of risks is an effective way to raise management awareness so they can make established  acceptable risk levels and quantities. Risk lists can be decentralized i.e. maintained by respective  departments of the provider if the central risk management function is not established.  Almost two thirds of operators keep a list of main risks for security and continuity of their networks and  services and their key personnel is aware of the main risks. A slightly lower share of operators have a  documented risk management methodology and tools and periodically review this methodology and tools  taking into account changes and past incidents.  Similarly, to the high-level security policy document, maintaining the list of risks is rather a low effort  exercise. Ideally, the deployment of risk management measures should be somewhat higher to indicate  that risk management receives appropriate attention.  Figure 3: Risk management framework  The providers often align business continuity management with security standards like ISO 22301 and  BCI (Business Continuity Institute) Good Practice Guidelines. Also, as with the previous topic of  information security policies, there are specific tools for different areas (IT or telecommunication  network) with different levels of sophistication.  2.1.3 Security requirements for contracts with third parties  The telecommunication providers need to implement a policy on security requirements in order to  procure and manage third-party networks and services like, for example, IT services, software, call- centres, shared facilities, interconnections etc.  Around 60% of providers include these requirements into the contracts and maintain and update  respective policies while keeping track of security incidents related to or caused by third parties. While  there is not much indication on the quality and coverage provided by the third party security policies,  the ability of 60,42% of providers to differentiate between security incidents caused internally and  externally can be considered as a very good achievement.  65%  56% 60%  6% 6%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  List of main risks in place  Documented risk management  methodology and tools  Risk management methodology and tools periodcally  reviewed  None Other  Risk management  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  14  Figure 4: Security requirements in contracts with third parties  When deciding whether to include security requirements in individual contracts with third parties, the  providers take into account, for example, the criticality of the systems/services or costs. It is important  to note that the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)9 defines the responsibilities for  entities that collect personal data (collectors) and process personal data (processors). As many of the  eCommunication providers deal with personal data in one or the other way, the GDPR will heavily affect  the majority of them. In case their role falls under definition of data collectors, it will be their  responsibility to track and inform about data breaches even if they are caused by the contracted third  parties.  Security of systems and facilities  2.2.1 Physical and environmental security of network and information systems and facilities  This particular area relates, inter alia, to the need for the providers to house critical and sensitive  information in secure areas and to protect them by defined security parameters along with appropriate  security barriers and entry controls. It also means that “physical protection against damage from fire,  flood, earthquake, explosion, civil unrest, and other forms of natural or man-made disaster should be  designed and applied.”10  For example, there are specific rules for building datacenters when the operators need to take into  account the surrounding area like the altitude or the close presence of a gas station.  9 http://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3e485e15-11bd-11e6-ba9a- 01aa75ed71a1/language-en  10 ISO27002, Chapter 9.1.4  60% 58% 60%  6% 4%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  Security requirements  included in contracts  Security policy for contracts with third parties  Keeping track of security incidents caused by third  parties  None Other  Security requirements in contracts with third parties  http://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3e485e15-11bd-11e6-ba9a-01aa75ed71a1/language-en http://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3e485e15-11bd-11e6-ba9a-01aa75ed71a1/language-en  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  15  Figure 5: Physical and environmental security  The vast majority of the providers (more than 80%) have measures in place to prevent an unauthorized  access to facilities which includes door and cabinet locks, burglar and fire alarms, fire extinguishers etc.  Almost two thirds of them implement a policy for physical security measures and physical and  environmental controls including industry standards.  These standards include electronic control of entrance and audit trail, segmentation of spaces according to  authorization levels, automated fire extinguishers with halocarbon gases and so on. Also, approximately  the same number (62.50%) of providers also evaluate and, when necessary, review and update the policies  for physical security measures and environmental controls in the light of changes and past incidents. These  figures can be considered as sufficiently high.  2.2.2 Access control measures  The electronic communication providers should have in place appropriate (logical) access controls for  access to network and information systems. This access should be controlled on the basis of business and  security requirements. The access control rules are categorized based on the criticality of data and also on  their life-cycle (when the data is stored, when it is destroyed).  The first grade (sophistication level) of access control rests with the access logs showing unique identifiers  for users and systems as well as an overview of authentication and access control methods for systems and  users. In almost 92% cases users have unique IDs and are authenticated for accessing the systems. In  around 40% of cases the providers protect passwords using standard cryptographic methods, shared  secrets and private keys before storing them on removable media without any additional access control.  The second sophistication level means that the providers have an access control policy in place including  description or responsibilities, groups, access rights and procedures for granting and revoking access. Also,  different types of authentication measures exist for different types of access. There is also a log of access  control policy violations and exceptions which is approved by security officers. Almost 80% of providers  claim to have such a policy in place that defines roles, responsibilities and procedures for access to  network and information systems. In more than 70% cases the authentication mechanisms differ  depending on the type of resource and access level and/or access is monitored and there is a process  dealing with exceptions and responding to access violations.  81%  65% 63%  2%  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%  Measures in place (door locks, alarms, fire  extinguishers etc.) to prevent unauthorized access  Documented policy and/or Industry standard controls  (electronic control of entrance, automated fire  extuinguishers)  Regular review of physical and environmental controls  Other  Physical and enivronmental security  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  16  The most mature handling of access controls is to evaluate the effectiveness of access control policies and  procedures and to review and, if needed, to revise them. Slightly less than a half of providers are doing  cross checks on access control mechanisms and more than 80% of providers review the access control  policy periodically.  Figure 6: Access control measures  The basic level of access control is implemented by vast majority of electronic communication providers.  However, there is a discrepancy between verifying the policy document and effectiveness of its  implementation. Checks on access control effectiveness should be stated in policy and executed at least as  often as access control policy review itself.  The following figure gives more detailed technical insights on the access controls implemented. The figure  covers both low-profile and high-profile security measures. It shows, for example, surprisingly quite a high  share (more than 58%) of operators claiming to implement certificate authentication with private key  protected by password, while over 31% go without password protection for the certificate authentication.  It is important to highlight the significant use of biometric authentication technology that was reported by  29.17% of eCommunication providers.  Responses of the surveyed and interviewed operators on the alignment of the technical access controls  with access control policy indicate a comparatively high maturity of the access control measures  implemented. A relatively wide use of biometric technology for authentication confirms that conclusion.  While the use of certificates without password protection can be explained by operational needs and no  password complexity enforcement by limited capabilities of embedded OS on the communication  92%  40%  79%  73%  71%  48%  81%  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%  Users have unique IDs and are authenticated for system access.  Passwords, shared secrets, and private keys are encrypted before stored on removable media, but no additional access  control is implemented.  There is a policy that defines roles, responsibilities, and procedures to access network and information systems.  Authentication mechanism differs based on type of resource and access level.  Access is monitored and there is a process to deal with exceptions and respond to access violations.  Cross checks on access control mechanisms are performed and effectiveness of policy is evaluated regularly.  Access control policy is reviewed periodically and revised as needed.  Access control measures implemented  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  17  equipment, both of these areas should be marked for improvement. And while the technical capability to  enforce password complexity may not be available on specific devices, the policy should clearly state the  access control security requirements11. Fulfilment of these requirements should be verified regularly.  Figure 7: Types of access control measures implemented  2.2.3 Integrity of network and information systems  The measures concerning integrity of network and information systems are those that provide protection  against malware, viruses and other common threats that can compromise the functionality of the systems.  Nine out of ten surveyed operators have implemented the basic level of integrity. That means that  software and data in network and information systems are protected by input controls, firewalls,  encryption and signing. Security critical data are protected by separate storage, encryption, hashing etc.  and malware detection systems are in place and they are up to date.  The second stage of maturity of measures in this area concerns proper documentation of software and  data in network and systems, availability of tools for detection of anomalous usage and behaviour of  systems and logs of intrusion detection and anomaly detection systems. 75% of operators have deployed  these mechanisms to detect whether the network or information systems have been tampered with or  altered.  11 https://www.sans.org/security-resources/policies/general#password-construction-guidelines  23%  94%  31%  54%  31%  58%  29%  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%  Passwords without complexity enforcement  Passwords with complexity enforcement  Hardware event or time-based one-time password token  Software event or time-based one-time password token  Certificate authentication without private key protected by password  Certificate authentication with private key protected by password  Biometric authentication (finger, palm, face, iris reader, etc.)  Technical access controls implemented  https://www.sans.org/security-resources/policies/general#password-construction-guidelines  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  18  State of the art measures, which are the highest on the sophistication scale, are implemented by 27% of  operators. These measures aimed at protection of the integrity of the systems include file-level and binary  integrity controls. Also, integrity controls are monitored and evaluated for effectiveness and revised if  needed. The controls may not be in place in all systems - depending on risk assessment.  Figure 8: Integrity of network and information systems  The integrity controls implemented range from basic ones like firewalls to automated restoration of the  system desired state in a case the integrity being compromised. Some 75% of operators have integrity  controlled at the firewall level, while almost 69% have implemented intrusion detection systems and  62,5% have intrusion prevention systems in place.  In addition to that it is worth noting a relatively high level of implementation of file level integrity controls  on critical systems (48%), while the SIEM implementation could be highlighted as the main area for  improvement. There is a discrepancy between implementation of configuration files integrity (25%) and  file-level integrity controls on critical systems (see above).  Some 23% of operators claim that they have deployed automated mechanisms for restoring the systems to  the desired level in case their integrity is compromised.  90%  75%  27%  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%  Input controls and firewalls are implemented and/or Passwords, shared secrets, private keys are not disclosed  Anti-malware measures are implemented and/or Defense in depth is implemented.

Integrity of network and information systems  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  19  Figure 9: Integrity controls implemented  Operations management  2.3.1 Operational procedures  The providers need to establish and maintain procedures for the management and operation of  information processing facilities. The vast majority (90%) of electronic communication providers have  assigned responsibilities for key network and information systems.  Over half (54%) of them have introduced respective policies to make sure that all critical systems are  operated and managed according to pre-defined procedures. These policies are regularly reviewed and  updated. Some providers align the operational procedures with business continuity and information  security programs, where critical services and systems are identified.  The European providers generally display a high operational maturity having the personnel with assigned  responsibilities for the key network and information systems. However, proper documentation  maintenance and incident tracking on the critical systems should be improved.  75%  69%  63%  58%  48%  8%  23%  25%  23%  0% 20% 40% 60% 80%  Integrity is controlled at the firewall level  Intrusion detection systems  Intrusion prevention systems  Security and event management system (SIEM)  File-level integrity controls on critical systems  File-level integrity controls on all systems  Binaries are signed and verified at deployment  Configuration files integrity check is implemented  Automated system is implemented that restores desited state of the system if integrity is compromised  Integrity controls implemented  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  20  Figure 10: Operational procedures for critical network and information systems  2.3.2 Change management procedures  The change management procedures are established in order to minimise the likelihood of disruptions and  errors resulting from the changes. The main goal of change management is to ensure reliable and timely  implementation of change requestes with minimal operational efforts. The change management  procedure (along with many others) is described in IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL)12. According to the ENISA  Annual incident report, in 2015 human errors was the root cause category involving most users affected,  around 2.6 million user connections on average per incident. Over 81% of providers follow predefined  procedures when making changes to critical systems. Around 65% of providers document change  management proceduress while these are reviewed by 56,25% of them taking account of changes and past  incidents.

Advancement of threats and their growing sophistication requires  companies to invest in incident management and response in addition to the introduction of preventive  measures. Three quarters of the surveyed providers claim that their personnel are trained to be able to  respond to incidents and that they record all major incidents.  A slightly lower number (approx. 73%) of providers have developed incident response policies that define  roles and responsibilities and contain specific procedures depending on type of incident. Over 62% of  providers implement the measures that are highest on the sophistication scale. This means they create  incident management reports for all major incidents and they review and evaluate them periodically to  update incident management procedures.  Incident management records and reports are created for major incidents when considered relevant.  Within the scope of information security, incident management is more mature for continuity-related  incidents (more frequent) and less mature for personal data-related incidents (less frequent).  It is interesting to note that the percentage of respondents with more advanced incident management  procedures, periodic review and improvement of incident management procedures, roughly corresponds  to the number of providers that implemented SIEM and Intrusion Detection/Preventions systems.  Figure 12: Incident management procedures implemented  2.4.2 Incident detection capabilities  Almost 69% of providers have implemented incident detection systems and processes. For 73% of them  incident detection is a continuous managed process that involves detection of incidents and their  forwarding to appropriate personnel for resolution. About 65% of providers review their incident detection  systems periodically while using network and information changes as well as past incidents to improve  incident detection capabilities.

It is likely to be attributed to the existence of  written policies and procedures that are not necessarily supported by operational capabilities.  Figure 13: Level of incident detection capability implemented  Incident management records and reports are created for major incidents when considered relevant.  Within the scope of Information Security, incident management is more mature for continuity-related  incidents (more frequent) and less mature for personal data related incidents (less frequent).  Intrusion detection systems are the most widely used incident detection capabilities with two thirds of the  providers stating they have them in place. 60% of providers do manual log review of firewall and network  devices and the same number of providers have this process automated. In-house Security Operation  Centre is the case for 56% of operators, while only 10% have this facility outsourced. User behaviour  monitoring system is used by 58% of providers while around 23% of them have implemented business  process aware incident detection, both of which can be considered as a very good achievement.  69% 73%  65%  6%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  Incident detection systems and  processes implemented  Incidents detected and forwarded to  appropriate personnel for  resolution  Incident detection systems periodically  evaluated and reviewed  None  Incident detection capabilities  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  23  Figure 14: Typical features of incident detection capability  2.4.3 Incident reporting and communication procedures  The providers are recommended to establish and maintain sound procedures for incident reporting and  communication that take into account national regulations on incident reporting to government  authorities. A total of 87.5% of providers communicate and report incidents to third parties like  government authorities and their customers. Only 50% of them have their own policies in place on incident  reporting which includes reasons and motivation for communication, the incident type, reports’ content,  communication channels and communication roles, templates for incident reporting etc. Even lower  number (48%) of providers carry out a regular review of the reporting and communication plans.  60%  60%  67%  58%  56%  52%  10%  35%  27%  23%  58%  0% 20% 40% 60% 80%  Firewall and network devices log review performed manually  Automated firewall and network devices log review  Intrusion detection systems  Intrusion prevention systems  Security incident and event management (SIEM)  In-house Security Operation Center (SOC)  Outsourced Security Operations Center (SOC)  User behavior monitoring system  Automated response based on detected deviation from normal behaviour  Business process aware incident detection  Fraud detection software and systems  Typical features of incident detection capabilty  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  24  Figure 15: Incident reporting and communication procedures  Notification to NRAs and customers is usually carried out under the requirements of Article 13a, which  were transposed to national legislation. The communication procedures are focused on service  interruption incidents, which are related to impact on customers, services provided and the resulting  reputation of the company.  Business continuity management  2.5.1 Disaster recovery capabilities  Disaster recovery capabilities serve to restore network and communication services following natural and  other major disasters. More than 85% of providers have implemented basic measures in this regard as  failover sites in other regions or backups of critical data in remote locations.  About 60% of surveyed providers have documented policies for deploying these capabilities, which may  include list of disasters with a potential to impact upon service provision as well as a list of disaster recover  capabilities available internally or provided by third parties.  Roughly 40% of providers have set up state of the art disaster recovery capabilities like full redundancy and  failover mechanisms. They also review their disaster recovery capabilities regularly. All numbers indicate  an overall high maturity of operators in disaster recovery capabilities.  One of the operators has provided valuable insights to their disaster recovery measures: “In addition to DR  for some services, the network architecture is defined to incorporate, when relevant, redundancy  capabilities. For example, some network platforms are implemented in a balanced/distributed architecture  (i.e., all the network traffic is distributed between all the identical platforms). In case of failure of one of  those platforms, the traffic is automatically re-routed. This can be considered an Active-Active architecture,  instead of the Active-Passive architecture of the DR.”  88%  50% 48%  2% 4%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  Incidents reported to third parties when  necessary  Own policies on incident reporting  Periodic review and update of the  reporting plans  None Other  Incident reporting and communication procedures  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  25  Figure 16: Disaster recovery capabilities  Monitoring, auditing and testing  2.6.1 Monitoring and logging of critical network and communication systems  Systems should be monitored and information security events should be recorded. Operator logs and fault  logging should be used to ensure information system problems are identified. Around 90% of providers  indicate that they carry out logs and monitoring reports of critical network and information systems.  A much lower number (58%) of providers have also implemented policies for monitoring and logging  including minimum logging and monitoring requirements. A very high share 63% of operators have set up  tools for automated collection and analysis of monitoring data and logs.

Rigorous testing of systems and network equipment saves a significant  amount of time by reducing troubleshooting times and improves network availability. Just like with  monitoring approximately nine out of ten providers produce test reports of the network and information  systems, which includes tests following big changes or the introduction of new systems. A majority of  62,5% claim to have policies and procedures in place as well as tools for automated testing. 54% of them  review and update testing policies and procedures.

This covers,  inter alia, also penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. The security assessment is a tool that  ensures intended functionality of security controls. Only two thirds of operators carry out regular security  scans and testing especially when introducing new systems or following changes. While it is possible to use  an availability as an excuse this number can be improved by performing security assessments of sliding  schedule or combined with failover testing.  A somewhat lower number (58%) of providers have in place documented procedures/policies concerning  the types of assets, the circumstances, frequency, confidentiality levels for assessments and test results  etc. as one of the surveyed providers put it: “We have policies for secure development of applications and  services and secure infrastructure implementation that include security testing checklists and risk  evaluation matrixes.” Some 56% of providers undertake regular review and update of these procedures.  Figure 19: Security assessments of network and information systems  Security standards, frameworks and guidelines  The security measures used in ENISA documents have been often adapted from various existing  international network and information security standards, guidelines and good practices. These standards,  that may be either mandated or recommended to the providers, provide them with guidance, terminology,  structure for supervision and auditing, baseline etc. Standards of ISO, especially ISO/IEC 27001  “Information security management systems” are the most widely used with 75% of providers claiming to  adhere to the ISO 27001. On the positive side it is worth to mention the proliferation of standards and  frameworks the practicality of which has been proven by the number of adopters in various industries,  including those other than the electronic communication providers. ISO 27000 group of standards and  parts of ITIL Service Management Framework have been reported with the highest adoption rate. ENISA’s  Technical Guideline is used by 17% providers. It was designed rather as a “soft approach” guideline only  and is probably seen as a driver for adoption of more detailed and more specific frameworks and  standards. It is also surprising to see such a high level of providers indicating the adoption of ISO 27001  standard, that contains Information Security Management System (ISMS) performance evaluation and  67%  58% 56%  8%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  Critical systems undergo security scans and testing  Documented policy/procedures for security assessments  Regular review of procedures  None  Security assessments of network and information systems  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  28  improvement requirements, while a significantly lower number in reality carries out periodic review of  efficiency of various security controls.

There are  many types of DDoS attacks, for example:  - Transport protocol based attacks aim to overload the target system with large volume of TCP, UDP, or  ICMP requests forcing the loss of similar requests from legitimate sources thus rendering the target  system non-responsive.  - Bandwidth exhaustion attack is similar to the above with the difference that malicious agents try to  overload the target with large amounts of bogus data.  - Application level attacks exploit application limitation to process requests in volumes and sizes  generated by malicious agents. While specific application may be under DDoS attack, other  applications running on the same infrastructure may also be affected as application competes for  computational and memory resources in an attempt to handle the requests volume.  Slightly more than a half of the providers indicate use of configurations (traffic limitation) to counter DDoS  attacks as well as close monitoring. Approximately a half of them use specialized hardware (i.e. Arbor  Networks) and less than 10% rely on upstream providers for DDoS mitigation. According to ENISA Annual  Incident Report for 2015 the incidents caused by malicious actions (e.g. DDoS), although there were not  many of them, had most impact in terms of duration, which lasted on average almost two days per  incident.13  Based on the low percentage of incidents the conclusion is that the defenses employed by providers are  sufficiently effective. At the time of writing, however, DDoS attacks had been on the rise with the use of  Internet of Things (IoT) devices as malicious agents.14 Those attacks are characterized by a significantly  increased volume of traffic so deployed defenses should be evaluated for the capability to withstand the  new attack levels.  Figure 21: Measures against DDoS attacks  13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/annual-incident-reports-2015  14 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2016/  48%  6% 4%  38%  4%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  Basic n/a None Product Upstream  Measures against DDoS attacks  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/annual-incident-reports-2015 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2016/  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  30  Measures for the SS7 protocol  SS7 protocol based attacks present a significant threat not only to the service providers but also to the  users to the point where the attacker can not only track the user location and access the information on  the connected mobile device, but also redirect the calls.15 16 17 Security measures are required to protect  attackers from:  1) Accessing private data residing on user’s mobile device;  2) Committing fraud e.g. transfer of funds;  3) Disrupt normal operation of the network.  Due to the age of the SS7 protocol (it was designed in the 70s) the majority of the security issues lie in the  architecture and configuration design and are not easy to resolve.  SS7 protection is a topic with a high diversity of security measures implemented. About 40% of  respondents indicated deployment of the SS7 firewalls with additional less than 10% relying on access  controls to prevent unauthorized access to the SS7 network. The rest of answers range from monitoring,  SS7 intrusion and fraud detection systems to administrative/procedural controls. As no data is available to  determine the widespread occurrence of SS7 specific security incidents it is difficult to reach a conclusion  on the subject given the variety of methods employed.

Key points and Recommedations  All-in-all, approximately 60% of providers report a very good level of compliance with ENISA security  requirements, while virtually all providers have deployed a good level of basic security controls. In some  security domains, the level of maturity reported is high as well as the sophistication of implemented  controls. Security of systems and facilities is an example of a security domain with a relatively high  maturity of measures adopted. For other domains, though, there is an ample room for improvement, in  particular as regards the availability of specific policies and operational documentation is lower than  desired.  With a growing sophistication of attacks the basic level of security controls may not provide sufficient  protection and the higher level of security controls maturity is essential. Many providers seem to realize  the necessity of qualitative security control improvement and have deployed sophisticated technical  controls. A key conclusion seems to be that while all IT security basics are covered, the achievement of the  next level of maturity is impeded mostly by lack of sustainability mechanisms, i.e. repeatable processes  and the regularly maintained documentation.  A general quantitative breakdown based on self-assessment indicates that approximately 25% of providers  have advanced capabilities in one or more security domains, and approximately 60% have satisfactory  capabilities in all domains. Below are the quick conclusions drawn per each security domain. A three-grade  maturity scale is applied for the conclusions on individual security domains.  Satisfactory High Very High  Providers indicated presence  and functionality of basic  security controls.  Providers indicated presence of  advanced security controls and  ad-hoc processes in place,  usually in reaction to a security  event.  Providers indicated proactive  security posture with  combination of advanced and  basic security controls verified  regularly according to well  established policies and  processes.  The main recommendation for the providers based on the analysis of the deployment of their security  measures is to pay additional attention to the sustainability and efficiency. This is best achieved by the  adoption of Service Management frameworks and by creating a system that includes measurement and  periodic reviews of security controls and capabilities in all domains.  Governance and risk management  Domain Maturity level:  [Satisfactory] High Very High  Around 60% of respondents report good practices for security governance and risk management. The  maturity level of the whole domain is ranked as satisfactory because high-level governance documents and  their periodic review is a relatively low effort exercise. Therefore; it is expected that at least the basic level  of maturity is reported by at least 90% of respondents. Only 56% of providers employ the risk  management methodology, while registering the risks is a first step towards effective risk management  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  32  program and is reported by 65% of providers. It is surprising that there is not a higher number of providers  taking the next step of addressing risks with mitigation techniques.

Reference  ource not found. to develop necessary company-wide topics for all aspects of security.   The starting point for proper risk management should be ISO 2700518 standard to turn risk  management from ad-hoc human-driven activity into the properly managed business process.   Select and adopt ISO or any other risk management framework that allows to build the processes  to regularly and systematically address risks registered in the lists of risks.  Security of systems and facilities  Domain Maturity level:  Satisfactory [High] Very High  High level of implementation of soft- and hardware based tokens for multi-factor authentication as well as  a significant presence of biometric authentication would make security of systems and facilities one of the  domains that demonstrates a very high maturity. Unfortunately, this significant achievement is offset by  only a very basic set of integrity controls. Preventing unauthorized changes to the systems is as important  as proper access control. Undesired changes are not necessarily a consequence of an attack, but often a  result of a simple human error.  The detection of the binary or configuration file modification by integrity  controls provides an additional layer of system security. In this respect it is noteworthy that some of the  eCommunication providers have realized the significance and deployed system-level file integrity controls  on critical systems and even built capability to automatically restore system to desired state in the case the  said state has been altered.  Domain recommendations:   Improve integrity controls by a wider adoption of file and filesystem-level integrity controls.   Pay a particular attention to automated restore of desired configuration for critical systems and  integrity control of binary and configuration files deployed on them.  Operation management  Domain Maturity level:  [Satisfactory] High Very High  The operation management domain is a perfect illustration to the overall conclusion summarized at the  beginning of this chapter. 81% of providers follow predefined procedures for change management and  90% have the responsibilities assigned. With all basics covered the number of respondents who document  18 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=56742  http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=56742  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  33  their change management procedures falls to 65%, and even further when it comes to a periodic review of  change management procedures – this is done by only 56% of respondents. This is aligned with another  data point – low percentage of respondents who are utilizing ITIL framework. Service management  frameworks allow for a better service delivery that in turn leads to higher customer satisfaction and  reduced incident costs.  Domain recommendations:   Adopt Service Management framework (e.g. ITIL) in particular where it describes change  management.   Keep in mind that change management process is tightly connected to both problem and incident  management.   Document de-facto processes, nominate process owners with assigned responsibility for periodic  review and update of operation management documentation.  Incident Management  Domain Maturity level:  [Satisfactory] High Very High  This domain too that has well developed detection capabilities that are followed by incidents being  assigned to appropriate personnel for resolution. However, when confronted with a list of specific controls  that are part of their incident management capability, the providers emphasize the detection capability  while review and update of procedures lack behind. The same value around 60% is reported for everything  from fraud detection capabilities to automated log reviews. It is interesting to see that half of respondents  run in-house Security Operation Centers, but 60% indicate that they review the logs manually with only  56% having Security Information and Events Management (SIEM) systems deployed.  Process-based  incident detection is reported in only 23%. On the positive side it is necessary to mention that slightly  above a quarter of respondents (27%) indicated that they are using automated response based on  detected deviation from normal behavior and 35% have user behavior monitoring.  Therefore the same  conclusion as before:  The majority of eCommunication providers have stopped at basics of incident  management with less than half (48%) reviewing and updating their incident reporting plans.  Domain recommendations:   Adopt Service Management framework (e.g. ITIL) in particular where incident response procedure  is connected to root-cause analysis activities and subsequent problem management process.   Analyze de-facto as well as documented processes for the possibility of introducing high-level  incident detection controls, define incident response trigger points at process level.   Assign process-based incident detection controls review to the process owner.  Business continuity management  Domain Maturity level:  Satisfactory [High] Very High  Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers  December 2016  34  High maturity domain together with Security of Systems and Facilities with 40% stating they have state-of- art disaster recovery capabilities and regularly update them. A significant number of providers (85%)  indicate availability of remote backups and geographically dispersed fail over sites.  Domain recommendations:   Introduce regular testing and update of policies and procedures as part of semi-annual business  continuity testing.  Monitoring, auditing and testing  Domain Maturity level:  Satisfactory [High] Very High  Another high maturity domain with a majority of respondents (90%) monitoring and testing critical system  and networks. Standard 60% have policies in place for both monitoring and testing. Main room for  improvement is security scan that lags below pre-deployment tests while it should be an integral part of  testing procedure.  Domain recommendations:   Make security testing part of pre-deployment testing procedure. Connect pre-deployment security  testing with integrity controls, introduce integrity monitoring of the systems and networks.   Reduce manual log analysis efforts by employing automated log review capabilities and integrate  this capability with SIEM systems.   Pay a particular attention to the effectiveness of automated capabilities (scanning and log review)  to ensure the capability is aligned with current business requirements as is capable to address the  ever changing threat landscape.   Consider the adoption of Continual Service Improvement (CSI) if adopting the whole ITIL  framework is not a business viable option.

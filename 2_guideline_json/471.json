Executive Summary  For the fourth consecutive year, last October the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) campaign took place across  Europe. The campaign was supported by ENISA, the European Commission, Europol’s EC3 and the European Banking  Federation, plus partners from the Member States, the support for which propelled the campaigns success as  measured by both the qualitative and quantitative data compiled.  Although this year’s campaign broke all previous  growth records, the conclusions of this reports highlight a number of fundamental issues that need to be addressed  in the coming years if the campaign is to reach its original objective which was to influence the security behaviour  of citizens online. The weaknesses that have been highlighted, will be clarified and qualified in the coming year  within the context of a campaign assessment. However within this report, recommendations are made to address  these shortfalls in the near term.  The following recommendations have been put forward to mitigate these shortfalls:   Draw up comprehensive communication plan with the assistance of the ENISA communications team and  external expertise   Populate the newly created website depository with partner material / information and seek ways to utilize  this as an information hub for citizens   Seek to create PPP’s amongst partners and private companies that have demonstrated a willingness to work  in awareness raising   Build into the budgetary decision making process impact analysis that documents the perceived impact  versus the cost, time and quality of budgetary decision.   Re-focus the work plan on the goals and objectives of the campaign before considering which methodology  to follow.  A crucial aspect of the evaluation was the extent to which the campaign addressed the overall objectives.  A number  of observations can be made regarding the impact towards some of these objectives such as the involvement of  relevant stakeholders and the media’s interest in Cyber Security which were indeed the case for both objectives.  The other more crucial observation regarding the impact towards raising general awareness especially to the EU  citizen, cannot be so easily made given the current data gathering methods used to evaluate the campaign.  Turning back to the objectives of European Cyber Security Month (ECSM), which were to promote cyber security  awareness among citizens, to modify their perception of cyber threats and to provide updated security information  through education, good practices and competitions. Each Member State decided upon the scope and how best to  tackle these objectives given their experience and knowledge of the local community; and the number of activities  and events it organised. ENISA provided guidance and expertise on how to organise information security campaigns,  together with tips and advice on how to be safe online. Moreover, the Agency provided access to the  cybersecuritymonth.eu, posters, infographics and social media for participating countries to promote their activities.  This report provides an overview of the activities organised and presents a synthesis of findings on the basis of  evaluation and performance information gathered via a questionnaire and media monitoring data.  The report is structured into three main parts: an introduction, the implementation phase and an evaluation of the  campaign.  The introduction will provide readers with the policy context, scope and target audience of the campaign.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  06  The implementation phase of the report highlights the mile stones that were achieved during the planning and  execution phase of the campaign.  This includes how events were organized and co-ordinated with partners,  marketing materials used and insights into the execution of the campaign including results.  The final section of the report deals with the evaluation of the campaign, comparing this year’s results with the  previous year’s and also provides input from the partners that was generated via a questionnaire; and finishes with  a conclusion and outlook for the future.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  07  2. Introduction  In early 2013 the EU published the “Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union”1 as a means to safeguard the  online environment and providing the highest possible freedom and security, for the benefit of EU citizens. This  strategy was jointly adopted by the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and  Security Policy. It outlines the EU's vision in this domain, clarifies roles and responsibilities and proposes specific  activities at EU level. Its goal is to ensure strong and effective protection and promotion of citizens' rights so as to  make the EU's online environment the safest in the world.  End users play a crucial role in ensuring security of networks and information systems. In this context they need to  be made aware of the risks they face online and be empowered to take simple steps to guard against them. Several  initiatives were developed in recent years. In particular, in October 2012, ENISA, with some Member States, piloted  the \"European Cyber Security Month\" campaign.  In the context of the ECSM project, the Commission invited the Member States to organise a yearly cybersecurity  month with the support of ENISA and the involvement of the private sector, with the goal to raise awareness among  end users. ECSM and the private sector were also encouraged to join efforts in order to promote cybersecurity  awareness at all levels, both in business practices and in the interface with customers.  ECSM runs for the entire month of October, with ENISA publishing new material and focusing on a different topic  each week. Along with ENISA, various stakeholders, ranging from the private sector, education, the European  Commission (EC) and other EU bodies, join together in a common vision by organising activities with special focus  on training, strategy summits, online quizzes and provide general presentations to end users toward the  establishment of an EU cyber-security culture.  This report summarises the activities carried out by ENISA and its partners for this year’s ECSM campaign and  presents the evaluation results and conclusions. More importantly, it seeks to trigger a discussion among partners  with respect to improvements that can be made for ECSM to strategically achieving its objectives in the future.  Scope and Objectives  The scope of this evaluation includes all the campaigns activities and their impact within 2016, comparing the results  with those of 2015, and also measuring the extent by which these activities addressed the campaign’s objectives.  The main objectives of the campaign were as follows:   to generate general awareness about Network and Information Security;   to promote safer use of the Internet for all users;   to build a strong track record to raise awareness through the ECSM;   to involve relevant stakeholders;   to increase national media interest through the European and international dimension of the  project;  1 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-cybersecurity-strategy-european-union- %E2%80%93-open-safe-and-secure-cyberspace  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  08   to enhance attention and interest with regard to information security through political and media  coordination.  The evaluation results and estimated impact of the ECSM activities shall allow us to discuss lessons learned deriving  from this exercise and shall help us to draw attention to related issues, hence acquiring a broader view for further  enhancing the ECSM’s development and effectiveness.  In addition, among other aims, analysis is intended to provide a basis for discussion by the Member States, the  European Commission and ENISA on how the ECSM can best be organised in the years to come. All countries will be  in need to face up to a similar challenge, namely how to engage citizens to change their information security  behaviour.  Evaluation Methodology  ENISA gathered information with regards the organization and achievements of the campaign using two distinct  methods:  1. by feedback from ECSM partners given a Q&A questionnaire, and  2. by the use of media monitoring services to gather analytical data.  The questionnaire aimed at extracting pertinent information on the overall impact of the campaign based on  partners’ feedback with respect to ENISA’s supportive role. More specifically, some of the elements assessed involve  the level of support and its usefulness provided to partners, the impact of promotion material used and marketing  strategies followed, future engagement with the private sector or other international campaigns, etc.  The data gathered by the media monitoring service was aggregated by combining data elements from different  sources to provide insights and identify the effectiveness of the messages, media channels and the campaign as a  whole in reaching the general population.  Target Audience  This evaluation is intended for organisations, either public or private, which supported the ECSM or intend to do so  in the future, as well as IT security professionals and other target groups who attended events and conferences  organised across Europe during the month of October 2016.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  09  3. Planning Phase  ENISA supported the organisation of the European Cyber Security Month campaign in various ways, such as:   coordinator of the organisation of the ECSM;   hub for all participating countries;   collector of available material and generator of synergies between countries;   subject-matter expert on how to organise information security campaigns;   facilitator of common messaging within the participating countries by providing tips and advice on how  to be safe and secure online;   creator of the ECSM brand and related marketing plan;   distributor of promotional material (posters and infographics).  The Agency coordinated the organisation of the ECSM campaign, by means of becoming a “hub” for all participating  countries and providing suggestions, replying to enquiries and generating synergies between countries when  possible.  ENISA provided guidance and expertise by organizing a monthly conference call with all partners so as to seek  synergies, collaboration and guide the campaign. The common message of “Cyber Security is a Shared  Responsibility” was promoted among Member States and material was provided to help with their cyber security  education and awareness campaigns. This material was recognised by all countries as an important tool in reaching  people and getting them to change their behaviour, or to reinforce good behaviour.  This material included:   tips and advice to provide in-depth information on how to stay safe in a variety of online settings, for  example on social networking sites, on gaming sites and on your mobile device;   posters and infographics2;   social media web banners3;   video clips4;   NIS Quiz5.  Moreover, the Agency produced promotional material for the Member States to help promote awareness messages  and also helped to identify speakers for events.  The planning phase of the campaign started in earnest with a request to partners from previous year’s campaign  to join the monthly conference calls.  The graph below depicts the mile stones of the planning phase leading up to October and also the execution  phase.  It highlights key events, meetings, conference and phases of the campaign.  2 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/press-campaign-toolbox/material  3 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/press-campaign-toolbox/visual-identity  4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr-gVUG9koM  5 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/quiz-demonstration/intro  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  10  Coordination  3.1.1.1 Conference Calls and Meetings  Monthly conference calls with partners were scheduled in order to update partners on the plans, get feedback and  hear from partners on their national campaign plans. These calls provided opportunities for partners to seek  synergies and form collaborations. Minutes where drawn up by ENISA after every call, including a list of action points  and after approval from the Head of Unit they were distributed to the conference call participants. As expected the  participation rate increased as the campaign month draw near with an average of 10 to 15 participants on the call  at a time.  During the year a number of face to face meetings were held with partners in order to finalize key areas of the  campaign such as the themes of the month and the organization and logistics of the kick-off event.  These were held  at partner offices in Brussels and in ENISA offices in Athens.  3.1.1.2 Themes of the Month Survey  A survey was launched amongst the partners to determine which would be the four themes of the month, one  theme for each of the weeks in October.  ENISA suggested twelve possible themes for the partners to choose from and with the help of the partners  throughout regular meetings and discussions, these themes were eventually narrowed down to the four most  prominent as shown below:  Figure 1: ECSM timeline of events planning  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  11  1st week – October 3-7: Cyber Security in Banking – supported by the European Banking Federation  2nd week – October 10-14: Cyber Training  3rd week – October 17-21: Cyber Safety  4th week – October 24-28: Mobile Malware – supported by Europol EC3  3.1.1.3 Kick-Off Event  Collaboration was forged early in the year with the European Banking Federation, who approached ENISA requesting  to host the kick-off event at their premises in Brussels but also to promote various activities with respect to the first  theme-week of October, that of Security in Banking. On the other hand Europol EC3 was engaged into promoting  the forth theme of the month directly related to secure practices with mobile devices. These collaborations were  well received by the ECSM partners during the monthly conference calls, and plans were put in motion to organize  the event. Three face to face meetings were eventually held between key partners for the organizational details of  the kick-off event.  Responsibilities for the arrangements of the communications and the logistics for the event were determined early  on, with two documents being drawn up, the “Common Communication Strategy” and the “Script” of activities for  the kick-off event. The former document aimed at aligning the partner’s messages and press releases on the day of  the event, while the latter provided a detailed outline of how the event would pan out in real time including roles,  responsibilities and contact points.  Policy makers, industry experts and representatives from competent authorities were invited to attend the launch  and had been encouraged to come forward as speakers or panellists for either of the four sessions on the weekly  themes, including:   Security in banking   Cyber security training   Cyber safety (child extortion, cyber bullying & IOT)   Mobile malware  Furthermore, in practice the planning phase consisted of an extensive consultation with stakeholders like the  Commission, NLO network, and international partners in order to come up with a consolidated version that anyone  could easily follow. Regarding the management of the communication process, all feedback, issues and ideas were  tackled in a tailored manner to fit the needs and purposes of organisations involved.  Marketing Material  A series of activities were planned to market the European Cyber Security Month project. The following sub  categories identify the various marketing solutions of the campaign.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  12  3.2.1.1 Visual identity  To strengthen visibility and public recognition of the European Cyber Security Month, ENISA created some years ago  a visual identity including a logo6, a colour chart, typography rules, guidelines on use of imagery, design templates  and a manual of formal guidelines on the proper use of these elements.  The design was created following consultation with the Member States and the European Commission and the logo  was used by partners on their material, videos and social media to link their efforts up to the European campaign.  3.2.1.2 Slogan  The slogan ‘Cyber Security is a Shared Responsibility’ was created to give the project an identity and a positive image.  It has been used in this year’s campaign and included with posters, infographics and the cybersecuritymonth.eu  website. The slogan was also promoted for use by the member states that organized their local activities and at  ENISA’s press releases.  3.2.1.3 Press releases  The European Cyber Security Month featured a diverse range of activities and events, and as part of the build-up  ENISA launched press releases7 that aimed to bring anticipation to the launch of the campaign.  3.2.1.4 Social media - banners  The dedicated social media accounts of Twitter and  Facebook were used as a medium for disseminating  useful advice about information security in general, as  well as tips and recommendations on how to protect your  PC and personal and business information. The accounts  provided information on the campaign and assisted in  engaging the digital citizen.  3.2.1.5 Poster and Infographics  An ECSM 2016 poster8 was created to highlight the four themes of the month, the kick-off event and the overall  message that this is a European wide effort with a single underlying message. A number of partner member states  participated in the creation of a dedicated country infographics.  Each country infographic highlighted the key  information and data regarding their campaigns and achievements. A total of 10 countries participated in creating  an infographic. Finally ENISA created a single unified infographic of the achievements of this year’s campaign.  6 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/press-campaign-toolbox/visual-identity  7 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/a-week-to-go-for-the-european-cyber-security-month-launch-1  8 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/press-campaign-toolbox/material  Figure 2: ECSM 2016 facebook banner.

European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  14  3.2.1.7 Website  The ECSM website11 was re-organized at the beginning of the year and the home page was given a facelift.  Changes  took into consideration websites of similar awareness raising campaigns, which included the addition of a  countdown clock leading up to the 1st October and more user friendly navigation to the relevant areas. Alas a  dedicated partner page was introduced to display the names and contact details of the organizations that are lead  collaborators of the campaign.  3.2.1.8 NIS Quiz  The NIS quiz12 was updated this year so that it would better reflect the new GDPR and other regulatory & legislative  changes in NIS.  Another important feature of quiz was the translation into the 23 official languages of the EU, now  making it accessible across Europe to all EU citizens.  11 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/  12 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/quiz-demonstration/intro  Figure 5: Map of activities across Europe  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  15  Partners  The National Liaison Officers network were contacted in order to identify the national contact point responsible  for the awareness campaign in their country.

Execution phase  Kick-off event  The execution of the kick-off event rested heavily on the preparation work that was put in place during the preceding  months between ENISA, EBF and Europol EC3. Clear lines of responsibility were drawn up early on during the  planning phase; and the communications between the three organizations were further strengthened by three face  to face meetings leading up to October.  The kick-off event was a half day event that consisted of four sessions the  details of which are presented below.  The opening speeches for the kick-off event consisted of introductions from the following speakers:   Sébastien De Brouwer, Executive Director, EBF   Wim Mijs, Chief Executive, EBF   Steve Purser, Head of Core Operations, ENISA   Olivier Burgersdijk, Integrated Data Management, Europol   Ken Ducatel, Director, DIGIT  A session regarding “national cyber security month campaigns” and another session focusing on “cyber awareness”  were the responsibility of ENISA to organize.  Five ECSM partners volunteered to present their campaigns which  consisted of the following panellists:   France: Anne-Charlotte Brou from Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information (ANSSI),   Germany: Hanna Heuer from Federal Office for Information Security (BSI),   Luxembourg: Daniele Bisdorff from Ministère de l'économie du Luxembourg (CASES),   Netherlands: Marjolijn Durinck from Platform voor de Informatiesamenleving (ECP),   Norway: Peggy Heie from Norsk senter for informasjonssikring (NorSIS).  The session on Cyber Awareness consisted of the following panellists:   Moderator: Jakub Boratynski, Head of Cybersecurity and Digital Privacy, DG CNECT   Dr. Veronica Donoso, Executive Director, INHOPE   Dr. Hans Martens, Insafe network coordinator, European Schoolnet   Erka Koivunen, Cyber Security Advisor, F-Secure Corporation   William O'Connell, Chief Business Security Officer, ADP  The other sessions during the kick-off event were organized by the European Banking Federation and Europol’s EC3  respectively, one focusing on Security in Banking and the other on Mobile Malware.  Security in Banking session consisted of the following panellists:   Moderator: Keith Gross, Chair EBF, Cyber Security WG   Wien De Geyter, Secretary General, Febelfin   Troëls Oerting , Group Chief Information Security Officer, Barclays  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  17   Koen Hermans, Public Prosecutor, Eurojust   Peter, Kerstens, Advisor for Financial Sector Cybersecurity, DG FISMA  Mobile Malware session consisted of the following panellists:   Moderator: Olivier Burgersdijk, Integrated Data Management, Europol   Michael Shaulov, Head of Go To Market, Mobile Security, Check Point Software  Technologies   Senan Moloney, VP Cyber Threat Intelligence, Barclays   Tomislav Vazdar, Chief Security Officer & Head of Corporate Security, Erste &  Steiermärkische bank   Daniel Lawrence, Detective Inspector, NPCC National Cyber Crime PROTECT  Coordinator, CERT UK  All the sessions proved informative and generated much discussion amongst the audience. ENISA received positive  feedback from the audience and the majority of the participants remained until the closing remarks of the event.  The communication unit of ENISA prepared a press release for the day of the kick-off event in collaboration with the  European Commission; that was distributed to the other key partners of the campaign for feedback before release.  Moreover, a weekly news item was prepared by the communication unit and released on the ENISA website to  inform readers of the upcoming activities in the beginning of each of the weeks.  4.1.1 Week 1  The first week kicked off with an online ask me anything “AMA” session via the website Reddit. On the 4th October  ENISA and F-Secure received questions from citizens related to Cyber Security.  The session lasted over 2 hours and  received 486 comments, was up-ticked to the home page of Reddit that has over 13 million subscribers and received  just under four thousand points.  4.1.2 Week 2  During week two of the campaign ENISA made two significant releases, foremost was the release of the updated  version of the NIS Quiz which was now also available for the first time in 23 official languages of the EU. The second  release of the week was the official ECSM animation video.  This is a 2 minute video that introduces the viewer to  ECSM and explains the what, where, how and who of the campaign.  4.1.3 Week 3  A conference at the University Piraeus was organized with ENISA and the university for the purposes of educating  undergraduate students of Informatics and Information Technology at the university. Presentations were given by  the Ionian University, the Cyber Crime Unit of the Greek police and the Hellenic Authority for Communication  Security and Privacy.  4.1.4 Week 4  The mobile malware theme for the month was organized by Europol EC3 and a number of participating countries  with the lead country being the Cyber Crime unit of the Greek Police.  For this reason on the 25th October ENISA  arranged a closed workshop for police officers at the Police HQ.  This was a half day morning session that included a  live demonstration by ENISA.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  18  National Campaigns  The following section provides readers with insight into some of the national campaigns that were organized by  ECSM partners. The feedback was gathered by ENISA using a questionnaire that was distributed to the partners at  the end of the campaign.  4.2.1 France  European Cybersecurity month (ECSM) was a great opportunity to give more visibility to good practices that ANSSI  has developed, to work with partners and use various communication material. For this edition, ANSSI focused on  promoting the good practices already promoted by our technical recommendations, guides and online interactions.  It is the first year that ANSSI was participating actively in the campaign so the main idea was to give more visibility  to our daily actions to raise awareness about cybersecurity. For instance, more than 17 events were organized by  ANSSI agents, directed to students, administrations as well as private companies.  ANSSI’s main security recommendations were our “12 rules” guide book reminding the importance of a good  password and regular updates. ANSSI also took this opportunity to build new partnerships in France, with the  government, the CNIL and public administrations (Europol France, gendarmerie), as well as to strengthen  international partnerships with the BSI.  ANSSI also initiated contact with the private sector – regarding a possible future collaboration. For instance, ANSSI  were able to build exchanges online, through Twitter, with the BSI linking their glossary project designed for the  ECSM with ANSSI’s French glossary. The kick-off event in Brussels was a great opportunity to exchanges the national  coordinators' point of view and organization of this event in their respective countries.  Regarding ECSM in France, the events had been successful and new inquiries were made to build cooperation for  the next edition.  4.2.2 Germany  As national coordinator in Germany, the BSI supported the ECSM especially with activities for private users. Based  on the weekly topics of ENISA the BSI provided information & material such as:  animated videos, which where we  explaining risks and preventive measures, distributed via our social media channels and BSI website for private users,  further information regarding the topics on our website, and a press release on each topic.  Furthermore, the BSI produced two radio features and set up a cyber-security ABC on facebook, where we explained  different terms. The BSI also took the ECSM as an opportunity to invite representatives of think tanks, NGOs,  ministries and journalists to a discussion on cyber security and its societal implications. Additionally, BSI ran activities  with partners, e.g. support a webinar on basic protection held by klicksafe and started an online-survey in close  cooperation with the police crime prevention on the behaviour of private users regarding security on the internet  and on their experiences with cybercrime. For SME the BSI produced a flyer with some security recommendations  on different aspects of cyber security.  To raise the visibility of the ECSM in Germany the BSI set up a project office which tasks were to contact possible  partners, provide them with information and give ideas on possible activities. The project office will continue its  work throughout the year. With the support of the project office the BSI won more than 70 partners in Germany  who established more than 120 activities around October. The range of activities was quite wide, from webinars and  social media activities to live-hacking events and a whole thematic day with workshops, discussions and so on.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  19  Overall, the BSI was satisfied with the results of this years ECSM campaign in Germany. BSI was able to reach more  partners and by this possibly more people and to get them involved in cyber security. The press releases were  published in different media, especially in newspapers. The videos had each a few thousand views on social media  and our website. The cyber security-ABC (27 postings) had an average outreach of 3.500 views on facebook. The  radio features had an outreach of 3.000.000 listeners (data provided by the stations). More than 1.600 people  participated in the online-survey.  4.2.3 Luxembourg  The local ECSM coordination was done by the ministry of the Economy, directorate for electronic commerce and  information security. Promotion and organization of the events was granted by SECURITYMADEIN.LU, the main  national online portal for cybersecurity.  ECSM campaign was rolled through a series of 10 events, (approx. 1,000 people in total). 5 events were dedicated  to cybersecurity for SMES’, local and international experts as well as cybersecurity start-ups; 3 were focused on  raising awareness among youth and the elderly; 2 presented cyber-risks to Luxembourg consumers.  The Luxembourg secretary of state of the Economy appeared at 2 occasions, highlighting the importance of  cybersecurity for Luxembourg and welcoming the ECSM initiative.  Major events were the “Cybersecurity4success” conference and workshop day for SME’s taking place at the  Luxembourg Chamber of Commerce, as well as the “Cyber security day” organized with PriceWaterhouseCoopers  (PwC). Other local events included a “crypto party” for kids, an “information day” for seniors, a presentation to  Luxembourg consumers. Furthermore ECSM logo is part of the BEE SECURE 1 year campaign “Share Respect”,  gathering 18 national partners and associations and being mainly displayed in schools and public spaces from  October 2016 to sept 2017. This years’ edition was proud to count on a partnership with Luxembourg Law  enforcement, Luxembourg Banking Association, and national youth initiative for the dissemination of the Europol’s  Mobile malware campaign.  Partners of the October month activities included: Maison de l’Europe, the Chamber of Commerce, Europe  Enterprise Network, House of Training, PwC; The secretariat of the Benelux Union; Union luxembourgeoise des  consommateurs. Partners specifically dedicated to the Europol Mobile Malware campaign were: ABBL, Luxembourg  Bankers Association; The National Police and BEE SECURE, governmental initiative raising awareness among young  people and public at large.  Online promotion was done through 4 main partner websites with approx. 1,000 unique visitors for the month. 5  press releases were sent; 15 website news were released. Over 20.000 people were reached through Facebook.  The impact of the BEE SECURE campaign cannot be analyzed yet as it continue into 2017 (30.000 flyers and 3300  posters are being distributed; 72 trainings will take place in Luxembourg schools.  4.2.4 Poland  NASK organised 5 major activities, and was engaged in preparation and promotion of Europol materials. Some of  the activities were still ongoing into the later end of 2016. The following are some stats for the campaign in Poland  during October. Secure: 500 participants capture the flag: 704 unique visitors visited the main page of the project,  141 started the competition, and there were 9 correct solutions (3 fastest users were rewarded)  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  20  Quizzes: 385 participants What to do if… educational materials: <100 visits  Bezpiecznymiesiac.pl: 2932 unique users, Facebook reach 151, Twitter impressions: 3640  4.2.5 Slovenia  For ECSM 2016 CERT Slovenia held a press conference addressing frauds when shopping online. CERT SL dealt with  a lot of cases, where people lose more than a few thousand EUR shopping online and stumbling upon fake sellers.  CERT SL invited all the major public agencies and inspectorates in Slovenia to speak about this issue with the public.  CERT SL prepared online quiz with 8 questions about most common online frauds and security issues. The quiz was  completed 6000 times, 1400 users agreed to sign up to the mailing list within the quiz, which was one of the main  goal: to gain contacts for further work. Besides the quiz CERT SL prepared 4 videos which addressed the 4 most  common frauds; sextortion, fake shops, ransomware and Airbnb frauds. Videos were played on Youtube and  Facebook. They reached 120.000 views on YT and had almost 3 million reach on Facebook. Which means that not a  single Slovenian FB user could avoid the message; frauds do happen however CERT SL are here to help.  All of CERT SL described activities were supported with press releases and media coverage that were well received.  Through month there were more than 40 media mentions. Including those in talk shows (they invited CERT SL as  guests), CERT SL were guests at news on national TV and commercial TV's. CERT SL prepared statements for radio  shows and received more than 30 media mentions in printed newspapers and news portals. This was another key  goal; to reach audience and users that don't use social media and Youtube often.  4.2.6 Non-Country participation  CECUA (Confederation of European Computer User Associations, see www.cecua.eu). The 2016 campaign was the  second year in a row that CECUA joined the group of partners for ECSM. Security is high on the CECUA Agenda as  technology can provide security solutions however in the end it is the awareness of people which counts. For ECSM  2016 CECUA produced publications for the European and national level and used further communication channels  to raise awareness.  Results  Highlights of 2016 campaign:  1. 455 activities encoded in the official calendar from public and private stakeholders  2. 32 countries with events taking place in October  3. 120 participants at the ECSM kick-off, oversubscribed with over 160 participants registered  4. 429 articles published in October referring to ECSM  5. 465 courses registered in 28 countries for the NIS Education map  6. 14,239 visits to the for www.cybersecuritymonth.eu site in October  7. 57,890 page views to the for www.cybersecuritymonth.eu site in October  http://www.cecua.eu/  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  21  5. Evaluation  The indicators used to evaluate the campaign demonstrated a significant increase in visibility from previous years.  Be they the number of activities registered on the ECSM website, the number of visitors to the website or the number  of followers on twitter, for which the percentage change this year compared to the previous three years was above  average across the board.  The distribution of media reach and articles peaked at two points during the campaign, initially during the launch of  the campaign on the 30th September which was to be expected given the media push by all three key partners during  the kick-off event; the second point was on the 24th October at the beginning of the final week of the campaign with  the start of the Mobile Malware theme, that was coordinated and organized by Europol EC3.  Another measure of the success of the campaign was the participation rate of the kick-off event that was  oversubscribed with over 160 participants registered the day before the event, with finally 120 participants turning  up on the day, which was the capacity of the venue. This contrasts greatly with the amount of participants in the  previous year’s kick-off event that was half the number of participants of 2016.  Turning to the objectives of the campaign as described in section 2.1 above and assessing the results in this context,  we can make the following concrete observations:   Relevant stakeholders were involved in the campaign such as the EBF and Europol EC3   Media interest did increase as measured by the number of articles published during October   Attention to information security through political and media coordination was enhanced as a result of the  high level representation during the kick-off event  What is less concrete to determine is the campaigns impact at raising general awareness about NIS and promoting  safer use of internet for all users. This is because the analytical information that is currently being gathered to  evaluate the campaign does not provide for this level of granularity and the resources required for such a study to  be conducted are beyond the resources allocated for this project.  Questionnaire  The questionnaire is an important tool to help measure the impact of the campaign from the point of view of the  partners that were engaged in the campaign. The charts below present the replies of 12 partners in contrast to 24  that participated in the previous year, a substantial decrease that was unexpected given the results of all the other  indicators.  5.1.1 Results  The questions of the survey and the results including feedback from partners are presented herein:  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  22  1.

There were no answers provided  from partners scoring the campaign in a negative way (scores 1 or 2).  However, there were no answers giving an  excellent score, which could be a signal that there is still space for improvement in the minds of the partners.  The overwhelming majority of partners stated that the campaign added value toward their national campaigns and  that it provided the support they needed and required for sharing ideas (Questions 2, 3 and 4). Nevertheless,  partners emphasised the need for greater effort in promoting the material produced by them at the national level  (Question 6). This means that essential outputs in cyber security awareness raising remain isolated or hidden at  0 2 4 6 8 10  No answer  No  Yes  P R I V A T E  S E C T O R  E N G A N G E M E N T  0 2 4 6 8  No answer  No  Yes  A L I G N M E N T  W I T H  I N T E R N A T I O N A L  C A M P A I G N S  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  25  national level, hence preventing their dissemination among partners across the EU and eventually down to the EU  citizen. This feedback has been noted and plans have already been put in place to address this issue early in 2017.  Some of the proposed solutions received from partners for the sharing of material include:   Including in the ECSM website a new feed of partner related articles and news related to the materials they  produce and pointing back to their work,   Informing partners of material produced by other partners by email or other means,   Partners to share social media posts regarding ECSM material,   Produce a timeline of the partner’s campaigns with their outputs,   Create a depository of such material (with selected translations) at the ECSM website.  Further efforts to promote NIS Quiz was also emphasized by the partners (Question 5). This feedback reflects the  lack of communication and marketing by ENISA after the release of the updated version of the quiz and its availability  into all the official languages of the EU. Other proposals included the use of the NIS quiz in national campaigns and  their websites, possibly by advertising a pointer to the original site of ECSM but also better management of social  media platforms to increase visibility.  With regard to ENISA facilitating the private sector’s engagement in future ECSM campaigns (Question 7), the  majority of answers seem to favour such an approach. In this context, “pros” and “cons” of such an approach were  provided as feedback. Positive considerations of such a collaboration included: the better outreach of the ECSM  campaign and the willingness of the private sector to collaborate at the national level will enhance partners’  awareness raising campaigns. On the other hand certain concerns were expressed such as: private sector runs its  own marketing agenda and will not engage in producing awareness raising related material and that ECSM may be  seen as a commercial opportunity, and finally; having a clear understanding and control over the roles activities may  require additional effort.  The overall perspective of aligning ECSM with other international campaigns was positive, as long as the scope and  objectives are shared (Question 8). On the other hand, reasonable scepticism was expressed on the strategic  approach that should be followed in this case and that such an approach should be clearly defined.  Web analytics  Web analytics provided the statistical data for ECSM web site and social media channels. The purpose of gathering  these figures were to evaluate the impact and visibility of the campaign.  5.2.1 ECSM Web Page  The analysis takes into consideration multiple variables in relation to different types of access points to the ECSM  website in the period of October.  Statistics for October include:   ECSM page views: 57,890.   Users accessing the website: 14,239.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  26   Total Sessions: 18,490.  The “pie” chart on the right hand side of Figure 7 shows the percentage of new visitors accessing the ECSM web  page only once with those revisiting the web page multiple times. While this is encouraging, ENISA recognises the  need of finding the means of keeping the interest of users “alive” for a greater period of time.  Below is a comparison between this year’s campaign and previous years with respect to the number of sessions and  page views to the ECSM webpage, where there exists a stable almost linear increase in popularity.  5.2.2 NIS Quiz  The data in figure 9 indicates page views for the NIS Quiz reached 17,668 views out of a total of 57,890 views that  the ECSM web site received in the period from 1st to 31st of October. These statistics show the popularity that the  NIS quiz has gained during the campaign, equating to approx. 30% of the total ECSM site web traffic, almost 1/3 of  the visits, targeted the NIS Quiz.  12000  15000  18490  2014 2015 2016  48000  52000  57890  2014 2015 2016  Figure 7: Graph overview of ECSM web site sessions.  Figure 8: Overview of annual increase of ECSM web page sessions and page views.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  27  In more details, the results of the analysis have shown that:   7,514 page views were dedicated to accessing the main NIS Quiz page   2,051 page views were dedicated for accessing the introductory youtube video of the quiz  Nevertheless, in contrast to the encouraging numbers received above, it seems that only 788 visits resulted in the  completion of the NIS quiz, which is 10% of the total amount of 7,514 visits to the quiz page, a rather sobering  number.  5.2.3 ECSM Map of Activities  The following data from Figure 10 illustrate the number of activities taking place from 2013 to 2016 during October.  The graph presents the total number of events registered on ECSM website during the month October every year  since 2013.  Clearly, a stable growth of events year on year occurred from inception up to 2015, wherein the number of events  registered almost doubled in 2016 from the previous year.  The analysis has not taken into consideration the content of the events registered but only quantitative figures. The  growth in the number of events registered is an outcome of the increased popularity of the campaign.  115  184 242  455  2013 2014 2015 2016  sdfsdfsf  27  30  32 32  2013 2014 2 0 1 5 2016  C OU NTRY PA RTI C I PA TI ON  Figure 9: NIS quiz page views within ECSM October’s events.

More information on the content of such activities can be found directly upon accessing the official ECSM website.  5.2.4 Social Media  Twitter has been a major tool used by ENISA to promote the campaign in recent years.  Figure 12 below  demonstrates the fluctuation of twitter followers from September until November 2016 for the handle  @CyberSecMonth. The highest peak corresponds to the launch of ECSM and specifically the Kick-off event on the  30th of September, followed by renewed interest again at the later end of the month that coincided with Mobile  Malware week.  Useful statistic that are extracted from the graph are:   The total number of followers (6,847)   The amount of new accounts (1,748) created within this period of three months  Figure 11:  Top Ten countries with respect to the number of events registered.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  29  The graph below tracks the growth in the number of twitter followers to @CyberSecMonth over time.

European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  30  5.2.5 Media Reach  There were a total of 429 articles published which mentioned ECSM during October, including the 30th September  of the kick-off event. In the charts below the reader can distinguish two major peaks. The first appears at the  campaign’s kick-off date and the second peak occurs during the launch of the mobile malware week coordinated by  Europol EC3.  Figure 14: Estimated online  reach in October 2016.  Figure 15: Number of articles  published in October 2016 that  mention ECSM.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  31  The significant growth in the number of publications and online reach occurred in 2016 when compared to previous  years, as demonstrated in the graphs below.  Publications almost tripled year on year, while online reach, meaning  the size of audience exposed to the campaign’s advertisement, almost doubled in size.  5.2.6 Conclusions  The analytical indicators used to evaluate the campaign demonstrate a significant increase in growth year on year  compared to the average level of growth from the previous years. What is significant is that this was a trend that  span across a majority of the data points gathered for the evaluation, giving weight to the conclusion that the 2016  campaign outperformed that of previous years.  100  146  429  2014 2015 2016  40000000  60000000  112000000  2014 2015 2016  Figure 16: Overview of number of articles published during October overtime.

Conclusions and Future Work  The positive results of the evaluation coupled with the feedback received from the ECSM partners do not only  confirm that the campaign was a success but they demonstrate that the campaign outperformed the results of  previous years. Several factors contributed to this positive outcome, a major one being the strength of the  relationship between ENISA and the national partners, another being the agreement with the European Banking  Federation to host the kick-off event and another being the contribution of Europol’s EC3 in the Mobile Malware  theme of the week. Internally the readjustment in the working methods of the campaign also played a significant  role in capitalizing on each of these factors.  A number of novel ideas also contributed to the campaigns success, such as the “Ask Me Anything” session on Reddit  with F-Secure which reached the home page of Reddit with over 13 million subscribers, and the additional  involvement of ECSM partners during the planning phase contributed positively to the campaign.  Taking a critical look at the campaign, the 2016 edition helped lay bare the strengths / weaknesses of the campaign,  and raised questions on its vision and current trajectory.  The reason for this revelation were two fold, a new  coordination team and a revisiting of the initial objectives of the campaign.  A new team was charged with the  execution of the 2016 campaign, with this brought new fresh ideas to the table and good standing practices were  scrutinized with new eyes. The chief concern for the new team was to ensure the continuation of the campaign in a  similar capacity as the previous years so as not to jeopardise the existing efforts by knee jerk reactions. The second  element was to return back to the original text of the pilot project of 2012, the awareness raising material produced  by ENISA in that regard and also the Cyber Security Communications Strategy that was the driver for the campaign  in the first place. The work performed during the pilot project, the objectives outlined in the Cyber Security Strategy  and the documented awareness raising methods demonstrated that a schism had occurred between the current  campaigns direction and the intended campaign direction based on these foundational documents.  The combination of these elements assisted in drawing up the following conclusions regarding the campaign:  Strengths:   Keen involvement by majority of EU Member States   Campaign recognized across the IT Security industry  Weaknesses:   Minimal requests received by ENISA from Member States for support with their national campaigns   Difficulty in evaluating the main objectives of the campaign given the current available data gathering  practices   The ECSM website not being used as intended   Minimal private sector involved in the campaign   Commitment from the European Commission is lukewarm   Not all Member States are engaged in the campaign  The following points provide are a more detailed look at the shortfalls of the campaign:   The is not a detailed and comprehensive communication plan produced to assist partners and coordinators  with awareness raising, organizing press releases and social media activity  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  33   The ECSM website is being used as an events gathering portal rather than its intended goal of providing  awareness raising information and material to citizens   There is minimal impact analysis done for the management of financial resources   The work plan of the campaign was overly focused on the methodology rather than the goals and objectives  of the campaign  ENISA will seek to address each of these points over the coming year.  Already ENISA has sort the assistance of an  awareness raising expert to help assess and evaluate the campaign with its goals and objectives.  These risks will be  further addressed during the process of assessment so as to mitigate them during 2017.  The success of the campaign over the past years and specifically for those of 2016 are tantamount to the strength  of the ENISA brand to carry the campaign.  It is this marriage between ENISA and ECSM that has formed the  foundation that drives the popularity of the campaign; especially within the IT security industry. The questions is;  does the campaign have the momentum to continue as a standalone project?  6.1.1 2017 and beyond  The first point of call for 2017 is to attempt to re-align the campaign with the initial vision of the campaign as  reflected in the seed documents. To this end, ENISA has requested the assistance of a security awareness raising  academic to assess the campaign and help bridge the gap.  The 2016 edition highlighted many of the weaknesses and shortfalls of the campaign and these will be addressed in  the coming year as documented in the conclusions, however the campaign can also benefit in a number of areas by  considering the following aspects in the coming years:  • Making better use of social media channels to increase visibility and contact with citizens  • Seeking closer relationships and engagement with ECSM partners  • Using alternative means of communication with partners such as monthly newsletter and call for actions  • Producing a comprehensive list analytical indicators for evaluating the campaign  It is ENISA’s hope that the campaign will continue to deliver results above expectations in the coming years and that  issues raised within this report are addressed in order to provide the EU citizen with the tools necessary to act  accordingly when online.

Executive Summary  For the fourth consecutive year, last October the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) campaign took place across  Europe. The campaign was supported by ENISA, the European Commission, Europol’s EC3 and the European Banking  Federation, plus partners from the Member States, the support for which propelled the campaigns success as  measured by both the qualitative and quantitative data compiled.  Although this year’s campaign broke all previous  growth records, the conclusions of this reports highlight a number of fundamental issues that need to be addressed  in the coming years if the campaign is to reach its original objective which was to influence the security behaviour  of citizens online. The weaknesses that have been highlighted, will be clarified and qualified in the coming year  within the context of a campaign assessment. However within this report, recommendations are made to address  these shortfalls in the near term.  The following recommendations have been put forward to mitigate these shortfalls:   Draw up comprehensive communication plan with the assistance of the ENISA communications team and  external expertise   Populate the newly created website depository with partner material / information and seek ways to utilize  this as an information hub for citizens   Seek to create PPP’s amongst partners and private companies that have demonstrated a willingness to work  in awareness raising   Build into the budgetary decision making process impact analysis that documents the perceived impact  versus the cost, time and quality of budgetary decision.   Re-focus the work plan on the goals and objectives of the campaign before considering which methodology  to follow.  A crucial aspect of the evaluation was the extent to which the campaign addressed the overall objectives.  A number  of observations can be made regarding the impact towards some of these objectives such as the involvement of  relevant stakeholders and the media’s interest in Cyber Security which were indeed the case for both objectives.  The other more crucial observation regarding the impact towards raising general awareness especially to the EU  citizen, cannot be so easily made given the current data gathering methods used to evaluate the campaign.  Turning back to the objectives of European Cyber Security Month (ECSM), which were to promote cyber security  awareness among citizens, to modify their perception of cyber threats and to provide updated security information  through education, good practices and competitions. Each Member State decided upon the scope and how best to  tackle these objectives given their experience and knowledge of the local community; and the number of activities  and events it organised. ENISA provided guidance and expertise on how to organise information security campaigns,  together with tips and advice on how to be safe online. Moreover, the Agency provided access to the  cybersecuritymonth.eu, posters, infographics and social media for participating countries to promote their activities.  This report provides an overview of the activities organised and presents a synthesis of findings on the basis of  evaluation and performance information gathered via a questionnaire and media monitoring data.  The report is structured into three main parts: an introduction, the implementation phase and an evaluation of the  campaign.  The introduction will provide readers with the policy context, scope and target audience of the campaign.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  06  The implementation phase of the report highlights the mile stones that were achieved during the planning and  execution phase of the campaign.  This includes how events were organized and co-ordinated with partners,  marketing materials used and insights into the execution of the campaign including results.  The final section of the report deals with the evaluation of the campaign, comparing this year’s results with the  previous year’s and also provides input from the partners that was generated via a questionnaire; and finishes with  a conclusion and outlook for the future.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  07  2. Introduction  In early 2013 the EU published the “Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union”1 as a means to safeguard the  online environment and providing the highest possible freedom and security, for the benefit of EU citizens. This  strategy was jointly adopted by the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and  Security Policy. It outlines the EU's vision in this domain, clarifies roles and responsibilities and proposes specific  activities at EU level. Its goal is to ensure strong and effective protection and promotion of citizens' rights so as to  make the EU's online environment the safest in the world.  End users play a crucial role in ensuring security of networks and information systems. In this context they need to  be made aware of the risks they face online and be empowered to take simple steps to guard against them. Several  initiatives were developed in recent years. In particular, in October 2012, ENISA, with some Member States, piloted  the \"European Cyber Security Month\" campaign.  In the context of the ECSM project, the Commission invited the Member States to organise a yearly cybersecurity  month with the support of ENISA and the involvement of the private sector, with the goal to raise awareness among  end users. ECSM and the private sector were also encouraged to join efforts in order to promote cybersecurity  awareness at all levels, both in business practices and in the interface with customers.  ECSM runs for the entire month of October, with ENISA publishing new material and focusing on a different topic  each week. Along with ENISA, various stakeholders, ranging from the private sector, education, the European  Commission (EC) and other EU bodies, join together in a common vision by organising activities with special focus  on training, strategy summits, online quizzes and provide general presentations to end users toward the  establishment of an EU cyber-security culture.  This report summarises the activities carried out by ENISA and its partners for this year’s ECSM campaign and  presents the evaluation results and conclusions. More importantly, it seeks to trigger a discussion among partners  with respect to improvements that can be made for ECSM to strategically achieving its objectives in the future.  Scope and Objectives  The scope of this evaluation includes all the campaigns activities and their impact within 2016, comparing the results  with those of 2015, and also measuring the extent by which these activities addressed the campaign’s objectives.  The main objectives of the campaign were as follows:   to generate general awareness about Network and Information Security;   to promote safer use of the Internet for all users;   to build a strong track record to raise awareness through the ECSM;   to involve relevant stakeholders;   to increase national media interest through the European and international dimension of the  project;  1 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-cybersecurity-strategy-european-union- %E2%80%93-open-safe-and-secure-cyberspace  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  08   to enhance attention and interest with regard to information security through political and media  coordination.  The evaluation results and estimated impact of the ECSM activities shall allow us to discuss lessons learned deriving  from this exercise and shall help us to draw attention to related issues, hence acquiring a broader view for further  enhancing the ECSM’s development and effectiveness.  In addition, among other aims, analysis is intended to provide a basis for discussion by the Member States, the  European Commission and ENISA on how the ECSM can best be organised in the years to come. All countries will be  in need to face up to a similar challenge, namely how to engage citizens to change their information security  behaviour.  Evaluation Methodology  ENISA gathered information with regards the organization and achievements of the campaign using two distinct  methods:  1. by feedback from ECSM partners given a Q&A questionnaire, and  2. by the use of media monitoring services to gather analytical data.  The questionnaire aimed at extracting pertinent information on the overall impact of the campaign based on  partners’ feedback with respect to ENISA’s supportive role. More specifically, some of the elements assessed involve  the level of support and its usefulness provided to partners, the impact of promotion material used and marketing  strategies followed, future engagement with the private sector or other international campaigns, etc.  The data gathered by the media monitoring service was aggregated by combining data elements from different  sources to provide insights and identify the effectiveness of the messages, media channels and the campaign as a  whole in reaching the general population.  Target Audience  This evaluation is intended for organisations, either public or private, which supported the ECSM or intend to do so  in the future, as well as IT security professionals and other target groups who attended events and conferences  organised across Europe during the month of October 2016.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  09  3. Planning Phase  ENISA supported the organisation of the European Cyber Security Month campaign in various ways, such as:   coordinator of the organisation of the ECSM;   hub for all participating countries;   collector of available material and generator of synergies between countries;   subject-matter expert on how to organise information security campaigns;   facilitator of common messaging within the participating countries by providing tips and advice on how  to be safe and secure online;   creator of the ECSM brand and related marketing plan;   distributor of promotional material (posters and infographics).  The Agency coordinated the organisation of the ECSM campaign, by means of becoming a “hub” for all participating  countries and providing suggestions, replying to enquiries and generating synergies between countries when  possible.  ENISA provided guidance and expertise by organizing a monthly conference call with all partners so as to seek  synergies, collaboration and guide the campaign. The common message of “Cyber Security is a Shared  Responsibility” was promoted among Member States and material was provided to help with their cyber security  education and awareness campaigns. This material was recognised by all countries as an important tool in reaching  people and getting them to change their behaviour, or to reinforce good behaviour.  This material included:   tips and advice to provide in-depth information on how to stay safe in a variety of online settings, for  example on social networking sites, on gaming sites and on your mobile device;   posters and infographics2;   social media web banners3;   video clips4;   NIS Quiz5.  Moreover, the Agency produced promotional material for the Member States to help promote awareness messages  and also helped to identify speakers for events.  The planning phase of the campaign started in earnest with a request to partners from previous year’s campaign  to join the monthly conference calls.  The graph below depicts the mile stones of the planning phase leading up to October and also the execution  phase.  It highlights key events, meetings, conference and phases of the campaign.  2 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/press-campaign-toolbox/material  3 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/press-campaign-toolbox/visual-identity  4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr-gVUG9koM  5 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/quiz-demonstration/intro  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  10  Coordination  3.1.1.1 Conference Calls and Meetings  Monthly conference calls with partners were scheduled in order to update partners on the plans, get feedback and  hear from partners on their national campaign plans. These calls provided opportunities for partners to seek  synergies and form collaborations. Minutes where drawn up by ENISA after every call, including a list of action points  and after approval from the Head of Unit they were distributed to the conference call participants. As expected the  participation rate increased as the campaign month draw near with an average of 10 to 15 participants on the call  at a time.  During the year a number of face to face meetings were held with partners in order to finalize key areas of the  campaign such as the themes of the month and the organization and logistics of the kick-off event.  These were held  at partner offices in Brussels and in ENISA offices in Athens.  3.1.1.2 Themes of the Month Survey  A survey was launched amongst the partners to determine which would be the four themes of the month, one  theme for each of the weeks in October.  ENISA suggested twelve possible themes for the partners to choose from and with the help of the partners  throughout regular meetings and discussions, these themes were eventually narrowed down to the four most  prominent as shown below:  Figure 1: ECSM timeline of events planning  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  11  1st week – October 3-7: Cyber Security in Banking – supported by the European Banking Federation  2nd week – October 10-14: Cyber Training  3rd week – October 17-21: Cyber Safety  4th week – October 24-28: Mobile Malware – supported by Europol EC3  3.1.1.3 Kick-Off Event  Collaboration was forged early in the year with the European Banking Federation, who approached ENISA requesting  to host the kick-off event at their premises in Brussels but also to promote various activities with respect to the first  theme-week of October, that of Security in Banking. On the other hand Europol EC3 was engaged into promoting  the forth theme of the month directly related to secure practices with mobile devices. These collaborations were  well received by the ECSM partners during the monthly conference calls, and plans were put in motion to organize  the event. Three face to face meetings were eventually held between key partners for the organizational details of  the kick-off event.  Responsibilities for the arrangements of the communications and the logistics for the event were determined early  on, with two documents being drawn up, the “Common Communication Strategy” and the “Script” of activities for  the kick-off event. The former document aimed at aligning the partner’s messages and press releases on the day of  the event, while the latter provided a detailed outline of how the event would pan out in real time including roles,  responsibilities and contact points.  Policy makers, industry experts and representatives from competent authorities were invited to attend the launch  and had been encouraged to come forward as speakers or panellists for either of the four sessions on the weekly  themes, including:   Security in banking   Cyber security training   Cyber safety (child extortion, cyber bullying & IOT)   Mobile malware  Furthermore, in practice the planning phase consisted of an extensive consultation with stakeholders like the  Commission, NLO network, and international partners in order to come up with a consolidated version that anyone  could easily follow. Regarding the management of the communication process, all feedback, issues and ideas were  tackled in a tailored manner to fit the needs and purposes of organisations involved.  Marketing Material  A series of activities were planned to market the European Cyber Security Month project. The following sub  categories identify the various marketing solutions of the campaign.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  12  3.2.1.1 Visual identity  To strengthen visibility and public recognition of the European Cyber Security Month, ENISA created some years ago  a visual identity including a logo6, a colour chart, typography rules, guidelines on use of imagery, design templates  and a manual of formal guidelines on the proper use of these elements.  The design was created following consultation with the Member States and the European Commission and the logo  was used by partners on their material, videos and social media to link their efforts up to the European campaign.  3.2.1.2 Slogan  The slogan ‘Cyber Security is a Shared Responsibility’ was created to give the project an identity and a positive image.  It has been used in this year’s campaign and included with posters, infographics and the cybersecuritymonth.eu  website. The slogan was also promoted for use by the member states that organized their local activities and at  ENISA’s press releases.  3.2.1.3 Press releases  The European Cyber Security Month featured a diverse range of activities and events, and as part of the build-up  ENISA launched press releases7 that aimed to bring anticipation to the launch of the campaign.  3.2.1.4 Social media - banners  The dedicated social media accounts of Twitter and  Facebook were used as a medium for disseminating  useful advice about information security in general, as  well as tips and recommendations on how to protect your  PC and personal and business information. The accounts  provided information on the campaign and assisted in  engaging the digital citizen.  3.2.1.5 Poster and Infographics  An ECSM 2016 poster8 was created to highlight the four themes of the month, the kick-off event and the overall  message that this is a European wide effort with a single underlying message. A number of partner member states  participated in the creation of a dedicated country infographics.  Each country infographic highlighted the key  information and data regarding their campaigns and achievements. A total of 10 countries participated in creating  an infographic. Finally ENISA created a single unified infographic of the achievements of this year’s campaign.  6 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/press-campaign-toolbox/visual-identity  7 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/a-week-to-go-for-the-european-cyber-security-month-launch-1  8 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/press-campaign-toolbox/material  Figure 2: ECSM 2016 facebook banner.

The first was a short animated video9 describing the objectives  of the ECSM campaign, highlighting the scope and target audience. The other video10 was of interviews taken of  speakers during the kick-off event on the 30th September in Brussels. Both videos will be used to further promote  the campaign amongst citizens and organizations.  9 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr-gVUG9koM&t=2s  10 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/press-campaign-toolbox/material  Figure 3: ECSM poster and infographics by country (left-to-right).  Figure 4: ECSM Animated Video Snapshot.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  14  3.2.1.7 Website  The ECSM website11 was re-organized at the beginning of the year and the home page was given a facelift.  Changes  took into consideration websites of similar awareness raising campaigns, which included the addition of a  countdown clock leading up to the 1st October and more user friendly navigation to the relevant areas. Alas a  dedicated partner page was introduced to display the names and contact details of the organizations that are lead  collaborators of the campaign.  3.2.1.8 NIS Quiz  The NIS quiz12 was updated this year so that it would better reflect the new GDPR and other regulatory & legislative  changes in NIS.  Another important feature of quiz was the translation into the 23 official languages of the EU, now  making it accessible across Europe to all EU citizens.  11 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/  12 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/quiz-demonstration/intro  Figure 5: Map of activities across Europe  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  15  Partners  The National Liaison Officers network were contacted in order to identify the national contact point responsible  for the awareness campaign in their country.

Execution phase  Kick-off event  The execution of the kick-off event rested heavily on the preparation work that was put in place during the preceding  months between ENISA, EBF and Europol EC3. Clear lines of responsibility were drawn up early on during the  planning phase; and the communications between the three organizations were further strengthened by three face  to face meetings leading up to October.  The kick-off event was a half day event that consisted of four sessions the  details of which are presented below.  The opening speeches for the kick-off event consisted of introductions from the following speakers:   Sébastien De Brouwer, Executive Director, EBF   Wim Mijs, Chief Executive, EBF   Steve Purser, Head of Core Operations, ENISA   Olivier Burgersdijk, Integrated Data Management, Europol   Ken Ducatel, Director, DIGIT  A session regarding “national cyber security month campaigns” and another session focusing on “cyber awareness”  were the responsibility of ENISA to organize.  Five ECSM partners volunteered to present their campaigns which  consisted of the following panellists:   France: Anne-Charlotte Brou from Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information (ANSSI),   Germany: Hanna Heuer from Federal Office for Information Security (BSI),   Luxembourg: Daniele Bisdorff from Ministère de l'économie du Luxembourg (CASES),   Netherlands: Marjolijn Durinck from Platform voor de Informatiesamenleving (ECP),   Norway: Peggy Heie from Norsk senter for informasjonssikring (NorSIS).  The session on Cyber Awareness consisted of the following panellists:   Moderator: Jakub Boratynski, Head of Cybersecurity and Digital Privacy, DG CNECT   Dr. Veronica Donoso, Executive Director, INHOPE   Dr. Hans Martens, Insafe network coordinator, European Schoolnet   Erka Koivunen, Cyber Security Advisor, F-Secure Corporation   William O'Connell, Chief Business Security Officer, ADP  The other sessions during the kick-off event were organized by the European Banking Federation and Europol’s EC3  respectively, one focusing on Security in Banking and the other on Mobile Malware.  Security in Banking session consisted of the following panellists:   Moderator: Keith Gross, Chair EBF, Cyber Security WG   Wien De Geyter, Secretary General, Febelfin   Troëls Oerting , Group Chief Information Security Officer, Barclays  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  17   Koen Hermans, Public Prosecutor, Eurojust   Peter, Kerstens, Advisor for Financial Sector Cybersecurity, DG FISMA  Mobile Malware session consisted of the following panellists:   Moderator: Olivier Burgersdijk, Integrated Data Management, Europol   Michael Shaulov, Head of Go To Market, Mobile Security, Check Point Software  Technologies   Senan Moloney, VP Cyber Threat Intelligence, Barclays   Tomislav Vazdar, Chief Security Officer & Head of Corporate Security, Erste &  Steiermärkische bank   Daniel Lawrence, Detective Inspector, NPCC National Cyber Crime PROTECT  Coordinator, CERT UK  All the sessions proved informative and generated much discussion amongst the audience. ENISA received positive  feedback from the audience and the majority of the participants remained until the closing remarks of the event.  The communication unit of ENISA prepared a press release for the day of the kick-off event in collaboration with the  European Commission; that was distributed to the other key partners of the campaign for feedback before release.  Moreover, a weekly news item was prepared by the communication unit and released on the ENISA website to  inform readers of the upcoming activities in the beginning of each of the weeks.  4.1.1 Week 1  The first week kicked off with an online ask me anything “AMA” session via the website Reddit. On the 4th October  ENISA and F-Secure received questions from citizens related to Cyber Security.  The session lasted over 2 hours and  received 486 comments, was up-ticked to the home page of Reddit that has over 13 million subscribers and received  just under four thousand points.  4.1.2 Week 2  During week two of the campaign ENISA made two significant releases, foremost was the release of the updated  version of the NIS Quiz which was now also available for the first time in 23 official languages of the EU. The second  release of the week was the official ECSM animation video.  This is a 2 minute video that introduces the viewer to  ECSM and explains the what, where, how and who of the campaign.  4.1.3 Week 3  A conference at the University Piraeus was organized with ENISA and the university for the purposes of educating  undergraduate students of Informatics and Information Technology at the university. Presentations were given by  the Ionian University, the Cyber Crime Unit of the Greek police and the Hellenic Authority for Communication  Security and Privacy.  4.1.4 Week 4  The mobile malware theme for the month was organized by Europol EC3 and a number of participating countries  with the lead country being the Cyber Crime unit of the Greek Police.  For this reason on the 25th October ENISA  arranged a closed workshop for police officers at the Police HQ.  This was a half day morning session that included a  live demonstration by ENISA.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  18  National Campaigns  The following section provides readers with insight into some of the national campaigns that were organized by  ECSM partners. The feedback was gathered by ENISA using a questionnaire that was distributed to the partners at  the end of the campaign.  4.2.1 France  European Cybersecurity month (ECSM) was a great opportunity to give more visibility to good practices that ANSSI  has developed, to work with partners and use various communication material. For this edition, ANSSI focused on  promoting the good practices already promoted by our technical recommendations, guides and online interactions.  It is the first year that ANSSI was participating actively in the campaign so the main idea was to give more visibility  to our daily actions to raise awareness about cybersecurity. For instance, more than 17 events were organized by  ANSSI agents, directed to students, administrations as well as private companies.  ANSSI’s main security recommendations were our “12 rules” guide book reminding the importance of a good  password and regular updates. ANSSI also took this opportunity to build new partnerships in France, with the  government, the CNIL and public administrations (Europol France, gendarmerie), as well as to strengthen  international partnerships with the BSI.  ANSSI also initiated contact with the private sector – regarding a possible future collaboration. For instance, ANSSI  were able to build exchanges online, through Twitter, with the BSI linking their glossary project designed for the  ECSM with ANSSI’s French glossary. The kick-off event in Brussels was a great opportunity to exchanges the national  coordinators' point of view and organization of this event in their respective countries.  Regarding ECSM in France, the events had been successful and new inquiries were made to build cooperation for  the next edition.  4.2.2 Germany  As national coordinator in Germany, the BSI supported the ECSM especially with activities for private users. Based  on the weekly topics of ENISA the BSI provided information & material such as:  animated videos, which where we  explaining risks and preventive measures, distributed via our social media channels and BSI website for private users,  further information regarding the topics on our website, and a press release on each topic.  Furthermore, the BSI produced two radio features and set up a cyber-security ABC on facebook, where we explained  different terms. The BSI also took the ECSM as an opportunity to invite representatives of think tanks, NGOs,  ministries and journalists to a discussion on cyber security and its societal implications. Additionally, BSI ran activities  with partners, e.g. support a webinar on basic protection held by klicksafe and started an online-survey in close  cooperation with the police crime prevention on the behaviour of private users regarding security on the internet  and on their experiences with cybercrime. For SME the BSI produced a flyer with some security recommendations  on different aspects of cyber security.  To raise the visibility of the ECSM in Germany the BSI set up a project office which tasks were to contact possible  partners, provide them with information and give ideas on possible activities. The project office will continue its  work throughout the year. With the support of the project office the BSI won more than 70 partners in Germany  who established more than 120 activities around October. The range of activities was quite wide, from webinars and  social media activities to live-hacking events and a whole thematic day with workshops, discussions and so on.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  19  Overall, the BSI was satisfied with the results of this years ECSM campaign in Germany. BSI was able to reach more  partners and by this possibly more people and to get them involved in cyber security. The press releases were  published in different media, especially in newspapers. The videos had each a few thousand views on social media  and our website. The cyber security-ABC (27 postings) had an average outreach of 3.500 views on facebook. The  radio features had an outreach of 3.000.000 listeners (data provided by the stations). More than 1.600 people  participated in the online-survey.  4.2.3 Luxembourg  The local ECSM coordination was done by the ministry of the Economy, directorate for electronic commerce and  information security. Promotion and organization of the events was granted by SECURITYMADEIN.LU, the main  national online portal for cybersecurity.  ECSM campaign was rolled through a series of 10 events, (approx. 1,000 people in total). 5 events were dedicated  to cybersecurity for SMES’, local and international experts as well as cybersecurity start-ups; 3 were focused on  raising awareness among youth and the elderly; 2 presented cyber-risks to Luxembourg consumers.  The Luxembourg secretary of state of the Economy appeared at 2 occasions, highlighting the importance of  cybersecurity for Luxembourg and welcoming the ECSM initiative.  Major events were the “Cybersecurity4success” conference and workshop day for SME’s taking place at the  Luxembourg Chamber of Commerce, as well as the “Cyber security day” organized with PriceWaterhouseCoopers  (PwC). Other local events included a “crypto party” for kids, an “information day” for seniors, a presentation to  Luxembourg consumers. Furthermore ECSM logo is part of the BEE SECURE 1 year campaign “Share Respect”,  gathering 18 national partners and associations and being mainly displayed in schools and public spaces from  October 2016 to sept 2017. This years’ edition was proud to count on a partnership with Luxembourg Law  enforcement, Luxembourg Banking Association, and national youth initiative for the dissemination of the Europol’s  Mobile malware campaign.  Partners of the October month activities included: Maison de l’Europe, the Chamber of Commerce, Europe  Enterprise Network, House of Training, PwC; The secretariat of the Benelux Union; Union luxembourgeoise des  consommateurs. Partners specifically dedicated to the Europol Mobile Malware campaign were: ABBL, Luxembourg  Bankers Association; The National Police and BEE SECURE, governmental initiative raising awareness among young  people and public at large.  Online promotion was done through 4 main partner websites with approx. 1,000 unique visitors for the month. 5  press releases were sent; 15 website news were released. Over 20.000 people were reached through Facebook.  The impact of the BEE SECURE campaign cannot be analyzed yet as it continue into 2017 (30.000 flyers and 3300  posters are being distributed; 72 trainings will take place in Luxembourg schools.  4.2.4 Poland  NASK organised 5 major activities, and was engaged in preparation and promotion of Europol materials. Some of  the activities were still ongoing into the later end of 2016. The following are some stats for the campaign in Poland  during October. Secure: 500 participants capture the flag: 704 unique visitors visited the main page of the project,  141 started the competition, and there were 9 correct solutions (3 fastest users were rewarded)  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  20  Quizzes: 385 participants What to do if… educational materials: <100 visits  Bezpiecznymiesiac.pl: 2932 unique users, Facebook reach 151, Twitter impressions: 3640  4.2.5 Slovenia  For ECSM 2016 CERT Slovenia held a press conference addressing frauds when shopping online. CERT SL dealt with  a lot of cases, where people lose more than a few thousand EUR shopping online and stumbling upon fake sellers.  CERT SL invited all the major public agencies and inspectorates in Slovenia to speak about this issue with the public.  CERT SL prepared online quiz with 8 questions about most common online frauds and security issues. The quiz was  completed 6000 times, 1400 users agreed to sign up to the mailing list within the quiz, which was one of the main  goal: to gain contacts for further work. Besides the quiz CERT SL prepared 4 videos which addressed the 4 most  common frauds; sextortion, fake shops, ransomware and Airbnb frauds. Videos were played on Youtube and  Facebook. They reached 120.000 views on YT and had almost 3 million reach on Facebook. Which means that not a  single Slovenian FB user could avoid the message; frauds do happen however CERT SL are here to help.  All of CERT SL described activities were supported with press releases and media coverage that were well received.  Through month there were more than 40 media mentions. Including those in talk shows (they invited CERT SL as  guests), CERT SL were guests at news on national TV and commercial TV's. CERT SL prepared statements for radio  shows and received more than 30 media mentions in printed newspapers and news portals. This was another key  goal; to reach audience and users that don't use social media and Youtube often.  4.2.6 Non-Country participation  CECUA (Confederation of European Computer User Associations, see www.cecua.eu). The 2016 campaign was the  second year in a row that CECUA joined the group of partners for ECSM. Security is high on the CECUA Agenda as  technology can provide security solutions however in the end it is the awareness of people which counts. For ECSM  2016 CECUA produced publications for the European and national level and used further communication channels  to raise awareness.  Results  Highlights of 2016 campaign:  1. 455 activities encoded in the official calendar from public and private stakeholders  2. 32 countries with events taking place in October  3. 120 participants at the ECSM kick-off, oversubscribed with over 160 participants registered  4. 429 articles published in October referring to ECSM  5. 465 courses registered in 28 countries for the NIS Education map  6. 14,239 visits to the for www.cybersecuritymonth.eu site in October  7. 57,890 page views to the for www.cybersecuritymonth.eu site in October  http://www.cecua.eu/  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  21  5. Evaluation  The indicators used to evaluate the campaign demonstrated a significant increase in visibility from previous years.  Be they the number of activities registered on the ECSM website, the number of visitors to the website or the number  of followers on twitter, for which the percentage change this year compared to the previous three years was above  average across the board.  The distribution of media reach and articles peaked at two points during the campaign, initially during the launch of  the campaign on the 30th September which was to be expected given the media push by all three key partners during  the kick-off event; the second point was on the 24th October at the beginning of the final week of the campaign with  the start of the Mobile Malware theme, that was coordinated and organized by Europol EC3.  Another measure of the success of the campaign was the participation rate of the kick-off event that was  oversubscribed with over 160 participants registered the day before the event, with finally 120 participants turning  up on the day, which was the capacity of the venue. This contrasts greatly with the amount of participants in the  previous year’s kick-off event that was half the number of participants of 2016.  Turning to the objectives of the campaign as described in section 2.1 above and assessing the results in this context,  we can make the following concrete observations:   Relevant stakeholders were involved in the campaign such as the EBF and Europol EC3   Media interest did increase as measured by the number of articles published during October   Attention to information security through political and media coordination was enhanced as a result of the  high level representation during the kick-off event  What is less concrete to determine is the campaigns impact at raising general awareness about NIS and promoting  safer use of internet for all users. This is because the analytical information that is currently being gathered to  evaluate the campaign does not provide for this level of granularity and the resources required for such a study to  be conducted are beyond the resources allocated for this project.  Questionnaire  The questionnaire is an important tool to help measure the impact of the campaign from the point of view of the  partners that were engaged in the campaign. The charts below present the replies of 12 partners in contrast to 24  that participated in the previous year, a substantial decrease that was unexpected given the results of all the other  indicators.  5.1.1 Results  The questions of the survey and the results including feedback from partners are presented herein:  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  22  1.

Would you want to further align ECSM with international awareness raising campaigns?  5.1.2 Conclusions  All the partners rated ECSM campaign with a score of 3 or 4 out of 5 (Question 1). There were no answers provided  from partners scoring the campaign in a negative way (scores 1 or 2).  However, there were no answers giving an  excellent score, which could be a signal that there is still space for improvement in the minds of the partners.  The overwhelming majority of partners stated that the campaign added value toward their national campaigns and  that it provided the support they needed and required for sharing ideas (Questions 2, 3 and 4). Nevertheless,  partners emphasised the need for greater effort in promoting the material produced by them at the national level  (Question 6). This means that essential outputs in cyber security awareness raising remain isolated or hidden at  0 2 4 6 8 10  No answer  No  Yes  P R I V A T E  S E C T O R  E N G A N G E M E N T  0 2 4 6 8  No answer  No  Yes  A L I G N M E N T  W I T H  I N T E R N A T I O N A L  C A M P A I G N S  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  25  national level, hence preventing their dissemination among partners across the EU and eventually down to the EU  citizen. This feedback has been noted and plans have already been put in place to address this issue early in 2017.  Some of the proposed solutions received from partners for the sharing of material include:   Including in the ECSM website a new feed of partner related articles and news related to the materials they  produce and pointing back to their work,   Informing partners of material produced by other partners by email or other means,   Partners to share social media posts regarding ECSM material,   Produce a timeline of the partner’s campaigns with their outputs,   Create a depository of such material (with selected translations) at the ECSM website.  Further efforts to promote NIS Quiz was also emphasized by the partners (Question 5). This feedback reflects the  lack of communication and marketing by ENISA after the release of the updated version of the quiz and its availability  into all the official languages of the EU. Other proposals included the use of the NIS quiz in national campaigns and  their websites, possibly by advertising a pointer to the original site of ECSM but also better management of social  media platforms to increase visibility.  With regard to ENISA facilitating the private sector’s engagement in future ECSM campaigns (Question 7), the  majority of answers seem to favour such an approach. In this context, “pros” and “cons” of such an approach were  provided as feedback. Positive considerations of such a collaboration included: the better outreach of the ECSM  campaign and the willingness of the private sector to collaborate at the national level will enhance partners’  awareness raising campaigns. On the other hand certain concerns were expressed such as: private sector runs its  own marketing agenda and will not engage in producing awareness raising related material and that ECSM may be  seen as a commercial opportunity, and finally; having a clear understanding and control over the roles activities may  require additional effort.  The overall perspective of aligning ECSM with other international campaigns was positive, as long as the scope and  objectives are shared (Question 8). On the other hand, reasonable scepticism was expressed on the strategic  approach that should be followed in this case and that such an approach should be clearly defined.  Web analytics  Web analytics provided the statistical data for ECSM web site and social media channels. The purpose of gathering  these figures were to evaluate the impact and visibility of the campaign.  5.2.1 ECSM Web Page  The analysis takes into consideration multiple variables in relation to different types of access points to the ECSM  website in the period of October.  Statistics for October include:   ECSM page views: 57,890.   Users accessing the website: 14,239.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  26   Total Sessions: 18,490.  The “pie” chart on the right hand side of Figure 7 shows the percentage of new visitors accessing the ECSM web  page only once with those revisiting the web page multiple times. While this is encouraging, ENISA recognises the  need of finding the means of keeping the interest of users “alive” for a greater period of time.  Below is a comparison between this year’s campaign and previous years with respect to the number of sessions and  page views to the ECSM webpage, where there exists a stable almost linear increase in popularity.  5.2.2 NIS Quiz  The data in figure 9 indicates page views for the NIS Quiz reached 17,668 views out of a total of 57,890 views that  the ECSM web site received in the period from 1st to 31st of October. These statistics show the popularity that the  NIS quiz has gained during the campaign, equating to approx. 30% of the total ECSM site web traffic, almost 1/3 of  the visits, targeted the NIS Quiz.  12000  15000  18490  2014 2015 2016  48000  52000  57890  2014 2015 2016  Figure 7: Graph overview of ECSM web site sessions.  Figure 8: Overview of annual increase of ECSM web page sessions and page views.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  27  In more details, the results of the analysis have shown that:   7,514 page views were dedicated to accessing the main NIS Quiz page   2,051 page views were dedicated for accessing the introductory youtube video of the quiz  Nevertheless, in contrast to the encouraging numbers received above, it seems that only 788 visits resulted in the  completion of the NIS quiz, which is 10% of the total amount of 7,514 visits to the quiz page, a rather sobering  number.  5.2.3 ECSM Map of Activities  The following data from Figure 10 illustrate the number of activities taking place from 2013 to 2016 during October.  The graph presents the total number of events registered on ECSM website during the month October every year  since 2013.  Clearly, a stable growth of events year on year occurred from inception up to 2015, wherein the number of events  registered almost doubled in 2016 from the previous year.  The analysis has not taken into consideration the content of the events registered but only quantitative figures. The  growth in the number of events registered is an outcome of the increased popularity of the campaign.  115  184 242  455  2013 2014 2015 2016  sdfsdfsf  27  30  32 32  2013 2014 2 0 1 5 2016  C OU NTRY PA RTI C I PA TI ON  Figure 9: NIS quiz page views within ECSM October’s events.

More information on the content of such activities can be found directly upon accessing the official ECSM website.  5.2.4 Social Media  Twitter has been a major tool used by ENISA to promote the campaign in recent years.  Figure 12 below  demonstrates the fluctuation of twitter followers from September until November 2016 for the handle  @CyberSecMonth. The highest peak corresponds to the launch of ECSM and specifically the Kick-off event on the  30th of September, followed by renewed interest again at the later end of the month that coincided with Mobile  Malware week.  Useful statistic that are extracted from the graph are:   The total number of followers (6,847)   The amount of new accounts (1,748) created within this period of three months  Figure 11:  Top Ten countries with respect to the number of events registered.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  29  The graph below tracks the growth in the number of twitter followers to @CyberSecMonth over time. The graph  illustrated in Figure 13 shows an accelerated growth in this year’s campaign versus the year on year growth from  previous years.  964  2223  3553  6847  2013 2014 2015 2016  Figure 12: The daily growth of Twitter followers from September to November 2016 to @CyberSecMonth.

European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  30  5.2.5 Media Reach  There were a total of 429 articles published which mentioned ECSM during October, including the 30th September  of the kick-off event. In the charts below the reader can distinguish two major peaks. The first appears at the  campaign’s kick-off date and the second peak occurs during the launch of the mobile malware week coordinated by  Europol EC3.  Figure 14: Estimated online  reach in October 2016.  Figure 15: Number of articles  published in October 2016 that  mention ECSM.  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  31  The significant growth in the number of publications and online reach occurred in 2016 when compared to previous  years, as demonstrated in the graphs below.  Publications almost tripled year on year, while online reach, meaning  the size of audience exposed to the campaign’s advertisement, almost doubled in size.  5.2.6 Conclusions  The analytical indicators used to evaluate the campaign demonstrate a significant increase in growth year on year  compared to the average level of growth from the previous years. What is significant is that this was a trend that  span across a majority of the data points gathered for the evaluation, giving weight to the conclusion that the 2016  campaign outperformed that of previous years.  100  146  429  2014 2015 2016  40000000  60000000  112000000  2014 2015 2016  Figure 16: Overview of number of articles published during October overtime.

Conclusions and Future Work  The positive results of the evaluation coupled with the feedback received from the ECSM partners do not only  confirm that the campaign was a success but they demonstrate that the campaign outperformed the results of  previous years. Several factors contributed to this positive outcome, a major one being the strength of the  relationship between ENISA and the national partners, another being the agreement with the European Banking  Federation to host the kick-off event and another being the contribution of Europol’s EC3 in the Mobile Malware  theme of the week. Internally the readjustment in the working methods of the campaign also played a significant  role in capitalizing on each of these factors.  A number of novel ideas also contributed to the campaigns success, such as the “Ask Me Anything” session on Reddit  with F-Secure which reached the home page of Reddit with over 13 million subscribers, and the additional  involvement of ECSM partners during the planning phase contributed positively to the campaign.  Taking a critical look at the campaign, the 2016 edition helped lay bare the strengths / weaknesses of the campaign,  and raised questions on its vision and current trajectory.  The reason for this revelation were two fold, a new  coordination team and a revisiting of the initial objectives of the campaign.  A new team was charged with the  execution of the 2016 campaign, with this brought new fresh ideas to the table and good standing practices were  scrutinized with new eyes. The chief concern for the new team was to ensure the continuation of the campaign in a  similar capacity as the previous years so as not to jeopardise the existing efforts by knee jerk reactions. The second  element was to return back to the original text of the pilot project of 2012, the awareness raising material produced  by ENISA in that regard and also the Cyber Security Communications Strategy that was the driver for the campaign  in the first place. The work performed during the pilot project, the objectives outlined in the Cyber Security Strategy  and the documented awareness raising methods demonstrated that a schism had occurred between the current  campaigns direction and the intended campaign direction based on these foundational documents.  The combination of these elements assisted in drawing up the following conclusions regarding the campaign:  Strengths:   Keen involvement by majority of EU Member States   Campaign recognized across the IT Security industry  Weaknesses:   Minimal requests received by ENISA from Member States for support with their national campaigns   Difficulty in evaluating the main objectives of the campaign given the current available data gathering  practices   The ECSM website not being used as intended   Minimal private sector involved in the campaign   Commitment from the European Commission is lukewarm   Not all Member States are engaged in the campaign  The following points provide are a more detailed look at the shortfalls of the campaign:   The is not a detailed and comprehensive communication plan produced to assist partners and coordinators  with awareness raising, organizing press releases and social media activity  European Cyber Security Month 2016  December 2016  33   The ECSM website is being used as an events gathering portal rather than its intended goal of providing  awareness raising information and material to citizens   There is minimal impact analysis done for the management of financial resources   The work plan of the campaign was overly focused on the methodology rather than the goals and objectives  of the campaign  ENISA will seek to address each of these points over the coming year.  Already ENISA has sort the assistance of an  awareness raising expert to help assess and evaluate the campaign with its goals and objectives.  These risks will be  further addressed during the process of assessment so as to mitigate them during 2017.  The success of the campaign over the past years and specifically for those of 2016 are tantamount to the strength  of the ENISA brand to carry the campaign.  It is this marriage between ENISA and ECSM that has formed the  foundation that drives the popularity of the campaign; especially within the IT security industry. The questions is;  does the campaign have the momentum to continue as a standalone project?  6.1.1 2017 and beyond  The first point of call for 2017 is to attempt to re-align the campaign with the initial vision of the campaign as  reflected in the seed documents. To this end, ENISA has requested the assistance of a security awareness raising  academic to assess the campaign and help bridge the gap.  The 2016 edition highlighted many of the weaknesses and shortfalls of the campaign and these will be addressed in  the coming year as documented in the conclusions, however the campaign can also benefit in a number of areas by  considering the following aspects in the coming years:  • Making better use of social media channels to increase visibility and contact with citizens  • Seeking closer relationships and engagement with ECSM partners  • Using alternative means of communication with partners such as monthly newsletter and call for actions  • Producing a comprehensive list analytical indicators for evaluating the campaign  It is ENISA’s hope that the campaign will continue to deliver results above expectations in the coming years and that  issues raised within this report are addressed in order to provide the EU citizen with the tools necessary to act  accordingly when online.

Currently, businesses in the EU have to deal with 28 different data protection  laws. This fragmentation is a costly administrative burden that makes it harder for many companies,  particularly SMEs, to access new markets.  One of the core obligations for all businesses, including SMEs, acting either as data controllers or data  processors, in GDPR is that of the security of personal data. In particular, according to GDPR security equally  covers confidentiality, integrity and availability and should be considered following a risk-based approach:  the higher the risk, the more rigorous the measures that the controller or the processor needs to take (in  order to manage the risk). Even if this risk-based approach is not a new concept only a few specific privacy  risk assessment frameworks have been presented, focusing principally on the evaluation of risks to personal  data and adoption of relevant security measures.  On this basis and as part of its continuous support on EU policy implementation, ENISA published in 2016 a  set of guidelines for SMEs , acting as data controllers or processors, which aim at helping them assess security  risks and accordingly adopt security measures for the protection of personal data. Those guidelines can also  be of use in all cases where risk assessment is envisaged under the Regulation (e.g. Data Protection Impact  Assessment, personal data breach notification, etc).  Within 2017 the Agency continued its activities in the area and focused on providing further guidance on  the application of the aforementioned guidelines through specific uses cases. In close collaboration with  experts from national Data Protection Authorities, each use case corresponds to a specific personal data  processing operation and makes specific assumptions on the data processing environment and overall  context of processing. The provided examples however focus only on security measures and do not aim at  providing any legal analysis or assessment of compliance with GDPR for the specific data processing  operations. While performing the analysis, a number of conclusions and relevant recommendations,  targeted at different stakeholders, were drawn and are presented below.   Competent EU bodies, EU policy makers and regulators (e.g. Data Protection Authorities) should  develop practical and scalable guidelines that will be able to support and assist different types of data  controllers and address specific stakeholders’ communities.   Competent EU bodies, EU policy makers and regulators (e.g. Data Protection Authorities) should  promulgate a set of baseline professional skills and requirements that Data Protection Officers’ should  meet.   EU policy makers and regulators (e.g. Data Protection Authorities) should define and promote scalable  data protection certification schemes, that meet the needs of SMEs and empower them to achieve and  demonstrate compliance.   The research community and competent EU bodies, in close collaboration with regulators (e.g. Data  Protection Authorities), should propose and put forward methodologies that combine security risk  management and risk management of personal data.  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  07   SME communities and associations, in close collaboration with competent EU bodies and regulators  (e.g. Data Protection Authorities), should communicate and encourage data controllers to undertake  actions towards security and privacy compliance as a competitive advantage alongside the underlying  legal obligations.  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  08  1. Introduction  Background  The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 679/20161 (‘GDPR’) will be, as of 25 May 2018, the main data  protection legal framework in EU directly applicable to all Member States, repealing the current Data  Protection Directive 95/46/EC2. Under the Regulation, one of the core obligations for all businesses, acting  either as data controllers or data processors, is that of the security of personal data processing.  Although security of personal data has already been a legal obligation for data controllers under the Data  Protection Directive, GDPR reinforces the relevant provisions (both in substance and context), extending at  the same time this responsibility directly also to data processors.  In particular, the security of personal data processing is mainly mandated in Article 32 of GDPR, which  states that:  ‘Having regard to the state of the art and the costs of implementation  and taking into account the nature,  scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the  rights and freedoms of individuals, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical  and organisational measures, to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia, as  appropriate: (a) the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data; (b) the ability to ensure the  ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of systems and services processing personal  data; (c) the ability to restore the availability and access to data in a timely manner in the event of a  physical or technical incident; (d) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness  of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.’  The article further stipulates that ‘in assessing the appropriate level of security account shall be taken in  particular of the risks that are presented by data processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful  destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or  otherwise processed’. It also mentions that adherence to an approved code of conduct (Article 40 GDPR) or  an approved certification mechanism (Article 41 GDPR) may be used as an element to demonstrate  compliance with the requirements for the security of processing. Last, it states that the controller and  processor ‘shall take steps to ensure that any person acting under their authority and having access to  personal data, shall not process them except on instructions from the controller, unless otherwise required  by Union or member state law’.  According to the aforementioned provisions, in GDPR security equally covers confidentiality, integrity and  availability and should be considered following a risk-based approach: the higher the risk (for the rights  and freedoms of data subjects), the more rigorous the measures that the controller or the processor needs  to take (in order to manage the risk). Moreover, security of processing should be regarded within the  overall GDPR accountability framework for data protection, which is also risk-based and impact-based and  aims to fit into the specific operational context and practices of an organization.  1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj  2 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/1995/46/oj  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/1995/46/oj  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  09  Taking the above considerations into account, ENISA published in 2016 a set of guidelines for SMEs3, acting  as data controllers or processors, which aim at helping them assess security risks and accordingly adopt  security measures for the protection of personal data. Under its 2017 work-programme, ENISA decided to  continue this work by providing practical examples on the application of the guidelines by SMEs.  Scope and Objectives  The overall scope of the present report is to provide practical demonstrations and interpretation of the  methodological steps of the ENISA’s 2016 guidelines for SMEs3 on the security of personal data processing.  This is performed through specific use cases and pragmatic processing operations that are common for all  SMEs. For each use case, the ENISA’s guidelines are applied in order to assess in practice the risk (for the  rights and freedoms of data subjects) and adopt the technical and organisational measures that are  appropriate to the risk presented.  The target audience of the report is mainly SMEs, acting as data controllers or processors, that can use the  examples as an inspiration for their own assessment of risks and adoption of security measures, while  pursuing compliance with GDPR. Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) might also find the use cases of  interest in the context of their own data protection audit frameworks and security recommendations.  It should be noted that, although all types of data processing systems are covered by ENISA’s 2016  guidelines, this report is mainly focused on electronic personal data processing by SMEs, which is based  on IT networks and systems, as well as new digital technologies (e.g. cloud computing, mobile devices,  etc.).  The report focuses explicitly on security measures and does not aim at making any legal analysis or  assessment of compliance of specific data processing operations.  Methodology  The report was supported by an expert group, comprising of Georgia Panagopoulou (Hellenic Data  Protection Authority) and Giuseppe D'Acquisto (Italian Data Protection Authority). A number of processing  operations was identified as the most typical ones or the ones that are met more often for the majority of  SMEs and was then validated, to the extent possible, with relevant data controllers.  Structure  The structure of the document is as follows:   Chapter 2 provides an overview of the methodological steps on the evaluation of security risks by  SMEs, as already proposed in 2016.   Chapters 3 to 7 present the selected use cases, with an analysis of the each processing operation  and calculation of the overall level of risk, based on the methodological steps described earlier.   Chapter 8 draws a number of final observations and conclusions with regard to the implementation  of the proposed approach by SMEs.  The report complements previous ENISA’s work in the fields of privacy and security of personal data4.  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guidelines-for-smes-on-the-security-of-personal-data-processing  4 For more information, see: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guidelines-for-smes-on-the-security-of-personal-data-processing https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  10  2. Risk assessment and security measures for personal data  ENISA, in its 2016 guidelines5, presented a simplified approach that can guide the SMEs (acting as data  controllers or processors) through their specific data processing operation, supporting them in evaluating  the relevant security risks and accordingly adopting security measures.  In this chapter we provide a short overview of ENISA’s 2016 guidelines that will be used in the rest of the  report for providing practical examples. We also introduce the notion of ‘use cases’ upon which the  examples on data processing scenarios will be built.  Methodological steps overview  The ENISA’s guidelines for SMEs propose an approach on evaluation of risk, which is based on four steps, as  follows:   Definition of the processing operation and its context.   Understanding and evaluation of impact.   Definition of possible threats and evaluation of their likelihood (threat occurrence probability).   Evaluation of risk (combining threat occurrence probability and impact).  Following the evaluation of risk, the SMEs can adopt technical and organizational security measures (from  a proposed list) that are appropriate to the level of risk.  2.1.1 Step 1: Definition of the processing operation and its context  This step is the starting point of the risk assessment and is fundamental for the data controller in order to  define the boundaries of the data processing system (under assessment) and its relevant context. To  support SMEs in defining the processing operation a set of questions is provided.  1. What is the personal data processing operation?  2. What are the types of personal data processed?  3. What is the purpose of the processing?  4. What are the means used for the processing of personal data?  5. Where does the processing of personal data take place?  6. Which are the categories of data subjects?  7. Which are the recipients of the data?  While answering these questions, an SME needs to consider the various phases of the data processing  (collection, storage, use, transfer, disposal, etc.) and their subsequent parameters.  2.1.2 Step 2: Understanding and evaluating impact  Based on the analysis of Step 1, the data controller at this stage must assess the impact on the  fundamental rights and freedoms of the individuals, resulting from the possible loss of security of the  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guidelines-for-smes-on-the-security-of-personal-data-processing  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guidelines-for-smes-on-the-security-of-personal-data-processing  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  11  personal data. Four levels of impact are considered (Low, Medium, High, Very High) as shown in Table 1  below.  LEVEL OF IMPACT DESCRIPTION  Low  Individuals may encounter a few minor inconveniences, which they will overcome without any  problem (time spent re-entering information, annoyances, irritations, etc.).  Medium  Individuals may encounter significant inconveniences, which they will be able to overcome  despite a few difficulties (extra costs, denial of access to business services, fear, lack of  understanding, stress, minor physical ailments, etc.).  High  Individuals may encounter significant consequences, which they should be able to overcome  albeit with serious difficulties (misappropriation of funds, blacklisting by financial institutions,  property damage, loss of employment, subpoena, worsening of health, etc.).  Very high  Individuals which may encounter significant, or even irreversible consequences, which they  may not overcome (inability to work, long-term psychological or physical ailments, death, etc.).  Table 1: Levels of impact description  The evaluation of impact is a qualitative process and a number of factors need to be considered by the  data controller, such as the types of personal data, criticality of the processing operation, volume of  personal data, special characteristics of the data controller, as well as special categories of data subjects.  In order to support the controller in this process, Table 2 can be used to assess separately impact from loss  of confidentiality, integrity and availability.  After this assessment, three different levels of impact (for loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability)  will be obtained. The highest of these levels is considered as the final result of the evaluation of the  impact, relating to the overall processing of personal data.  NO QUESTION EVALUATION  I.1.  Please reflect on the impact that an unauthorized disclosure (loss of  confidentiality) of personal data - in the context where your business activity  takes place - could have on the individual and express a rating accordingly.  Low  Medium  High  Very high  I.2.  Please reflect on the impact that an unauthorized alteration (loss of integrity) of  personal data - in the context where your business activity takes place - could  have on the individual and express a rating accordingly.  Low  Medium  High  Very high  I.3.  Please reflect on the impact that an unauthorized destruction or loss (loss of  availability) of personal data - in the context where your business activity takes  place - could have on the individual and express a rating accordingly.  Low  Medium  High  Very high  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  12  Table 2: Impact evaluation questions  2.1.3 Step 3: Definition of possible threats and evaluation of their likelihood  At this step, the scope for the data controller is to understand the threats related to the overall environment  of the personal data processing (external or internal) and assess their likelihood (threat occurrence  probability).  To simplify this process, a number of assessment questions have been defined, which aim at making the  SMEs aware of the data processing environment (that is directly relevant to the threats). As such, they  relate to four main dimensions of this environment (assessment areas), namely:   Network and technical resources (hardware and software)   Processes/procedures related to the data processing operation   Different parties and people involved in the processing operation   Business sector and scale of the processing  Table 3 below summarizes the questions related to the assessment of threat occurrence probability.  A.  NETWORK AND TECHNICAL RESOURCES  1.  Is any part of the processing of personal data performed  through the internet?  When the processing of personal data is performed  fully or partially through the open Internet, possible  threats from external online attackers increase (e.g.  Denial of Service, SQL injection, Man-in-the-Middle  attacks), especially when the service is available (and,  thus, traceable/known) to all internet users.  2.  Is it possible to provide access to an internal personal data  processing system through the internet (e.g. for certain users or  groups of users)?  When access to an internal data processing system is  provided through the internet, the likelihood of  external threats increases (e.g. due to external online  attackers). At the same time the likelihood of  (accidental or intentional) misuse of data by the users  also increases (e.g. accidental disclosure of personal  data when working in public spaces). Special attention  should be given to cases where remote  management/administration of the IT system is  allowed.  3.  Is the personal data processing system interconnected to  another external or internal (to your organization) IT system or  service?  Connection to external IT systems may introduce  additional threats due to the threats (and potential  security flaws) that are inherent to those systems. The  same applies also to internal systems, taking into  account that, if not appropriately configured, such  connections may allow access (to the personal data) to  more persons within the organization (which are not in  principle authorized for such access).  4.  Can unauthorized individuals easily access the data processing  environment?  Although focus has been put on electronic systems and  services, the physical environment (relevant to these  systems and services) is an important aspect that, if not  adequately safeguarded, can seriously compromise  security (e.g. by allowing unauthorized parties to gain  physical access to the IT equipment and network  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  13  components or failing to provide protection of the  computer room in the event of a physical disaster).  5.  Is the personal data processing system designed, implemented  or maintained without following relevant best practices?  Poorly designed, implemented and/or maintained  hardware and software components can pose serious  risks to information security. To this end, good or best  practices accumulate the experience of prior events  and can be regarded as practical guidelines of how to  avoid exposure and achieve certain levels of resilience.  B. PROCESSES/PROCEDURES RELATED TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA  6.  Are the roles and responsibilities with regard to personal data  processing vague or not clearly defined?  When roles and responsibilities are not clearly defined,  access (and further processing) of personal data may  be uncontrolled, resulting to unauthorized use of  resources and compromising the overall security of the  system.  7.  Is the acceptable use of the network, system and physical  resources within the organization ambiguous or not clearly  defined  When acceptable use of resources is not clearly  mandated, security threats might arise due to  misunderstanding or intentional misuse of the system.  The clear definition of policies for network, system and  physical resources can reduce potential risks.  8.  Are the employees allowed to bring and use their own devices  to connect to the personal data processing system?  Employees using their personal devices within the  organization could increase the risk of data leakage or  unauthorized access to the information system.  Moreover, as devices are not centrally controlled, they  may introduce additional bugs or viruses into the  system.  9.  Are employees allowed to transfer, store or otherwise process  personal data outside the premises of the organization?  Processing of personal data outside the premises of  the organization can offer a lot of flexibility, but at the  same time introduces additional risks, both related to  the transmission of information through possibly  insecure network channels (e.g. open Wi-Fi networks),  as well as unauthorised use of this information.  10.  Can personal data processing activities be carried out without  log files being created?  The lack of appropriate logging and monitoring  mechanisms can increase intentional or accidental  abuse of processes/procedures and resources,  resulting to the subsequent abuse of personal data.  C. PARTIES/PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA  11.  Is the processing of personal data performed by a non-defined  number of employees?  When access (and further processing) of personal data  is open to a large number of employees, the  possibilities of abuse due to human factor increase.  Clearly defining who really needs to access the data  and limiting access only to those persons can  contribute to the security of personal data.  12.  Is any part of the data processing operation performed by a  contractor/third party (data processor)?  When the processing is performed by external  contractors, the organization may lose partially the  control over these data. Moreover, additional security  threats may be introduced due to the threats that are  inherent to these contractors. It is important for the  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  14  organization to select contractors that can offer a high  level of security and to clearly define what part of the  processing is assigned to them, maintaining as much as  possible a high level of control.  13.  Are the obligations of the parties/persons involved in personal  data processing ambiguous or not clearly stated?  When employees are not clearly informed about their  obligations, threats from accidental misuse (e.g.  disclosure or destruction) of data many significantly  increase.  14.  Is personnel involved in the processing of personal data  unfamiliar with information security matters?  When employees are not aware of the need of  applying security measures, they can accidentally pose  further threats to the system. Training can greatly  contribute to  making employees aware both of their  data protection obligations, as well as the application  of specific security measures.  15.  Do persons/parties involved in the data processing operation  neglect to securely store and/or destroy personal data?  Many personal data breaches occur due to the lack of  physical protection measures, such as locks and secure  destruction systems. Paper based files are usually part  of the input or the output of an information system,  can contain personal data and should also be protected  from unauthorized disclosure and re-use.  D. BUSINESS SECTOR AND SCALE OF PROCESSING  16.  Do you consider your business sector as being prone to  cyberattacks?  When security attacks have already taken place in a  specific business sector, there is an indication that the  organization would probably need to take additional  measures to avoid a similar event.  17.  Has your organization suffered any cyberattack or other type of  security breach over the last two years?  If the organization has already been attacked or there  are indications that this might have been the case,  additional measures need to be taken to prevent  similar events in the future.  18.  Have you received any notifications and/or complaints with  regard to the security of the IT system (used for the processing  of personal data) over the last year?  Security bugs/vulnerabilities can be exploited to  perform attacks (cyber or physical) to systems and  services. Security bulletins containing important  information regarding security vulnerabilities that  could affect the aforementioned systems and services  should be considered.  19.  Does a processing operation concern a large volume of  individuals and/or personal data?  The type and volume of personal data (scale) can make  the processing operation attractive to attackers (due  to the inherent value of these data).  20.  Are there any security best practices specific to your business  sector that have not been adequately followed?  Sector specific security measures are usually adjusted  to the needs (and risks) of the particular sector. Lack of  compliance with relevant best practices might be an  indicator of poor security management.  Following this approach, the level of threat occurrence probability can be defined for each of the assessment  areas, as follows:  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  15   Low: the threat is unlikely to materialize.   Medium: there is a reasonable chance that the threat materializes.   High: the threat is likely to materialize  Tables 4 and 5 can then be used to document the threat occurrence probability for each assessment area  and accordingly calculate its final value.  ASSESSMENT AREA  PROBABILITY  LEVEL SCORE  NETWORK AND TECHNICAL RESOURCES  Low 1  Medium 2  High 3  PROCESSES/PROCEDURES RELATED TO THE PROCESSING OF  PERSONAL DATA  Low 1  Medium 2  High 3  PARTIES/PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL  DATA  Low 1  Medium 2  High 3  BUSINESS SECTOR AND SCALE OF PROCESSING  Low 1  Medium 2  High 3  Table 3: Assessing threat occurrence probability per area  OVERALL SUM OF THREAT OCCURRENCE  PROBABILITY  THREAT OCCURRENCE PROBABILITY LEVEL  4 - 5 Low  6 - 8 Medium  9 -12 High  Table 4: Evaluation of threat occurrence  The final threat occurrence probability is calculated after summing up the four different scores obtained  under Table 4 and associating the result to the scales of Table 5.  2.1.4 Step 4: Evaluation of risk  After evaluating the impact of the personal data processing operation and the relevant threat occurrence  probability, the final evaluation of risk is possible (Table 6).  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  16  THREAT OCCURRENCE  PROBABILITY  IMPACT LEVEL  Low Medium High / Very High  Low  Medium  High  Legend  Low Risk  Medium Risk  High Risk  Table 6: Evaluation of risk  Irrespective of the final result of this exercise, the SME should feel free to adjust the obtained risk level,  taking into account specific characteristics of the data processing operation (that have been missed during  the assessment process) and providing adequate justification for this adjustment.  2.1.5 Step 5: Security measures  Following the evaluation of the risk level, the SME can proceed with the selection of appropriate security  measures for the protection of personal data.  The ENISA guidelines consider two broad categories of measures (organizational and technical ones),  which are further divided in specific subcategories. Under each subcategory measures are presented per  risk level (low: green, medium: yellow, high: red). In order to achieve scalability, it is assumed that all  measures described under the low level (green) are applicable to all levels. Similarly, measures presented  under the medium level (yellow) are applicable also to high level of risk. Measures presented under the  high level (red) are not applicable to any other level of risk.  Annex A: presents the list of proposed measures per risk level.  It should be noted that the matching of measures to specific risk levels should not be perceived as absolute.  Depending on the context of the personal data processing, the organization can consider adopting additional  measures, even if they are assigned to a higher level of risk. Furthermore, the proposed list of measures does not  take into account other additional sector specific security requirements, as well as specific regulatory obligations,  arising for example from the ePrivacy Directive6 or the NIS Directive7.  In an attempt to further facilitate this  procedure a mapping of the proposed group of measures with the ISO/IEC 27001:20138 security controls is also  included.  Use cases and approach of the report  As already mentioned, this report provides further guidance on the application of ENISA’s guidelines  (section 2.1) based on use case scenarios (‘use cases’). Each use case corresponds to a specific personal  6 Directive 2002/58/EC on privacy and electronic communications: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32002L0058  7 Directive 2016/1148 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems  across the Union http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1481193515962&uri=CELEX:32016L1148  8 ISO/IEC 27001:2013 - Information technology -- Security techniques -- Information security management systems –  Requirements http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=54534  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32002L0058 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32002L0058 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1481193515962&uri=CELEX:32016L1148 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=54534  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  17  data processing operation and makes specific assumptions on the data processing environment and overall  context of processing.  To this end, within the context of EU SMEs, a number of processing operations have been identified. These  processing operations vary from Human Resources (HR) related processes, provision of goods, marketing  and physical security/access control. In addition to these general categories, some specific use cases from  the health and education sectors are considered.  For each use case, a description of the processing operation is provided, depicting the assumptions that  were made and the specificities that were taken into account.  Then the evaluation of risk is performed, on  the basis of the assumptions made within the description and throughout the various steps. Specific  parameters that could alter the overall risk are also mentioned in certain cases. Following the risk  evaluation, the appropriate (to the identified level of risk) security measures can be adopted based on  Annex A:.  The calculation of risk for each use case should only be seen as an example of the application of  ENISA’s guidelines under the specific example scenario (and relevant assumptions made).  It cannot be regarded as an a priori applicable to the related data processing operations.  The data controller is advised to start with the examples provided and further carry out the  assessment based on her specific data processing context and environment.  The use cases focus only on security measures and do not aim at providing any legal analysis or  assessment of compliance with GDPR for the specific data processing operations.  To this end, any assumptions made under the use cases are only meant to facilitate the provision of  practical examples and they do not provide any indication with regard to the legality/compliance of  specific data processing operations.  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  18  3. Use Cases: Human Resource Processes  A typical SME will process personal data of its’ employees as part of the Human Resources (HR) activities.  Depending on the nature of business activities, the size and the internal organization of an SME, the  Human Recourses activities might pertain additional procedures, process more or less personal data or for  different purposes. The most common processing operations that we consider in this report are: a) Payroll  management, b) Leave - absence management, c) Recruitment and d) Evaluation of staff. Other operations  could include Health data of staff (e.g. annual medical check-ups required by the employer, trainings of  staff, etc.  Payroll management  Within the scope of this use case, we consider as an example a retail SME that processes personal data of  its employees for salaries, benefits and social security. The personal data considered to be processed are:  contact information (such as last and first name, address, telephone numbers,) social insurance number,  taxation Identifier, date of employment, position and salary information.  The processing operation is  facilitated by the HR IT system, which is deployed within the premises of the SME, and the HR officer  operates it. There is a specific use policy in place. However, there are no specific policies regarding data  retention and destruction. Processing of personal data is limited to the premises of the company. Towards  the end of each month, the HR officer submits to the financial Institutions and the social security institute  statements for all employees. Although the HR officer has signed a confidentiality disclaimer, no security or  data protection training has recently been performed for the SME’s employees.  3.1.1 Definition of the processing operation and its context  The specific data processing operation can be detailed, as follows:  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  EMPLOYEES PAYROLL MANAGEMENT  Personal Data Processed  Contact information (last and first name, address, telephone number,) social security  number, taxation Identifier, date of employment, salary information  Processing Purpose Payroll management (payment of salaries, benefits and social security contributions)  Data Subject Employees  Processing Means Human Resources IT System  Recipients of the Data  External Financial Institutions  External Social Insurance Schemes  Data Processor Used In-house (no data processor)  3.1.2 Evaluating Impact  Following the approach presented in section 2.1.2, the following analysis can be made:  Loss of confidentiality  Within the scope of the employees’ payroll management processing operation, as described above, the  impact from loss of confidentiality is mainly related to potential unintended disclosure of income (and  other relevant data) to third parties. This could expose the data subject to consequences ranging from the  discomfort arising from the public knowledge of one’s own private data to even, in specific cases, the  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  19  potential risk of targeted attacks from thefts or money seekers. This might be more than a simple  annoyance, and the impact from loss of confidentiality could, thus, be set to MEDIUM.  Loss of integrity and availability  The loss of integrity and/or availability might be in general considered as LOW, as data subjects are  expected to face  inconvenience (e.g. need to resubmit information or unable to receive monthly payment  on time) but the problems can be quickly overcome. More serious impacts from loss of confidentiality  might be set to MEDIUM if the consequences to data subjects are more persistent over time (e.g.  repeatedly delaying payments of salaries); this is however not considered to be the general case in our  example.  The next table summarizes the aforementioned analysis.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Medium Low Low  Overall Impact Evaluation MEDIUM  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is the highest identified. Therefore, the overall impact in  this particular case is evaluated as MEDIUM.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could be  higher from the one calculated above. An example of such case could be the:   systematic processing of specific health/disability data (e.g. due to special privileges/working  arrangements, such as extra allowances for impaired or disadvantaged employees). In such case the  data controller should consider whether the impact level is set to HIGH.  3.1.3 Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is LOW, as the system is not  connected to the internet and does not allow access from internet to internal resources and other IT  systems. It is assumed for this use case that unauthorized access is prevented following relevant ICT  security best practices.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  LOW, assuming that roles and responsibilities of HR officer are clearly defined along to an acceptable  use policy, processing of personal data is limited to the premises of the organization and log files are  created for any processing activity.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  MEDIUM as HR officers have not received relevant information security training and it is not certain  that personal data are always securely processed and/or destroyed (due to lack of relevant policies –  see use case description).   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is LOW as the business  sector of the SME is in general not considered prone to cyberattacks. It is assumed that no personal  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  20  data breach is known to have occurred in the past and the processing operation is limited only to the  employees of the SME.  ASSESSMENT AREA  PROBABILITY  LEVEL SCORE  Network and Technical Resources Low 1  Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data  Low 1  Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data  Medium 2  Business sector and scale of processing  Low 1  Overall Threat Occurrence Probability Low  (5)  Following the aforementioned assessment, the overall threat occurrence probability is calculated as LOW.  3.1.4 Evaluation of Risk and Adoption of Security Measures.  Using the results from impact assessment and threat occurrence probability, the risk is calculated based on  Section 2.1.4.  THREAT OCCURRENCE  PROBABILITY  IMPACT LEVEL  Low Medium High / Very High  Low  X  Medium  High  The overall risk for this particular case is generally considered as MEDIUM. Annex A: (A.1 and A.2) can be  used for the adoption of measures appropriate to the risk presented.  Note should be taken that the risk might be different (higher) under special conditions directly related to  the specific data processing operation and affecting either the impact or the threat occurrence  probability (see also relevant considerations under section 3.1.2).  Recruitment  Within the scope of this use case, we consider again the retail SME described in section 3.1. Staff  recruitment is a process run by HR and consists of numerous organizational activities aimed at the  selection of people who have specific skills or are capable of performing certain tasks. After the vacancy  notice has been published, candidates are invited to submit their application electronically alongside a  detailed curriculum, with the academic education and qualifications, working experience, further  professional or academic training, family status, and personal details such as first and last name, address,  telephone numbers, date of birth. The selection committee reviews and evaluates the applications and  comes up with a list of candidates to be invited for an interview. During the interview, the selection  committee members take notes on the performance of the candidate and at the end they draft a detailed  report which is submitted to senior management. Processing is facilitated by an IT system which supports  the submission of applications, the shortlisting of candidates and the interview reports and is operated by  an HR officer.  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  21  3.2.1 Definition of the processing operation and its context  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  RECRUITMENT  Personal Data Processed  Academic education and qualifications, working experience, further professional or  academic training , family status, first and last name, address, telephone numbers,  date of birth, interview notes/report  Processing Purpose Managing candidate selection for recruitment  Data Subject Recruitment Candidates  Processing Means Recruitment IT platform  Recipients of the Data Internal Senior Management  Data Processor Used In-house (no data processor)  3.2.2 Evaluating Impact  Following the approach presented in section 2.1.2, the following analysis can be made:  Loss of confidentiality  Within the scope of the employees’ recruitment operation, as described above, the loss of confidentiality  could allow disclosure of data of the candidates, potentially leading to embarrassment or defamation. This  is mainly related to the evaluation results, that may provide an assessment of the candidate’s professional  experience and capacity, as well as other personal qualities (e.g. ability to communicate well or express  himself/herself clearly). For the purpose of this use case, we assume that the recruitment platform  provides for a structured assessment of the candidates, based on specific professional criteria, and does  not include other types of assessments of the personality or characteristics of the candidate (e.g.  psychological profile). Following the aforementioned description, the data subject is expected to  encounter from minor to serious inconvenience from loss of confidentiality, which could in some cases  influence her ability of getting employed. Therefore, the impact level for this case could in general be  considered as MEDIUM.  Loss of integrity  The level of impact resulting from loss of integrity is considered to be MEDIUM as unauthorized alteration  of personal data processed could either hinder the successful accomplishment of the recruitment  procedure or amend the eligibility/ interview report of a candidate (and, thus, her possibility of getting  employed).  Loss of availability  The level of impact resulting from loss of integrity is considered to be LOW as data subjects are expected  to encounter minor inconvenience, due to the delay of the process, which will not be invalidated though.  The next table summarizes the aforementioned analysis.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Medium Medium Low  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  22  Overall Impact Evaluation MEDIUM  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is the highest identified and therefore the overall impact  evaluated is MEDIUM.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could be  higher from the one calculated above. For example, such could be the case of an evaluation process  including psychological tests or specific behavioural characteristics of the candidates. Another case could  be if personal data related to disabilities, ethnic background etc. are also processed.  3.2.3  Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions, presented in Section 2.1.3, we the following assessment was made for each  dimension of the processing operations’ environment:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is LOW as the processing is not  performed through the Internet and the evaluation platform is a dedicated system, which is not  connected to other IT systems of the SME. Like in previous cases, it is assumed that best practices are  deployed to prevent unauthorized access and accordingly safeguard the data.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  LOW, assuming that roles and responsibilities of employees involved are clearly defined along to an  acceptable use policy, processing of personal data is limited to the premises of the organization and  log files are created for any processing activity.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  MEDIUM as it includes a large number of employees involved in the processing (HR officers, selection  committee, senior management) and it is assumed that not all employees involved in the processing  have received relevant information security training.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is LOW as the business  sector of the SME is in general not considered prone to cyberattacks and no personal data breach is  known to have occurred in the past. The processing operation is limited only to the employees of the  SME.  ASSESSMENT AREA  PROBABILITY  LEVEL SCORE  Network and Technical Resources Low 1  Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data  Low 1  Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data  Medium 2  Business sector and scale of processing  Low 1  Overall Threat Occurrence Probability Low  (5)  Following the aforementioned assessment, the overall threat occurrence probability is calculated as LOW.  3.2.4 Evaluation of Risk  Using the results from impact assessment and threat occurrence probability, the risk is calculated based on  Section 2.1.4.  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  23  THREAT OCCURRENCE  PROBABILITY  IMPACT LEVEL  Low Medium High / Very High  Low  X  Medium  High  In particular, the overall risk for this particular case is generally considered as MEDIUM. Annex A: (A.1 &  A.2) can be used for the adoption of measures appropriate to the risk presented.  Note should be taken that the risk might be different (higher) under conditions directly related to the  specific data processing operation and affecting either the impact or the threat occurrence probability.  For example, if the candidates have access to their evaluation reports directly through the recruitment IT  platform, the threat occurrence probability would probably be increased to HIGH. See also relevant  considerations under section 3.3.2 for impact evaluation.  Evaluation of employees  Within the scope of this use case, we consider as an example an SME specializing in IT products and  relevant consultancy services. On a yearly basis, each employee is evaluated by the line manager against  predefined and pre-agreed criteria related to his/her performance and professional characteristics, which  include reliability, orientation towards users/customers, timeliness/readiness, interpersonal skills,  flexibility, autonomy, written and oral communication skills and team spirit. The processing is performed  by an HR officer and line managers with electronic tools and paper documentation. The line manager  produces a first version of the report on paper and discusses the findings with the employee. The final  version of the report is duly signed and submitted electronically to the HR department while the summary  and the conclusions/findings of the report are submitted electronically as well.  3.3.1 Definition of the processing operation and its context  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  EVALUATION OF STAFF  Personal Data Processed  First and last name, position within the SME, date of employment, employment  history, technical skills, knowledge and behaviours (work performance evaluation  reports)  Processing Purpose  Assessment of the performance and professional characteristics that arise in the  execution of the work  Data Subject Employees  Processing Means Human Resources IT System  Recipients of the Data Internal Line Managers  Data Processor Used In-house (no data processor)  3.3.2 Evaluating Impact  Following the approach presented in section 2.1.2, the following analysis can be made:  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  24  Loss of confidentiality  Within the scope of this processing operation, it should be taken into account that the staff assessment  provides a detailed professional profile of the employee by attributing quantitative and qualitative values  to her performance at work. Although evaluation may be limited to work performance, in the course of the  exercise, other individual's characteristics may emerge, creating a marginal risk that information relating to  the behavior and personality of the employees is also processed. The loss of confidentiality of this data  could range from simple discomfort to dishonor or even limitation of the employee, e.g. when seeking for  a new job. Therefore, the impact of loss of confidentiality is considered as MEDIUM.  Loss of integrity  The loss of integrity might be in general considered as MEDIUM as data subjects are expected to encounter  significant inconveniences including improper evaluation or lack or delays in benefitting from the results of  the evaluation.  Loss of availability  The loss of availability might be in general considered as LOW as data subjects are expected to encounter  minor inconveniences due to the delay of the process, which will not be invalidated though. The next table  summarizes the aforementioned analysis.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Medium Medium Low  Overall Impact Evaluation MEDIUM  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is the highest identified and therefore the overall impact  evaluated is MEDIUM.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could be  higher from the one calculated above. An example of such case could be when the:   Specific working context requires an assessment of the psychological characteristics of the  employees or when sensitive data are included in the course of the evaluation process (e.g.  relating to persons with disabilities).  3.3.3  Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is LOW, as the system is not  connected to the internet and does not allow access from internet to internal resources and other IT  systems. It is assumed for this use case that unauthorized access is prevented based on relevant best  practices.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  MEDIUM, assuming that the use policy is not clearly defined  and processing of information is not  necessarily limited to the premises of the organization (paper based process).  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  25   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  MEDIUM as it is assumed (from the case description) that there no specific policies regarding secure  storage and deletion of data (especially when part of the process is paper based).   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is LOW as the business  sector of the SME is in general not considered prone to cyberattacks and it is assumed that no personal  data breach is known to have occurred in the past. The processing operation is limited only to the  employees of the SME.

Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  26  4. Use cases: Customers management, marketing and suppliers  A typical SME will process personal data of its customers and perform marketing activities so as to attract  new customers. It may also process personal data in relation to its suppliers. Depending on the nature of  business activities, the nature and amount of products and services portfolio, as well as the target market,  the activities may differentiate and include processing of different types of personal data in a different  scale or/and for different purposes.  Order and delivery of goods  Within the scope of this use case, we consider a retail SME that offers goods through a dedicated e-shop.  Customers can browse through the available goods, add them to the cart and check out. In order to  complete the order, the customer has to register at the e-shop platform (if not already registered) and  provide her contact details (first and last name, delivery address, telephone number and email address).  During the checkout process, registered users are also asked to provide payment details in a separate  form, which is provided by the payment services provider. Following the successful placement of the order  and the confirmation from the payment service provider, the details of the order are transmitted to the  Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, to the Customer Relation Management (CRM) system and to  the delivery services provider. Regarding the use of the system there is a specific use policy in place and  best practises are implemented and maintained. However, there are no specific policies regarding data  retention and destruction and not all employees involved has received relevant information security  training.  4.1.1 Definition of the processing operation and its context  The specific data processing operation can be detailed, as follows:  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  ORDER AND DELIVERY OF GOODS  Personal Data Processed  Contact information (last and first name, address, telephone number) payment data  (credit card, bank account information)  Processing Purpose Order and delivery of goods  Data Subject Customers  Processing Means Order Management system  Recipients of the Data  External Payment services provider  External Delivery services provider  Internal Customer Relation Management (CRM) system  Internal Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system  Data Processor Used In-house and external parties  4.1.2 Evaluating Impact  Loss of confidentiality and integrity  Within the scope of the specific processing operation, as described earlier, the impact from loss of  confidentiality and/or integrity is considered as MEDIUM, as unauthorized disclosure and/or alteration of  personal data processed, including financial data, could result in significant inconveniences for the data  subject (which can be recovered with some effort).  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  27  Loss of availability  The level of impact resulting from loss of availability is considered to be LOW, as unavailability of the  personal data processed is expected to result only to minor inconveniences for the data subject which can  easily be overcome, e.g. delay of the delivery of goods.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Medium Medium Low  Overall Impact Evaluation MEDIUM  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is therefore MEDIUM.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases in which the overall impact could  be different (higher) from the one calculated above. An example could be the case when goods available  for order can reveal sensitive data about the individual, e.g. relating to her health, sexual or political and  religious preferences.  4.1.3 Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is MEDIUM, as part of the  processing of personal data is performed through the internet and the processing system is  interconnected to another internal and external IT systems. It is assumed for this use case that  unauthorized access to personal data is prevented based on relevant best practices.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  LOW, as it assumed that roles and responsibilities of employees are clearly defined in line with an  acceptable use policy, the processing of personal data is limited to the premises of the organization  and log files are created for any processing activity being performed.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  MEDIUM as not all employees have received relevant information security training and it is not  ensured that personal data are always securely processed and/or destroyed.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is MEDIUM as the business  sector of the as the business sector of the SME (e-shop) can be considered in general as prone to  cyberattacks and the processing operation does concern a large number of individuals. However, it is  assumed for the particular case that a personal data breach has very occurred in the past.

THREAT OCCURRENCE  PROBABILITY  IMPACT LEVEL  Low Medium High / Very High  Low  Medium  X  High  In particular, the overall risk for this particular case is generally considered as MEDIUM. Annex A (A.1 &  A.2) can be used for the adoption of measures appropriate to the risk presented.  Note should be taken that the risk might be different (higher) under conditions directly related to the  specific data processing operation and affecting either the impact or the threat occurrence probability  (see also relevant considerations under section 4.1.2).  Marketing/advertising  Within the scope of this use case, we consider the retail SME described in section 4.1, which processes  personal data of potential customers in order to promote the different kinds of goods available within its  portfolio. For such processing to take place it is assumed that data subjects have already provided their  consent via paper or electronic form (we do not make any legal analysis in the context of the use case).  For this processing operation, the SME makes use of a dedicated web tool, offered by a third party  provider who specializes in such activities. The third party provider is EU based and adheres to relevant  security best practices. Each month, an officer from the marketing department, inserts to the web tool,  through an appropriate web interface the contact information (first and last name, email address) of  potential customers and updates the list with any potential customers that have requested not to be  included in the list. Every week, the officer initiates a new marketing campaign through the web tool,  which then sends respective personalized emails, to the lastly updated recipients list. For each campaign,  the tool provides a report with statistics on the percentage of emails read, unread, deleted without  however providing information on specific individuals.  4.2.1 Definition of the processing operation and its context  The specific data processing operation can be detailed, as follows :  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  MARKETING/ADVERTISING  Personal Data Processed Contact info (e.g name, postal address, telephone number, email)  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  29  Processing Purpose Promotion of goods and special offers to possible customers  Data Subject Customers and potential Customers  Processing Means Third party marketing campaign web service  Recipients of the Data  External Third party marketing campaign web service provider  Internal Marketing Department  Internal CRM IT system  Data Processor Used Third party marketing campaign web service provider  4.2.2 Evaluating Impact  Loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability  Within the scope of the specific operation, the impact from loss of confidentiality, and/or integrity and/or  availability is considered to be LOW, as individuals may encounter some minor inconvenience, e.g. by  unauthorized disclosure of their contact info (which could lead to spam) or unauthorized modification of  their data, excluding them from a potential marketing campaign. In all cases the issue can be easily  resolved with some small effort.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Low Low Low  Overall Impact Evaluation LOW  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is therefore LOW.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could be  different (higher) from the one calculated above. An example could be a case where the inclusion of the  individual in a marketing campaign may reveal sensitive information, e.g. related to her racial or ethnic  origin, political opinions or health status.  Another example could be if the processing operation included processing of personal data in order to  cultivate a better understanding of customers and potential customers’ habits, preferences and eventually  orient appropriately their marketing strategies. This type of processing would then be characterized as  ‘profiling’ and data related to data subject’s possible preferences and interests (acquired through the  profiling process). Within the scope of this specific processing operation, the impact from loss of  confidentiality would then be considered as MEDIUM, as individuals may encounter in certain cases  significant problems by having their preferences, shopping habits, interests being accessed by third parties  in an unknown way. It could be raised to HIGH, e.g. in case that this profiling is based on sensitive data.  4.2.3 Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is MEDIUM, as the processing of  personal data is performed through the internet and the processing system is interconnected to other  internal and external IT systems.  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  30   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  LOW, as it is assumed that processes are well defined and the specialised third party adheres to  security best practices in the field.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  MEDIUM as part of the data processing operation is performed by a data processor (third party) and,  thus, the SME is not in full control of the data. Still, it is assumed that the specialised third adheres to  security best practices in the field.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is MEDIUM as the business  sector of the SME (e-shop) is in general prone to cyberattacks and the processing operation does  concern a large number of individuals. However, it is assumed that a personal data breach has never  occurred in the past.

THREAT OCCURRENCE  PROBABILITY  IMPACT LEVEL  Low Medium High / Very High  Low  Medium X  High  In particular, the overall risk for this particular case is considered as LOW. Annex A (A.1) can be used for  the adoption of measures appropriate to the risk presented.  Note should be taken that the risk might be different (Medium of even High) under conditions directly  related to the specific data processing operation and affecting either the impact or the threat occurrence  probability (see also relevant considerations under section 4.2.2).  Suppliers of services and goods  Within the scope of this use case, we consider the retail SME described in 4.1, which acquires services and  goods needed for both day to day operation and also for sale of goods. These procedures may include in  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  31  certain cases processing of personal data, for instance, contact data of specific employees working for the  suppliers or contact and financial data of persons that are in direct contract with the SME (i.e. directly  acting as suppliers of goods or services).  The processing operation is supported by an IT system connected to the Enterprise Resource Planning  (ERP) system and the Accounting System. The processed personal data include company name and contact  details, financial data (tax number, banking account), employee pictures and access credentials (for staff  working within premises).  All business relationships between SMEs and suppliers take place using CRM via extranet, directly to the  platforms of the suppliers. Payments are made using remote banking services.

IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Low Low Low  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  32  Overall Impact Evaluation LOW  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is LOW.  Further to the assumptions made in this use case, there might be cases where the overall impact could be  different (higher) from the one calculated above. An example of such case could be when the company  operates in a ‘sensitive’ environment and, thus, the disclosure of employees’ names might put them at risk  (e.g. in a military environment).  4.3.3  Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is MEDIUM, as the system is  connected to the internet and it is possible to provide access to the internal personal data processing  system through the internet. However, best practices are used to prevent unauthorized access.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  LOW, as it is assumed that roles and responsibilities of personnel are clearly defined along to an  acceptable use policy, employees are not allowed to bring their own devices and store, transfer or  ortherwise process personal data outside the premises of the organization and log files are created for  any processing activity being performed.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: Threat occurrence probability for is LOW  as employees are not able to transfer, store or otherwise process personal data outside the premises  of the organization while the acceptable use of the network, system and physical resources within the  organization is clearly defined and employees involved in the data processing operation securely store  and destroy personal data.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is LOW as the business  sector of the SME is in general not considered prone to cyberattacks, a security breach incident or a  complaint has not been received during the last two years and the processing operation does not  concern a large number of individuals.

Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  34  5. Safety and security  Access control  Within the scope of this use case, we consider as an example a consulting company (SME) that processes  the personal data of its employees and visitors for physical access control within its premises, in order to  ensure that only the authorized individuals have access into and out of specific areas.  The deployed access control system comprises of RFID card readers installed in predefined points, RFID  cards and the access control management platform. Each employee, upon taking up his or her duties, is  registered to the access control management platform and is assigned a unique alphanumeric value which  is stored in an RFID card. The personal data used during the registration include first and last name, date of  employment, position within the organization, end of employment (if specified by the contract) and a  profile picture. Each employee’s RFID card is personalized as the name of the employee and his/her profile  picture are printed on the card. For each type of position within the organization (administration,  manager, secretariat support etc.) specific access rights are predefined. Each time an employee swipes her  card against a reader, the platform checks the rights and grants access to the premise accordingly. Each  attempt is logged within the platform and in case of an unauthorized access attempt, the security officer is  notified. Visitors are also issued respective anonymized visitor RFID cards which are preset to allow access  only to meeting rooms. Upon arrival of a visitor, the security officer registers within the platform the first  and last name of the visitor, the accompanying employee’s first and last name and the expected duration  of the visit and assigns temporarily a RFID card to the visitor. Upon departure or expiry of the duration of  visit, the card is invalidated and is returned to the security officer. Security officers operating the platform  have received special training on the functions of the platform and their obligations and it is assumed that  best practices are followed.  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  ACCESS CONTROL  Personal Data Processed  For employees: first and last name, date of employment, position within the  organization, end of employment, a profile picture.

For example, employees might not  be able to access specific premises of the SME and perform their task (integrity or availability loss) or a  visitor’s presence in the SME premises might be disclosed (confidentiality loss).  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  35  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Low Low Low  Overall Impact Evaluation LOW  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is therefore LOW.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could be  different (higher) from the one calculated above. An example of such case is when the visit to the SME’s  premises may reveal specific sensitive information, e.g. with regard to health, religious beliefs, political or  sexual preferences.  5.1.2  Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is LOW, as the system is not  connected to the internet, it does not allow access from internet to internal resources and connection  to other IT systems and it is assumed that best practices are used to prevent unauthorized access to  the system.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  LOW, as it is assumed that roles and responsibilities of security officer are clearly defined along to an  acceptable use policy and log files are created for any processing activity being performed.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is LOW  as the security officer is not able to transfer, store or otherwise process personal data outside the  premises of the organization while the acceptable use of the network, system and physical resources  within the SME is clearly defined.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is LOW as the business  sector of the SME is not in general considered prone to cyberattacks, a personal data breach has not  occurred in the past and the processing operation does not concern a large number of individuals.

Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  36  THREAT  OCCURRENCE  PROBABILITY  IMPACT LEVEL  Low Medium High / Very High  Low X  Medium  High  In particular, the overall risk for this particular case is generally considered as LOW. Annex A (A.1) can be  used for the adoption of measures appropriate to the risk presented.  Note should be taken that the risk might be different (Medium or even High) under conditions directly  related to the specific data processing operation and affecting either the impact or the threat occurrence  probability (see also relevant considerations under section 5.1.2). For example, the threat occurrence  probability might be higher in case where the SME operates in a ‘sensitive’ environment, e.g. a health  data laboratory (thus, increasing the possibilities of malicious attempts to gain unauthorised access to  premises).  Moreover, account should be taken in general to the fact that access control is an integral measure for  preventing unauthorised access to one’s premises and, thus, directly linked to security and safety of  persons and goods. Therefore, depending again on the nature of the organisation, the SME might  consider increasing the overall risk to MEDIUM or even HIGH.  Closed Circuit Television System (CCTV)  Within the scope of this use case, we consider the SME described in section 5.1, which also processes  personal data by means of CCTV (images and video with no sound), in order to enhance the security and  safety of people and goods in their premises. It should be noted that the use case does not aim at making  any legal analysis or on the use of CCTV; we, therefore, assume that the processing is GDPR compliant and  that the guidance of the Data Protection Authority (DPA) has been taken into account. Still, we note that in  all cases special attention should be paid to the legal basis of CCTV operation, which should be in  compliance with both data protection and labour legal and normative requirements and obligations.  The CCTV system in our example comprises of the camera, and the CCTV management IT system which  records the feed, displays it to the security officers and logs any activity on processing non –real time  feeds. The feed is stored for the time indicated by the DPA and is then automatically deleted securely,  unless the operator extracts it manually for cases which require further examination (for example a  security alarm during non-working hours, etc.) Security officers operating the platform have received  special training on the functions of the platform and their obligations and it is assumed that best practises  are used to avoid authorized access to the feed.  Special attention should be paid to the legal basis of the installation and operation of the CCTV  system, which should be in compliance to both data protection and labour legal and normative  requirements and obligations.  5.2.1 Definition of the processing operation and its context  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  37  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  CCTV  Personal Data Processed Image and video of persons (employees, visitors).

Loss of integrity and availability  The loss of integrity is rather hard to achieve (from a technical point of view) in this particular case, as it  would require manipulation of the video images. Loss of availability relates to the unavailability (full or  temporal) of video footage. In both cases, the impact is considered LOW and it could even be stated that  there is no impact for the individuals at all (as loss of CCTV footage is a problem for the SME, but not for  the individuals who are being recorded).  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Low Low Low  Overall Impact Evaluation LOW  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is therefore LOW.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could be  different (higher) from the one calculated above. An example of such case is when the visit to the SME’s  premises could reveal or infer sensitive information, e.g. related to health status, religious beliefs, political  or sexual preferences.  5.2.3  Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is LOW, as the system is assumed to  not be connected to the internet and best practices are used to prevent unauthorized access.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  LOW, as roles and responsibilities of security officers are clearly defined along to an acceptable use  policy and log files are created for any processing activity being performed  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  38   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is LOW  as employees are not able to transfer, store or otherwise process CCTV data outside the premises of  the organization while the acceptable use of the network, system and physical resources within the  organization is clearly defined.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is LOW as the business  sector of the SME is not in general considered as prone to cyberattacks and, a personal data breach  has not occurred in the past.

For example, the threat occurrence  probability might be higher in case where the SME uses advanced CCTV systems, which allow zooming  and video recording (note that in such cases the overall legality of the data processing operation should  be carefully analysed).  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  39  6. Specific use case: Health sector  Health Services Provision  Within the scope of this use case, we consider an SME in the health care domain (small clinic) which  processes personal data in order to provide healthcare services. For each patient visiting the clinic to  perform an examination or a consultation visit, an electronic record is created (or updated) and includes  patients’ contact details, social insurance number, medical exams’ results, pathologies, allergies, diagnosis  and cure schemas (medical information). Through this record, treating doctors and nurses have an  overview of the history and the status of the patients’ health and can access it if needed from pre-defined  terminals within the clinic premises. Prior to the medical examination or consultation visit, the eligibility of  the patient to receive such examination or treatment without covering its cost is validated against the  public health system records. If the patient or exanimation is not eligible, the cost is communicated to the  accounting IT system which issues the respective invoice. After each examination or consultation visit,  patient records are updated with the latest data by the treating doctor or nurse either by scanning paper  based documents or inserting manually diagnosis and cure schemas.  The IT platform supporting this processing operation, is hosted within the premises of the SME and it is not  accessible through the Internet. For the purpose of the use case, it is assumed that best practises are used  to prevent unauthorized access to the platform and that periodical security awareness raising trainings are  being organized. Still, access rights to the patients’ medical records are not explicitly defined at a granular  level, as nurses and doctors need to be able to access the files at any time and the system does not  support relevant granularity. The SME plans to have a more dedicated patient record system within the  next years.  6.1.1 Definition of the processing operation and its context  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  HEALTH SERVICES PROVISION  Personal Data Processed  Contact Information (last and first name, address, telephone number,) social insurance  number, medical examination results, pathologies, allergies, diagnosis and cure  schemas (medical information), administrative and financial information (invoices,  hospitalisation papers, etc.).

Equally important (HIGH) may be the loss of integrity, as wrong medical  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  40  information might even put an individual’s life at risk.  The same (HIGH) could be argued also for the loss of  availability, as even a temporal unavailability of the clinic’s IT system might hinder its operations, thus  putting patients at serious risk.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  High High High  Overall Impact Evaluation HIGH  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is therefore HIGH.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could  even be considered as VERY HIGH, for example in cases of vulnerable categories of data subjects or minors.  6.1.3  Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is MEDIUM, as the system is  interconnected to other external and internal systems. However, the data cannot be accessed via the  Internet and, according to the use case description, security best practices have been applied to  prevent unauthorized access to the system.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  LOW, as roles and responsibilities of personnel are clearly defined along to an acceptable use policy,  the processing of data is limited in the premises of the SME and log files are created for any processing  activity being performed.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is HIGH  as processing of personal data is performed by an undefined number of employees and there is no  clear policy regarding granular access to the health records. However, the obligations of all parties  involved in the processing are clearly defined and awareness raising seminars are organized  periodically.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is HIGH as the business  sector of the SME (healthcare) is in generally considered prone to cyberattacks and the processing  operation does concern a large number of individuals. However, it is assumed that as personal data  breach has not occurred in the past.

Medically Assisted Procreation  Within the scope of this use case, we consider an SME in the health care domain specializing in Medically  Assisted Procreation (MAP) that processes personal data for management and tracking of biological  samples stored within its premises. MAP includes different methods or techniques based on the  manipulation of reproductive cells that will allow infertile couples to conceive a child. MAP procedures also  include cryopreservation techniques for gametes (oocytes and spermatozoa) and embryos.  The IT system deployed internally to support MAP holds records for each sample that include: information  of the donor (first and last name, address, telephone number, date of birth), social insurance number,  health data, genetic sample data and genetic sample identifier. Through the platform, the operator can  perform the following functions: a) sample management,  traceability of all sample manifestations, sample  position management within cryogenic containers, and b) access management and registration of  cryopreserved samples.  Regarding the use of the IT system, a specific use policy is in place alongside specific policies regarding data  retention and destruction. Processing of personal data is limited to the premises of the SME. Access to the  platform is allowed only to specific employees of the SME, acting as the operators, and to the doctor and  biologist employees responsible for performing MAP. All platform users have been clearly informed about  their obligations regarding personal data processing and awareness-raising training is organized  periodically.  The platform is not connected to the internet and it is assumed that best practises are used  to prevent unauthorised access.  6.2.1 Definition of the processing operation and its context  The specific data processing operation can be detailed, as follows:  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES FOR MEDICALLY ASSISTED PROCREATION  Personal Data Processed  Information of the donor (first and last name, address, telephone number, date of  birth), social insurance number, health data, genetic sample data and genetic sample  identifier  Processing Purpose Management of genetic sampled for Medically Assisted Procreation (MAP)  Data Subject Donors  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  42  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES FOR MEDICALLY ASSISTED PROCREATION  Processing Means Medically Assisted Procreation Management IT system  Recipients of the Data Internal  Data Processor Used In-house (no data processor)  6.2.2 Evaluating Impact  Following the approach presented in section 2.1.2, the following analysis can be made:  Loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability  Within the scope of the specific processing operation the impact from loss of confidentiality is considered  HIGH, as data subjects are expected to encounter significant adverse effects from unauthorised disclosure  of health and genetic data. The impact from loss of integrity or availability is equally important (HIGH), as  data subjects are expected to encounter significant or even irreversible inconvenience from unauthorised  alteration or loss of health and genetic data, which could even prevent them from undergoing a MAP  procedure.

Remote monitoring of patients with chronic diseases  Within the scope of this use case, we consider an SME in the health care domain specializing in providing  homecare remote monitoring services for patients who have been diagnosed with a chronic condition.  Each patient is provided with a monitoring device, which allows real time tracking of vital signs and  transmission of information such as blood pressure, glucose level, pulse and ECG rhythm in set intervals  diagnoses to the affiliated healthcare centre. The monitoring device also acts as a communication device,  enabling patients to respond to personalized clinician-directed surveys related to the compliance level of  treatment schemas.  The remote monitoring device is supported by a web-based platform, hosted by a cloud provider within  the EU, which collects and correlates all data transmitted in order to detect any deviations from the clinical  protocol and determine the overall health status of the patient. Should a deviation from acceptable values  and procedures is detected, a medical practitioner communicates through phone with the patient to  determine whether an in house visit is required.  The personal data involved in the processing operation include patients’ personal information, such as first  and last name, address, telephone numbers, date of birth, alongside social insurance number, health  status data, diagnosis results, treatment schemas, vital signs readings and relevant statistics. The web  platform is operated by authorized medical practitioners with clearly defined roles, responsibilities and  obligations related to personal data processing.

Specific use case: Education sector  Early childhood – Crèche  Within the scope of this use case, we consider an early childhood school which uses a web platform to  support communication of day to day physical, intellectual, language, emotional and social activities of  minors between the school and the parents. In addition, the platform may also include information on the  childrens’ health, appetite and disposition (provided by the parents). Parents are also able to communicate  with the educator and seek advice and support on how to nurture and better support the cognitive and  social-emotional development of their infant.  The platform is hosted at an EU based hosting provider and operated by the educators. Each educator  manages and updates information about the children assigned to his or her classroom, while the overall  administration of the platform is performed by the secretariat of the school. Parents are registered to the  platform by the secretariat and can only access and update the data of their child. It is assumed that best  practices are being used to prevent unauthorized access, roles and responsibilities of employees involved  are clearly defined and communicated, and log files are created for all data processing activities.  The  platform processes the following data: first and last name, date of birth, home address, daily information  on the child’s performance (including eating, activities, etc.), health data, allergies, nutrition intolerances,  parent(s) first and last name, parent(s) telephone number, emergency contact number.  7.1.1 Definition of the processing operation and its context  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  EARLY CHILDHOOD SCHOOL COMMUNICATION PLATFORM  Personal Data Processed  First and last name, date of birth, home address, daily information on the child’s  performance (including eating, activities, etc.), health data, allergies, nutrition  intolerances, parent(s) first and last name, parent(s) telephone number, emergency  contact number  Processing Purpose  Provision of educational services (communication of day to day activities and child’s  development)  Data Subject Children and parents  Processing Means Web based  Recipients of the Data  External Parents  Internal Secretariat, Educators  Data Processor Used Web hosting provider  7.1.2 Evaluating Impact  Loss of confidentiality  Within the scope of the specific processing operation, the impact from loss of confidentiality is considered  as MEDIUM, as in certain cases individuals (children and parents) may encounter significant inconvenience  from the disclosure of certain data (e.g. regarding the child’s behavior or communication or eating  patterns).  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  47  Loss of integrity  The loss of integrity can also be considered as MEDIUM, as unauthorized modification of this data could  possibly hinder the appropriate provision of services by the crèche (especially with regard to allergies,  nutrition patterns and other related data).  Loss of availability  The loss of availability can be considered as LOW, since the unavailability of the data can lead to some  minor inconvenience that can be easily overcome (e.g. by entering again the data in the platform or  communicating with the parents through other means)..  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Medium Medium Low  Overall Impact Evaluation MEDIUM  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is the highest identified and therefore the overall impact  evaluated is MEDIUM.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could be  higher than the one calculated above. An example of such case is when there are particular diet plans  followed by specific children (e.g. due to religious beliefs). Another example is the case of a school  specifically dedicated to children with special conditions or disabilities.  7.1.3  Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is MEDIUM, as the system is  connected to the internet and it is possible to provide access to the internal personal data processing  system through the internet. However, best practices are used to prevent unauthorized access and it is  assumed that these are up-to-date.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  MEDIUM, as there are different parties accessing the same platform and it is not clear if roles and  responsibilities have been clearly defined. Still, there is an  acceptable use policy in place and log files  are created for any processing activity being performed.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  MEDIUM as a third party data processor is being used and employees are able to transfer, store or  otherwise process personal data outside the premises of the school. However, it is assumed that  acceptable use of the network, system and physical resources is clearly defined.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is LOW as the business  sector of the SME (education) is not in general considered as prone to cyberattacks and the processing  operation does not concern a large number of individuals. It is assumed that no personal data breach  has even occurred in the past.

Note should be taken that the risk might be different (higher) under conditions directly related to the  specific data processing operation and affecting either the impact or the threat occurrence probability  (see also relevant considerations under section 7.1.2).  University e-learning platform  Within the scope of this use case we consider a university which offers an e-learning and course  management platform hosted internally in a web server. Through the platform, professors and  administration can send announcements to students and students can retrieve their course materials,  lecture notes and slides, submit assignments, undertake assessments and tests and get evaluation results  and grades. At the beginning of each semester the University’s administration department enrols students  to modules (courses) and assigns respective privileges to both students and academic staff. It is assumed  that best practices are being used to prevent unauthorized access, roles and responsibilities of employees  involved are clearly defined and communicated, and log files are created for all data processing activities.  For evaluation results, professors submit the final scores to administration in paper, and administration  encodes them to the platform. The platform processes the following data: a) Students: first and last name,  date of birth, date of admission, selected course(s), evaluation results, grades; b) Academic Staff: first and  last name, date of birth, course(s) assigned.

Loss of integrity  The impact from loss of confidentiality is considered also as MEDIUM, since data subjects are expected to  encounter significant inconvenience from unauthorised alteration of personal data which directly influence  their performance and grades.  Loss of availability  The impact from loss of confidentiality is considered LOW, as data subjects are expected to encounter  minor inconvenience from unavailability of personal data, which can be easily overcome (assuming that  there are back-ups and information on evaluation results and grades is also stored offline).  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Medium Medium Low  Overall Impact Evaluation MEDIUM  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is the highest identified and therefore the overall impact  evaluated is MEDIUM.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could be  different (higher) than the one calculated above. An example of such case could be the possible integration  of the platform with social network profiles, where other data are also collected about the students (e.g.  lifestyle, habits, etc.). Another example could be the possible use of the platform for statistics and  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  50  analytics. Note should be taken that in both of these cases, the overall legality of the data processing  operations should be carefully assessed.  7.2.3  Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is MEDIUM, as the system is  connected to the internet and it is possible to provide access to the internal personal data processing  system through the internet. However, it is assumed that best practices are used to prevent  unauthorized access and that these are up-to-date.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  MEDIUM, due to the different parties accessing the system and the fact that roles and responsibilities  need to be very clearly set. Still, it is assumed that there is a specific acceptable use policy and log files  are created for any processing activity being performed.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is LOW  as a third party data processor is being used and. However, it is assumed that acceptable use of the  network, system and physical resources is clearly defined and employees are able to transfer, store or  otherwise process personal data outside the premises of the school.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is MEDIUM as the  processing operation does concern a large number of individuals and the business sector of the SME  (higher education - university) could potentially be prone to cyberattacks.

Conclusions  Security of personal data processing is already a legal obligation for data controllers, however the  imminent General Data Protection Regulation reinforces the relevant provisions (both in substance and  context) and extends this responsibility directly also to data processors. Considering the specific  characteristics of SMEs, such as limited resources and unavailability of qualified personnel, this report  builds on top of the methodological steps of the ENISA’s 2016 guidelines for SMEs3 (on the security of  personal data processing) and provides a practical demonstration of the aforementioned steps through  specific use cases. Each use case corresponds to a specific personal data processing operation and makes  specific assumptions on the data processing environment and overall context of processing. The provided  examples focus only on security measures and do not aim at providing any legal analysis or assessment of  compliance with GDPR for the specific data processing operations.  While performing the analysis of selected use cases, a number of conclusions and relevant recommendations  were drawn and are discussed below.  Guidance Needed  Similar personal data processing operations may differ among data controllers, taking into consideration  their specificities, the means used for the processing of personal data, the categories of data subjects, the  data processors and the recipients of data. Therefore, a one-size fits all approach on the overall risk based  approach, which extends beyond the data security provisions, cannot be regarded as viable and pragmatic.  Each processing operation should be reviewed separately taking also into account the context and  environment of the processing. Therefore, instead of a priori categorizing processing operations into risk  levels, the focus should be shifted on empowering and guiding the data controllers to first comprehend  their processing operations and then evaluate the level of risk and deploy the appropriate security  measures.  Competent EU bodies, EU policy makers and regulators (e.g. Data Protection Authorities) should  develop practical and scalable guidelines that will be able to support and assist different types of data  controllers and address specific stakeholders’ communities.  Skilled DPO’s  The empowerment of data controllers can also be perceived as a matter of raising their awareness to their  processing operations and the overall GDPR provisions. In order, though, to be able to manage their  compliance in a more structured manner, rather than a sporadic remedial action, it is expected that they  will seek support and guidance.  The role of an appropriately qualified Data Protection Officer (DPO) is  central in this approach, even when the designation of a DPO is not mandatory according to GDPR Article  37. Having said that, it is important to note that the fulfilment of this role requires both a good  understanding of the data protection legal framework, as well as the modern IT technologies (and relevant  security best practices), which form the basis for most common data processing means today9.  9 See relevant guidelines on Data Protection Officers issued by Article 29 Data Protection Working Party,  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=43823  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=43823  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  53  Competent EU bodies, EU policy makers and regulators (e.g. Data Protection Authorities) should  promulgate a set of baseline professional skills and requirements that Data Protection Officers’ should  meet.  Demonstrating Compliance  As discussed earlier, the security of personal data processing should not be regarded by data controllers as  an isolated obligation under GDPR but as part of the overall compliance framework they should develop,  implement and maintain. The ENISA methodology can be useful in this regard in all cases where risk  assessment is envisaged under the Regulation (e.g. personal data breach notification). Throughout the  development of the aforementioned compliance framework, data controllers should try to extend the  documentation of their approach, beyond the level imposed by GDPR provisions. This not only ensures  that they actively and positively consider the risks of any data processing they undertake but will also step  up their efforts with regards to the accountability principle and demonstrating compliance. Furthermore,  as the risk based approach is integral part of Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), it is expected that  availability of documentation will also facilitate the undertaking, even on a voluntary basis, of the DPIA.  SMEs communities/associations and data controllers should engage in the notion of risk assessment  and relevant structured documentation as an integral part of information management systems for  personal data.  Regulators (e.g. Data Protection Authorities) should provide guidance and support training for data  controllers in this context.  Scalable Certification Schemes  The data protection certification mechanisms of GDPR (Articles 42 and 43) have the potential to play a  significant role in enabling data controllers to achieve and demonstrate the existence of appropriate  safeguards, including security measures, and therefore compliance of their processing operations with  GDPR provisions. As data controllers, and especially SMEs, are relying more and more on third party  technologies, products and services, it is important to be encouraged and motivated to assess the level of  conformity of these parties and, if possible, acquire such certifications. Given the voluntary nature of  certification mechanisms under GDPR, it is crucial that data controllers are motivated and encouraged to  adhere to certification schemes, as well as opt for data processors that are following similar practices.  EU policy makers and regulators (e.g. Data Protection Authorities) should define and promote scalable  data protection certification schemes, that meet the needs of SMEs and empower them to achieve  and demonstrate compliance.  SME communities/associations and data controllers should opt for data processors that adhere to  security best practices and relevant certification mechanisms.  Novel Risk Management Methodologies  Information security risk management and risk management of personal data security regard the  calculation of risk levels from two different standpoints: the first one focuses on the impact for the data  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  54  controller and the latter on the impact for data subjects. However, both approaches result in proposed  sets of organizational and technical measures to be implemented, maintained and reviewed by the data  controller. Regardless of the specificities described earlier, a common methodology, embracing both  aspects, could enable data controllers, specifically SMEs, to follow a systematic approach towards reaching  compliance.  The research community and competent EU bodies, in close collaboration with regulators (e.g. Data  Protection Authorities), should propose and put forward methodologies that combine security risk  management and risk management of personal data.  Communication and Awareness Raising  EU SMEs are only starting to consider the changes they should undertake and broaden the perspective of  their existing information security and business strategies in order to meet the legal requirements.  However, the extent of change(s) required, in order to integrate them into existing business processes,  cannot be foreseen. Data controllers are often reluctant and perceive such changes as a barrier rather than  an opportunity to position themselves in a newly created market, reinforcing also their customers’  confidence and trust.  SME communities and associations, in close collaboration with competent EU bodies and regulators  (e.g. Data Protection Authorities), should communicate and encourage data controllers to undertake  actions towards security and privacy compliance as a competitive advantage alongside the underlying  legal obligations.  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  55  Annex A: Organizational and Technical Measures  Under each section, measures are presented per risk level (low: green, medium: yellow, high: red). In order  to achieve scalability, it is assumed that all measures described under the low level (green) are applicable  to all levels.

Currently, businesses in the EU have to deal with 28 different data protection  laws. This fragmentation is a costly administrative burden that makes it harder for many companies,  particularly SMEs, to access new markets.  One of the core obligations for all businesses, including SMEs, acting either as data controllers or data  processors, in GDPR is that of the security of personal data. In particular, according to GDPR security equally  covers confidentiality, integrity and availability and should be considered following a risk-based approach:  the higher the risk, the more rigorous the measures that the controller or the processor needs to take (in  order to manage the risk). Even if this risk-based approach is not a new concept only a few specific privacy  risk assessment frameworks have been presented, focusing principally on the evaluation of risks to personal  data and adoption of relevant security measures.  On this basis and as part of its continuous support on EU policy implementation, ENISA published in 2016 a  set of guidelines for SMEs , acting as data controllers or processors, which aim at helping them assess security  risks and accordingly adopt security measures for the protection of personal data. Those guidelines can also  be of use in all cases where risk assessment is envisaged under the Regulation (e.g. Data Protection Impact  Assessment, personal data breach notification, etc).  Within 2017 the Agency continued its activities in the area and focused on providing further guidance on  the application of the aforementioned guidelines through specific uses cases. In close collaboration with  experts from national Data Protection Authorities, each use case corresponds to a specific personal data  processing operation and makes specific assumptions on the data processing environment and overall  context of processing. The provided examples however focus only on security measures and do not aim at  providing any legal analysis or assessment of compliance with GDPR for the specific data processing  operations. While performing the analysis, a number of conclusions and relevant recommendations,  targeted at different stakeholders, were drawn and are presented below.   Competent EU bodies, EU policy makers and regulators (e.g. Data Protection Authorities) should  develop practical and scalable guidelines that will be able to support and assist different types of data  controllers and address specific stakeholders’ communities.   Competent EU bodies, EU policy makers and regulators (e.g. Data Protection Authorities) should  promulgate a set of baseline professional skills and requirements that Data Protection Officers’ should  meet.   EU policy makers and regulators (e.g. Data Protection Authorities) should define and promote scalable  data protection certification schemes, that meet the needs of SMEs and empower them to achieve and  demonstrate compliance.   The research community and competent EU bodies, in close collaboration with regulators (e.g. Data  Protection Authorities), should propose and put forward methodologies that combine security risk  management and risk management of personal data.  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  07   SME communities and associations, in close collaboration with competent EU bodies and regulators  (e.g. Data Protection Authorities), should communicate and encourage data controllers to undertake  actions towards security and privacy compliance as a competitive advantage alongside the underlying  legal obligations.  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  08  1. Introduction  Background  The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 679/20161 (‘GDPR’) will be, as of 25 May 2018, the main data  protection legal framework in EU directly applicable to all Member States, repealing the current Data  Protection Directive 95/46/EC2. Under the Regulation, one of the core obligations for all businesses, acting  either as data controllers or data processors, is that of the security of personal data processing.  Although security of personal data has already been a legal obligation for data controllers under the Data  Protection Directive, GDPR reinforces the relevant provisions (both in substance and context), extending at  the same time this responsibility directly also to data processors.  In particular, the security of personal data processing is mainly mandated in Article 32 of GDPR, which  states that:  ‘Having regard to the state of the art and the costs of implementation  and taking into account the nature,  scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the  rights and freedoms of individuals, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical  and organisational measures, to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia, as  appropriate: (a) the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data; (b) the ability to ensure the  ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of systems and services processing personal  data; (c) the ability to restore the availability and access to data in a timely manner in the event of a  physical or technical incident; (d) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness  of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.’  The article further stipulates that ‘in assessing the appropriate level of security account shall be taken in  particular of the risks that are presented by data processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful  destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or  otherwise processed’. It also mentions that adherence to an approved code of conduct (Article 40 GDPR) or  an approved certification mechanism (Article 41 GDPR) may be used as an element to demonstrate  compliance with the requirements for the security of processing. Last, it states that the controller and  processor ‘shall take steps to ensure that any person acting under their authority and having access to  personal data, shall not process them except on instructions from the controller, unless otherwise required  by Union or member state law’.  According to the aforementioned provisions, in GDPR security equally covers confidentiality, integrity and  availability and should be considered following a risk-based approach: the higher the risk (for the rights  and freedoms of data subjects), the more rigorous the measures that the controller or the processor needs  to take (in order to manage the risk). Moreover, security of processing should be regarded within the  overall GDPR accountability framework for data protection, which is also risk-based and impact-based and  aims to fit into the specific operational context and practices of an organization.  1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj  2 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/1995/46/oj  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/1995/46/oj  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  09  Taking the above considerations into account, ENISA published in 2016 a set of guidelines for SMEs3, acting  as data controllers or processors, which aim at helping them assess security risks and accordingly adopt  security measures for the protection of personal data. Under its 2017 work-programme, ENISA decided to  continue this work by providing practical examples on the application of the guidelines by SMEs.  Scope and Objectives  The overall scope of the present report is to provide practical demonstrations and interpretation of the  methodological steps of the ENISA’s 2016 guidelines for SMEs3 on the security of personal data processing.  This is performed through specific use cases and pragmatic processing operations that are common for all  SMEs. For each use case, the ENISA’s guidelines are applied in order to assess in practice the risk (for the  rights and freedoms of data subjects) and adopt the technical and organisational measures that are  appropriate to the risk presented.  The target audience of the report is mainly SMEs, acting as data controllers or processors, that can use the  examples as an inspiration for their own assessment of risks and adoption of security measures, while  pursuing compliance with GDPR. Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) might also find the use cases of  interest in the context of their own data protection audit frameworks and security recommendations.  It should be noted that, although all types of data processing systems are covered by ENISA’s 2016  guidelines, this report is mainly focused on electronic personal data processing by SMEs, which is based  on IT networks and systems, as well as new digital technologies (e.g. cloud computing, mobile devices,  etc.).  The report focuses explicitly on security measures and does not aim at making any legal analysis or  assessment of compliance of specific data processing operations.  Methodology  The report was supported by an expert group, comprising of Georgia Panagopoulou (Hellenic Data  Protection Authority) and Giuseppe D'Acquisto (Italian Data Protection Authority). A number of processing  operations was identified as the most typical ones or the ones that are met more often for the majority of  SMEs and was then validated, to the extent possible, with relevant data controllers.  Structure  The structure of the document is as follows:   Chapter 2 provides an overview of the methodological steps on the evaluation of security risks by  SMEs, as already proposed in 2016.   Chapters 3 to 7 present the selected use cases, with an analysis of the each processing operation  and calculation of the overall level of risk, based on the methodological steps described earlier.   Chapter 8 draws a number of final observations and conclusions with regard to the implementation  of the proposed approach by SMEs.  The report complements previous ENISA’s work in the fields of privacy and security of personal data4.  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guidelines-for-smes-on-the-security-of-personal-data-processing  4 For more information, see: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guidelines-for-smes-on-the-security-of-personal-data-processing https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  10  2. Risk assessment and security measures for personal data  ENISA, in its 2016 guidelines5, presented a simplified approach that can guide the SMEs (acting as data  controllers or processors) through their specific data processing operation, supporting them in evaluating  the relevant security risks and accordingly adopting security measures.  In this chapter we provide a short overview of ENISA’s 2016 guidelines that will be used in the rest of the  report for providing practical examples. We also introduce the notion of ‘use cases’ upon which the  examples on data processing scenarios will be built.  Methodological steps overview  The ENISA’s guidelines for SMEs propose an approach on evaluation of risk, which is based on four steps, as  follows:   Definition of the processing operation and its context.   Understanding and evaluation of impact.   Definition of possible threats and evaluation of their likelihood (threat occurrence probability).   Evaluation of risk (combining threat occurrence probability and impact).  Following the evaluation of risk, the SMEs can adopt technical and organizational security measures (from  a proposed list) that are appropriate to the level of risk.  2.1.1 Step 1: Definition of the processing operation and its context  This step is the starting point of the risk assessment and is fundamental for the data controller in order to  define the boundaries of the data processing system (under assessment) and its relevant context. To  support SMEs in defining the processing operation a set of questions is provided.  1. What is the personal data processing operation?  2. What are the types of personal data processed?  3. What is the purpose of the processing?  4. What are the means used for the processing of personal data?  5. Where does the processing of personal data take place?  6. Which are the categories of data subjects?  7. Which are the recipients of the data?  While answering these questions, an SME needs to consider the various phases of the data processing  (collection, storage, use, transfer, disposal, etc.) and their subsequent parameters.  2.1.2 Step 2: Understanding and evaluating impact  Based on the analysis of Step 1, the data controller at this stage must assess the impact on the  fundamental rights and freedoms of the individuals, resulting from the possible loss of security of the  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guidelines-for-smes-on-the-security-of-personal-data-processing  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guidelines-for-smes-on-the-security-of-personal-data-processing  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  11  personal data. Four levels of impact are considered (Low, Medium, High, Very High) as shown in Table 1  below.  LEVEL OF IMPACT DESCRIPTION  Low  Individuals may encounter a few minor inconveniences, which they will overcome without any  problem (time spent re-entering information, annoyances, irritations, etc.).  Medium  Individuals may encounter significant inconveniences, which they will be able to overcome  despite a few difficulties (extra costs, denial of access to business services, fear, lack of  understanding, stress, minor physical ailments, etc.).  High  Individuals may encounter significant consequences, which they should be able to overcome  albeit with serious difficulties (misappropriation of funds, blacklisting by financial institutions,  property damage, loss of employment, subpoena, worsening of health, etc.).  Very high  Individuals which may encounter significant, or even irreversible consequences, which they  may not overcome (inability to work, long-term psychological or physical ailments, death, etc.).  Table 1: Levels of impact description  The evaluation of impact is a qualitative process and a number of factors need to be considered by the  data controller, such as the types of personal data, criticality of the processing operation, volume of  personal data, special characteristics of the data controller, as well as special categories of data subjects.  In order to support the controller in this process, Table 2 can be used to assess separately impact from loss  of confidentiality, integrity and availability.  After this assessment, three different levels of impact (for loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability)  will be obtained. The highest of these levels is considered as the final result of the evaluation of the  impact, relating to the overall processing of personal data.  NO QUESTION EVALUATION  I.1.  Please reflect on the impact that an unauthorized disclosure (loss of  confidentiality) of personal data - in the context where your business activity  takes place - could have on the individual and express a rating accordingly.  Low  Medium  High  Very high  I.2.  Please reflect on the impact that an unauthorized alteration (loss of integrity) of  personal data - in the context where your business activity takes place - could  have on the individual and express a rating accordingly.  Low  Medium  High  Very high  I.3.  Please reflect on the impact that an unauthorized destruction or loss (loss of  availability) of personal data - in the context where your business activity takes  place - could have on the individual and express a rating accordingly.  Low  Medium  High  Very high  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  12  Table 2: Impact evaluation questions  2.1.3 Step 3: Definition of possible threats and evaluation of their likelihood  At this step, the scope for the data controller is to understand the threats related to the overall environment  of the personal data processing (external or internal) and assess their likelihood (threat occurrence  probability).  To simplify this process, a number of assessment questions have been defined, which aim at making the  SMEs aware of the data processing environment (that is directly relevant to the threats). As such, they  relate to four main dimensions of this environment (assessment areas), namely:   Network and technical resources (hardware and software)   Processes/procedures related to the data processing operation   Different parties and people involved in the processing operation   Business sector and scale of the processing  Table 3 below summarizes the questions related to the assessment of threat occurrence probability.  A.  NETWORK AND TECHNICAL RESOURCES  1.  Is any part of the processing of personal data performed  through the internet?  When the processing of personal data is performed  fully or partially through the open Internet, possible  threats from external online attackers increase (e.g.  Denial of Service, SQL injection, Man-in-the-Middle  attacks), especially when the service is available (and,  thus, traceable/known) to all internet users.  2.  Is it possible to provide access to an internal personal data  processing system through the internet (e.g. for certain users or  groups of users)?  When access to an internal data processing system is  provided through the internet, the likelihood of  external threats increases (e.g. due to external online  attackers). At the same time the likelihood of  (accidental or intentional) misuse of data by the users  also increases (e.g. accidental disclosure of personal  data when working in public spaces). Special attention  should be given to cases where remote  management/administration of the IT system is  allowed.  3.  Is the personal data processing system interconnected to  another external or internal (to your organization) IT system or  service?  Connection to external IT systems may introduce  additional threats due to the threats (and potential  security flaws) that are inherent to those systems. The  same applies also to internal systems, taking into  account that, if not appropriately configured, such  connections may allow access (to the personal data) to  more persons within the organization (which are not in  principle authorized for such access).  4.  Can unauthorized individuals easily access the data processing  environment?  Although focus has been put on electronic systems and  services, the physical environment (relevant to these  systems and services) is an important aspect that, if not  adequately safeguarded, can seriously compromise  security (e.g. by allowing unauthorized parties to gain  physical access to the IT equipment and network  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  13  components or failing to provide protection of the  computer room in the event of a physical disaster).  5.  Is the personal data processing system designed, implemented  or maintained without following relevant best practices?  Poorly designed, implemented and/or maintained  hardware and software components can pose serious  risks to information security. To this end, good or best  practices accumulate the experience of prior events  and can be regarded as practical guidelines of how to  avoid exposure and achieve certain levels of resilience.  B. PROCESSES/PROCEDURES RELATED TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA  6.  Are the roles and responsibilities with regard to personal data  processing vague or not clearly defined?  When roles and responsibilities are not clearly defined,  access (and further processing) of personal data may  be uncontrolled, resulting to unauthorized use of  resources and compromising the overall security of the  system.  7.  Is the acceptable use of the network, system and physical  resources within the organization ambiguous or not clearly  defined  When acceptable use of resources is not clearly  mandated, security threats might arise due to  misunderstanding or intentional misuse of the system.  The clear definition of policies for network, system and  physical resources can reduce potential risks.  8.  Are the employees allowed to bring and use their own devices  to connect to the personal data processing system?  Employees using their personal devices within the  organization could increase the risk of data leakage or  unauthorized access to the information system.  Moreover, as devices are not centrally controlled, they  may introduce additional bugs or viruses into the  system.  9.  Are employees allowed to transfer, store or otherwise process  personal data outside the premises of the organization?  Processing of personal data outside the premises of  the organization can offer a lot of flexibility, but at the  same time introduces additional risks, both related to  the transmission of information through possibly  insecure network channels (e.g. open Wi-Fi networks),  as well as unauthorised use of this information.  10.  Can personal data processing activities be carried out without  log files being created?  The lack of appropriate logging and monitoring  mechanisms can increase intentional or accidental  abuse of processes/procedures and resources,  resulting to the subsequent abuse of personal data.  C. PARTIES/PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA  11.  Is the processing of personal data performed by a non-defined  number of employees?  When access (and further processing) of personal data  is open to a large number of employees, the  possibilities of abuse due to human factor increase.  Clearly defining who really needs to access the data  and limiting access only to those persons can  contribute to the security of personal data.  12.  Is any part of the data processing operation performed by a  contractor/third party (data processor)?  When the processing is performed by external  contractors, the organization may lose partially the  control over these data. Moreover, additional security  threats may be introduced due to the threats that are  inherent to these contractors. It is important for the  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  14  organization to select contractors that can offer a high  level of security and to clearly define what part of the  processing is assigned to them, maintaining as much as  possible a high level of control.  13.  Are the obligations of the parties/persons involved in personal  data processing ambiguous or not clearly stated?  When employees are not clearly informed about their  obligations, threats from accidental misuse (e.g.  disclosure or destruction) of data many significantly  increase.  14.  Is personnel involved in the processing of personal data  unfamiliar with information security matters?  When employees are not aware of the need of  applying security measures, they can accidentally pose  further threats to the system. Training can greatly  contribute to  making employees aware both of their  data protection obligations, as well as the application  of specific security measures.  15.  Do persons/parties involved in the data processing operation  neglect to securely store and/or destroy personal data?  Many personal data breaches occur due to the lack of  physical protection measures, such as locks and secure  destruction systems. Paper based files are usually part  of the input or the output of an information system,  can contain personal data and should also be protected  from unauthorized disclosure and re-use.  D. BUSINESS SECTOR AND SCALE OF PROCESSING  16.  Do you consider your business sector as being prone to  cyberattacks?  When security attacks have already taken place in a  specific business sector, there is an indication that the  organization would probably need to take additional  measures to avoid a similar event.  17.  Has your organization suffered any cyberattack or other type of  security breach over the last two years?  If the organization has already been attacked or there  are indications that this might have been the case,  additional measures need to be taken to prevent  similar events in the future.  18.  Have you received any notifications and/or complaints with  regard to the security of the IT system (used for the processing  of personal data) over the last year?  Security bugs/vulnerabilities can be exploited to  perform attacks (cyber or physical) to systems and  services. Security bulletins containing important  information regarding security vulnerabilities that  could affect the aforementioned systems and services  should be considered.  19.  Does a processing operation concern a large volume of  individuals and/or personal data?  The type and volume of personal data (scale) can make  the processing operation attractive to attackers (due  to the inherent value of these data).  20.  Are there any security best practices specific to your business  sector that have not been adequately followed?  Sector specific security measures are usually adjusted  to the needs (and risks) of the particular sector. Lack of  compliance with relevant best practices might be an  indicator of poor security management.  Following this approach, the level of threat occurrence probability can be defined for each of the assessment  areas, as follows:  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  15   Low: the threat is unlikely to materialize.   Medium: there is a reasonable chance that the threat materializes.   High: the threat is likely to materialize  Tables 4 and 5 can then be used to document the threat occurrence probability for each assessment area  and accordingly calculate its final value.  ASSESSMENT AREA  PROBABILITY  LEVEL SCORE  NETWORK AND TECHNICAL RESOURCES  Low 1  Medium 2  High 3  PROCESSES/PROCEDURES RELATED TO THE PROCESSING OF  PERSONAL DATA  Low 1  Medium 2  High 3  PARTIES/PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL  DATA  Low 1  Medium 2  High 3  BUSINESS SECTOR AND SCALE OF PROCESSING  Low 1  Medium 2  High 3  Table 3: Assessing threat occurrence probability per area  OVERALL SUM OF THREAT OCCURRENCE  PROBABILITY  THREAT OCCURRENCE PROBABILITY LEVEL  4 - 5 Low  6 - 8 Medium  9 -12 High  Table 4: Evaluation of threat occurrence  The final threat occurrence probability is calculated after summing up the four different scores obtained  under Table 4 and associating the result to the scales of Table 5.  2.1.4 Step 4: Evaluation of risk  After evaluating the impact of the personal data processing operation and the relevant threat occurrence  probability, the final evaluation of risk is possible (Table 6).  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  16  THREAT OCCURRENCE  PROBABILITY  IMPACT LEVEL  Low Medium High / Very High  Low  Medium  High  Legend  Low Risk  Medium Risk  High Risk  Table 6: Evaluation of risk  Irrespective of the final result of this exercise, the SME should feel free to adjust the obtained risk level,  taking into account specific characteristics of the data processing operation (that have been missed during  the assessment process) and providing adequate justification for this adjustment.  2.1.5 Step 5: Security measures  Following the evaluation of the risk level, the SME can proceed with the selection of appropriate security  measures for the protection of personal data.  The ENISA guidelines consider two broad categories of measures (organizational and technical ones),  which are further divided in specific subcategories. Under each subcategory measures are presented per  risk level (low: green, medium: yellow, high: red). In order to achieve scalability, it is assumed that all  measures described under the low level (green) are applicable to all levels. Similarly, measures presented  under the medium level (yellow) are applicable also to high level of risk. Measures presented under the  high level (red) are not applicable to any other level of risk.  Annex A: presents the list of proposed measures per risk level.  It should be noted that the matching of measures to specific risk levels should not be perceived as absolute.  Depending on the context of the personal data processing, the organization can consider adopting additional  measures, even if they are assigned to a higher level of risk. Furthermore, the proposed list of measures does not  take into account other additional sector specific security requirements, as well as specific regulatory obligations,  arising for example from the ePrivacy Directive6 or the NIS Directive7.  In an attempt to further facilitate this  procedure a mapping of the proposed group of measures with the ISO/IEC 27001:20138 security controls is also  included.  Use cases and approach of the report  As already mentioned, this report provides further guidance on the application of ENISA’s guidelines  (section 2.1) based on use case scenarios (‘use cases’). Each use case corresponds to a specific personal  6 Directive 2002/58/EC on privacy and electronic communications: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32002L0058  7 Directive 2016/1148 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems  across the Union http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1481193515962&uri=CELEX:32016L1148  8 ISO/IEC 27001:2013 - Information technology -- Security techniques -- Information security management systems –  Requirements http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=54534  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32002L0058 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32002L0058 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1481193515962&uri=CELEX:32016L1148 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=54534  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  17  data processing operation and makes specific assumptions on the data processing environment and overall  context of processing.  To this end, within the context of EU SMEs, a number of processing operations have been identified. These  processing operations vary from Human Resources (HR) related processes, provision of goods, marketing  and physical security/access control. In addition to these general categories, some specific use cases from  the health and education sectors are considered.  For each use case, a description of the processing operation is provided, depicting the assumptions that  were made and the specificities that were taken into account.  Then the evaluation of risk is performed, on  the basis of the assumptions made within the description and throughout the various steps. Specific  parameters that could alter the overall risk are also mentioned in certain cases. Following the risk  evaluation, the appropriate (to the identified level of risk) security measures can be adopted based on  Annex A:.  The calculation of risk for each use case should only be seen as an example of the application of  ENISA’s guidelines under the specific example scenario (and relevant assumptions made).  It cannot be regarded as an a priori applicable to the related data processing operations.  The data controller is advised to start with the examples provided and further carry out the  assessment based on her specific data processing context and environment.  The use cases focus only on security measures and do not aim at providing any legal analysis or  assessment of compliance with GDPR for the specific data processing operations.  To this end, any assumptions made under the use cases are only meant to facilitate the provision of  practical examples and they do not provide any indication with regard to the legality/compliance of  specific data processing operations.  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  18  3. Use Cases: Human Resource Processes  A typical SME will process personal data of its’ employees as part of the Human Resources (HR) activities.  Depending on the nature of business activities, the size and the internal organization of an SME, the  Human Recourses activities might pertain additional procedures, process more or less personal data or for  different purposes. The most common processing operations that we consider in this report are: a) Payroll  management, b) Leave - absence management, c) Recruitment and d) Evaluation of staff. Other operations  could include Health data of staff (e.g. annual medical check-ups required by the employer, trainings of  staff, etc.  Payroll management  Within the scope of this use case, we consider as an example a retail SME that processes personal data of  its employees for salaries, benefits and social security. The personal data considered to be processed are:  contact information (such as last and first name, address, telephone numbers,) social insurance number,  taxation Identifier, date of employment, position and salary information.  The processing operation is  facilitated by the HR IT system, which is deployed within the premises of the SME, and the HR officer  operates it. There is a specific use policy in place. However, there are no specific policies regarding data  retention and destruction. Processing of personal data is limited to the premises of the company. Towards  the end of each month, the HR officer submits to the financial Institutions and the social security institute  statements for all employees. Although the HR officer has signed a confidentiality disclaimer, no security or  data protection training has recently been performed for the SME’s employees.  3.1.1 Definition of the processing operation and its context  The specific data processing operation can be detailed, as follows:  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  EMPLOYEES PAYROLL MANAGEMENT  Personal Data Processed  Contact information (last and first name, address, telephone number,) social security  number, taxation Identifier, date of employment, salary information  Processing Purpose Payroll management (payment of salaries, benefits and social security contributions)  Data Subject Employees  Processing Means Human Resources IT System  Recipients of the Data  External Financial Institutions  External Social Insurance Schemes  Data Processor Used In-house (no data processor)  3.1.2 Evaluating Impact  Following the approach presented in section 2.1.2, the following analysis can be made:  Loss of confidentiality  Within the scope of the employees’ payroll management processing operation, as described above, the  impact from loss of confidentiality is mainly related to potential unintended disclosure of income (and  other relevant data) to third parties. This could expose the data subject to consequences ranging from the  discomfort arising from the public knowledge of one’s own private data to even, in specific cases, the  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  19  potential risk of targeted attacks from thefts or money seekers. This might be more than a simple  annoyance, and the impact from loss of confidentiality could, thus, be set to MEDIUM.  Loss of integrity and availability  The loss of integrity and/or availability might be in general considered as LOW, as data subjects are  expected to face  inconvenience (e.g. need to resubmit information or unable to receive monthly payment  on time) but the problems can be quickly overcome. More serious impacts from loss of confidentiality  might be set to MEDIUM if the consequences to data subjects are more persistent over time (e.g.  repeatedly delaying payments of salaries); this is however not considered to be the general case in our  example.  The next table summarizes the aforementioned analysis.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Medium Low Low  Overall Impact Evaluation MEDIUM  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is the highest identified. Therefore, the overall impact in  this particular case is evaluated as MEDIUM.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could be  higher from the one calculated above. An example of such case could be the:   systematic processing of specific health/disability data (e.g. due to special privileges/working  arrangements, such as extra allowances for impaired or disadvantaged employees). In such case the  data controller should consider whether the impact level is set to HIGH.  3.1.3 Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is LOW, as the system is not  connected to the internet and does not allow access from internet to internal resources and other IT  systems. It is assumed for this use case that unauthorized access is prevented following relevant ICT  security best practices.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  LOW, assuming that roles and responsibilities of HR officer are clearly defined along to an acceptable  use policy, processing of personal data is limited to the premises of the organization and log files are  created for any processing activity.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  MEDIUM as HR officers have not received relevant information security training and it is not certain  that personal data are always securely processed and/or destroyed (due to lack of relevant policies –  see use case description).   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is LOW as the business  sector of the SME is in general not considered prone to cyberattacks. It is assumed that no personal  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  20  data breach is known to have occurred in the past and the processing operation is limited only to the  employees of the SME.  ASSESSMENT AREA  PROBABILITY  LEVEL SCORE  Network and Technical Resources Low 1  Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data  Low 1  Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data  Medium 2  Business sector and scale of processing  Low 1  Overall Threat Occurrence Probability Low  (5)  Following the aforementioned assessment, the overall threat occurrence probability is calculated as LOW.  3.1.4 Evaluation of Risk and Adoption of Security Measures.  Using the results from impact assessment and threat occurrence probability, the risk is calculated based on  Section 2.1.4.  THREAT OCCURRENCE  PROBABILITY  IMPACT LEVEL  Low Medium High / Very High  Low  X  Medium  High  The overall risk for this particular case is generally considered as MEDIUM. Annex A: (A.1 and A.2) can be  used for the adoption of measures appropriate to the risk presented.  Note should be taken that the risk might be different (higher) under special conditions directly related to  the specific data processing operation and affecting either the impact or the threat occurrence  probability (see also relevant considerations under section 3.1.2).  Recruitment  Within the scope of this use case, we consider again the retail SME described in section 3.1. Staff  recruitment is a process run by HR and consists of numerous organizational activities aimed at the  selection of people who have specific skills or are capable of performing certain tasks. After the vacancy  notice has been published, candidates are invited to submit their application electronically alongside a  detailed curriculum, with the academic education and qualifications, working experience, further  professional or academic training, family status, and personal details such as first and last name, address,  telephone numbers, date of birth. The selection committee reviews and evaluates the applications and  comes up with a list of candidates to be invited for an interview. During the interview, the selection  committee members take notes on the performance of the candidate and at the end they draft a detailed  report which is submitted to senior management. Processing is facilitated by an IT system which supports  the submission of applications, the shortlisting of candidates and the interview reports and is operated by  an HR officer.  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  21  3.2.1 Definition of the processing operation and its context  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  RECRUITMENT  Personal Data Processed  Academic education and qualifications, working experience, further professional or  academic training , family status, first and last name, address, telephone numbers,  date of birth, interview notes/report  Processing Purpose Managing candidate selection for recruitment  Data Subject Recruitment Candidates  Processing Means Recruitment IT platform  Recipients of the Data Internal Senior Management  Data Processor Used In-house (no data processor)  3.2.2 Evaluating Impact  Following the approach presented in section 2.1.2, the following analysis can be made:  Loss of confidentiality  Within the scope of the employees’ recruitment operation, as described above, the loss of confidentiality  could allow disclosure of data of the candidates, potentially leading to embarrassment or defamation. This  is mainly related to the evaluation results, that may provide an assessment of the candidate’s professional  experience and capacity, as well as other personal qualities (e.g. ability to communicate well or express  himself/herself clearly). For the purpose of this use case, we assume that the recruitment platform  provides for a structured assessment of the candidates, based on specific professional criteria, and does  not include other types of assessments of the personality or characteristics of the candidate (e.g.  psychological profile). Following the aforementioned description, the data subject is expected to  encounter from minor to serious inconvenience from loss of confidentiality, which could in some cases  influence her ability of getting employed. Therefore, the impact level for this case could in general be  considered as MEDIUM.  Loss of integrity  The level of impact resulting from loss of integrity is considered to be MEDIUM as unauthorized alteration  of personal data processed could either hinder the successful accomplishment of the recruitment  procedure or amend the eligibility/ interview report of a candidate (and, thus, her possibility of getting  employed).  Loss of availability  The level of impact resulting from loss of integrity is considered to be LOW as data subjects are expected  to encounter minor inconvenience, due to the delay of the process, which will not be invalidated though.  The next table summarizes the aforementioned analysis.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Medium Medium Low  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  22  Overall Impact Evaluation MEDIUM  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is the highest identified and therefore the overall impact  evaluated is MEDIUM.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could be  higher from the one calculated above. For example, such could be the case of an evaluation process  including psychological tests or specific behavioural characteristics of the candidates. Another case could  be if personal data related to disabilities, ethnic background etc. are also processed.  3.2.3  Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions, presented in Section 2.1.3, we the following assessment was made for each  dimension of the processing operations’ environment:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is LOW as the processing is not  performed through the Internet and the evaluation platform is a dedicated system, which is not  connected to other IT systems of the SME. Like in previous cases, it is assumed that best practices are  deployed to prevent unauthorized access and accordingly safeguard the data.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  LOW, assuming that roles and responsibilities of employees involved are clearly defined along to an  acceptable use policy, processing of personal data is limited to the premises of the organization and  log files are created for any processing activity.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  MEDIUM as it includes a large number of employees involved in the processing (HR officers, selection  committee, senior management) and it is assumed that not all employees involved in the processing  have received relevant information security training.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is LOW as the business  sector of the SME is in general not considered prone to cyberattacks and no personal data breach is  known to have occurred in the past. The processing operation is limited only to the employees of the  SME.  ASSESSMENT AREA  PROBABILITY  LEVEL SCORE  Network and Technical Resources Low 1  Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data  Low 1  Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data  Medium 2  Business sector and scale of processing  Low 1  Overall Threat Occurrence Probability Low  (5)  Following the aforementioned assessment, the overall threat occurrence probability is calculated as LOW.  3.2.4 Evaluation of Risk  Using the results from impact assessment and threat occurrence probability, the risk is calculated based on  Section 2.1.4.  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  23  THREAT OCCURRENCE  PROBABILITY  IMPACT LEVEL  Low Medium High / Very High  Low  X  Medium  High  In particular, the overall risk for this particular case is generally considered as MEDIUM. Annex A: (A.1 &  A.2) can be used for the adoption of measures appropriate to the risk presented.  Note should be taken that the risk might be different (higher) under conditions directly related to the  specific data processing operation and affecting either the impact or the threat occurrence probability.  For example, if the candidates have access to their evaluation reports directly through the recruitment IT  platform, the threat occurrence probability would probably be increased to HIGH. See also relevant  considerations under section 3.3.2 for impact evaluation.  Evaluation of employees  Within the scope of this use case, we consider as an example an SME specializing in IT products and  relevant consultancy services. On a yearly basis, each employee is evaluated by the line manager against  predefined and pre-agreed criteria related to his/her performance and professional characteristics, which  include reliability, orientation towards users/customers, timeliness/readiness, interpersonal skills,  flexibility, autonomy, written and oral communication skills and team spirit. The processing is performed  by an HR officer and line managers with electronic tools and paper documentation. The line manager  produces a first version of the report on paper and discusses the findings with the employee. The final  version of the report is duly signed and submitted electronically to the HR department while the summary  and the conclusions/findings of the report are submitted electronically as well.  3.3.1 Definition of the processing operation and its context  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  EVALUATION OF STAFF  Personal Data Processed  First and last name, position within the SME, date of employment, employment  history, technical skills, knowledge and behaviours (work performance evaluation  reports)  Processing Purpose  Assessment of the performance and professional characteristics that arise in the  execution of the work  Data Subject Employees  Processing Means Human Resources IT System  Recipients of the Data Internal Line Managers  Data Processor Used In-house (no data processor)  3.3.2 Evaluating Impact  Following the approach presented in section 2.1.2, the following analysis can be made:  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  24  Loss of confidentiality  Within the scope of this processing operation, it should be taken into account that the staff assessment  provides a detailed professional profile of the employee by attributing quantitative and qualitative values  to her performance at work. Although evaluation may be limited to work performance, in the course of the  exercise, other individual's characteristics may emerge, creating a marginal risk that information relating to  the behavior and personality of the employees is also processed. The loss of confidentiality of this data  could range from simple discomfort to dishonor or even limitation of the employee, e.g. when seeking for  a new job. Therefore, the impact of loss of confidentiality is considered as MEDIUM.  Loss of integrity  The loss of integrity might be in general considered as MEDIUM as data subjects are expected to encounter  significant inconveniences including improper evaluation or lack or delays in benefitting from the results of  the evaluation.  Loss of availability  The loss of availability might be in general considered as LOW as data subjects are expected to encounter  minor inconveniences due to the delay of the process, which will not be invalidated though. The next table  summarizes the aforementioned analysis.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Medium Medium Low  Overall Impact Evaluation MEDIUM  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is the highest identified and therefore the overall impact  evaluated is MEDIUM.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could be  higher from the one calculated above. An example of such case could be when the:   Specific working context requires an assessment of the psychological characteristics of the  employees or when sensitive data are included in the course of the evaluation process (e.g.  relating to persons with disabilities).  3.3.3  Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is LOW, as the system is not  connected to the internet and does not allow access from internet to internal resources and other IT  systems. It is assumed for this use case that unauthorized access is prevented based on relevant best  practices.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  MEDIUM, assuming that the use policy is not clearly defined  and processing of information is not  necessarily limited to the premises of the organization (paper based process).  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  25   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  MEDIUM as it is assumed (from the case description) that there no specific policies regarding secure  storage and deletion of data (especially when part of the process is paper based).   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is LOW as the business  sector of the SME is in general not considered prone to cyberattacks and it is assumed that no personal  data breach is known to have occurred in the past. The processing operation is limited only to the  employees of the SME.  ASSESSMENT AREA  PROBABILITY  LEVEL SCORE  Network and Technical Resources Low 1  Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data  Medium 2  Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data  Medium 2  Business sector and scale of processing  Low 1  Overall Threat Occurrence Probability Medium  (6)  Following the aforementioned assessment, the overall threat occurrence probability is calculated as  MEDIUM.  3.3.4 Evaluation of Risk  Using the results from impact assessment and threat occurrence probability, the risk is calculated based on  Section 2.1.4.  THREAT OCCURRENCE  PROBABILITY  IMPACT LEVEL  Low Medium High / Very High  Low  Medium  X  High  In particular, the overall risk for this particular case is generally considered as MEDIUM. Annex A: (A.1 &  A.2) can be used for the adoption of measures appropriate to the risk presented.  Note should be taken that the risk might be different (higher) under conditions directly related to the  specific data processing operation and affecting either the impact or the threat occurrence probability  (see also relevant considerations under section 3.3.2).  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  26  4. Use cases: Customers management, marketing and suppliers  A typical SME will process personal data of its customers and perform marketing activities so as to attract  new customers. It may also process personal data in relation to its suppliers. Depending on the nature of  business activities, the nature and amount of products and services portfolio, as well as the target market,  the activities may differentiate and include processing of different types of personal data in a different  scale or/and for different purposes.  Order and delivery of goods  Within the scope of this use case, we consider a retail SME that offers goods through a dedicated e-shop.  Customers can browse through the available goods, add them to the cart and check out. In order to  complete the order, the customer has to register at the e-shop platform (if not already registered) and  provide her contact details (first and last name, delivery address, telephone number and email address).  During the checkout process, registered users are also asked to provide payment details in a separate  form, which is provided by the payment services provider. Following the successful placement of the order  and the confirmation from the payment service provider, the details of the order are transmitted to the  Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, to the Customer Relation Management (CRM) system and to  the delivery services provider. Regarding the use of the system there is a specific use policy in place and  best practises are implemented and maintained. However, there are no specific policies regarding data  retention and destruction and not all employees involved has received relevant information security  training.  4.1.1 Definition of the processing operation and its context  The specific data processing operation can be detailed, as follows:  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  ORDER AND DELIVERY OF GOODS  Personal Data Processed  Contact information (last and first name, address, telephone number) payment data  (credit card, bank account information)  Processing Purpose Order and delivery of goods  Data Subject Customers  Processing Means Order Management system  Recipients of the Data  External Payment services provider  External Delivery services provider  Internal Customer Relation Management (CRM) system  Internal Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system  Data Processor Used In-house and external parties  4.1.2 Evaluating Impact  Loss of confidentiality and integrity  Within the scope of the specific processing operation, as described earlier, the impact from loss of  confidentiality and/or integrity is considered as MEDIUM, as unauthorized disclosure and/or alteration of  personal data processed, including financial data, could result in significant inconveniences for the data  subject (which can be recovered with some effort).  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  27  Loss of availability  The level of impact resulting from loss of availability is considered to be LOW, as unavailability of the  personal data processed is expected to result only to minor inconveniences for the data subject which can  easily be overcome, e.g. delay of the delivery of goods.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Medium Medium Low  Overall Impact Evaluation MEDIUM  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is therefore MEDIUM.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases in which the overall impact could  be different (higher) from the one calculated above. An example could be the case when goods available  for order can reveal sensitive data about the individual, e.g. relating to her health, sexual or political and  religious preferences.  4.1.3 Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is MEDIUM, as part of the  processing of personal data is performed through the internet and the processing system is  interconnected to another internal and external IT systems. It is assumed for this use case that  unauthorized access to personal data is prevented based on relevant best practices.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  LOW, as it assumed that roles and responsibilities of employees are clearly defined in line with an  acceptable use policy, the processing of personal data is limited to the premises of the organization  and log files are created for any processing activity being performed.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  MEDIUM as not all employees have received relevant information security training and it is not  ensured that personal data are always securely processed and/or destroyed.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is MEDIUM as the business  sector of the as the business sector of the SME (e-shop) can be considered in general as prone to  cyberattacks and the processing operation does concern a large number of individuals. However, it is  assumed for the particular case that a personal data breach has very occurred in the past.

THREAT OCCURRENCE  PROBABILITY  IMPACT LEVEL  Low Medium High / Very High  Low  Medium  X  High  In particular, the overall risk for this particular case is generally considered as MEDIUM. Annex A (A.1 &  A.2) can be used for the adoption of measures appropriate to the risk presented.  Note should be taken that the risk might be different (higher) under conditions directly related to the  specific data processing operation and affecting either the impact or the threat occurrence probability  (see also relevant considerations under section 4.1.2).  Marketing/advertising  Within the scope of this use case, we consider the retail SME described in section 4.1, which processes  personal data of potential customers in order to promote the different kinds of goods available within its  portfolio. For such processing to take place it is assumed that data subjects have already provided their  consent via paper or electronic form (we do not make any legal analysis in the context of the use case).  For this processing operation, the SME makes use of a dedicated web tool, offered by a third party  provider who specializes in such activities. The third party provider is EU based and adheres to relevant  security best practices. Each month, an officer from the marketing department, inserts to the web tool,  through an appropriate web interface the contact information (first and last name, email address) of  potential customers and updates the list with any potential customers that have requested not to be  included in the list. Every week, the officer initiates a new marketing campaign through the web tool,  which then sends respective personalized emails, to the lastly updated recipients list. For each campaign,  the tool provides a report with statistics on the percentage of emails read, unread, deleted without  however providing information on specific individuals.  4.2.1 Definition of the processing operation and its context  The specific data processing operation can be detailed, as follows :  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  MARKETING/ADVERTISING  Personal Data Processed Contact info (e.g name, postal address, telephone number, email)  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  29  Processing Purpose Promotion of goods and special offers to possible customers  Data Subject Customers and potential Customers  Processing Means Third party marketing campaign web service  Recipients of the Data  External Third party marketing campaign web service provider  Internal Marketing Department  Internal CRM IT system  Data Processor Used Third party marketing campaign web service provider  4.2.2 Evaluating Impact  Loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability  Within the scope of the specific operation, the impact from loss of confidentiality, and/or integrity and/or  availability is considered to be LOW, as individuals may encounter some minor inconvenience, e.g. by  unauthorized disclosure of their contact info (which could lead to spam) or unauthorized modification of  their data, excluding them from a potential marketing campaign. In all cases the issue can be easily  resolved with some small effort.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Low Low Low  Overall Impact Evaluation LOW  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is therefore LOW.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could be  different (higher) from the one calculated above. An example could be a case where the inclusion of the  individual in a marketing campaign may reveal sensitive information, e.g. related to her racial or ethnic  origin, political opinions or health status.  Another example could be if the processing operation included processing of personal data in order to  cultivate a better understanding of customers and potential customers’ habits, preferences and eventually  orient appropriately their marketing strategies. This type of processing would then be characterized as  ‘profiling’ and data related to data subject’s possible preferences and interests (acquired through the  profiling process). Within the scope of this specific processing operation, the impact from loss of  confidentiality would then be considered as MEDIUM, as individuals may encounter in certain cases  significant problems by having their preferences, shopping habits, interests being accessed by third parties  in an unknown way. It could be raised to HIGH, e.g. in case that this profiling is based on sensitive data.  4.2.3 Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is MEDIUM, as the processing of  personal data is performed through the internet and the processing system is interconnected to other  internal and external IT systems.  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  30   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  LOW, as it is assumed that processes are well defined and the specialised third party adheres to  security best practices in the field.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  MEDIUM as part of the data processing operation is performed by a data processor (third party) and,  thus, the SME is not in full control of the data. Still, it is assumed that the specialised third adheres to  security best practices in the field.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is MEDIUM as the business  sector of the SME (e-shop) is in general prone to cyberattacks and the processing operation does  concern a large number of individuals. However, it is assumed that a personal data breach has never  occurred in the past.

Suppliers of services and goods  Within the scope of this use case, we consider the retail SME described in 4.1, which acquires services and  goods needed for both day to day operation and also for sale of goods. These procedures may include in  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  31  certain cases processing of personal data, for instance, contact data of specific employees working for the  suppliers or contact and financial data of persons that are in direct contract with the SME (i.e. directly  acting as suppliers of goods or services).  The processing operation is supported by an IT system connected to the Enterprise Resource Planning  (ERP) system and the Accounting System. The processed personal data include company name and contact  details, financial data (tax number, banking account), employee pictures and access credentials (for staff  working within premises).  All business relationships between SMEs and suppliers take place using CRM via extranet, directly to the  platforms of the suppliers. Payments are made using remote banking services. There is an off-line platform  where delivery bills and invoices are loaded overnight in batches. Administrative communications with  suppliers take place through ordinary email service.  4.3.1 Definition of the processing operation and its context  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  PROCUREMENT (SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIALS, GOODS AND SERVICES)  Personal Data Processed  First and last name, contact Information, tax and banking information (for supplier),  picture and access credentials (for staff working on premises).

Further to the assumptions made in this use case, there might be cases where the overall impact could be  different (higher) from the one calculated above. An example of such case could be when the company  operates in a ‘sensitive’ environment and, thus, the disclosure of employees’ names might put them at risk  (e.g. in a military environment).  4.3.3  Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is MEDIUM, as the system is  connected to the internet and it is possible to provide access to the internal personal data processing  system through the internet. However, best practices are used to prevent unauthorized access.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  LOW, as it is assumed that roles and responsibilities of personnel are clearly defined along to an  acceptable use policy, employees are not allowed to bring their own devices and store, transfer or  ortherwise process personal data outside the premises of the organization and log files are created for  any processing activity being performed.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: Threat occurrence probability for is LOW  as employees are not able to transfer, store or otherwise process personal data outside the premises  of the organization while the acceptable use of the network, system and physical resources within the  organization is clearly defined and employees involved in the data processing operation securely store  and destroy personal data.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is LOW as the business  sector of the SME is in general not considered prone to cyberattacks, a security breach incident or a  complaint has not been received during the last two years and the processing operation does not  concern a large number of individuals.

Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  34  5. Safety and security  Access control  Within the scope of this use case, we consider as an example a consulting company (SME) that processes  the personal data of its employees and visitors for physical access control within its premises, in order to  ensure that only the authorized individuals have access into and out of specific areas.  The deployed access control system comprises of RFID card readers installed in predefined points, RFID  cards and the access control management platform. Each employee, upon taking up his or her duties, is  registered to the access control management platform and is assigned a unique alphanumeric value which  is stored in an RFID card. The personal data used during the registration include first and last name, date of  employment, position within the organization, end of employment (if specified by the contract) and a  profile picture. Each employee’s RFID card is personalized as the name of the employee and his/her profile  picture are printed on the card. For each type of position within the organization (administration,  manager, secretariat support etc.) specific access rights are predefined. Each time an employee swipes her  card against a reader, the platform checks the rights and grants access to the premise accordingly. Each  attempt is logged within the platform and in case of an unauthorized access attempt, the security officer is  notified. Visitors are also issued respective anonymized visitor RFID cards which are preset to allow access  only to meeting rooms. Upon arrival of a visitor, the security officer registers within the platform the first  and last name of the visitor, the accompanying employee’s first and last name and the expected duration  of the visit and assigns temporarily a RFID card to the visitor. Upon departure or expiry of the duration of  visit, the card is invalidated and is returned to the security officer. Security officers operating the platform  have received special training on the functions of the platform and their obligations and it is assumed that  best practices are followed.  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  ACCESS CONTROL  Personal Data Processed  For employees: first and last name, date of employment, position within the  organization, end of employment, a profile picture.

For example, employees might not  be able to access specific premises of the SME and perform their task (integrity or availability loss) or a  visitor’s presence in the SME premises might be disclosed (confidentiality loss).  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  35  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Low Low Low  Overall Impact Evaluation LOW  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is therefore LOW.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could be  different (higher) from the one calculated above. An example of such case is when the visit to the SME’s  premises may reveal specific sensitive information, e.g. with regard to health, religious beliefs, political or  sexual preferences.  5.1.2  Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is LOW, as the system is not  connected to the internet, it does not allow access from internet to internal resources and connection  to other IT systems and it is assumed that best practices are used to prevent unauthorized access to  the system.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  LOW, as it is assumed that roles and responsibilities of security officer are clearly defined along to an  acceptable use policy and log files are created for any processing activity being performed.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is LOW  as the security officer is not able to transfer, store or otherwise process personal data outside the  premises of the organization while the acceptable use of the network, system and physical resources  within the SME is clearly defined.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is LOW as the business  sector of the SME is not in general considered prone to cyberattacks, a personal data breach has not  occurred in the past and the processing operation does not concern a large number of individuals.

Annex A (A.1) can be  used for the adoption of measures appropriate to the risk presented.  Note should be taken that the risk might be different (Medium or even High) under conditions directly  related to the specific data processing operation and affecting either the impact or the threat occurrence  probability (see also relevant considerations under section 5.1.2). For example, the threat occurrence  probability might be higher in case where the SME operates in a ‘sensitive’ environment, e.g. a health  data laboratory (thus, increasing the possibilities of malicious attempts to gain unauthorised access to  premises).  Moreover, account should be taken in general to the fact that access control is an integral measure for  preventing unauthorised access to one’s premises and, thus, directly linked to security and safety of  persons and goods. Therefore, depending again on the nature of the organisation, the SME might  consider increasing the overall risk to MEDIUM or even HIGH.  Closed Circuit Television System (CCTV)  Within the scope of this use case, we consider the SME described in section 5.1, which also processes  personal data by means of CCTV (images and video with no sound), in order to enhance the security and  safety of people and goods in their premises. It should be noted that the use case does not aim at making  any legal analysis or on the use of CCTV; we, therefore, assume that the processing is GDPR compliant and  that the guidance of the Data Protection Authority (DPA) has been taken into account. Still, we note that in  all cases special attention should be paid to the legal basis of CCTV operation, which should be in  compliance with both data protection and labour legal and normative requirements and obligations.  The CCTV system in our example comprises of the camera, and the CCTV management IT system which  records the feed, displays it to the security officers and logs any activity on processing non –real time  feeds. The feed is stored for the time indicated by the DPA and is then automatically deleted securely,  unless the operator extracts it manually for cases which require further examination (for example a  security alarm during non-working hours, etc.) Security officers operating the platform have received  special training on the functions of the platform and their obligations and it is assumed that best practises  are used to avoid authorized access to the feed.  Special attention should be paid to the legal basis of the installation and operation of the CCTV  system, which should be in compliance to both data protection and labour legal and normative  requirements and obligations.  5.2.1 Definition of the processing operation and its context  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  37  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  CCTV  Personal Data Processed Image and video of persons (employees, visitors).

Loss of integrity and availability  The loss of integrity is rather hard to achieve (from a technical point of view) in this particular case, as it  would require manipulation of the video images. Loss of availability relates to the unavailability (full or  temporal) of video footage. In both cases, the impact is considered LOW and it could even be stated that  there is no impact for the individuals at all (as loss of CCTV footage is a problem for the SME, but not for  the individuals who are being recorded).  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Low Low Low  Overall Impact Evaluation LOW  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is therefore LOW.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could be  different (higher) from the one calculated above. An example of such case is when the visit to the SME’s  premises could reveal or infer sensitive information, e.g. related to health status, religious beliefs, political  or sexual preferences.  5.2.3  Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is LOW, as the system is assumed to  not be connected to the internet and best practices are used to prevent unauthorized access.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  LOW, as roles and responsibilities of security officers are clearly defined along to an acceptable use  policy and log files are created for any processing activity being performed  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  38   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is LOW  as employees are not able to transfer, store or otherwise process CCTV data outside the premises of  the organization while the acceptable use of the network, system and physical resources within the  organization is clearly defined.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is LOW as the business  sector of the SME is not in general considered as prone to cyberattacks and, a personal data breach  has not occurred in the past.

For example, the threat occurrence  probability might be higher in case where the SME uses advanced CCTV systems, which allow zooming  and video recording (note that in such cases the overall legality of the data processing operation should  be carefully analysed).  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  39  6. Specific use case: Health sector  Health Services Provision  Within the scope of this use case, we consider an SME in the health care domain (small clinic) which  processes personal data in order to provide healthcare services. For each patient visiting the clinic to  perform an examination or a consultation visit, an electronic record is created (or updated) and includes  patients’ contact details, social insurance number, medical exams’ results, pathologies, allergies, diagnosis  and cure schemas (medical information). Through this record, treating doctors and nurses have an  overview of the history and the status of the patients’ health and can access it if needed from pre-defined  terminals within the clinic premises. Prior to the medical examination or consultation visit, the eligibility of  the patient to receive such examination or treatment without covering its cost is validated against the  public health system records. If the patient or exanimation is not eligible, the cost is communicated to the  accounting IT system which issues the respective invoice. After each examination or consultation visit,  patient records are updated with the latest data by the treating doctor or nurse either by scanning paper  based documents or inserting manually diagnosis and cure schemas.  The IT platform supporting this processing operation, is hosted within the premises of the SME and it is not  accessible through the Internet. For the purpose of the use case, it is assumed that best practises are used  to prevent unauthorized access to the platform and that periodical security awareness raising trainings are  being organized. Still, access rights to the patients’ medical records are not explicitly defined at a granular  level, as nurses and doctors need to be able to access the files at any time and the system does not  support relevant granularity. The SME plans to have a more dedicated patient record system within the  next years.  6.1.1 Definition of the processing operation and its context  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  HEALTH SERVICES PROVISION  Personal Data Processed  Contact Information (last and first name, address, telephone number,) social insurance  number, medical examination results, pathologies, allergies, diagnosis and cure  schemas (medical information), administrative and financial information (invoices,  hospitalisation papers, etc.).

Equally important (HIGH) may be the loss of integrity, as wrong medical  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  40  information might even put an individual’s life at risk.  The same (HIGH) could be argued also for the loss of  availability, as even a temporal unavailability of the clinic’s IT system might hinder its operations, thus  putting patients at serious risk.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  High High High  Overall Impact Evaluation HIGH  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is therefore HIGH.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could  even be considered as VERY HIGH, for example in cases of vulnerable categories of data subjects or minors.  6.1.3  Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is MEDIUM, as the system is  interconnected to other external and internal systems. However, the data cannot be accessed via the  Internet and, according to the use case description, security best practices have been applied to  prevent unauthorized access to the system.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  LOW, as roles and responsibilities of personnel are clearly defined along to an acceptable use policy,  the processing of data is limited in the premises of the SME and log files are created for any processing  activity being performed.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is HIGH  as processing of personal data is performed by an undefined number of employees and there is no  clear policy regarding granular access to the health records. However, the obligations of all parties  involved in the processing are clearly defined and awareness raising seminars are organized  periodically.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is HIGH as the business  sector of the SME (healthcare) is in generally considered prone to cyberattacks and the processing  operation does concern a large number of individuals. However, it is assumed that as personal data  breach has not occurred in the past.

Annex A (A.1 & A.2 &  A.3) can be used for the adoption of measures appropriate to the risk presented.  Medically Assisted Procreation  Within the scope of this use case, we consider an SME in the health care domain specializing in Medically  Assisted Procreation (MAP) that processes personal data for management and tracking of biological  samples stored within its premises. MAP includes different methods or techniques based on the  manipulation of reproductive cells that will allow infertile couples to conceive a child. MAP procedures also  include cryopreservation techniques for gametes (oocytes and spermatozoa) and embryos.  The IT system deployed internally to support MAP holds records for each sample that include: information  of the donor (first and last name, address, telephone number, date of birth), social insurance number,  health data, genetic sample data and genetic sample identifier. Through the platform, the operator can  perform the following functions: a) sample management,  traceability of all sample manifestations, sample  position management within cryogenic containers, and b) access management and registration of  cryopreserved samples.  Regarding the use of the IT system, a specific use policy is in place alongside specific policies regarding data  retention and destruction. Processing of personal data is limited to the premises of the SME. Access to the  platform is allowed only to specific employees of the SME, acting as the operators, and to the doctor and  biologist employees responsible for performing MAP. All platform users have been clearly informed about  their obligations regarding personal data processing and awareness-raising training is organized  periodically.  The platform is not connected to the internet and it is assumed that best practises are used  to prevent unauthorised access.  6.2.1 Definition of the processing operation and its context  The specific data processing operation can be detailed, as follows:  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES FOR MEDICALLY ASSISTED PROCREATION  Personal Data Processed  Information of the donor (first and last name, address, telephone number, date of  birth), social insurance number, health data, genetic sample data and genetic sample  identifier  Processing Purpose Management of genetic sampled for Medically Assisted Procreation (MAP)  Data Subject Donors  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  42  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES FOR MEDICALLY ASSISTED PROCREATION  Processing Means Medically Assisted Procreation Management IT system  Recipients of the Data Internal  Data Processor Used In-house (no data processor)  6.2.2 Evaluating Impact  Following the approach presented in section 2.1.2, the following analysis can be made:  Loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability  Within the scope of the specific processing operation the impact from loss of confidentiality is considered  HIGH, as data subjects are expected to encounter significant adverse effects from unauthorised disclosure  of health and genetic data. The impact from loss of integrity or availability is equally important (HIGH), as  data subjects are expected to encounter significant or even irreversible inconvenience from unauthorised  alteration or loss of health and genetic data, which could even prevent them from undergoing a MAP  procedure.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  High High High  Overall Impact Evaluation HIGH  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is the highest identified and therefore the overall impact  evaluated is HIGH  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could be  even be considered as VERY HIGH, for example, in cases of vulnerable categories of data subjects (e.g. data  subjects with specific diseases or handicaps)  6.2.3  Threat Occurrence Probability   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is LOW, as the system is not  connected to the internet, it is not possible to provide access to the internal personal data processing  system through the internet and best practices are used to prevent unauthorized access.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  LOW, as roles and responsibilities of personnel are clearly defined along to an acceptable use policy,  the processing is limited to the premises of the SME and log files are created for any processing activity  being performed.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is LOW  as processing of personal data is performed by a defined number of employees with clearly defined  obligations and it is assumed that employees involved in the data processing operation securely store  and destroy personal data.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is HIGH as the business  sector of the SME could be considered as prone to cyberattacks and could potentially concern a large  number of individuals. However, it is assumed that no personal data breach is known to have occurred  in the past.

Remote monitoring of patients with chronic diseases  Within the scope of this use case, we consider an SME in the health care domain specializing in providing  homecare remote monitoring services for patients who have been diagnosed with a chronic condition.  Each patient is provided with a monitoring device, which allows real time tracking of vital signs and  transmission of information such as blood pressure, glucose level, pulse and ECG rhythm in set intervals  diagnoses to the affiliated healthcare centre. The monitoring device also acts as a communication device,  enabling patients to respond to personalized clinician-directed surveys related to the compliance level of  treatment schemas.  The remote monitoring device is supported by a web-based platform, hosted by a cloud provider within  the EU, which collects and correlates all data transmitted in order to detect any deviations from the clinical  protocol and determine the overall health status of the patient. Should a deviation from acceptable values  and procedures is detected, a medical practitioner communicates through phone with the patient to  determine whether an in house visit is required.  The personal data involved in the processing operation include patients’ personal information, such as first  and last name, address, telephone numbers, date of birth, alongside social insurance number, health  status data, diagnosis results, treatment schemas, vital signs readings and relevant statistics. The web  platform is operated by authorized medical practitioners with clearly defined roles, responsibilities and  obligations related to personal data processing.

The loss of integrity is equally important (HIGH), as data subjects are expected to  encounter significant or even irreversible inconvenience from unauthorised alteration of health data  (signals and statistics), which could even make it difficult for them to receive appropriate treatment. The  loss of availability is also HIGH, as it could again hinder the timely and accurate treatment of the data  subjects, which could even put their lives at risk.

Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could  even be considered as VERY HIGH, for example, when the processing relates to minors.  6.3.3  Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is HIGH, as the system is connected  to the internet and it is possible to provide access to the internal personal data processing system  through the internet. Moreover, different tools and systems are interconnected and many different  systems need to be equally secured.  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  45   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  MEDIUM, as roles and responsibilities are complex in this scenario, due to many different actors and  systems involved.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is HIGH  as a data processor is used, which is based on the cloud. Still, the processing is performed by a pre- defined number of employees and it is assumed that they receive periodic awareness raising trainings.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is HIGH as the business  sector of the SME could be considered as prone to cyberattacks and could potentially concern a large  number of individuals.

Specific use case: Education sector  Early childhood – Crèche  Within the scope of this use case, we consider an early childhood school which uses a web platform to  support communication of day to day physical, intellectual, language, emotional and social activities of  minors between the school and the parents. In addition, the platform may also include information on the  childrens’ health, appetite and disposition (provided by the parents). Parents are also able to communicate  with the educator and seek advice and support on how to nurture and better support the cognitive and  social-emotional development of their infant.  The platform is hosted at an EU based hosting provider and operated by the educators. Each educator  manages and updates information about the children assigned to his or her classroom, while the overall  administration of the platform is performed by the secretariat of the school. Parents are registered to the  platform by the secretariat and can only access and update the data of their child. It is assumed that best  practices are being used to prevent unauthorized access, roles and responsibilities of employees involved  are clearly defined and communicated, and log files are created for all data processing activities.  The  platform processes the following data: first and last name, date of birth, home address, daily information  on the child’s performance (including eating, activities, etc.), health data, allergies, nutrition intolerances,  parent(s) first and last name, parent(s) telephone number, emergency contact number.  7.1.1 Definition of the processing operation and its context  PROCESSING OPERATION  DESCRIPTION  EARLY CHILDHOOD SCHOOL COMMUNICATION PLATFORM  Personal Data Processed  First and last name, date of birth, home address, daily information on the child’s  performance (including eating, activities, etc.), health data, allergies, nutrition  intolerances, parent(s) first and last name, parent(s) telephone number, emergency  contact number  Processing Purpose  Provision of educational services (communication of day to day activities and child’s  development)  Data Subject Children and parents  Processing Means Web based  Recipients of the Data  External Parents  Internal Secretariat, Educators  Data Processor Used Web hosting provider  7.1.2 Evaluating Impact  Loss of confidentiality  Within the scope of the specific processing operation, the impact from loss of confidentiality is considered  as MEDIUM, as in certain cases individuals (children and parents) may encounter significant inconvenience  from the disclosure of certain data (e.g. regarding the child’s behavior or communication or eating  patterns).  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  47  Loss of integrity  The loss of integrity can also be considered as MEDIUM, as unauthorized modification of this data could  possibly hinder the appropriate provision of services by the crèche (especially with regard to allergies,  nutrition patterns and other related data).  Loss of availability  The loss of availability can be considered as LOW, since the unavailability of the data can lead to some  minor inconvenience that can be easily overcome (e.g. by entering again the data in the platform or  communicating with the parents through other means)..  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Medium Medium Low  Overall Impact Evaluation MEDIUM  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is the highest identified and therefore the overall impact  evaluated is MEDIUM.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could be  higher than the one calculated above. An example of such case is when there are particular diet plans  followed by specific children (e.g. due to religious beliefs). Another example is the case of a school  specifically dedicated to children with special conditions or disabilities.  7.1.3  Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is MEDIUM, as the system is  connected to the internet and it is possible to provide access to the internal personal data processing  system through the internet. However, best practices are used to prevent unauthorized access and it is  assumed that these are up-to-date.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  MEDIUM, as there are different parties accessing the same platform and it is not clear if roles and  responsibilities have been clearly defined. Still, there is an  acceptable use policy in place and log files  are created for any processing activity being performed.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  MEDIUM as a third party data processor is being used and employees are able to transfer, store or  otherwise process personal data outside the premises of the school. However, it is assumed that  acceptable use of the network, system and physical resources is clearly defined.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is LOW as the business  sector of the SME (education) is not in general considered as prone to cyberattacks and the processing  operation does not concern a large number of individuals. It is assumed that no personal data breach  has even occurred in the past.

Note should be taken that the risk might be different (higher) under conditions directly related to the  specific data processing operation and affecting either the impact or the threat occurrence probability  (see also relevant considerations under section 7.1.2).  University e-learning platform  Within the scope of this use case we consider a university which offers an e-learning and course  management platform hosted internally in a web server. Through the platform, professors and  administration can send announcements to students and students can retrieve their course materials,  lecture notes and slides, submit assignments, undertake assessments and tests and get evaluation results  and grades. At the beginning of each semester the University’s administration department enrols students  to modules (courses) and assigns respective privileges to both students and academic staff. It is assumed  that best practices are being used to prevent unauthorized access, roles and responsibilities of employees  involved are clearly defined and communicated, and log files are created for all data processing activities.  For evaluation results, professors submit the final scores to administration in paper, and administration  encodes them to the platform. The platform processes the following data: a) Students: first and last name,  date of birth, date of admission, selected course(s), evaluation results, grades; b) Academic Staff: first and  last name, date of birth, course(s) assigned.

Loss of integrity  The impact from loss of confidentiality is considered also as MEDIUM, since data subjects are expected to  encounter significant inconvenience from unauthorised alteration of personal data which directly influence  their performance and grades.  Loss of availability  The impact from loss of confidentiality is considered LOW, as data subjects are expected to encounter  minor inconvenience from unavailability of personal data, which can be easily overcome (assuming that  there are back-ups and information on evaluation results and grades is also stored offline).  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Medium Medium Low  Overall Impact Evaluation MEDIUM  The overall result of the evaluation of the impact is the highest identified and therefore the overall impact  evaluated is MEDIUM.  Further to the assumptions made in this example, there might be cases where the overall impact could be  different (higher) than the one calculated above. An example of such case could be the possible integration  of the platform with social network profiles, where other data are also collected about the students (e.g.  lifestyle, habits, etc.). Another example could be the possible use of the platform for statistics and  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  50  analytics. Note should be taken that in both of these cases, the overall legality of the data processing  operations should be carefully assessed.  7.2.3  Threat Occurrence Probability  Based on the questions and approach presented in Section 2.1.3, the following assessment can be made  for each dimension of the specific data processing environment of this use case:   Network & technical resources: The threat occurrence probability is MEDIUM, as the system is  connected to the internet and it is possible to provide access to the internal personal data processing  system through the internet. However, it is assumed that best practices are used to prevent  unauthorized access and that these are up-to-date.   Processes/Procedures related to the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is  MEDIUM, due to the different parties accessing the system and the fact that roles and responsibilities  need to be very clearly set. Still, it is assumed that there is a specific acceptable use policy and log files  are created for any processing activity being performed.   Parties/People involved in the processing of personal data: The threat occurrence probability is LOW  as a third party data processor is being used and. However, it is assumed that acceptable use of the  network, system and physical resources is clearly defined and employees are able to transfer, store or  otherwise process personal data outside the premises of the school.   Business sector and scale of processing: The threat occurrence probability is MEDIUM as the  processing operation does concern a large number of individuals and the business sector of the SME  (higher education - university) could potentially be prone to cyberattacks.

Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  52  8. Conclusions  Security of personal data processing is already a legal obligation for data controllers, however the  imminent General Data Protection Regulation reinforces the relevant provisions (both in substance and  context) and extends this responsibility directly also to data processors. Considering the specific  characteristics of SMEs, such as limited resources and unavailability of qualified personnel, this report  builds on top of the methodological steps of the ENISA’s 2016 guidelines for SMEs3 (on the security of  personal data processing) and provides a practical demonstration of the aforementioned steps through  specific use cases. Each use case corresponds to a specific personal data processing operation and makes  specific assumptions on the data processing environment and overall context of processing. The provided  examples focus only on security measures and do not aim at providing any legal analysis or assessment of  compliance with GDPR for the specific data processing operations.  While performing the analysis of selected use cases, a number of conclusions and relevant recommendations  were drawn and are discussed below.  Guidance Needed  Similar personal data processing operations may differ among data controllers, taking into consideration  their specificities, the means used for the processing of personal data, the categories of data subjects, the  data processors and the recipients of data. Therefore, a one-size fits all approach on the overall risk based  approach, which extends beyond the data security provisions, cannot be regarded as viable and pragmatic.  Each processing operation should be reviewed separately taking also into account the context and  environment of the processing. Therefore, instead of a priori categorizing processing operations into risk  levels, the focus should be shifted on empowering and guiding the data controllers to first comprehend  their processing operations and then evaluate the level of risk and deploy the appropriate security  measures.  Competent EU bodies, EU policy makers and regulators (e.g. Data Protection Authorities) should  develop practical and scalable guidelines that will be able to support and assist different types of data  controllers and address specific stakeholders’ communities.  Skilled DPO’s  The empowerment of data controllers can also be perceived as a matter of raising their awareness to their  processing operations and the overall GDPR provisions. In order, though, to be able to manage their  compliance in a more structured manner, rather than a sporadic remedial action, it is expected that they  will seek support and guidance.  The role of an appropriately qualified Data Protection Officer (DPO) is  central in this approach, even when the designation of a DPO is not mandatory according to GDPR Article  37. Having said that, it is important to note that the fulfilment of this role requires both a good  understanding of the data protection legal framework, as well as the modern IT technologies (and relevant  security best practices), which form the basis for most common data processing means today9.  9 See relevant guidelines on Data Protection Officers issued by Article 29 Data Protection Working Party,  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=43823  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=43823  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  53  Competent EU bodies, EU policy makers and regulators (e.g. Data Protection Authorities) should  promulgate a set of baseline professional skills and requirements that Data Protection Officers’ should  meet.  Demonstrating Compliance  As discussed earlier, the security of personal data processing should not be regarded by data controllers as  an isolated obligation under GDPR but as part of the overall compliance framework they should develop,  implement and maintain. The ENISA methodology can be useful in this regard in all cases where risk  assessment is envisaged under the Regulation (e.g. personal data breach notification). Throughout the  development of the aforementioned compliance framework, data controllers should try to extend the  documentation of their approach, beyond the level imposed by GDPR provisions. This not only ensures  that they actively and positively consider the risks of any data processing they undertake but will also step  up their efforts with regards to the accountability principle and demonstrating compliance. Furthermore,  as the risk based approach is integral part of Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), it is expected that  availability of documentation will also facilitate the undertaking, even on a voluntary basis, of the DPIA.  SMEs communities/associations and data controllers should engage in the notion of risk assessment  and relevant structured documentation as an integral part of information management systems for  personal data.  Regulators (e.g. Data Protection Authorities) should provide guidance and support training for data  controllers in this context.  Scalable Certification Schemes  The data protection certification mechanisms of GDPR (Articles 42 and 43) have the potential to play a  significant role in enabling data controllers to achieve and demonstrate the existence of appropriate  safeguards, including security measures, and therefore compliance of their processing operations with  GDPR provisions. As data controllers, and especially SMEs, are relying more and more on third party  technologies, products and services, it is important to be encouraged and motivated to assess the level of  conformity of these parties and, if possible, acquire such certifications. Given the voluntary nature of  certification mechanisms under GDPR, it is crucial that data controllers are motivated and encouraged to  adhere to certification schemes, as well as opt for data processors that are following similar practices.  EU policy makers and regulators (e.g. Data Protection Authorities) should define and promote scalable  data protection certification schemes, that meet the needs of SMEs and empower them to achieve  and demonstrate compliance.  SME communities/associations and data controllers should opt for data processors that adhere to  security best practices and relevant certification mechanisms.  Novel Risk Management Methodologies  Information security risk management and risk management of personal data security regard the  calculation of risk levels from two different standpoints: the first one focuses on the impact for the data  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  54  controller and the latter on the impact for data subjects. However, both approaches result in proposed  sets of organizational and technical measures to be implemented, maintained and reviewed by the data  controller. Regardless of the specificities described earlier, a common methodology, embracing both  aspects, could enable data controllers, specifically SMEs, to follow a systematic approach towards reaching  compliance.  The research community and competent EU bodies, in close collaboration with regulators (e.g. Data  Protection Authorities), should propose and put forward methodologies that combine security risk  management and risk management of personal data.  Communication and Awareness Raising  EU SMEs are only starting to consider the changes they should undertake and broaden the perspective of  their existing information security and business strategies in order to meet the legal requirements.  However, the extent of change(s) required, in order to integrate them into existing business processes,  cannot be foreseen. Data controllers are often reluctant and perceive such changes as a barrier rather than  an opportunity to position themselves in a newly created market, reinforcing also their customers’  confidence and trust.  SME communities and associations, in close collaboration with competent EU bodies and regulators  (e.g. Data Protection Authorities), should communicate and encourage data controllers to undertake  actions towards security and privacy compliance as a competitive advantage alongside the underlying  legal obligations.  Handbook on Security of Personal Data Processing  December 2017  55  Annex A: Organizational and Technical Measures  Under each section, measures are presented per risk level (low: green, medium: yellow, high: red). In order  to achieve scalability, it is assumed that all measures described under the low level (green) are applicable  to all levels.

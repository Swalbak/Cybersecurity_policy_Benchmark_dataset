pioneering EU policy initiatives that will already have changed the digital landscape by  the time we implement this 2022–2024 European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA)  single programming document.  A great many of these initiatives either directly or indirectly integrate cybersecurity  concerns, challenges and solutions, and they were introduced in December 2020 in the  EU’s new cybersecurity strategy. ENISA is ready and indeed very proud to contribute to  making these initiatives and their implementation a success, whether by promoting the  uptake of the EU’s first cybersecurity certification schemes, revising the network and  information security (NIS) directive and the electronic identification and trust services  (eIDAS) regulation, supporting the full implementation of the EU’s 5G Cybersecurity  Toolbox or fulfilling its roles in the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre, the  Network of National Coordination Centres and the new Joint Cyber Unit. ENISA will  use its new mandate, the expanded tasks and the fresh resources given to it by the  2019 Cybersecurity Act to make sure that it remains a key and reliable player and  partner within the EU’s cybersecurity ecosystem, able to tackle the ever-moving target  of cybersecurity. Furthermore, it will make sure that the need for future resources is  understood and that resources remain tailored to the EU’s cybersecurity prerogatives.  In the second year of my tenure, I have been inspired in my work by the motivation  and drive of the EU cybersecurity community – from my ENISA colleagues in their daily  work to the political leaders and the European stakeholder community across the  EU and in the national institutions in their united vision and support. There is a real  common determination and a ‘let’s do it’ approach to making Europe more cybersecure.  We will need to maintain that momentum to tackle the ever-growing sophistication  of cyberattackers and cyber challenges. Only in this way will we be able to establish  European technological autonomy in the area of cybersecurity.  I am particularly proud that we – the Agency’s staff and Management Board together  – have laid solid foundations to make ENISA more agile, more connected and more  performance-orientated, and this is reflected in the new organisational structure  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 9  of ENISA, operational since 1 January 2021, and in the way we work. This has been  enshrined in the 2020 ENISA strategy A Trusted and Cyber Secure Europe. And the  effects are showing: we are increasingly able to attract cybersecurity talent from all  over the EU to help us make a difference. In addition, with the generous support of  our Greek host authorities, we have moved to larger premises in Athens, and we are  expanding our networks throughout the EU, specifically through the imminent opening  of a local office in Brussels.  The full positive effects of these investments will be truly felt only once we have overcome  the current pandemic, but I am convinced that we will come out of this stronger, more  united and better prepared to embark on the European digital decade project.  Juhan Lepassaar Executive Director  1010  The mission of the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) is to achieve a high common  level of cybersecurity across the Union in cooperation  with the wider community. It does this through acting  as a centre of expertise on cybersecurity, collecting  and providing independent, high quality technical  advice and assistance to Member States and EU  bodies on cybersecurity. It contributes to developing  and implementing the Union’s cybersecurity policies.  Our aim is to strengthen trust in the connected  economy, boost resilience and trust of the Union’s  infrastructure and services and keep our society and  citizens digitally secure. We aspire to be an agile,  environmentally and socially responsible organisation  focused on people.  MISSION STATEMENT  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 11  STRATEGY  EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES  Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. Europe  strives for a cross sectoral, all-inclusive cooperation  framework. ENISA plays a key role in stimulating  active cooperation between the cybersecurity  stakeholders in Member States and the EU  institutions and agencies. It strives to ensure  complementarity of common efforts, by adding  value to the stakeholders, exploring synergies and  effectively using limited cybersecurity expertise and  resources. Communities should be empowered to  scale up the cybersecurity model.  CYBERSECURITY POLICY  Cybersecurity is the cornerstone of digital  transformation and the need for it permeates  all sectors, therefore it needs to be considered  across a broad range of policy fields and initiatives.  Cybersecurity must not be restricted to a specialist  community of technical cybersecurity experts.  Cybersecurity must therefore be embedded across all  domains of EU policies. Avoiding fragmentation and  the need for a coherent approach while taking into  account the specificities of each sector is essential.  OPERATIONAL COOPERATION  The benefits of the European digital economy and  society can only be fully attained under the premise  of cybersecurity. Cyber-attacks know no borders.  All layers of society can be impacted and the Union  needs to be ready to respond to massive (large-scale  and cross-border) cyber-attacks and cyber crisis.  Cross-border interdependencies have highlighted  the need for effective cooperation between Member  States and the EU institutions for faster response and  proper coordination of efforts at all levels (strategic,  operational, technical and communications).  CAPACITY BUILDING  The frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks  is rising speedily, while at the same time the use of  ICT infrastructures and technologies by individuals,  organisations, and industries is increasing rapidly. The  needs for cybersecurity knowledge and competences  exceeds the supply. The EU has to invest in building  competences and talents in cybersecurity at all levels,  from the non-expert to the highly skilled professional.  The investments should focus not only on increasing  the cybersecurity skillset in the Member States but  also on making sure that the different operational  communities possess the appropriate capacity to deal  with the cyber threat landscape.  12  TRUSTED SOLUTION  Digital products and services bring benefits as well  as risks, and these risks must be identified and  mitigated. In the process of evaluating security of  digital solutions and ensuring their trustworthiness,  it is essential to adopt a common approach, with the  goal to strike a balance between societal, market,  economic and cybersecurity needs. A neutral entity  acting in a transparent manner will increase customer  trust on digital solutions and the wider digital  environment.  FORESIGHT  Numerous new technologies, still in their infancy or  close to mainstream adoption, would benefit from  the use of foresight methods. Through a structured  process enabling dialogue among stakeholders,  decision- and policy-makers would be able to define  early mitigation strategies that improve the EU  resilience to cybersecurity threats and find solutions  to address emerging challenges.  Empowering  Communities  Cybersecurity  Policy  Operational  Cooperation  Capacity  Building  Trusted  Solutions  Foresight  Knowledge  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 13  KNOWLEDGE  The energy that fuels the mill of cybersecurity is  information and knowledge. For cybersecurity  professionals to be efficient at tackling our objectives,  to work in a constantly moving environment – in  terms of digital developments as well as with  regard to actors – to face the challenges of our  time, a continuous process of collecting, organising,  summarising, analysing, communicating, and  maintaining cybersecurity information and knowledge  is clearly needed. All phases are essential to ensure  that information and knowledge is shared and  expanded within the EU cybersecurity ecosystem.  I  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 15  The year 2020 was characterised by the increased  prioritisation of EU digital policies, through initiatives  such as the Digital Services Act, the proposals for  cybersecurity-specific revisions to the NIS directive,  and many other digital initiatives, such as the  European digital identity. The EU’s ambition in this  area were encapsulated in the phrase ‘making  2020–2030 “Europe’s Digital Decade”’, used by  Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in her  State of the Union address1 in September 2020.  Where cybersecurity is concerned, these ambitions  were made more concrete in the EU’s cybersecurity  strategy2 for the digital decade, released in December  2020, and also in the context of ensuring the EU’s  technological autonomy. This prioritisation continued  in 20213 and beyond.  ENISA welcomes the EU’s new cybersecurity strategy.  The strategy proposes, among many things, a review  of the NIS directive, a new critical entities resilience  directive, a network of security operations centres  (SOCs), new measures to strengthen the EU Cyber  Diplomacy Toolbox and the further implementation  of the 5G Cybersecurity Toolbox. The Agency is ready  1 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ SPEECH_20_1655 2 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ IP_20_2391  3 And has been fortified by the most recent State of the  Union address (15 September 2021), which highlighted the  concepts of cooperation, resilience and situational awareness  (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ SPEECH_21_4701).  to fully utilise its mandate and tasks to act in the  areas outlined by the strategy that are covered by  its mandate over the period of the 2022–2024 single  programming document (SPD).  The COVID-19 pandemic has not only brought  healthcare challenges; it has also had an impact on  the process of digitalisation in Europe, worldwide and  across sectors, increased technological complexities  and exposed the need to boost technology skill sets.  These effects in turn have accelerated exposure to  a wide range of cybersecurity threats and threat  actors, as documented by ENISA in 2021, on the one  hand, and have increased the need for cybersecurity  knowledge, awareness, resilience, cooperation and  solutions on the other. This affects all aspects of  ENISA’s work and the cybersecurity ecosystem that  the EU is building up.  ENISA’s eighth edition of its annual threat landscape  report4 confirmed current and future trends of  cyberattacks becoming ever-more sophisticated,  targeted, widespread and undetected. Malware  was again voted the EU’s number one cyber threat  in a poll of intelligence experts, and changes were  observed in phishing, identity theft and ransomware  that moved them to higher-ranking positions.  Monetisation remains cybercriminals’ top motivation,  and the COVID-19 environment fuelled attacks  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-threat- landscape-2020  PART I GENERAL CONTEXT  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_20_1655 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_20_1655 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2391 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2391 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-threat-landscape-2020 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-threat-landscape-2020  16  on homes, businesses, governments and critical  infrastructure in 2020 and early 2021. Industries  and governments alike continue to be hit by  cyberespionage attacks. The number of data breach  incidents continues to be very high, and the amount  of stolen financial information and user credentials  is growing. Unfortunately, we are getting used to  hearing terms like ‘Bad Rabbit ransomware’, ‘Winnti’,  ‘Magecart’ and ‘watering hole attacks’. In December  2020, the European Medicines Agency was a victim  of a cyberattack resulting in the leak of documents  relating to the evaluation processes for COVID-19  vaccines. In the same month, another cyberattack on  the software company SolarWinds through its supply  chain resulted in a back-door infiltration into its  commercial software application. The list has grown  in 2021, with further supply chain attacks with global  implications, such as the Kaseya and SITA attacks.  The current escalation and the threat landscape  status require the continual introduction of new  methods and different approaches for Europe to  become cybersecure.  The adoption and implementation of policy  frameworks is one key area where the EU is making  a difference. Indeed, the policies and initiatives that  will be put in place in the coming years will determine  how the EU faces the cybersecurity challenges of  today and tomorrow. In this context, ENISA will  determine and adapt the support that it provides,  particularly in the following areas.  THE NIS2 DIRECTIVE  AND THE JOINT CYBER UNIT  Improving cyber resilience, particularly for those who  operate essential services such as healthcare and  energy or for those who provide online marketplace  services, has been the main focus of the current NIS  directive since 2016. The proposed expansion of its  scope, in the form of the new NIS2 directive, will see  far more entities obliged to take measures to increase  the level of cybersecurity in Europe.  A 2020 ENISA study on NIS investments5 showed that,  for organisations implementing the NIS directive,  ‘Unclear expectations’ (35 %) and ‘Limited support  from the national authority’ (22 %) were among the  challenges faced. The NIS2 proposal addresses these  areas, aiming to provide more clarity in terms of what  is expected of national authorities, computer security  incident response teams (CSIRTs), and essential  and important entities in terms of reporting, crisis  management and information sharing.  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investments  ENISA is already invested in the above areas, with  its resilience, cooperation and capacity-building  work, and will be building up its own capacities to  support the outcome of the proposal in the coming  years using existing resources and building on these  wherever necessary. This will also apply to increased  cooperation under the potential Joint Cyber Unit (JCU)  umbrella. ENISA will contribute to the implementation  of the Commission’s recommendation on ‘building  the Joint Cyber Unit’, with a view to contributing  to the establishment of an EU crisis management  framework. This includes fostering cooperation  among cybersecurity communities, among relevant  EU institutions, bodies and agencies, and within  (and between) civilian cooperation networks (i.e. the  Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe),  the CSIRTs Network and, to the extent needed,  Cooperation Group).  IMPLEMENTATION OF  THE EU CYBERSECURITY  CERTIFICATION FRAMEWORK  ENISA is playing a central role in supporting the  implementation of the European cybersecurity  certification framework by preparing and maintaining  the candidate schemes with the support of area  experts and in collaboration with public authorities in  Member States. It is expected that the draft candidate  cybersecurity certifications schemes proposed by  ENISA will be adopted as Commission implementing  regulations. A conformity assessment of digital  products, services and processes in the digital single  market will be enabled under the adopted schemes,  therefore improving their cybersecurity. At the time of  writing, ENISA has prepared a candidate scheme on  common criteria (common criteria based European  candidate cybersecurity certification scheme) and  is advancing its work on cloud services (European  cybersecurity certification scheme for cloud services)  and 5G (EU5G).  Finalising the candidate schemes for the more  specialised product categories under the common  criteria and for cloud services is just the first step and  should start bringing initial benefits in terms of EU- wide certification processes and higher consumer and  user trust during 2022–2024.  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION  The EU is extending its support for and investments  in the wealth of expertise and experience in  cybersecurity research and technological and  industrial development that exists in the EU by  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investments  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 17  PART I. General context  18  prioritising cybersecurity in its research and  innovation support efforts, and in particular  through its Horizon Europe and Digital Europe  programmes. It is also pooling resources and  expertise by setting up the European Cybersecurity  Competence Centre and the Network of National  Coordination Centres6. ENISA is ready to contribute  to this essential area in the coming years within  the role given to it by the regulation establishing  the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre  and the Network of National Coordination Centres  and by the mandate of the Cybersecurity Act (CSA).  Some of this work is anticipated to take place in  2022–2024, and the particular tasks required will  become clearer as the Cybersecurity Competence  Centre becomes operational.  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  With the EU’s artificial intelligence (AI) agenda  advancing rapidly following the European  Commission proposal on AI7 and 2021 coordinated  plan on AI8, the EU is addressing the major  technological, ethical, legal and socioeconomic  challenges that must be met to put AI at the service of  European citizens and the economy, for instance by  considering linking high-risk AI systems to mandatory  trustworthiness requirements. One of these  challenges is understanding the interplay between  cybersecurity and AI and how this can affect the  availability, safety and resilience of future AI services  and applications.  Building on ENISA’s AI threat landscape report9 of  December 2020 and with the guidance of its Ad Hoc  Expert Group on AI10, the Agency can continue its  open dialogue with EU institutions in support of the  legislative initiatives reaching into 2022–2024. In this  way, ENISA can continue to support the Commission  and Member States by providing good security  practices and guidelines.  6 Regulation (EU) 2021/887 of 20 May 2021 establishing  the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and  Research Competence Centre and the Network of National  Coordination Centres. 7 Proposal for Regulation (EU) 2021/206 of 21 April 2021 laying  down harmonised rules on AI (Artificial Intelligence Act) and  amending certain Union legislative acts. 8 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/coordinated- plan-artificial-intelligence-2021-review 9 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-ai- threat-landscape-report-unveils-major-cybersecurity-challenges 10 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart- infrastructures/artificial_intelligence/ad-hoc-working-group  THE EUROPEAN DIGITAL  IDENTITY FRAMEWORK  The EU’s eIDAS regulation provides a framework for  interoperability of national electronic identification  (eID) schemes and sets up an EU-wide market of  electronic trust services. eID schemes and trust  services are crucial for the EU digital market  because they allow citizens and businesses to  carry out transactions online in a safe and trusted  way. In 2020, the Commission reviewed the eIDAS  regulation and identified several gaps. In June 2021,  the Commission adopted a proposal for a revised  legal framework establishing a European digital  identity11 that can be used by all EU citizens and by  EU businesses when carrying out online transactions.  In 2022–2024, ENISA will support Member States  and the Commission in the implementation and  development of the toolbox and the European digital  identity framework as set out in the Commission’s  recommendation of 3 June 202112 in addition to  promoting the exchange of good practices and  capacity building of relevant stakeholders.  FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS  In 2020, ENISA put forward a proposal to open a local  office in Brussels in accordance with Article 20(5)  of the CSA. This will strengthen ENISA’s position in  the digital ecosystem of the EU and in particular its  role in establishing synergies with EU institutions,  bodies, offices and agencies in the field of operational  cooperation at EU level. Moreover, the local office in  Brussels will aim to ensure regular and systematic  cooperation with EU institutions, bodies and  agencies and other competent bodies involved in  cybersecurity. Indeed, it will support the delivery of  tasks mandated to ENISA under Article 7 of the CSA,  in particular that of establishing and maintaining  structured cooperation with the Computer  Emergency Response Team for the EU institutions,  bodies and agencies (CERT-EU). A detailed and annual  cooperation plan is being integrated into ENISA’s SPD  and is part of the memorandum of understanding  (MoU) signed in early 2021. This will enable both  organisations to benefit from synergies provided  by proximity and daily contact and to avoid any  duplication of activities.  11 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0281 12 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/946 of 3 June 2021  on a common union toolbox for a coordinated approach towards  a European digital identity framework.  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/coordinated-plan-artificial-intelligence-2021-review https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/coordinated-plan-artificial-intelligence-2021-review https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-ai-threat-landscape-report-unveils-major-cybersecurity-challenges https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-ai-threat-landscape-report-unveils-major-cybersecurity-challenges https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/artificial_intelligence/ad-hoc-working-group https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/artificial_intelligence/ad-hoc-working-group https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0281 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0281  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 19  PART I. General context  In 2021, ENISA established a cooperation agreement13  with the European Telecommunications Standards  Institute (ETSI). ETSI and ENISA have the common  objective of collaborating on, contributing to and  promoting regional and international standardisation.  There is mutual interest in avoiding any duplication  of technical work, and in adopting an aligned and  complementary approach to the standardisation  process in specific domains.  13 Signature pending.  II  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 21  For decades, Europe has taken steps to improve  digital security and trust through policies and  initiatives. The Management Board of ENISA adopted  a new strategy for the Agency in June 2020, which  builds on the CSA and outlines how the Agency will  strive to meet expectations of the cybersecurity  ecosystem in the long term, in a manner that is  open, innovative and agile as well as being socially  and environmentally responsible. The strategy sets  out a vision of a trusted and cybersecure Europe in  which all citizens and organisations of Europe not  only benefit but are also key components in the effort  to secure Europe. Most importantly, the new ENISA  strategy outlines seven strategic objectives that are  derived from the CSA and set the expected long-term  goals for the Agency.  2.1. MULTIANNUAL WORK  PROGRAMME  The following table maps the strategic objectives  stemming from ENISA’s strategy14 against the relevant  articles of the CSA. It furthermore integrates the  activities of the work programme, showing how  progress towards the achievement of the objectives  is monitored. These objectives may be reviewed  through the ENISA Management Board from  1 July 2024.  14 The ENISA strategy entered into force on 31 July 2020 and the  Management Board shall launch a review procedure, if relevant,  on 1 July 2024.

Community mindset. ENISA works with  communities, respecting their competencies and  expertise, and fosters synergies and trust to best  achieve its mission.  Excellence. ENISA aims for state-of-the-art expertise  in its work, upholds the highest quality standards  of operation and evaluates its performance to strive  for continuous improvement through innovation  and foresight.  Integrity/ethics. ENISA upholds ethical principles  and relevant EU rules and obligations in its services  and working environment, ensuring fairness  and inclusiveness.  Respect. ENISA respects fundamental European  rights and values covering all its services and  working environments, as well as the expectations  of its stakeholders.  Responsibility. ENISA assumes responsibility, thus  ensuring integration of the social and environmental  dimensions into practices and procedures.  Transparency. ENISA adopts procedures,  structures and processes that are open, factual  and independent, thus limiting bias, ambiguity,  fraud and obscurity.  These values are built on the ethos of the CSA,  in particular the objectives set out in Article 3(4)  and Article 4(1), and have been encapsulated into  two corporate objectives, which form the baseline  Corporate objective Actions to  achieve  objective  Article of  the CSA  Expected results Key performance indicator Metrics  Sound resource and risk  management  Activity 10 Article 4(1) •  Maximised quality and value provided to stakeholders  and citizens  •  Building lasting credibility and trust  •  Organisational performance  •  Trust in ENISA  Proportion of key performance indicators reached  Individual contribution to achieving the objectives of the Agency through  clear links to key performance indicators (Career Development Report)  Exceptions in risk register  Number of complaints filed against ENISA including number of inquiries/ complaints to the European Ombudsman  Number of complaints addressed in a timely manner and in accordance with  relevant procedures  Results of annual risk assessment exercise  Observations from external audit bodies (e.g. European Court of Auditors)  requiring follow-up actions by ENISA (i.e. number of ‘critical’, ‘significant’  or ‘very important’ findings and number of observations successfully  completed and closed)  Level of trust in ENISA (survey)  Build an agile  organisation focused  on people  Activity 11 Article 3(4) ENISA as an employer of choice Staff commitment, motivation  and satisfaction  Staff satisfaction survey (including attractiveness of ENISA as an employer,  staff empowerment, organisational culture, opportunities for internal  mobility, workspace, work environment and work tools)  Quantity and quality of ENISA training and career development activities  organised for staff  Reasons for staff departure (established by exit interviews)  Staff retention/turnover rate  Resilience and quality of ENISA’s information technology (IT) systems  and services (including ability to consistently increase satisfaction with  IT services and tools)  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 2727  PART II. Multiannual programming  2022–2024  Corporate objective Actions to  achieve  objective  Article of  the CSA  Expected results Key performance indicator Metrics  Sound resource and risk  management  Activity 10 Article 4(1) •  Maximised quality and value provided to stakeholders  and citizens  •  Building lasting credibility and trust  •  Organisational performance  •  Trust in ENISA  Proportion of key performance indicators reached  Individual contribution to achieving the objectives of the Agency through  clear links to key performance indicators (Career Development Report)  Exceptions in risk register  Number of complaints filed against ENISA including number of inquiries/ complaints to the European Ombudsman  Number of complaints addressed in a timely manner and in accordance with  relevant procedures  Results of annual risk assessment exercise  Observations from external audit bodies (e.g. European Court of Auditors)  requiring follow-up actions by ENISA (i.e. number of ‘critical’, ‘significant’  or ‘very important’ findings and number of observations successfully  completed and closed)  Level of trust in ENISA (survey)  Build an agile  organisation focused  on people  Activity 11 Article 3(4) ENISA as an employer of choice Staff commitment, motivation  and satisfaction  Staff satisfaction survey (including attractiveness of ENISA as an employer,  staff empowerment, organisational culture, opportunities for internal  mobility, workspace, work environment and work tools)  Quantity and quality of ENISA training and career development activities  organised for staff  Reasons for staff departure (established by exit interviews)  Staff retention/turnover rate  Resilience and quality of ENISA’s information technology (IT) systems  and services (including ability to consistently increase satisfaction with  IT services and tools)  from which the multiannual activities of the SPD will  be delivered.  The corporate objective of sound resource and  risk management is derived from requirements  in Article 4(1) of the CSA, which sets an objective  for the Agency to ‘be a centre of expertise on  cybersecurity by virtue of its independence, the  scientific and technical quality of the advice and  assistance it delivers, the information it provides,  the transparency of its operating procedures, the  methods of operation, and its diligence in carrying out  its tasks’. In addition, the inspiration for this corporate  objective stems from the values of excellence and  transparency derived from the ENISA strategy and  the principle of efficiency set out in the Management  Board Decision MB/2020/5 on the principles to be  applied for organising ENISA. This decision aims for  ENISA to uphold the highest quality of standards,  strive for continuous improvement and enhance  its performance.  The corporate objective of building an agile  organisation focused on people is derived from  requirements in Article 3(4) of the CSA, which obliges  the Agency to ‘develop its own resources, including …  human capabilities and skills, necessary to perform  the tasks assigned to it under this Regulation’. In  addition, the inspiration for this corporate objective  stems from the values of responsibility and respect  derived from the ENISA strategy and the principle  of competences set out in Management Board  Decision MB/2020/5 on the principles to be applied  for organising ENISA. This decision aims for ENISA to  respect fundamental European rights and values in its  working environment, assume responsibility for social  and environmental dimensions of its procedures and  develop its staff competences, expertise and talent.  2828  2.2. HUMAN AND FINANCIAL  RESOURCES – OUTLOOK FOR 2022–2024  2.2.1. Overview of the past and  current situations  Table 1.  2019 2020 2021 202218  Number of  posts in the  establishment  plan  59 69 76 82  Fulfilment of the  establishment  plan (on  1 January)  76 % 80 % 80 % 94 %  As an agency, ENISA has historically struggled to  meet its human resources needs and take steps to  ensure timely and rapid fulfilment of its establishment  plan. The gap between the available posts and the  fulfilment is evidenced in Table 1. This has hampered  the Agency in terms of making use of its potential  capabilities in the most efficient manner, resulting in a  smaller actual human resource capacity of the Agency.  In order to change this, in 2020 the Agency embarked  on a large-scale call for expression of interest for  temporary agents (TAs) and contract agents (CAs)  following a novel approach, with the aim of creating  a sufficiently diverse and broad reserve shortlist of  candidates with more transversal competences and  skills that could be used to recruit staff and thus fill  the gaps in the current establishment plan, as well as  serve as a pool of candidates for the establishment  plan on a multiannual basis. The call, which was  accompanied by a widespread promotional  campaign, attracted 1 173 candidates for TA posts,  18 Three administrator posts subject to budget approval  (NIS2 proposal). Projection of establishment plan fulfilment  on 1 January 2022 depends on successful conclusions  of ongoing selections for Q4 2021.  590 CA candidates and 229 manager candidates from  across all Member States. This resulted in a reserve  shortlist of 68 candidates for TA posts, 15 for CA posts  and 8 for manager posts. The figures below depict the  results of the recruitment exercise. The full table of  results can be found in Annex IV, Table 4.  The second measure that the Agency put in place  was to introduce an annual strategic workforce  planning framework, which prompts the organisation  to analyse its human resources needs in advance,  on a multiannual basis on the basis of the SPD, and  plan and review the allocation of human resources  across different activities as well as prepare new  recruitment calls well in advance of the enactment  of the applicable annual establishment plans.  This also enables the Agency to take corrective  action if and when necessary, to achieve the aims  set out in Article 3(3) of the Management Board  Decision MB/2020/9, which foresees that the  executive director will ensure that ‘The average  number of staff members assigned to the EDO and  CSS [offices and services supporting the functioning  of the Agency] shall not exceed the average number  of staff members assigned to units [executing the  objectives and tasks of the Agency].’  In the course of the 2021 Strategic Workforce Review,  the Agency, in addition to other measures, reallocated  a total of four posts from executive director’s office  (EDO) and corporate support services (CSS), to be  able to meet the threshold foreseen in Article 3(3)  of Management Board Decision MB/2020/9. This  resulted in a termination of one contract, and  the prolongation of two contracts was put under  review. The posts are now allocated to policy  development & implementation unit (PDI), capacity  building unit (CBU) and market, certification and  standardisation unit (MCS), to be fulfilled through  ongoing recruitment calls. The intended impact of the  conclusions of the 2021 Strategic Workforce Review  are summarised in the table below.  Table 2.

Table 3.  2021 2022* 2023* 2024*  Total appropri- ations for ENISA  22 833  000a  24 208  000  24 707  000  25 220  000  * Source: Draft EU annual budget for the 2022 financial year  (COM(2021) 300 and Commission forecast), including a reserve  budget of EUR 610 000 as a result of the NIS2 proposal. a Other contributions by the Greek authorities to cover  rental payments up to a maximum amount of EUR 640 000  are not included.  As of 2022, 97.6 % of ENISA’s revenue will be from  the EU contribution and 2.4 % will be from the  European Economic Area country contribution  (see Annex III, Table 6). In absolute terms, the EU  and European Economic Area contributions for  2022 are estimated to reach EUR 23.6 million and  EUR 0.6 million respectively.  The general allocation of funds across titles is  expected to remain stable during 2022–2024.  Expenditure in 2022 is expected to amount  to EUR 24.2 million, of which EUR 12.5 million  in Title 1 covers all staff-related costs (52 %),  EUR 2.8 million in Title 2 covers main items such as  building-related expenditure and ICT expenses (11 %)  and EUR 8.9 million in Title 3 covers all core operating  expenditure (37 %). Total expenditures include  the reserve budget of EUR 610 000 expected to be  allocated to cover additional staff (three TAs and two  CAs)19 to manage part of the activities linked to the  NIS directive being discussed by legislators.  19 The Commission asks ENISA to amend its establishment plan  and resource planning in order to include the additional five  full-time equivalents (three temporary agent and two contract  agent posts), as specified in the legislative financial statement  accompanying the proposal for a directive revising Directive  (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council  of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high common level of  security of network and information systems across the Union  ((COM 2020/823) final). These resources should be managed  as reserves that the Agency can draw on once the final budget  is adopted. The Commission invites the Agency to update the  2.2.3.2. Human resources  In its budget proposal for the 2022–2024 SPD, the  Agency asks for an extra six seconded national  expert (SNE) posts to be introduced gradually (two  per year over 3 years). It stresses that the related  costs would be budget-neutral (i.e. covered by  ENISA’s current budget and therefore additional  budgetary resources would not be required). ENISA  proposes to cover the related costs through the  established operational budget (Title 3)20, as the  posts are directly linked to the operational needs  and expectations of the Agency.  Specifically, the six additional SNE posts are crucial  to the Agency’s ability to address the tasks mandated  by the CSA in the areas of development of the  national cybersecurity strategies, incident reporting  and indexing, and in particular in the area of  operational cooperation (Article 7 of the CSA). They  would therefore be justified both by the Agency’s  current activity areas and by those extra activities  and requirements, as foreseen especially in the  initial phases of the JCU, as per the Commission’s  recommendation on the Joint Cyber Unit of  23 June 2021.  It is clear that the request for the six SNEs cannot  cover all the potential future developments of the  JCU, nor that only exclusively SNE posts will be able  to cater for future needs. It is however also clear  that without the inclusion of such posts, it will be  far more challenging for the Agency to support the  crucial initial phases of the JCU. Based on the above  approach, the request for the six SNE posts without  additional budgetary resources has a 3-year time  frame between 2022 and 2024 (e.g. they can be  introduced gradually: two per year over 3 years).  Finally, the collective knowledge acquired from the  Member State perspective through such posts will  be crucial for the success of these tasks. In fact, by  importing unique expertise and knowledge into the  Agency through SNE posts rather than having to  outsource certain tasks or create any dependencies  on external staff, ENISA is catering for the increasing  number of activities that require close cooperation  with Member States as part of its mandate. Higher  SNE turnovers will, in turn, be of direct benefit to all  draft single programming document with the impact of this  Commission proposal. 20 In terms of process at the time of writing, the Commission  opinion of 24 August 2021 (6130) did not support this proposal,  as reflected in the 2022–2024 SPD. This had been endorsed by  the Management Board in the past and is currently pending final  outcome in the budgetary approval process among co-legislators.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 3131  PART II. Multiannual programming  2022–2024  Member States and offer a rich experience to SNEs  following their posting.  In addition, and pending the final outcome of the  proposed NIS directive proposal, NIS221, as of  2022/2023, ENISA may be tasked with additional  action areas. While these action areas are covered by  ENISA’s general tasks in accordance with its mandate,  they would be supported by five supplementary full- time equivalents (FTEs) (three TAs and two CAs) with  a corresponding budget of around EUR 610 000 per  year. This is an integrated part of the NIS2 proposal,  which is subject to approval and managed as reserves  that the Agency can draw on following the completion  of the EU budget process.  As all those resources are required in order to fulfil  the operational mandate of the Agency, the Agency  also plans to allocate all the new posts to operational  units. Thus, although the current average does  not meet the threshold foreseen in Article 3(3) of  Management Board Decision MB/2020/9, it should  be regarded as a temporary derogation until such  time as the new posts will become available and  subsequently established. The Agency also commits  itself not to raise the number of staff assigned to  supporting offices and services (EDO and CSS) from  the current level (a total of 40 staff members).  2.2.4. Strategy for achieving  efficiency gains  ENISA is committed to continuously implementing  measures to obtain efficiency gains in all activities.  In 2021, the ENISA organisational structure  was amended to follow the principles of sound  budgetary management and building efficiencies  in both executing its core mandate and fulfilling its  corporate functions. Also, the Agency continues to  implement its work programme by systematic use of  its statutory bodies (National Liaison Officers (NLO)  Network and ENISA Advisory Group), as well as other  statutory groups ENISA is involved in (Stakeholder  Cybersecurity Certification Group (SCCG) as set  out in Article 22 of the CSA and NISD Cooperation  Group and its work streams and expert groups  created under EU law) and its own ad hoc expert  groups where appropriate to peer review the scope  and direction of actions undertaken to implement  outputs, as well as validate the results. This way,  the Agency will fulfil its obligation as outlined in  Article 3(3) of the CSA: avoiding duplication of  21 Proposal COM 2020/823 of 16 December 2020 for a directive  revising Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of 6 July 2016 concerning  measures for a high common level of security of network and  information systems across the Union.  Member State activities and taking into consideration  existing Member State expertise. Hence, all activities  enlisted under Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of this SPD  contain an indication of how specific deliverables and  other actions undertaken to fulfil the outputs will be  validated and peer reviewed or consulted as per the  legal requirements in the area of certification.  In 2021, the framework for structured cooperation  with CERT-EU to utilise synergies and avoid  duplication of activities in executing its task in the  field of operational cooperation (Article 7 of the CSA)  is being implemented, and a local office in Brussels  established in 2021 should further enable the Agency  to further create synergies with other EU institutions,  agencies and bodies within and beyond these  activities. The Agency is also pursuing cooperation  with relevant EU bodies (through the Joint  Research Centre) and will create synergies with the  Cybersecurity Competence Centre and the Network  of National Coordination Centres once established to  pursue synergies in fulfilling their tasks in the field of  research and innovation (Article 11 of the CSA).  In its corporate functions, ENISA seeks to further  rationalise its internal processes to improve its overall  efficiency and to benchmark its activities with the  best practices implemented by other EU institutions  and agencies. The Agency is continuing and further  expanding the sharing of services among other EU  agencies. A number of collaborations and agreements  are currently in place (e.g. with the European Union  Intellectual Property Office) and in 2021 the Agency  signed a cooperation plan with the European Union  Agency for the Operational Management of Large- Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and  Justice (eu-LISA). In addition, ENISA and the European  Centre for the Development of Vocational Training  (Cedefop) are strengthening their cooperation to  streamline procurement, share financial services,  increase efficiency gains in human resources, explore  IT solutions together and support each other in  the area of data protection. The aim is to share  knowledge and utilise human resources in the most  efficient manner between the two agencies, resulting  in better value for EU citizens.  Prompted by the COVID-19 crisis, the Agency  established efficiency gains through digitalisation  of its functions. It is already using EU tools such  as accrual-based accounting (ABAC), ABAC assets,  procurement and e-invoicing. Furthermore, in  2020 the Agency deployed Sysper and in 2021  the migration of its services to other tools, such  as; Missions Integrated Processing System (MIPS)  and Advanced Record System (ARES), is foreseen.  Most administrative tasks are already supported  3232  by the application ‘Paperless’ and others, which  is a significant step towards the goal of 100 %  e-administration. E-training is also internally  encouraged, with the aim, among others, of reducing  the costs associated with ‘classroom’ training  (travelling costs etc.).  In 2021, the Agency established a series of events  and webinars for external parties and will upgrade its  capabilities to use secure digital conferencing across  the field, providing further opportunities in efficiency  gains as well as expanding the scale and scope  of its activities.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 3333  PART II. Multiannual programming  2022–2024  34  III  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 35  This is the main body of the work programme,  describing, as per operational and corporate activity,  what the Agency aims to deliver in the respective year  in terms of achieving its strategy and the expected  results. In total, nine operational activities and two  corporate activities have been identified to support  the implementation of ENISA’s mandate in 2022.  The activities of the work programme seek to mirror  and align with the tasks set out in Chapter II of the  CSA, demonstrating concretely not only the specific  objectives, results and outputs expected for each task  but also the resources assigned.  Activities 1, 2, 3 and 9 represent the Agency’s most  developed areas, with longstanding projects such  as policy support, cyber exercises and training  and European Cybersecurity Month. Activities 4–8  represent the areas of the Agency that are  developing, such as contributing to cooperative  response, certification, supporting the cybersecurity  market and industry, and providing analysis on  emerging challenges. Prioritisation in terms of  resources is foreseen for these less-developed  activities to support their development over the  coming years.  In addition, the activities below do not reflect the  additional five supplementary FTEs (three TAs  and two CAs) and the corresponding budget of  EUR 610 000 per year from the proposed NIS directive  (NIS2)22. This allocation will take place in due course,  in accordance with the final agreement of regulators  and once tasks have been finalised.  22 Proposal COM 2020/823 of 16 December 2020 for a directive  revising Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of 6 July 2016 concerning  measures for a high common level of security of network and  information systems across the Union.

Under this activity, ENISA will continue to enhance key objectives of its reorganisation, as described in the  Management Board Decision MB/2020/5, including the need to address the gaps in the Agency’s quality  assessment framework, install proper and functioning internal controls and compliance checks, make best use  of the internal resources of the Agency, impose sound financial and budgetary management, and utilise internal  and external synergies within ENISA. These aspects are addressed in the new organisational architecture,  but should also be built into the daily operations of the Agency as guided by the work programme. Actions  undertaken will ensure that the Agency’s outputs add real value, through making performance and ex post  and ex ante evaluations integral to the work programme througout its life cycle, including by rigorous quality  assurance through proper project management, internal peer reviews and independent audits and validations.  Gaps in skills and training as well as resource planning will be reviewed and mitigated. The Agency will carry out a  risk assessment of its organisational activities and IT systems and propose mitigation measures. The Agency will  link its main business processes with information systems that serve these processes and will produce a single  registry of corporate processes (SOPs).  The legal basis for this activity is Articles 4(1) and 32 of the CSA, the latter of which strongly focuses on the sound  financial management principle with a view to maximise value for stakeholders.  Objectives  •  Increased effectiveness and efficiency in  achieving Agency objectives.  •  Fully comply with legal and financial  frameworks in performance (i.e. build a culture  of compliance).  •  Protect the Agency’s assets and reputation,  while reducing risks.  •  Achieve full climate neutrality of all operations  by 2030.  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  Sound resource and risk management.

The allocation specifies direct budgets and FTEs for  each activity, with indirect budgets being assigned  based on causal relationships.  The following assumptions are used in the simplified  activity-based budgeting methodology.  The direct budget is the cost estimate of each  of the nine operational activities and two  corporate activities as indicated in Section  3 of this 2022–2024 SPD in terms of goods  and services to be procured.  The indirect budget is the cost estimate of salaries  and allowances, buildings, IT, equipment and  miscellaneous operating costs attributable to  each activity. The indirect budget is allocated to  activities based on different drivers. The main  driver for cost allocation was number of foreseen  FTEs for each activity in 2022.  The allocation of five additional FTEs and EUR  610 000 from the proposed NIS2 directive will be  allocated in due course in accordance with the  final agreement of the regulators and once the  tasks have been finalised.

Cancellation of payment appropriations  carried over  (Fund source: ‘C8’ – appropriations carried over  automatically from 2019 to 2020.)  The appropriations of 2019 carried over to 2020 were  utilised at a rate of 96 % (automatic carry-overs),  which indicates a satisfactory capability of estimation  of needs. From the amount of EUR 4 347 332 carried  forward, EUR 180 024 was cancelled, mostly due  to the circumstances caused by COVID-19. This  cancellation represents 0.7 % of the total budget for  2020 (fund sources: C1 and C8).

The most represented nationality has seen a  decrease of 1 % over the past 5 years. This can be attributed to the broad outreach campaigns on popular media  across the EU, closer consideration of the nationality spread in relation to competencies requested, and the  continuation of specific provisions in recruitment (55).  E. LOCAL OFFICE IN BRUSSELS, BELGIUM  In 2020, ENISA put forward a proposal to open a local office in accordance with Article 20(5) of the CSA.  The number of staff in each local office shall not exceed 10 % of the total number of ENISA staff located in the  Member State in which ENISA’s headquarters are located.  The main approval steps were:  the June 2020 Management Board meeting gave the ED prior consent to proceed  with the establishment preparations;  Greek (January 2021) and Belgian (August 2020) authorities gave their positive opinion;  in June 2021, Commission adopted Decision C(2021)4626 of 23 June 2021, giving its prior consent;  in July 2021, ENISA’s Management Board confirmed the establishment of the office.  Table 28. Indicative resources foreseen  Resources (indicative) 2021 2022 2023 2024  Headcount (FTEs) 2–3 4–7 4–10 4–10  Budget (one-off and  maintenance costs) (EUR)  25 000 500 000 170 000 170 000  The practical preperations for the Brussels local office are at an advanced stage.  55 The seeming imbalance related to the most represented nationality among ENISA staff is related to several factors, such as the  level of posts and related salaries, which may be perceived as less appealing for job seekers in relatively more advanced Member  State economies; the fact that ENISA has a better position as an employer compared with average conditions offered in the Greek job  market; the small job market in Greece for cybersecurity professionals. Other reasons that may be cited are the need for stability during  the start-up phase of the Agency, as staff from the hosting Member State (Greece) were considered less likely to resign (resulting in  lower turnover), which in combination with the comparatively young age of the Agency, still has its original impact; the relatively better  academic profile of Greek candidates appropriate for lower-level posts; the relatively lower payroll cost for staff that are relatively better  qualified than average while costing less if expatriation allowance is considered; and the general predisposition to retain a lower-level  position in the home country.

A public School  of European  Education, type  II, was founded in  2005 by the Greek  Government in  Heraklion, Crete,  for the children of  ENISA staff.  There is no  European School  operating in Athens.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 83  ANNEX Evaluations  ANNEX 9 EVALUATIONS  External consultants are contracted to carry out annual ex post evaluations of  operational activities. The scope of the evaluation focuses on ENISA’s operational  activities. The overall aim of the annual evaluations is to evaluate the effectiveness,  efficiency, coherence and relevance.  The consulted stakeholders generally agree that ENISA is the only entity that could  achieve such results, is seen as a key enabler of knowledge, experience and expertise,  and enables the creation of a strong cybersecurity community. The evaluation also  revealed that ENISA is perceived as a strong and credible partner at EU level and its  activities are seen as pertinent for Member States. The report therefore concludes on  an extremely positive note, acknowledging the added value of ENISA’s activities for the  whole EU.  The ex ante evaluation included desk research and interviews with key ENISA  stakeholders. It concluded that given the restructuring of the 2021–2023 programming  document, the structure of ENISA’s SPD would not require any changes, but it was  recommended that certain outputs should be strengthened with a specific focus on the  following areas:  a proactive shaping of the political agenda;  developing a transversal focus on digital strategic autonomy and its implications  for cybersecurity;  reinforcing the cooperative response by an insight-driven approach;  focusing on stakeholder management, awareness raising and activities  targeting industry.  ENISA uses an internal monitoring system that is intended to support the project  management function, which includes the project delivery and resources allocation. The  regular reporting and the ENISA management team use this information for managerial  purposes. Moreover, ENISA has implemented a mid-term review procedure and regular  weekly management team meetings. ENISA has undertaken a study to upgrade the use  of electronic tools in the internal project management and overall delivery of the Agency  work programme.  84  ANNEX Strategy for organisational management and internal control systems  ANNEX 10 STRATEGY FOR  ORGANISATIONAL  MANAGEMENT  AND INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  The Agency’s strategy for an effective internal control system is based on international  best practices and on the internal control framework (the committee of sponsoring  organization framework’s international standards).  The control environment is the set of standards of conduct, processes and structures  that provide the basis for carrying out internal control across ENISA. The Management  Team set the tone from the outset with respect to the importance of the internal control,  including expected standards of conduct.  Risk assessment is the Agency’s dynamic and iterative process for identifying and  assessing risks that could affect the achievement of objectives, and for determining how  such risks should be managed.  The control activities ensure the mitigation of risks related to the achievement of  policy, operational and internal control objectives. They are performed at all levels of  the organisation, at various stages of business processes and across the technology  environment. They may be preventive or detective, and encompass a range of manual  and automated activities as well as segregation of duties.  Information is necessary for the organisation to carry out internal control and to support  the achievement of its objectives. In this respect, it is necessary to consider external and  internal communication. External communication provides specific Agency stakeholders  and, more widely, EU citizens with information on ENISA’s policy, objectives, actions and  achievements. Internal communication provides ENISA staff with the information required  to support the achievement of objectives and the awareness for day-to-day controls.  Continuous and specific assessments are used to ascertain whether each of the five  components of internal control are present and functioning. Continuous assessments,  built into business processes at different levels of the organisation, provide timely  information on any deficiencies. Findings are assessed and deficiencies are communicated  and corrected in a timely manner, with serious matters reported as appropriate.  The Common Approach on EU Decentralised Agencies foresees that EU agencies should  be more active concerning fraud prevention issues and that the related communication  forms an essential part of its success. In order to implement this, the European Anti- Fraud Office recommended that each agency should adopt an anti-fraud strategy that is  proportionate to its fraud risks. Rules for the prevention and management of conflicts of  interest are part of the anti-fraud strategy of the Agency.

The CSA also refers to specific international  organisations (e.g. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  (OECD), Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)) that ENISA is called to develop relations  with (see recital 43).  1.3.  Since the entry into force of the CSA, ENISA’s exposure to partners outside the EU  has increased both quantitatively and qualitatively57. ENISA is also often approached  by third countries directly with high expectations of mutual collaboration, and is  confronted each time on how best to react. Such welcomed developments call for  a more strategic approach to the international dimension of ENISA’s work in order  to guide the engagement of the Agency with third country partners, as well to direct  Agency’s response to third country partners seeking cooperation with ENISA.  1.4.  This international strategy covers the cooperation with international organisations  and with non-EU countries. However, for those non-EU countries or regions with  which the EU has special agreements this international strategy should be read in  the light of such agreements, looking at where a closer cooperation in the area of  cybersecurity is foreseen.  56 Chapter II of Title II of the CSA covers all tasks of ENISA and thus outlines areas in which ENISA  is competent. 57 The expectations of various actors inside the EU institutions and of Member States for ENISA to engage  more actively internationally have increased, as was stressed in the bilateral interviews undertaken by ENISA  in spring 2021. This was also confirmed in the internal survey carried out by ENISA in early 2021.  88  2. ENISA’S OVERALL INTERNATIONAL APPROACH  The directions and provisions in this strategy will not in any way limit or hamper the  provisions laid out by Article 12 of the CSA.  The mandate of the Agency is to achieve ‘a high common level of cybersecurity across the  Union, including by actively supporting Member States, Union institutions, bodies, offices  and agencies in improving cybersecurity’. Under this mandate, ENISA’s strategic aim is to  build a trusted and cybersecure Europe. ENISA’s international strategy must therefore be  at the service of the Union, advance the achievement of the Agency’s mandate within the  Union and contribute to its strategy58.  This underlying premise directs the Agency to be selective in engaging with  international partners and to limit its overall approach in international cooperation  to only those areas and activities that will have high and measurable added value in  achieving the Agency’s strategic objectives.  International cooperation should be resourced prudently and proportionally. This  strategy outlines three approaches that the Agency can use in terms of level of  commitment of resources: the limited, assisting and outreach approaches.  2.1. Limited approach  ENISA’s default international approach is ‘limited’. Under this approach, ENISA will,  in line with its objectives enshrined in Article 4 of the CSA, exchange information with  relevant international partners on an ad hoc basis59, to strengthen and develop its  expertise and anticipate changes prompted by global developments in cybersecurity.  It will seek to promote the Union’s values and to advance its strategic objectives  and cybersecurity policies when engaging with international partners in meetings,  conferences and seminars. ENISA will not commit dedicated resources to pursue this  approach beyond mission or conference costs.  2.2. Assisting approach  In line with its mandate to ‘actively support Member States, Union institutions, bodies,  offices and agencies in improving cybersecurity’ (Article 3(1) of the CSA), ENISA may  respond to requests for assistance – when the request is deemed to add significant value  to a specific strategic objective and is in line with the Union’s policies – namely from  third countries and international organisations with which the Union has agreements  or frameworks that promote specific or general cooperation in cybersecurity. Under  this approach, ENISA may exchange and share expertise, contribute to organising  training sessions and exercises, support the Commission/EU in building and maintaining  cybersecurity dialogues and support individual cybersecurity activities with international  partners organised by the requester. To respond to such requests, ENISA might use  resources dedicated to specific strategic objectives as set out in its single programming  document (SPD).  58 ENISA (2020), A Trusted and Cyber Secure Europe – ENISA strategy (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/ publications/corporate-documents/enisa-strategy-a-trusted-and-cyber-secure-europe). 59 For principles that govern selecting and engaging with international partners, please see Section 3 of this  annex: ‘Principles governing ENISA’s international approach’.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 89  2.3. Outreach approach  ENISA may follow an ‘outreach’ approach for specific aims and provisions of the strategic  objectives outlined in this strategy, to proactively engage with specific international  partners to be able to advance the Agency’s strategic objectives and fulfil the objectives of  the CSA. Under this approach, ENISA may plan dedicated resources in its SPD in pursuit  of this approach.  3. PRINCIPLES GOVERNING ENISA’S INTERNATIONAL APPROACH  1. ENISA will focus its international cooperation on partners with which the Union has strategic economic relationships and which share the Union’s values.  2. When cooperation in cybersecurity between the Union and an international partner is explicitly stated in an agreement, ENISA may follow an outreach approach, respecting the limits of the agreement provisions.  3. Beyond specific provisions outlined under Section 4 of this annex, ‘Specific aims and provisions under individual strategic objectives’, ENISA can, when relevant, pursue an outreach approach across all of its strategic objectives with European Economic Area countries.  4. ENISA will refrain from engaging with international actors if contacts or cooperation with  such actors would be deemed incompatible with the Union’s interests or policy goals.  5. The Agency’s international cooperation activities should align with and add value to the partnerships of Member States.  6. When responding to requests under the assisting approach not explicitly covered in this strategy, and where otherwise appropriate, ENISA will consult and coordinate with the European External Action Service and the Commission, to ensure that the Agency’s international engagement is in line with the Union’s policy goals. ENISA will notify the Executive Board of requests under an assisting approach and those under an outreach approach. ENISA will furthermore ensure that its outreach activities are in line with the Union’s policies by regularly consulting with the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology.  7. In its SPD, ENISA will proportionally evaluate the resources needed for involvement in any international activities with an assisting or outreach approach.  8. ENISA will seek endorsement of the Executive Board prior to developing cooperation frameworks or agreements with international organisations and third countries. When such agreements place financial or legal obligations on the Agency, they must be approved by the Management Board.  9. In its annual activity report, ENISA will outline all international activities it has pursued under different approaches. In particular, it will evaluate and provide assessment of the added value of international activities under an assisting or outreach approach in pursuit of its strategic objectives.  10. The Agency should be able to react in an agile manner while adhering to these principles.  ANNEX International strategy of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity  90  4. SPECIFIC AIMS AND PROVISIONS UNDER INDIVIDUAL  STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES  4.1. Strategic objective ‘Empowered and engaged communities  across the cybersecurity ecosystem’  ENISA exchanges best practices and expertise and promotes international activities to  enhance the cybersecurity awareness and education of the various communities of the  Union. Furthermore:  using the assisting approach, ENISA can give support in terms of expertise to the  Western Balkans as a region and/or single countries of the region and to countries  belonging to the European Eastern Partnership as a region and/or single countries of  the region;  using the outreach approach, and with the endorsement of the Management Board,  ENISA can cooperate with third countries with which there are specific EU agreements  to enhance mutual cybersecurity awareness and education in line with the respective  specific provisions of such agreements.  4.2. Strategic objective ‘Cybersecurity as an integral part  of EU policies’  ENISA collects and exchanges information on best practices in cybersecurity policy  development and implementation internationally and promotes the projection of EU  cybersecurity policies to the benefit of the Union. ENISA’s connections with international  organisations working on digital security can both contribute to the promotion of EU  acquis in this field and feed into EU cybersecurity policy development. Furthermore:  using the assisting approach, ENISA can support Union representatives of relevant  international organisations and regulatory forums by providing expertise on  cybersecurity policies and cybersecurity aspects of Union legislation as outlined under  Article 5 of the CSA;  using the assisting approach, ENISA can provide expertise on cybersecurity policy  implementation to the Western Balkans and Eastern Partnership countries;  using the outreach approach, ENISA can cooperate with the OECD (and like-minded  countries such as the Unites States) on mapping and promoting best practices in  integrating cybersecurity into various policy domains.  4.3. Strategic objective ‘Effective cooperation among operational  actors within the union in case of massive cyber incidents’  ENISA’s international cooperation should assist and contribute to the Union’s incident  response and crisis management, in particular by building a trusted network of like- minded international partners – including major global cybersecurity companies and  vendors – to contribute to the Union’s common situational awareness and preparedness.  Furthermore, ENISA – in line with recital 43 of the CSA and using the outreach approach –  can contribute to this by cooperating with international partners such as the OSCE and  NATO on joint incident response coordination60.  60 Those activities are to be carried out in full respect of the principles of inclusiveness, reciprocity and  the decision-making autonomy of the Union, without prejudice to the specific character of the security and  defence policy of any Member State.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 91  4.4. Strategic objective ‘Cutting-edge competences and capabilities  in cybersecurity across the Union’  ENISA will seek to reach out to international partners to exchange information and best  practices in order to enhance and develop cybersecurity competences and capabilities  within the Union. Where appropriate, it can participate as an observer in the organisation  of international cybersecurity exercises in line with Article 12 of the CSA. Furthermore:  using the assisting approach, ENISA can contribute to building competences and  capabilities in the Western Balkans as a region and/or single countries by supporting  training and exercises;  using the assisting approach, ENISA can support, with relevant expertise, countries  belonging to the Eastern Partnership as a region and/or single countries of the region  or countries benefiting from the Union’s development programmes;  in line with recital 43 of the CSA and using the assisting approach, ENISA can  contribute to the organisation of joint cybersecurity exercises with the OECD, the  OSCE and NATO;  under the outreach approach, ENISA can organise international cybersecurity  challenges to promote and enhance the competitiveness of cybersecurity  competences in the Union;  using the outreach approach, and with the endorsement of the Management Board,  ENISA can cooperate with third countries with which there are specific EU agreements  to build and enhance mutual cybersecurity capacities in line with the respective  specific provisions of such agreements.  4.5. Strategic objective ‘A high level of trust in secure digital solutions’  Without prejudice to possible tasks stemming from Article 12(d) of the CSA, ENISA will  seek to advance its expertise and monitor international developments in cybersecurity  certification and related standardisation areas, also in line with Article 54 of the CSA61. It  will engage with international actors on the supply and demand sides of the cybersecurity  market to promote and advance European digital autonomy. Furthermore:  using the outreach approach, ENISA will engage with the relevant key strategic  economic partners of the Union to promote the EU’s cybersecurity certification  schemes or candidate schemes;  using the outreach approach, and in line with recital 23 of the CSA, ENISA will support  the global development and maintenance of standards that underpin the public core  of the open internet and the stability and security of its functioning.  4.6. strategic objective ‘Foresight on emerging and future  cybersecurity challenges’  ENISA aims to exchange information on an ad hoc basis and participate in international  forums to increase its expertise in international developments and map global  cybersecurity threats as well as research areas and innovation trends that could address  emerging challenges.  61 Article 54 (elements of European cybersecurity certification schemes) of the CSA states that ‘A European  cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements: […] (c) references to the  international, European or national standards applied in the evaluation or, where such standards are  not available or appropriate, to technical specifications that meet the requirements set out in Annex II  to Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 or, if such specifications are not available, to technical specifications or  other cybersecurity requirements defined in the European cybersecurity certification scheme; […] (o) the  identification of national or international cybersecurity certification schemes covering the same type or  categories of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes, security requirements, evaluation criteria and  methods, and assurance levels.’  ANNEX International strategy of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity  92  4.7. Strategic objective ‘Efficient and effective cybersecurity  information and knowledge management for Europe’  ENISA aims to gain a better overview and understanding of the international  cybersecurity landscape and ensure that relevant cybersecurity information and  knowledge generated internationally is shared and expanded within the EU cybersecurity  ecosystem. ENISA will focus its outreach to partners deemed like-minded (e.g. Japan).  Furthermore:  using the outreach approach, ENISA will cooperate with the OECD and NATO in  exchanging expertise for the development of cybersecurity indices and benchmarks;  using the outreach approach, and with the endorsement of the Management Board,  ENISA will cooperate with third countries with which there are specific EU agreements  to enhance mutual knowledge and information in line with the respective specific  provisions of such agreements.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 93  ANNEX Annual cooperation plan 2022  ANNEX 13 ANNUAL  COOPERATION  PLAN 2022  This document is the draft 2022 annual cooperation plan for ENISA and CERT-EU, as  foreseen in the co-signed MoU.  The plan aims to cover the cooperation activities planned for 2022.  The plan proposed in this document includes references to the activities included in the  2022 ENISA work programme, which has been submitted to the Management Board  for approval.  In that regard, and because CERT-EU is in the process of drafting its annual programme  for 2022, this plan should not be considered final.  In line with the 2021 annual cooperation plan, the proposed plan identifies actions in the  following areas:  capacity building, as referred to in Articles 6(c) and 6(i) of the CSA;  operational cooperation, as referred to in Article 7 of the CSA;  long-term strategic analyses of cyber threats, as foreseen in Article 9(b) of the CSA.  94  1. CAPACITY BUILDING  Capacity building62 covers assistance to relevant public bodies to improve capabilities  to respond to cyber threats and incidents as well as provision of cybersecurity training.  Focus points of capacity building for the structured cooperation plan for 2022 remain  maturity, training and exercises.  1.1. Maturity  Maturity assessments are useful means to identify current abilities and also existing gaps  that require reinforcement of an organisation’s capabilities and to guide its efforts to  improve its overall cybersecurity posture by achieving higher maturity levels over time.  In 2021, drawing on CERT-EU’s and other CSIRTs Network and EU institutions’, bodies’  and agencies’ stakeholders’ experience and expertise, ENISA performed maturity-related  activities targeting the CSIRTs Network to improve its members’ capabilities for handling  cyber incidents and EU institutions’, bodies’ and agencies’ Blueprint63 actors to assess  their EU-level crisis management capabilities. This work is expected to result64 in a new  and updated methodology for performing maturity assessments.  In parallel, and with the help of ENISA, CERT-EU started developing a cybersecurity  maturity assessment methodology for all EU institutions, bodies and agencies, in the  context of the European Commission’s upcoming proposal for a regulation on common  binding cybersecurity rules for all EU institutions, bodies and agencies.  The plan for 2022 will focus on continuing the activities started in 2021, in particular  the following.  EU institutions’, bodies’ and agencies’ cyber hygiene. CERT-EU will lead the  activities of finalising the proposal for common binding cybersecurity rules regulation  for all EU institutions, bodies and agencies and develop a cybersecurity maturity  assessment methodology for all EU institutions, bodies and agencies.  CSIRT maturity. ENISA will finalise the new proposed maturity framework for  the CSIRTs Network and the maturity assessment methodology for EU-level crisis  management. ENISA will foster the application of the methodologies to relevant  subjects to help identify current abilities and gaps.  CERT-EU and ENISA will maintain close contact throughout the process to ensure their  maturity-related activities complement each other in the most efficient way, avoiding  duplication and misalignment.  62 As referred to in Articles 6(c) and 6(i) of the CSA. 63 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2017/1584 (Blueprint). 64 According to the 2021 annual cooperation plan, the work will be concluded by the end of 2021.

This close cooperation will continue in 2022 and will be enhanced  to the benefit of the cybersecurity community.  The proposed cooperation for 2022 will continue to combine CERT-EU’s and ENISA’s  strengths to lay the basis for developing a relevant, cost-efficient training portfolio that  supports cybersecurity capacity building but also operational cooperation. The ambition  of the cooperation is for ENISA to be able to provide a state-of-the-art training portfolio  that will be offered to Member States and EU institutions, bodies and agencies and to  keep it up to date and relevant through close collaboration with CERT-EU and other  key stakeholders.  Working methods already developed in 2021 will continue throughout 2022, with  structured cooperation building on those (e.g. ENISA hosting CERT-EU training material  and CERT-EU collaborating with ENISA when determining topics for working group  training sessions).  The focus of 2022 will be to sustain ongoing activities (i.e. cyber exercises regularly  organised by ENISA) and finalising activities started in 2021, particularly the following.  Custom technical courses. Building on the activity in 2021, ENISA will work with  CERT-EU and the CSIRTs Network Training Working Group to enhance training  programmes based on audience knowledge level (e.g. elementary versus advanced).  Technical specialised workshop for CERT-EU constituents. CERT-EU will further  develop technical specialised workshops, leveraging, where relevant, the experience  and working practice of ENISA.  Regular ENISA cybersecurity exercises. This is an ongoing activity led by ENISA that  materialises in several types of exercises involving different stakeholders. Through  the structured cooperation, CERT-EU will be involved not only as a participant in  relevant exercises, but also as a planner for selected exercises (e.g. Cyber Europe).  ANNEX Annual cooperation plan 2022  96  Joint exercises. When relevant and in reference to the structured operational  cooperation, ENISA and CERT-EU will join forces by participating in exercises alongside  planners and a training audience. In addition, common operational activities (e.g. joint  rapid reports) will be evaluated through these occasions.  Objective Task Deliverable Lead 2022 work  programme  1.

OPERATIONAL COOPERATION  2.1. Blueprint  As part of the efforts to further develop the Blueprint, both ENISA and CERT-EU will align  actions on developing SOPs and improving common situational awareness.  The target for 2022 is to further expand on the cooperation activities started with the  2021 annual cooperation plan. In particular, the 2022 plan will still have SOPs and  common situational awareness as key objectives of the cooperation.  Joint SOP for Blueprint stakeholders. ENISA will continue leading at the operational  layer whereas CERT-EU will continue leading at the technical level of the Blueprint.  With the joint SOP document expected to be finalised during 2021, ENISA and CERT- EU will focus on further improving the SOP and testing the EU institutions’, bodies’  and agencies’ SOPs through exercises.  Security incident response – continuous improvement. CERT-EU will leverage  the work on SOPs, lessons learnt in significant incidents and proceedings on the  information exchange domain with ENISA and other Blueprint stakeholders to review  and update its technical SOPs – security incident response process.  Common situational awareness. As a result of the 2021 activities, both  organisations have worked towards the establishment of a mechanism for  information exchange at EU level, and set the stage for joint reports to raise  awareness of significant cybersecurity events (65). Within the 2022 activity, ENISA and  CERT-EU will further operationalise the mechanism, seeking additional opportunity  for joint reports and using exercises to enhance the production of situational  awareness deliverables.  65 Cybersecurity events or incidents significantly affecting or potentially significantly affecting EU Member  States, critical sectors within the meaning of the NISD or ICT technologies, services, platforms or ICT  infrastructures widely applied and used across the internal market.

In 2021, ENISA worked on establishing a mechanism supporting such assistance,  including the development of necessary processes and procedures as well as the basis  for a pool of experts. A similar mechanism has been established for EU institutions,  bodies and agencies under the lead of CERT-EU, building on the major attacks paper  (TF 03 18). This is combined with the aforementioned revision of the security incident  response process.  The 2022 proposed plan aligns with the work done in 2021, and focuses on further  enhancement and operationalisation of the provided mechanisms, in particular the  following.  Cybersecurity assistance mechanism. ENISA will continue focusing on the  operationalisation of the assistance mechanism, by ensuring the adoption and  endorsement of the mechanism by all involved actors, testing the mechanism in  cooperation with Member States and further enhancing the effectiveness of the  mechanism’s SOPs.  Operational capability to assist EU institutions, bodies and agencies. CERT-EU will  continue managing the pool of experts and further enhance its operational capability.  66 This is still in draft and the final name of the deliverable and service may change.

KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SHARING  Knowledge and information sharing is a horizontal activity that nurtures and sustains the  previous two pillars (capacity building and operational cooperation), as well as receiving  input from them.  As outlined in Article 9(b) of the CSA, ENISA performs long-term strategic analyses  of cyber threats and incidents in order to identify emerging trends and help prevent  incidents. One of the activities in this field is the ENISA threat landscape, which provides  an overview of threats, together with current and emerging trends. It is based on publicly  available or voluntarily shared information and data, and provides an independent  view on observed threats, threat agents and threat trends. CERT-EU is an important  and structured contributor to the ENISA threat landscape and related activities and will  remain so in 2022.  ENISA is leading long-term strategic analyses also through maintaining and collaborating  with a working group of experts on foresight for emerging and future cybersecurity  challenges and the cyber threat landscape67. Those two groups were formalised in 2021.  In 2022, CERT-EU, through its inclusion as an observer in these ENISA working groups, will  contribute to, review and validate the findings and generally enhance the outputs of the  groups. These activities refer to Activity 8 of the 2022 ENISA work programme: knowledge  on emerging cybersecurity challenges and opportunities.  The long-term strategic analyses will feed into the capacity-building and operational  activities outlined in the previous sections.  67 ENISA Ad-Hoc Working Group on Foresight on Emerging and Future Cybersecurity Challenges and ENISA  Ad-Hoc Working Group on Cyber Threat Landscapes.

pioneering EU policy initiatives that will already have changed the digital landscape by  the time we implement this 2022–2024 European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA)  single programming document.  A great many of these initiatives either directly or indirectly integrate cybersecurity  concerns, challenges and solutions, and they were introduced in December 2020 in the  EU’s new cybersecurity strategy. ENISA is ready and indeed very proud to contribute to  making these initiatives and their implementation a success, whether by promoting the  uptake of the EU’s first cybersecurity certification schemes, revising the network and  information security (NIS) directive and the electronic identification and trust services  (eIDAS) regulation, supporting the full implementation of the EU’s 5G Cybersecurity  Toolbox or fulfilling its roles in the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre, the  Network of National Coordination Centres and the new Joint Cyber Unit. ENISA will  use its new mandate, the expanded tasks and the fresh resources given to it by the  2019 Cybersecurity Act to make sure that it remains a key and reliable player and  partner within the EU’s cybersecurity ecosystem, able to tackle the ever-moving target  of cybersecurity. Furthermore, it will make sure that the need for future resources is  understood and that resources remain tailored to the EU’s cybersecurity prerogatives.  In the second year of my tenure, I have been inspired in my work by the motivation  and drive of the EU cybersecurity community – from my ENISA colleagues in their daily  work to the political leaders and the European stakeholder community across the  EU and in the national institutions in their united vision and support. There is a real  common determination and a ‘let’s do it’ approach to making Europe more cybersecure.  We will need to maintain that momentum to tackle the ever-growing sophistication  of cyberattackers and cyber challenges. Only in this way will we be able to establish  European technological autonomy in the area of cybersecurity.  I am particularly proud that we – the Agency’s staff and Management Board together  – have laid solid foundations to make ENISA more agile, more connected and more  performance-orientated, and this is reflected in the new organisational structure  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 9  of ENISA, operational since 1 January 2021, and in the way we work. This has been  enshrined in the 2020 ENISA strategy A Trusted and Cyber Secure Europe. And the  effects are showing: we are increasingly able to attract cybersecurity talent from all  over the EU to help us make a difference. In addition, with the generous support of  our Greek host authorities, we have moved to larger premises in Athens, and we are  expanding our networks throughout the EU, specifically through the imminent opening  of a local office in Brussels.  The full positive effects of these investments will be truly felt only once we have overcome  the current pandemic, but I am convinced that we will come out of this stronger, more  united and better prepared to embark on the European digital decade project.  Juhan Lepassaar Executive Director  1010  The mission of the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) is to achieve a high common  level of cybersecurity across the Union in cooperation  with the wider community. It does this through acting  as a centre of expertise on cybersecurity, collecting  and providing independent, high quality technical  advice and assistance to Member States and EU  bodies on cybersecurity. It contributes to developing  and implementing the Union’s cybersecurity policies.  Our aim is to strengthen trust in the connected  economy, boost resilience and trust of the Union’s  infrastructure and services and keep our society and  citizens digitally secure. We aspire to be an agile,  environmentally and socially responsible organisation  focused on people.  MISSION STATEMENT  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 11  STRATEGY  EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES  Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. Europe  strives for a cross sectoral, all-inclusive cooperation  framework. ENISA plays a key role in stimulating  active cooperation between the cybersecurity  stakeholders in Member States and the EU  institutions and agencies. It strives to ensure  complementarity of common efforts, by adding  value to the stakeholders, exploring synergies and  effectively using limited cybersecurity expertise and  resources. Communities should be empowered to  scale up the cybersecurity model.  CYBERSECURITY POLICY  Cybersecurity is the cornerstone of digital  transformation and the need for it permeates  all sectors, therefore it needs to be considered  across a broad range of policy fields and initiatives.  Cybersecurity must not be restricted to a specialist  community of technical cybersecurity experts.  Cybersecurity must therefore be embedded across all  domains of EU policies. Avoiding fragmentation and  the need for a coherent approach while taking into  account the specificities of each sector is essential.  OPERATIONAL COOPERATION  The benefits of the European digital economy and  society can only be fully attained under the premise  of cybersecurity. Cyber-attacks know no borders.  All layers of society can be impacted and the Union  needs to be ready to respond to massive (large-scale  and cross-border) cyber-attacks and cyber crisis.  Cross-border interdependencies have highlighted  the need for effective cooperation between Member  States and the EU institutions for faster response and  proper coordination of efforts at all levels (strategic,  operational, technical and communications).  CAPACITY BUILDING  The frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks  is rising speedily, while at the same time the use of  ICT infrastructures and technologies by individuals,  organisations, and industries is increasing rapidly. The  needs for cybersecurity knowledge and competences  exceeds the supply. The EU has to invest in building  competences and talents in cybersecurity at all levels,  from the non-expert to the highly skilled professional.  The investments should focus not only on increasing  the cybersecurity skillset in the Member States but  also on making sure that the different operational  communities possess the appropriate capacity to deal  with the cyber threat landscape.  12  TRUSTED SOLUTION  Digital products and services bring benefits as well  as risks, and these risks must be identified and  mitigated. In the process of evaluating security of  digital solutions and ensuring their trustworthiness,  it is essential to adopt a common approach, with the  goal to strike a balance between societal, market,  economic and cybersecurity needs. A neutral entity  acting in a transparent manner will increase customer  trust on digital solutions and the wider digital  environment.  FORESIGHT  Numerous new technologies, still in their infancy or  close to mainstream adoption, would benefit from  the use of foresight methods. Through a structured  process enabling dialogue among stakeholders,  decision- and policy-makers would be able to define  early mitigation strategies that improve the EU  resilience to cybersecurity threats and find solutions  to address emerging challenges.  Empowering  Communities  Cybersecurity  Policy  Operational  Cooperation  Capacity  Building  Trusted  Solutions  Foresight  Knowledge  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 13  KNOWLEDGE  The energy that fuels the mill of cybersecurity is  information and knowledge. For cybersecurity  professionals to be efficient at tackling our objectives,  to work in a constantly moving environment – in  terms of digital developments as well as with  regard to actors – to face the challenges of our  time, a continuous process of collecting, organising,  summarising, analysing, communicating, and  maintaining cybersecurity information and knowledge  is clearly needed. All phases are essential to ensure  that information and knowledge is shared and  expanded within the EU cybersecurity ecosystem.  I  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 15  The year 2020 was characterised by the increased  prioritisation of EU digital policies, through initiatives  such as the Digital Services Act, the proposals for  cybersecurity-specific revisions to the NIS directive,  and many other digital initiatives, such as the  European digital identity. The EU’s ambition in this  area were encapsulated in the phrase ‘making  2020–2030 “Europe’s Digital Decade”’, used by  Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in her  State of the Union address1 in September 2020.  Where cybersecurity is concerned, these ambitions  were made more concrete in the EU’s cybersecurity  strategy2 for the digital decade, released in December  2020, and also in the context of ensuring the EU’s  technological autonomy. This prioritisation continued  in 20213 and beyond.  ENISA welcomes the EU’s new cybersecurity strategy.  The strategy proposes, among many things, a review  of the NIS directive, a new critical entities resilience  directive, a network of security operations centres  (SOCs), new measures to strengthen the EU Cyber  Diplomacy Toolbox and the further implementation  of the 5G Cybersecurity Toolbox. The Agency is ready  1 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ SPEECH_20_1655 2 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ IP_20_2391  3 And has been fortified by the most recent State of the  Union address (15 September 2021), which highlighted the  concepts of cooperation, resilience and situational awareness  (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ SPEECH_21_4701).  to fully utilise its mandate and tasks to act in the  areas outlined by the strategy that are covered by  its mandate over the period of the 2022–2024 single  programming document (SPD).  The COVID-19 pandemic has not only brought  healthcare challenges; it has also had an impact on  the process of digitalisation in Europe, worldwide and  across sectors, increased technological complexities  and exposed the need to boost technology skill sets.  These effects in turn have accelerated exposure to  a wide range of cybersecurity threats and threat  actors, as documented by ENISA in 2021, on the one  hand, and have increased the need for cybersecurity  knowledge, awareness, resilience, cooperation and  solutions on the other. This affects all aspects of  ENISA’s work and the cybersecurity ecosystem that  the EU is building up.  ENISA’s eighth edition of its annual threat landscape  report4 confirmed current and future trends of  cyberattacks becoming ever-more sophisticated,  targeted, widespread and undetected. Malware  was again voted the EU’s number one cyber threat  in a poll of intelligence experts, and changes were  observed in phishing, identity theft and ransomware  that moved them to higher-ranking positions.  Monetisation remains cybercriminals’ top motivation,  and the COVID-19 environment fuelled attacks  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-threat- landscape-2020  PART I GENERAL CONTEXT  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_20_1655 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_20_1655 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2391 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2391 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-threat-landscape-2020 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-threat-landscape-2020  16  on homes, businesses, governments and critical  infrastructure in 2020 and early 2021. Industries  and governments alike continue to be hit by  cyberespionage attacks. The number of data breach  incidents continues to be very high, and the amount  of stolen financial information and user credentials  is growing. Unfortunately, we are getting used to  hearing terms like ‘Bad Rabbit ransomware’, ‘Winnti’,  ‘Magecart’ and ‘watering hole attacks’. In December  2020, the European Medicines Agency was a victim  of a cyberattack resulting in the leak of documents  relating to the evaluation processes for COVID-19  vaccines. In the same month, another cyberattack on  the software company SolarWinds through its supply  chain resulted in a back-door infiltration into its  commercial software application. The list has grown  in 2021, with further supply chain attacks with global  implications, such as the Kaseya and SITA attacks.  The current escalation and the threat landscape  status require the continual introduction of new  methods and different approaches for Europe to  become cybersecure.  The adoption and implementation of policy  frameworks is one key area where the EU is making  a difference. Indeed, the policies and initiatives that  will be put in place in the coming years will determine  how the EU faces the cybersecurity challenges of  today and tomorrow. In this context, ENISA will  determine and adapt the support that it provides,  particularly in the following areas.  THE NIS2 DIRECTIVE  AND THE JOINT CYBER UNIT  Improving cyber resilience, particularly for those who  operate essential services such as healthcare and  energy or for those who provide online marketplace  services, has been the main focus of the current NIS  directive since 2016. The proposed expansion of its  scope, in the form of the new NIS2 directive, will see  far more entities obliged to take measures to increase  the level of cybersecurity in Europe.  A 2020 ENISA study on NIS investments5 showed that,  for organisations implementing the NIS directive,  ‘Unclear expectations’ (35 %) and ‘Limited support  from the national authority’ (22 %) were among the  challenges faced. The NIS2 proposal addresses these  areas, aiming to provide more clarity in terms of what  is expected of national authorities, computer security  incident response teams (CSIRTs), and essential  and important entities in terms of reporting, crisis  management and information sharing.  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investments  ENISA is already invested in the above areas, with  its resilience, cooperation and capacity-building  work, and will be building up its own capacities to  support the outcome of the proposal in the coming  years using existing resources and building on these  wherever necessary. This will also apply to increased  cooperation under the potential Joint Cyber Unit (JCU)  umbrella. ENISA will contribute to the implementation  of the Commission’s recommendation on ‘building  the Joint Cyber Unit’, with a view to contributing  to the establishment of an EU crisis management  framework. This includes fostering cooperation  among cybersecurity communities, among relevant  EU institutions, bodies and agencies, and within  (and between) civilian cooperation networks (i.e. the  Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe),  the CSIRTs Network and, to the extent needed,  Cooperation Group).  IMPLEMENTATION OF  THE EU CYBERSECURITY  CERTIFICATION FRAMEWORK  ENISA is playing a central role in supporting the  implementation of the European cybersecurity  certification framework by preparing and maintaining  the candidate schemes with the support of area  experts and in collaboration with public authorities in  Member States. It is expected that the draft candidate  cybersecurity certifications schemes proposed by  ENISA will be adopted as Commission implementing  regulations. A conformity assessment of digital  products, services and processes in the digital single  market will be enabled under the adopted schemes,  therefore improving their cybersecurity. At the time of  writing, ENISA has prepared a candidate scheme on  common criteria (common criteria based European  candidate cybersecurity certification scheme) and  is advancing its work on cloud services (European  cybersecurity certification scheme for cloud services)  and 5G (EU5G).  Finalising the candidate schemes for the more  specialised product categories under the common  criteria and for cloud services is just the first step and  should start bringing initial benefits in terms of EU- wide certification processes and higher consumer and  user trust during 2022–2024.  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION  The EU is extending its support for and investments  in the wealth of expertise and experience in  cybersecurity research and technological and  industrial development that exists in the EU by  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investments  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 17  PART I. General context  18  prioritising cybersecurity in its research and  innovation support efforts, and in particular  through its Horizon Europe and Digital Europe  programmes. It is also pooling resources and  expertise by setting up the European Cybersecurity  Competence Centre and the Network of National  Coordination Centres6. ENISA is ready to contribute  to this essential area in the coming years within  the role given to it by the regulation establishing  the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre  and the Network of National Coordination Centres  and by the mandate of the Cybersecurity Act (CSA).  Some of this work is anticipated to take place in  2022–2024, and the particular tasks required will  become clearer as the Cybersecurity Competence  Centre becomes operational.  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  With the EU’s artificial intelligence (AI) agenda  advancing rapidly following the European  Commission proposal on AI7 and 2021 coordinated  plan on AI8, the EU is addressing the major  technological, ethical, legal and socioeconomic  challenges that must be met to put AI at the service of  European citizens and the economy, for instance by  considering linking high-risk AI systems to mandatory  trustworthiness requirements. One of these  challenges is understanding the interplay between  cybersecurity and AI and how this can affect the  availability, safety and resilience of future AI services  and applications.  Building on ENISA’s AI threat landscape report9 of  December 2020 and with the guidance of its Ad Hoc  Expert Group on AI10, the Agency can continue its  open dialogue with EU institutions in support of the  legislative initiatives reaching into 2022–2024. In this  way, ENISA can continue to support the Commission  and Member States by providing good security  practices and guidelines.  6 Regulation (EU) 2021/887 of 20 May 2021 establishing  the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and  Research Competence Centre and the Network of National  Coordination Centres. 7 Proposal for Regulation (EU) 2021/206 of 21 April 2021 laying  down harmonised rules on AI (Artificial Intelligence Act) and  amending certain Union legislative acts. 8 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/coordinated- plan-artificial-intelligence-2021-review 9 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-ai- threat-landscape-report-unveils-major-cybersecurity-challenges 10 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart- infrastructures/artificial_intelligence/ad-hoc-working-group  THE EUROPEAN DIGITAL  IDENTITY FRAMEWORK  The EU’s eIDAS regulation provides a framework for  interoperability of national electronic identification  (eID) schemes and sets up an EU-wide market of  electronic trust services. eID schemes and trust  services are crucial for the EU digital market  because they allow citizens and businesses to  carry out transactions online in a safe and trusted  way. In 2020, the Commission reviewed the eIDAS  regulation and identified several gaps. In June 2021,  the Commission adopted a proposal for a revised  legal framework establishing a European digital  identity11 that can be used by all EU citizens and by  EU businesses when carrying out online transactions.  In 2022–2024, ENISA will support Member States  and the Commission in the implementation and  development of the toolbox and the European digital  identity framework as set out in the Commission’s  recommendation of 3 June 202112 in addition to  promoting the exchange of good practices and  capacity building of relevant stakeholders.  FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS  In 2020, ENISA put forward a proposal to open a local  office in Brussels in accordance with Article 20(5)  of the CSA. This will strengthen ENISA’s position in  the digital ecosystem of the EU and in particular its  role in establishing synergies with EU institutions,  bodies, offices and agencies in the field of operational  cooperation at EU level. Moreover, the local office in  Brussels will aim to ensure regular and systematic  cooperation with EU institutions, bodies and  agencies and other competent bodies involved in  cybersecurity. Indeed, it will support the delivery of  tasks mandated to ENISA under Article 7 of the CSA,  in particular that of establishing and maintaining  structured cooperation with the Computer  Emergency Response Team for the EU institutions,  bodies and agencies (CERT-EU). A detailed and annual  cooperation plan is being integrated into ENISA’s SPD  and is part of the memorandum of understanding  (MoU) signed in early 2021. This will enable both  organisations to benefit from synergies provided  by proximity and daily contact and to avoid any  duplication of activities.  11 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0281 12 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/946 of 3 June 2021  on a common union toolbox for a coordinated approach towards  a European digital identity framework.  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/coordinated-plan-artificial-intelligence-2021-review https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/coordinated-plan-artificial-intelligence-2021-review https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-ai-threat-landscape-report-unveils-major-cybersecurity-challenges https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-ai-threat-landscape-report-unveils-major-cybersecurity-challenges https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/artificial_intelligence/ad-hoc-working-group https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/artificial_intelligence/ad-hoc-working-group https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0281 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0281  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 19  PART I. General context  In 2021, ENISA established a cooperation agreement13  with the European Telecommunications Standards  Institute (ETSI). ETSI and ENISA have the common  objective of collaborating on, contributing to and  promoting regional and international standardisation.  There is mutual interest in avoiding any duplication  of technical work, and in adopting an aligned and  complementary approach to the standardisation  process in specific domains.  13 Signature pending.  II  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 21  For decades, Europe has taken steps to improve  digital security and trust through policies and  initiatives. The Management Board of ENISA adopted  a new strategy for the Agency in June 2020, which  builds on the CSA and outlines how the Agency will  strive to meet expectations of the cybersecurity  ecosystem in the long term, in a manner that is  open, innovative and agile as well as being socially  and environmentally responsible. The strategy sets  out a vision of a trusted and cybersecure Europe in  which all citizens and organisations of Europe not  only benefit but are also key components in the effort  to secure Europe. Most importantly, the new ENISA  strategy outlines seven strategic objectives that are  derived from the CSA and set the expected long-term  goals for the Agency.  2.1. MULTIANNUAL WORK  PROGRAMME  The following table maps the strategic objectives  stemming from ENISA’s strategy14 against the relevant  articles of the CSA. It furthermore integrates the  activities of the work programme, showing how  progress towards the achievement of the objectives  is monitored. These objectives may be reviewed  through the ENISA Management Board from  1 July 2024.  14 The ENISA strategy entered into force on 31 July 2020 and the  Management Board shall launch a review procedure, if relevant,  on 1 July 2024.

Community mindset. ENISA works with  communities, respecting their competencies and  expertise, and fosters synergies and trust to best  achieve its mission.  Excellence. ENISA aims for state-of-the-art expertise  in its work, upholds the highest quality standards  of operation and evaluates its performance to strive  for continuous improvement through innovation  and foresight.  Integrity/ethics. ENISA upholds ethical principles  and relevant EU rules and obligations in its services  and working environment, ensuring fairness  and inclusiveness.  Respect. ENISA respects fundamental European  rights and values covering all its services and  working environments, as well as the expectations  of its stakeholders.  Responsibility. ENISA assumes responsibility, thus  ensuring integration of the social and environmental  dimensions into practices and procedures.  Transparency. ENISA adopts procedures,  structures and processes that are open, factual  and independent, thus limiting bias, ambiguity,  fraud and obscurity.  These values are built on the ethos of the CSA,  in particular the objectives set out in Article 3(4)  and Article 4(1), and have been encapsulated into  two corporate objectives, which form the baseline  Corporate objective Actions to  achieve  objective  Article of  the CSA  Expected results Key performance indicator Metrics  Sound resource and risk  management  Activity 10 Article 4(1) •  Maximised quality and value provided to stakeholders  and citizens  •  Building lasting credibility and trust  •  Organisational performance  •  Trust in ENISA  Proportion of key performance indicators reached  Individual contribution to achieving the objectives of the Agency through  clear links to key performance indicators (Career Development Report)  Exceptions in risk register  Number of complaints filed against ENISA including number of inquiries/ complaints to the European Ombudsman  Number of complaints addressed in a timely manner and in accordance with  relevant procedures  Results of annual risk assessment exercise  Observations from external audit bodies (e.g. European Court of Auditors)  requiring follow-up actions by ENISA (i.e. number of ‘critical’, ‘significant’  or ‘very important’ findings and number of observations successfully  completed and closed)  Level of trust in ENISA (survey)  Build an agile  organisation focused  on people  Activity 11 Article 3(4) ENISA as an employer of choice Staff commitment, motivation  and satisfaction  Staff satisfaction survey (including attractiveness of ENISA as an employer,  staff empowerment, organisational culture, opportunities for internal  mobility, workspace, work environment and work tools)  Quantity and quality of ENISA training and career development activities  organised for staff  Reasons for staff departure (established by exit interviews)  Staff retention/turnover rate  Resilience and quality of ENISA’s information technology (IT) systems  and services (including ability to consistently increase satisfaction with  IT services and tools)  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 2727  PART II. Multiannual programming  2022–2024  Corporate objective Actions to  achieve  objective  Article of  the CSA  Expected results Key performance indicator Metrics  Sound resource and risk  management  Activity 10 Article 4(1) •  Maximised quality and value provided to stakeholders  and citizens  •  Building lasting credibility and trust  •  Organisational performance  •  Trust in ENISA  Proportion of key performance indicators reached  Individual contribution to achieving the objectives of the Agency through  clear links to key performance indicators (Career Development Report)  Exceptions in risk register  Number of complaints filed against ENISA including number of inquiries/ complaints to the European Ombudsman  Number of complaints addressed in a timely manner and in accordance with  relevant procedures  Results of annual risk assessment exercise  Observations from external audit bodies (e.g. European Court of Auditors)  requiring follow-up actions by ENISA (i.e. number of ‘critical’, ‘significant’  or ‘very important’ findings and number of observations successfully  completed and closed)  Level of trust in ENISA (survey)  Build an agile  organisation focused  on people  Activity 11 Article 3(4) ENISA as an employer of choice Staff commitment, motivation  and satisfaction  Staff satisfaction survey (including attractiveness of ENISA as an employer,  staff empowerment, organisational culture, opportunities for internal  mobility, workspace, work environment and work tools)  Quantity and quality of ENISA training and career development activities  organised for staff  Reasons for staff departure (established by exit interviews)  Staff retention/turnover rate  Resilience and quality of ENISA’s information technology (IT) systems  and services (including ability to consistently increase satisfaction with  IT services and tools)  from which the multiannual activities of the SPD will  be delivered.  The corporate objective of sound resource and  risk management is derived from requirements  in Article 4(1) of the CSA, which sets an objective  for the Agency to ‘be a centre of expertise on  cybersecurity by virtue of its independence, the  scientific and technical quality of the advice and  assistance it delivers, the information it provides,  the transparency of its operating procedures, the  methods of operation, and its diligence in carrying out  its tasks’. In addition, the inspiration for this corporate  objective stems from the values of excellence and  transparency derived from the ENISA strategy and  the principle of efficiency set out in the Management  Board Decision MB/2020/5 on the principles to be  applied for organising ENISA. This decision aims for  ENISA to uphold the highest quality of standards,  strive for continuous improvement and enhance  its performance.  The corporate objective of building an agile  organisation focused on people is derived from  requirements in Article 3(4) of the CSA, which obliges  the Agency to ‘develop its own resources, including …  human capabilities and skills, necessary to perform  the tasks assigned to it under this Regulation’. In  addition, the inspiration for this corporate objective  stems from the values of responsibility and respect  derived from the ENISA strategy and the principle  of competences set out in Management Board  Decision MB/2020/5 on the principles to be applied  for organising ENISA. This decision aims for ENISA to  respect fundamental European rights and values in its  working environment, assume responsibility for social  and environmental dimensions of its procedures and  develop its staff competences, expertise and talent.  2828  2.2. HUMAN AND FINANCIAL  RESOURCES – OUTLOOK FOR 2022–2024  2.2.1. Overview of the past and  current situations  Table 1.  2019 2020 2021 202218  Number of  posts in the  establishment  plan  59 69 76 82  Fulfilment of the  establishment  plan (on  1 January)  76 % 80 % 80 % 94 %  As an agency, ENISA has historically struggled to  meet its human resources needs and take steps to  ensure timely and rapid fulfilment of its establishment  plan. The gap between the available posts and the  fulfilment is evidenced in Table 1. This has hampered  the Agency in terms of making use of its potential  capabilities in the most efficient manner, resulting in a  smaller actual human resource capacity of the Agency.  In order to change this, in 2020 the Agency embarked  on a large-scale call for expression of interest for  temporary agents (TAs) and contract agents (CAs)  following a novel approach, with the aim of creating  a sufficiently diverse and broad reserve shortlist of  candidates with more transversal competences and  skills that could be used to recruit staff and thus fill  the gaps in the current establishment plan, as well as  serve as a pool of candidates for the establishment  plan on a multiannual basis. The call, which was  accompanied by a widespread promotional  campaign, attracted 1 173 candidates for TA posts,  18 Three administrator posts subject to budget approval  (NIS2 proposal). Projection of establishment plan fulfilment  on 1 January 2022 depends on successful conclusions  of ongoing selections for Q4 2021.  590 CA candidates and 229 manager candidates from  across all Member States. This resulted in a reserve  shortlist of 68 candidates for TA posts, 15 for CA posts  and 8 for manager posts. The figures below depict the  results of the recruitment exercise. The full table of  results can be found in Annex IV, Table 4.  The second measure that the Agency put in place  was to introduce an annual strategic workforce  planning framework, which prompts the organisation  to analyse its human resources needs in advance,  on a multiannual basis on the basis of the SPD, and  plan and review the allocation of human resources  across different activities as well as prepare new  recruitment calls well in advance of the enactment  of the applicable annual establishment plans.  This also enables the Agency to take corrective  action if and when necessary, to achieve the aims  set out in Article 3(3) of the Management Board  Decision MB/2020/9, which foresees that the  executive director will ensure that ‘The average  number of staff members assigned to the EDO and  CSS [offices and services supporting the functioning  of the Agency] shall not exceed the average number  of staff members assigned to units [executing the  objectives and tasks of the Agency].’  In the course of the 2021 Strategic Workforce Review,  the Agency, in addition to other measures, reallocated  a total of four posts from executive director’s office  (EDO) and corporate support services (CSS), to be  able to meet the threshold foreseen in Article 3(3)  of Management Board Decision MB/2020/9. This  resulted in a termination of one contract, and  the prolongation of two contracts was put under  review. The posts are now allocated to policy  development & implementation unit (PDI), capacity  building unit (CBU) and market, certification and  standardisation unit (MCS), to be fulfilled through  ongoing recruitment calls. The intended impact of the  conclusions of the 2021 Strategic Workforce Review  are summarised in the table below.  Table 2.

As of 2022, 97.6 % of ENISA’s revenue will be from  the EU contribution and 2.4 % will be from the  European Economic Area country contribution  (see Annex III, Table 6). In absolute terms, the EU  and European Economic Area contributions for  2022 are estimated to reach EUR 23.6 million and  EUR 0.6 million respectively.  The general allocation of funds across titles is  expected to remain stable during 2022–2024.  Expenditure in 2022 is expected to amount  to EUR 24.2 million, of which EUR 12.5 million  in Title 1 covers all staff-related costs (52 %),  EUR 2.8 million in Title 2 covers main items such as  building-related expenditure and ICT expenses (11 %)  and EUR 8.9 million in Title 3 covers all core operating  expenditure (37 %). Total expenditures include  the reserve budget of EUR 610 000 expected to be  allocated to cover additional staff (three TAs and two  CAs)19 to manage part of the activities linked to the  NIS directive being discussed by legislators.  19 The Commission asks ENISA to amend its establishment plan  and resource planning in order to include the additional five  full-time equivalents (three temporary agent and two contract  agent posts), as specified in the legislative financial statement  accompanying the proposal for a directive revising Directive  (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council  of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high common level of  security of network and information systems across the Union  ((COM 2020/823) final). These resources should be managed  as reserves that the Agency can draw on once the final budget  is adopted. The Commission invites the Agency to update the  2.2.3.2. Human resources  In its budget proposal for the 2022–2024 SPD, the  Agency asks for an extra six seconded national  expert (SNE) posts to be introduced gradually (two  per year over 3 years). It stresses that the related  costs would be budget-neutral (i.e. covered by  ENISA’s current budget and therefore additional  budgetary resources would not be required). ENISA  proposes to cover the related costs through the  established operational budget (Title 3)20, as the  posts are directly linked to the operational needs  and expectations of the Agency.  Specifically, the six additional SNE posts are crucial  to the Agency’s ability to address the tasks mandated  by the CSA in the areas of development of the  national cybersecurity strategies, incident reporting  and indexing, and in particular in the area of  operational cooperation (Article 7 of the CSA). They  would therefore be justified both by the Agency’s  current activity areas and by those extra activities  and requirements, as foreseen especially in the  initial phases of the JCU, as per the Commission’s  recommendation on the Joint Cyber Unit of  23 June 2021.  It is clear that the request for the six SNEs cannot  cover all the potential future developments of the  JCU, nor that only exclusively SNE posts will be able  to cater for future needs. It is however also clear  that without the inclusion of such posts, it will be  far more challenging for the Agency to support the  crucial initial phases of the JCU. Based on the above  approach, the request for the six SNE posts without  additional budgetary resources has a 3-year time  frame between 2022 and 2024 (e.g. they can be  introduced gradually: two per year over 3 years).  Finally, the collective knowledge acquired from the  Member State perspective through such posts will  be crucial for the success of these tasks. In fact, by  importing unique expertise and knowledge into the  Agency through SNE posts rather than having to  outsource certain tasks or create any dependencies  on external staff, ENISA is catering for the increasing  number of activities that require close cooperation  with Member States as part of its mandate. Higher  SNE turnovers will, in turn, be of direct benefit to all  draft single programming document with the impact of this  Commission proposal. 20 In terms of process at the time of writing, the Commission  opinion of 24 August 2021 (6130) did not support this proposal,  as reflected in the 2022–2024 SPD. This had been endorsed by  the Management Board in the past and is currently pending final  outcome in the budgetary approval process among co-legislators.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 3131  PART II. Multiannual programming  2022–2024  Member States and offer a rich experience to SNEs  following their posting.  In addition, and pending the final outcome of the  proposed NIS directive proposal, NIS221, as of  2022/2023, ENISA may be tasked with additional  action areas. While these action areas are covered by  ENISA’s general tasks in accordance with its mandate,  they would be supported by five supplementary full- time equivalents (FTEs) (three TAs and two CAs) with  a corresponding budget of around EUR 610 000 per  year. This is an integrated part of the NIS2 proposal,  which is subject to approval and managed as reserves  that the Agency can draw on following the completion  of the EU budget process.  As all those resources are required in order to fulfil  the operational mandate of the Agency, the Agency  also plans to allocate all the new posts to operational  units. Thus, although the current average does  not meet the threshold foreseen in Article 3(3) of  Management Board Decision MB/2020/9, it should  be regarded as a temporary derogation until such  time as the new posts will become available and  subsequently established. The Agency also commits  itself not to raise the number of staff assigned to  supporting offices and services (EDO and CSS) from  the current level (a total of 40 staff members).  2.2.4. Strategy for achieving  efficiency gains  ENISA is committed to continuously implementing  measures to obtain efficiency gains in all activities.  In 2021, the ENISA organisational structure  was amended to follow the principles of sound  budgetary management and building efficiencies  in both executing its core mandate and fulfilling its  corporate functions. Also, the Agency continues to  implement its work programme by systematic use of  its statutory bodies (National Liaison Officers (NLO)  Network and ENISA Advisory Group), as well as other  statutory groups ENISA is involved in (Stakeholder  Cybersecurity Certification Group (SCCG) as set  out in Article 22 of the CSA and NISD Cooperation  Group and its work streams and expert groups  created under EU law) and its own ad hoc expert  groups where appropriate to peer review the scope  and direction of actions undertaken to implement  outputs, as well as validate the results. This way,  the Agency will fulfil its obligation as outlined in  Article 3(3) of the CSA: avoiding duplication of  21 Proposal COM 2020/823 of 16 December 2020 for a directive  revising Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of 6 July 2016 concerning  measures for a high common level of security of network and  information systems across the Union.  Member State activities and taking into consideration  existing Member State expertise. Hence, all activities  enlisted under Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of this SPD  contain an indication of how specific deliverables and  other actions undertaken to fulfil the outputs will be  validated and peer reviewed or consulted as per the  legal requirements in the area of certification.  In 2021, the framework for structured cooperation  with CERT-EU to utilise synergies and avoid  duplication of activities in executing its task in the  field of operational cooperation (Article 7 of the CSA)  is being implemented, and a local office in Brussels  established in 2021 should further enable the Agency  to further create synergies with other EU institutions,  agencies and bodies within and beyond these  activities. The Agency is also pursuing cooperation  with relevant EU bodies (through the Joint  Research Centre) and will create synergies with the  Cybersecurity Competence Centre and the Network  of National Coordination Centres once established to  pursue synergies in fulfilling their tasks in the field of  research and innovation (Article 11 of the CSA).  In its corporate functions, ENISA seeks to further  rationalise its internal processes to improve its overall  efficiency and to benchmark its activities with the  best practices implemented by other EU institutions  and agencies. The Agency is continuing and further  expanding the sharing of services among other EU  agencies. A number of collaborations and agreements  are currently in place (e.g. with the European Union  Intellectual Property Office) and in 2021 the Agency  signed a cooperation plan with the European Union  Agency for the Operational Management of Large- Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and  Justice (eu-LISA). In addition, ENISA and the European  Centre for the Development of Vocational Training  (Cedefop) are strengthening their cooperation to  streamline procurement, share financial services,  increase efficiency gains in human resources, explore  IT solutions together and support each other in  the area of data protection. The aim is to share  knowledge and utilise human resources in the most  efficient manner between the two agencies, resulting  in better value for EU citizens.  Prompted by the COVID-19 crisis, the Agency  established efficiency gains through digitalisation  of its functions. It is already using EU tools such  as accrual-based accounting (ABAC), ABAC assets,  procurement and e-invoicing. Furthermore, in  2020 the Agency deployed Sysper and in 2021  the migration of its services to other tools, such  as; Missions Integrated Processing System (MIPS)  and Advanced Record System (ARES), is foreseen.  Most administrative tasks are already supported  3232  by the application ‘Paperless’ and others, which  is a significant step towards the goal of 100 %  e-administration. E-training is also internally  encouraged, with the aim, among others, of reducing  the costs associated with ‘classroom’ training  (travelling costs etc.).  In 2021, the Agency established a series of events  and webinars for external parties and will upgrade its  capabilities to use secure digital conferencing across  the field, providing further opportunities in efficiency  gains as well as expanding the scale and scope  of its activities.

In total, nine operational activities and two  corporate activities have been identified to support  the implementation of ENISA’s mandate in 2022.  The activities of the work programme seek to mirror  and align with the tasks set out in Chapter II of the  CSA, demonstrating concretely not only the specific  objectives, results and outputs expected for each task  but also the resources assigned.  Activities 1, 2, 3 and 9 represent the Agency’s most  developed areas, with longstanding projects such  as policy support, cyber exercises and training  and European Cybersecurity Month. Activities 4–8  represent the areas of the Agency that are  developing, such as contributing to cooperative  response, certification, supporting the cybersecurity  market and industry, and providing analysis on  emerging challenges. Prioritisation in terms of  resources is foreseen for these less-developed  activities to support their development over the  coming years.  In addition, the activities below do not reflect the  additional five supplementary FTEs (three TAs  and two CAs) and the corresponding budget of  EUR 610 000 per year from the proposed NIS directive  (NIS2)22. This allocation will take place in due course,  in accordance with the final agreement of regulators  and once tasks have been finalised.  22 Proposal COM 2020/823 of 16 December 2020 for a directive  revising Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of 6 July 2016 concerning  measures for a high common level of security of network and  information systems across the Union.  PART III WORK PROGRAMME  FOR 2022  36  3.1. OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES  ACTIVITY 1: Providing assistance in policy  development  Overview of activity  This activity delivers assistance and advice to the EU and Member States in developing cybersecurity policy and  sector-specific policy and law initiatives where matters related to cybersecurity are involved, and on the basis  of the new 2020 EU cybersecurity strategy. Aspects such as privacy and personal data protection are taken into  consideration (including encryption).  This activity seeks to bolster policy initiatives on novel/emerging technology areas by providing technical, fact- driven and tailor-made cybersecurity advice and recommendations. In addition to support in emerging policy  areas (such as AI, 5G, EU eID, quantum computing, blockchain, big data, digital resilience and response to current  and future crises), ENISA – in coordination with the Commission and Member States – will also conduct policy  scouting to support the Commission and Member States in identifying potential areas of policy development,  as well as develop monitoring capabilities and tools to regularly and consistently be able to give advice on the  effectiveness of existing EU policy and law in accordance with the EU’s institutional competencies in this area.  The added value of this activity is to support the decision-makers in a timely manner on developments at  technological, societal and economic market levels that might affect the cybersecurity policy framework (see also  activity 8). Given the cross-cutting nature of cybersecurity across the policy landscape, this activity will provide an  up-to-date risk-based analysis of cybersecurity not only in the areas of critical infrastructure and sectors, but also  by providing advice across the field in an integrated and holistic manner. The legal basis for this activity is Article  5 of the CSA.  Objectives  •  Foster cybersecurity as an integral part of EU  policy (existing and new).  •  Ensure that EU policymakers are regularly  informed about the effectiveness of the  existing frameworks and EU policymakers and  stakeholders are provided with timely and  tailor-made policy recommendations on future  cybersecurity challenges and opportunities.

ENISA demonstrates a  commitment rate of 97 % of C1 appropriations  for 2020 at the year-end (31 December). The  consumption of the 2020 budget at year-end shows  the capacity of the Agency to fully implement its  annual appropriations. The payment rate reached  69 %, and the amount carried forward to 2021  was EUR 6 074 991, representing 29 % of total C1  appropriations in 2020.  Cancellation of payment appropriations for the year  No payment appropriations were cancelled during 2020.  Cancellation of payment appropriations  carried over  (Fund source: ‘C8’ – appropriations carried over  automatically from 2019 to 2020.)  The appropriations of 2019 carried over to 2020 were  utilised at a rate of 96 % (automatic carry-overs),  which indicates a satisfactory capability of estimation  of needs. From the amount of EUR 4 347 332 carried  forward, EUR 180 024 was cancelled, mostly due  to the circumstances caused by COVID-19. This  cancellation represents 0.7 % of the total budget for  2020 (fund sources: C1 and C8).

The most represented nationality has seen a  decrease of 1 % over the past 5 years. This can be attributed to the broad outreach campaigns on popular media  across the EU, closer consideration of the nationality spread in relation to competencies requested, and the  continuation of specific provisions in recruitment (55).  E. LOCAL OFFICE IN BRUSSELS, BELGIUM  In 2020, ENISA put forward a proposal to open a local office in accordance with Article 20(5) of the CSA.  The number of staff in each local office shall not exceed 10 % of the total number of ENISA staff located in the  Member State in which ENISA’s headquarters are located.  The main approval steps were:  the June 2020 Management Board meeting gave the ED prior consent to proceed  with the establishment preparations;  Greek (January 2021) and Belgian (August 2020) authorities gave their positive opinion;  in June 2021, Commission adopted Decision C(2021)4626 of 23 June 2021, giving its prior consent;  in July 2021, ENISA’s Management Board confirmed the establishment of the office.  Table 28. Indicative resources foreseen  Resources (indicative) 2021 2022 2023 2024  Headcount (FTEs) 2–3 4–7 4–10 4–10  Budget (one-off and  maintenance costs) (EUR)  25 000 500 000 170 000 170 000  The practical preperations for the Brussels local office are at an advanced stage.  55 The seeming imbalance related to the most represented nationality among ENISA staff is related to several factors, such as the  level of posts and related salaries, which may be perceived as less appealing for job seekers in relatively more advanced Member  State economies; the fact that ENISA has a better position as an employer compared with average conditions offered in the Greek job  market; the small job market in Greece for cybersecurity professionals. Other reasons that may be cited are the need for stability during  the start-up phase of the Agency, as staff from the hosting Member State (Greece) were considered less likely to resign (resulting in  lower turnover), which in combination with the comparatively young age of the Agency, still has its original impact; the relatively better  academic profile of Greek candidates appropriate for lower-level posts; the relatively lower payroll cost for staff that are relatively better  qualified than average while costing less if expatriation allowance is considered; and the general predisposition to retain a lower-level  position in the home country.

A new objective has been  introduced in 2022 to carry out an overarching audit of the CO2 impact of all operations  of the Agency and to develop and implement a targeted action plan. The objective of this  undertaking is for the Agency to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 81  ANNEX Building policy  ANNEX 7 BUILDING POLICY  In 2021, ENISA relocated to a new headquarters building in Athens, Greece. The building  policy will be developed in the course of 2022.  82  ANNEX 8 PRIVILEGES  AND IMMUNITIES  Agency privileges  Privileges granted to staff  Protocol of privileges and immunities /  diplomatic status  Education/day  care  In accordance with Article 23 of Regulation  (EU) No 2019/881 of the European  Parliament and of the Council of 17 April  2019, the protocol No 7 on the privileges  and immunities of the EU annexed to the  Treaty on European Union and the Treaty  on the Functioning of the European Union  applies to the Agency and its staff.  The Greek Government and ENISA signed  a Seat Agreement on 13 November 2018,  which was ratified by Greek Law 4627/2019  on 25 September 2019 and entered into  force on 4 October 2019 and is applicable to  ENISA and its staff.  In accordance with Article 35 of Regulation  (EU) No 2019/881 of the European Parliament  and of the Council of 17 April 2019, the  protocol No 7 on the privileges and  immunities of the EU annexed to the Treaty  on European Union and the Treaty on the  Functioning of the European Union applies to  the Agency and its staff.  The Greek Government and ENISA signed a  Seat Agreement on 13 November 2018, which  was ratified by Greek Law 4627/2019 on 25  September 2019 and entered into force on 4  October 2019 and is applicable to ENISA and  its staff.  A public School  of European  Education, type  II, was founded in  2005 by the Greek  Government in  Heraklion, Crete,  for the children of  ENISA staff.  There is no  European School  operating in Athens.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 83  ANNEX Evaluations  ANNEX 9 EVALUATIONS  External consultants are contracted to carry out annual ex post evaluations of  operational activities. The scope of the evaluation focuses on ENISA’s operational  activities. The overall aim of the annual evaluations is to evaluate the effectiveness,  efficiency, coherence and relevance.  The consulted stakeholders generally agree that ENISA is the only entity that could  achieve such results, is seen as a key enabler of knowledge, experience and expertise,  and enables the creation of a strong cybersecurity community. The evaluation also  revealed that ENISA is perceived as a strong and credible partner at EU level and its  activities are seen as pertinent for Member States. The report therefore concludes on  an extremely positive note, acknowledging the added value of ENISA’s activities for the  whole EU.  The ex ante evaluation included desk research and interviews with key ENISA  stakeholders. It concluded that given the restructuring of the 2021–2023 programming  document, the structure of ENISA’s SPD would not require any changes, but it was  recommended that certain outputs should be strengthened with a specific focus on the  following areas:  a proactive shaping of the political agenda;  developing a transversal focus on digital strategic autonomy and its implications  for cybersecurity;  reinforcing the cooperative response by an insight-driven approach;  focusing on stakeholder management, awareness raising and activities  targeting industry.  ENISA uses an internal monitoring system that is intended to support the project  management function, which includes the project delivery and resources allocation. The  regular reporting and the ENISA management team use this information for managerial  purposes. Moreover, ENISA has implemented a mid-term review procedure and regular  weekly management team meetings. ENISA has undertaken a study to upgrade the use  of electronic tools in the internal project management and overall delivery of the Agency  work programme.  84  ANNEX Strategy for organisational management and internal control systems  ANNEX 10 STRATEGY FOR  ORGANISATIONAL  MANAGEMENT  AND INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  The Agency’s strategy for an effective internal control system is based on international  best practices and on the internal control framework (the committee of sponsoring  organization framework’s international standards).  The control environment is the set of standards of conduct, processes and structures  that provide the basis for carrying out internal control across ENISA. The Management  Team set the tone from the outset with respect to the importance of the internal control,  including expected standards of conduct.  Risk assessment is the Agency’s dynamic and iterative process for identifying and  assessing risks that could affect the achievement of objectives, and for determining how  such risks should be managed.  The control activities ensure the mitigation of risks related to the achievement of  policy, operational and internal control objectives. They are performed at all levels of  the organisation, at various stages of business processes and across the technology  environment. They may be preventive or detective, and encompass a range of manual  and automated activities as well as segregation of duties.  Information is necessary for the organisation to carry out internal control and to support  the achievement of its objectives. In this respect, it is necessary to consider external and  internal communication. External communication provides specific Agency stakeholders  and, more widely, EU citizens with information on ENISA’s policy, objectives, actions and  achievements. Internal communication provides ENISA staff with the information required  to support the achievement of objectives and the awareness for day-to-day controls.  Continuous and specific assessments are used to ascertain whether each of the five  components of internal control are present and functioning. Continuous assessments,  built into business processes at different levels of the organisation, provide timely  information on any deficiencies. Findings are assessed and deficiencies are communicated  and corrected in a timely manner, with serious matters reported as appropriate.  The Common Approach on EU Decentralised Agencies foresees that EU agencies should  be more active concerning fraud prevention issues and that the related communication  forms an essential part of its success. In order to implement this, the European Anti- Fraud Office recommended that each agency should adopt an anti-fraud strategy that is  proportionate to its fraud risks. Rules for the prevention and management of conflicts of  interest are part of the anti-fraud strategy of the Agency.

The CSA also refers to specific international  organisations (e.g. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  (OECD), Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)) that ENISA is called to develop relations  with (see recital 43).  1.3.  Since the entry into force of the CSA, ENISA’s exposure to partners outside the EU  has increased both quantitatively and qualitatively57. ENISA is also often approached  by third countries directly with high expectations of mutual collaboration, and is  confronted each time on how best to react. Such welcomed developments call for  a more strategic approach to the international dimension of ENISA’s work in order  to guide the engagement of the Agency with third country partners, as well to direct  Agency’s response to third country partners seeking cooperation with ENISA.  1.4.  This international strategy covers the cooperation with international organisations  and with non-EU countries. However, for those non-EU countries or regions with  which the EU has special agreements this international strategy should be read in  the light of such agreements, looking at where a closer cooperation in the area of  cybersecurity is foreseen.  56 Chapter II of Title II of the CSA covers all tasks of ENISA and thus outlines areas in which ENISA  is competent. 57 The expectations of various actors inside the EU institutions and of Member States for ENISA to engage  more actively internationally have increased, as was stressed in the bilateral interviews undertaken by ENISA  in spring 2021. This was also confirmed in the internal survey carried out by ENISA in early 2021.  88  2. ENISA’S OVERALL INTERNATIONAL APPROACH  The directions and provisions in this strategy will not in any way limit or hamper the  provisions laid out by Article 12 of the CSA.  The mandate of the Agency is to achieve ‘a high common level of cybersecurity across the  Union, including by actively supporting Member States, Union institutions, bodies, offices  and agencies in improving cybersecurity’. Under this mandate, ENISA’s strategic aim is to  build a trusted and cybersecure Europe. ENISA’s international strategy must therefore be  at the service of the Union, advance the achievement of the Agency’s mandate within the  Union and contribute to its strategy58.  This underlying premise directs the Agency to be selective in engaging with  international partners and to limit its overall approach in international cooperation  to only those areas and activities that will have high and measurable added value in  achieving the Agency’s strategic objectives.  International cooperation should be resourced prudently and proportionally. This  strategy outlines three approaches that the Agency can use in terms of level of  commitment of resources: the limited, assisting and outreach approaches.  2.1. Limited approach  ENISA’s default international approach is ‘limited’. Under this approach, ENISA will,  in line with its objectives enshrined in Article 4 of the CSA, exchange information with  relevant international partners on an ad hoc basis59, to strengthen and develop its  expertise and anticipate changes prompted by global developments in cybersecurity.  It will seek to promote the Union’s values and to advance its strategic objectives  and cybersecurity policies when engaging with international partners in meetings,  conferences and seminars. ENISA will not commit dedicated resources to pursue this  approach beyond mission or conference costs.  2.2. Assisting approach  In line with its mandate to ‘actively support Member States, Union institutions, bodies,  offices and agencies in improving cybersecurity’ (Article 3(1) of the CSA), ENISA may  respond to requests for assistance – when the request is deemed to add significant value  to a specific strategic objective and is in line with the Union’s policies – namely from  third countries and international organisations with which the Union has agreements  or frameworks that promote specific or general cooperation in cybersecurity. Under  this approach, ENISA may exchange and share expertise, contribute to organising  training sessions and exercises, support the Commission/EU in building and maintaining  cybersecurity dialogues and support individual cybersecurity activities with international  partners organised by the requester. To respond to such requests, ENISA might use  resources dedicated to specific strategic objectives as set out in its single programming  document (SPD).  58 ENISA (2020), A Trusted and Cyber Secure Europe – ENISA strategy (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/ publications/corporate-documents/enisa-strategy-a-trusted-and-cyber-secure-europe). 59 For principles that govern selecting and engaging with international partners, please see Section 3 of this  annex: ‘Principles governing ENISA’s international approach’.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 89  2.3. Outreach approach  ENISA may follow an ‘outreach’ approach for specific aims and provisions of the strategic  objectives outlined in this strategy, to proactively engage with specific international  partners to be able to advance the Agency’s strategic objectives and fulfil the objectives of  the CSA. Under this approach, ENISA may plan dedicated resources in its SPD in pursuit  of this approach.  3. PRINCIPLES GOVERNING ENISA’S INTERNATIONAL APPROACH  1. ENISA will focus its international cooperation on partners with which the Union has strategic economic relationships and which share the Union’s values.  2. When cooperation in cybersecurity between the Union and an international partner is explicitly stated in an agreement, ENISA may follow an outreach approach, respecting the limits of the agreement provisions.  3. Beyond specific provisions outlined under Section 4 of this annex, ‘Specific aims and provisions under individual strategic objectives’, ENISA can, when relevant, pursue an outreach approach across all of its strategic objectives with European Economic Area countries.  4. ENISA will refrain from engaging with international actors if contacts or cooperation with  such actors would be deemed incompatible with the Union’s interests or policy goals.  5. The Agency’s international cooperation activities should align with and add value to the partnerships of Member States.  6. When responding to requests under the assisting approach not explicitly covered in this strategy, and where otherwise appropriate, ENISA will consult and coordinate with the European External Action Service and the Commission, to ensure that the Agency’s international engagement is in line with the Union’s policy goals. ENISA will notify the Executive Board of requests under an assisting approach and those under an outreach approach. ENISA will furthermore ensure that its outreach activities are in line with the Union’s policies by regularly consulting with the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology.  7. In its SPD, ENISA will proportionally evaluate the resources needed for involvement in any international activities with an assisting or outreach approach.  8. ENISA will seek endorsement of the Executive Board prior to developing cooperation frameworks or agreements with international organisations and third countries. When such agreements place financial or legal obligations on the Agency, they must be approved by the Management Board.  9. In its annual activity report, ENISA will outline all international activities it has pursued under different approaches. In particular, it will evaluate and provide assessment of the added value of international activities under an assisting or outreach approach in pursuit of its strategic objectives.  10. The Agency should be able to react in an agile manner while adhering to these principles.  ANNEX International strategy of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity  90  4. SPECIFIC AIMS AND PROVISIONS UNDER INDIVIDUAL  STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES  4.1. Strategic objective ‘Empowered and engaged communities  across the cybersecurity ecosystem’  ENISA exchanges best practices and expertise and promotes international activities to  enhance the cybersecurity awareness and education of the various communities of the  Union. Furthermore:  using the assisting approach, ENISA can give support in terms of expertise to the  Western Balkans as a region and/or single countries of the region and to countries  belonging to the European Eastern Partnership as a region and/or single countries of  the region;  using the outreach approach, and with the endorsement of the Management Board,  ENISA can cooperate with third countries with which there are specific EU agreements  to enhance mutual cybersecurity awareness and education in line with the respective  specific provisions of such agreements.  4.2. Strategic objective ‘Cybersecurity as an integral part  of EU policies’  ENISA collects and exchanges information on best practices in cybersecurity policy  development and implementation internationally and promotes the projection of EU  cybersecurity policies to the benefit of the Union. ENISA’s connections with international  organisations working on digital security can both contribute to the promotion of EU  acquis in this field and feed into EU cybersecurity policy development. Furthermore:  using the assisting approach, ENISA can support Union representatives of relevant  international organisations and regulatory forums by providing expertise on  cybersecurity policies and cybersecurity aspects of Union legislation as outlined under  Article 5 of the CSA;  using the assisting approach, ENISA can provide expertise on cybersecurity policy  implementation to the Western Balkans and Eastern Partnership countries;  using the outreach approach, ENISA can cooperate with the OECD (and like-minded  countries such as the Unites States) on mapping and promoting best practices in  integrating cybersecurity into various policy domains.  4.3. Strategic objective ‘Effective cooperation among operational  actors within the union in case of massive cyber incidents’  ENISA’s international cooperation should assist and contribute to the Union’s incident  response and crisis management, in particular by building a trusted network of like- minded international partners – including major global cybersecurity companies and  vendors – to contribute to the Union’s common situational awareness and preparedness.  Furthermore, ENISA – in line with recital 43 of the CSA and using the outreach approach –  can contribute to this by cooperating with international partners such as the OSCE and  NATO on joint incident response coordination60.  60 Those activities are to be carried out in full respect of the principles of inclusiveness, reciprocity and  the decision-making autonomy of the Union, without prejudice to the specific character of the security and  defence policy of any Member State.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 91  4.4. Strategic objective ‘Cutting-edge competences and capabilities  in cybersecurity across the Union’  ENISA will seek to reach out to international partners to exchange information and best  practices in order to enhance and develop cybersecurity competences and capabilities  within the Union. Where appropriate, it can participate as an observer in the organisation  of international cybersecurity exercises in line with Article 12 of the CSA. Furthermore:  using the assisting approach, ENISA can contribute to building competences and  capabilities in the Western Balkans as a region and/or single countries by supporting  training and exercises;  using the assisting approach, ENISA can support, with relevant expertise, countries  belonging to the Eastern Partnership as a region and/or single countries of the region  or countries benefiting from the Union’s development programmes;  in line with recital 43 of the CSA and using the assisting approach, ENISA can  contribute to the organisation of joint cybersecurity exercises with the OECD, the  OSCE and NATO;  under the outreach approach, ENISA can organise international cybersecurity  challenges to promote and enhance the competitiveness of cybersecurity  competences in the Union;  using the outreach approach, and with the endorsement of the Management Board,  ENISA can cooperate with third countries with which there are specific EU agreements  to build and enhance mutual cybersecurity capacities in line with the respective  specific provisions of such agreements.  4.5. Strategic objective ‘A high level of trust in secure digital solutions’  Without prejudice to possible tasks stemming from Article 12(d) of the CSA, ENISA will  seek to advance its expertise and monitor international developments in cybersecurity  certification and related standardisation areas, also in line with Article 54 of the CSA61. It  will engage with international actors on the supply and demand sides of the cybersecurity  market to promote and advance European digital autonomy. Furthermore:  using the outreach approach, ENISA will engage with the relevant key strategic  economic partners of the Union to promote the EU’s cybersecurity certification  schemes or candidate schemes;  using the outreach approach, and in line with recital 23 of the CSA, ENISA will support  the global development and maintenance of standards that underpin the public core  of the open internet and the stability and security of its functioning.  4.6. strategic objective ‘Foresight on emerging and future  cybersecurity challenges’  ENISA aims to exchange information on an ad hoc basis and participate in international  forums to increase its expertise in international developments and map global  cybersecurity threats as well as research areas and innovation trends that could address  emerging challenges.  61 Article 54 (elements of European cybersecurity certification schemes) of the CSA states that ‘A European  cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements: […] (c) references to the  international, European or national standards applied in the evaluation or, where such standards are  not available or appropriate, to technical specifications that meet the requirements set out in Annex II  to Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 or, if such specifications are not available, to technical specifications or  other cybersecurity requirements defined in the European cybersecurity certification scheme; […] (o) the  identification of national or international cybersecurity certification schemes covering the same type or  categories of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes, security requirements, evaluation criteria and  methods, and assurance levels.’  ANNEX International strategy of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity  92  4.7. Strategic objective ‘Efficient and effective cybersecurity  information and knowledge management for Europe’  ENISA aims to gain a better overview and understanding of the international  cybersecurity landscape and ensure that relevant cybersecurity information and  knowledge generated internationally is shared and expanded within the EU cybersecurity  ecosystem. ENISA will focus its outreach to partners deemed like-minded (e.g. Japan).  Furthermore:  using the outreach approach, ENISA will cooperate with the OECD and NATO in  exchanging expertise for the development of cybersecurity indices and benchmarks;  using the outreach approach, and with the endorsement of the Management Board,  ENISA will cooperate with third countries with which there are specific EU agreements  to enhance mutual knowledge and information in line with the respective specific  provisions of such agreements.  ENISA SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2022–2024 93  ANNEX Annual cooperation plan 2022  ANNEX 13 ANNUAL  COOPERATION  PLAN 2022  This document is the draft 2022 annual cooperation plan for ENISA and CERT-EU, as  foreseen in the co-signed MoU.  The plan aims to cover the cooperation activities planned for 2022.  The plan proposed in this document includes references to the activities included in the  2022 ENISA work programme, which has been submitted to the Management Board  for approval.  In that regard, and because CERT-EU is in the process of drafting its annual programme  for 2022, this plan should not be considered final.  In line with the 2021 annual cooperation plan, the proposed plan identifies actions in the  following areas:  capacity building, as referred to in Articles 6(c) and 6(i) of the CSA;  operational cooperation, as referred to in Article 7 of the CSA;  long-term strategic analyses of cyber threats, as foreseen in Article 9(b) of the CSA.  94  1. CAPACITY BUILDING  Capacity building62 covers assistance to relevant public bodies to improve capabilities  to respond to cyber threats and incidents as well as provision of cybersecurity training.  Focus points of capacity building for the structured cooperation plan for 2022 remain  maturity, training and exercises.  1.1. Maturity  Maturity assessments are useful means to identify current abilities and also existing gaps  that require reinforcement of an organisation’s capabilities and to guide its efforts to  improve its overall cybersecurity posture by achieving higher maturity levels over time.  In 2021, drawing on CERT-EU’s and other CSIRTs Network and EU institutions’, bodies’  and agencies’ stakeholders’ experience and expertise, ENISA performed maturity-related  activities targeting the CSIRTs Network to improve its members’ capabilities for handling  cyber incidents and EU institutions’, bodies’ and agencies’ Blueprint63 actors to assess  their EU-level crisis management capabilities. This work is expected to result64 in a new  and updated methodology for performing maturity assessments.  In parallel, and with the help of ENISA, CERT-EU started developing a cybersecurity  maturity assessment methodology for all EU institutions, bodies and agencies, in the  context of the European Commission’s upcoming proposal for a regulation on common  binding cybersecurity rules for all EU institutions, bodies and agencies.  The plan for 2022 will focus on continuing the activities started in 2021, in particular  the following.  EU institutions’, bodies’ and agencies’ cyber hygiene. CERT-EU will lead the  activities of finalising the proposal for common binding cybersecurity rules regulation  for all EU institutions, bodies and agencies and develop a cybersecurity maturity  assessment methodology for all EU institutions, bodies and agencies.  CSIRT maturity. ENISA will finalise the new proposed maturity framework for  the CSIRTs Network and the maturity assessment methodology for EU-level crisis  management. ENISA will foster the application of the methodologies to relevant  subjects to help identify current abilities and gaps.  CERT-EU and ENISA will maintain close contact throughout the process to ensure their  maturity-related activities complement each other in the most efficient way, avoiding  duplication and misalignment.  62 As referred to in Articles 6(c) and 6(i) of the CSA. 63 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2017/1584 (Blueprint). 64 According to the 2021 annual cooperation plan, the work will be concluded by the end of 2021.

This close cooperation will continue in 2022 and will be enhanced  to the benefit of the cybersecurity community.  The proposed cooperation for 2022 will continue to combine CERT-EU’s and ENISA’s  strengths to lay the basis for developing a relevant, cost-efficient training portfolio that  supports cybersecurity capacity building but also operational cooperation. The ambition  of the cooperation is for ENISA to be able to provide a state-of-the-art training portfolio  that will be offered to Member States and EU institutions, bodies and agencies and to  keep it up to date and relevant through close collaboration with CERT-EU and other  key stakeholders.  Working methods already developed in 2021 will continue throughout 2022, with  structured cooperation building on those (e.g. ENISA hosting CERT-EU training material  and CERT-EU collaborating with ENISA when determining topics for working group  training sessions).  The focus of 2022 will be to sustain ongoing activities (i.e. cyber exercises regularly  organised by ENISA) and finalising activities started in 2021, particularly the following.  Custom technical courses. Building on the activity in 2021, ENISA will work with  CERT-EU and the CSIRTs Network Training Working Group to enhance training  programmes based on audience knowledge level (e.g. elementary versus advanced).  Technical specialised workshop for CERT-EU constituents. CERT-EU will further  develop technical specialised workshops, leveraging, where relevant, the experience  and working practice of ENISA.  Regular ENISA cybersecurity exercises. This is an ongoing activity led by ENISA that  materialises in several types of exercises involving different stakeholders. Through  the structured cooperation, CERT-EU will be involved not only as a participant in  relevant exercises, but also as a planner for selected exercises (e.g. Cyber Europe).  ANNEX Annual cooperation plan 2022  96  Joint exercises. When relevant and in reference to the structured operational  cooperation, ENISA and CERT-EU will join forces by participating in exercises alongside  planners and a training audience. In addition, common operational activities (e.g. joint  rapid reports) will be evaluated through these occasions.  Objective Task Deliverable Lead 2022 work  programme  1.

OPERATIONAL COOPERATION  2.1. Blueprint  As part of the efforts to further develop the Blueprint, both ENISA and CERT-EU will align  actions on developing SOPs and improving common situational awareness.  The target for 2022 is to further expand on the cooperation activities started with the  2021 annual cooperation plan. In particular, the 2022 plan will still have SOPs and  common situational awareness as key objectives of the cooperation.  Joint SOP for Blueprint stakeholders. ENISA will continue leading at the operational  layer whereas CERT-EU will continue leading at the technical level of the Blueprint.  With the joint SOP document expected to be finalised during 2021, ENISA and CERT- EU will focus on further improving the SOP and testing the EU institutions’, bodies’  and agencies’ SOPs through exercises.  Security incident response – continuous improvement. CERT-EU will leverage  the work on SOPs, lessons learnt in significant incidents and proceedings on the  information exchange domain with ENISA and other Blueprint stakeholders to review  and update its technical SOPs – security incident response process.  Common situational awareness. As a result of the 2021 activities, both  organisations have worked towards the establishment of a mechanism for  information exchange at EU level, and set the stage for joint reports to raise  awareness of significant cybersecurity events (65). Within the 2022 activity, ENISA and  CERT-EU will further operationalise the mechanism, seeking additional opportunity  for joint reports and using exercises to enhance the production of situational  awareness deliverables.  65 Cybersecurity events or incidents significantly affecting or potentially significantly affecting EU Member  States, critical sectors within the meaning of the NISD or ICT technologies, services, platforms or ICT  infrastructures widely applied and used across the internal market.

In 2021, ENISA worked on establishing a mechanism supporting such assistance,  including the development of necessary processes and procedures as well as the basis  for a pool of experts. A similar mechanism has been established for EU institutions,  bodies and agencies under the lead of CERT-EU, building on the major attacks paper  (TF 03 18). This is combined with the aforementioned revision of the security incident  response process.  The 2022 proposed plan aligns with the work done in 2021, and focuses on further  enhancement and operationalisation of the provided mechanisms, in particular the  following.  Cybersecurity assistance mechanism. ENISA will continue focusing on the  operationalisation of the assistance mechanism, by ensuring the adoption and  endorsement of the mechanism by all involved actors, testing the mechanism in  cooperation with Member States and further enhancing the effectiveness of the  mechanism’s SOPs.  Operational capability to assist EU institutions, bodies and agencies. CERT-EU will  continue managing the pool of experts and further enhance its operational capability.  66 This is still in draft and the final name of the deliverable and service may change.

KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SHARING  Knowledge and information sharing is a horizontal activity that nurtures and sustains the  previous two pillars (capacity building and operational cooperation), as well as receiving  input from them.  As outlined in Article 9(b) of the CSA, ENISA performs long-term strategic analyses  of cyber threats and incidents in order to identify emerging trends and help prevent  incidents. One of the activities in this field is the ENISA threat landscape, which provides  an overview of threats, together with current and emerging trends. It is based on publicly  available or voluntarily shared information and data, and provides an independent  view on observed threats, threat agents and threat trends. CERT-EU is an important  and structured contributor to the ENISA threat landscape and related activities and will  remain so in 2022.  ENISA is leading long-term strategic analyses also through maintaining and collaborating  with a working group of experts on foresight for emerging and future cybersecurity  challenges and the cyber threat landscape67. Those two groups were formalised in 2021.  In 2022, CERT-EU, through its inclusion as an observer in these ENISA working groups, will  contribute to, review and validate the findings and generally enhance the outputs of the  groups. These activities refer to Activity 8 of the 2022 ENISA work programme: knowledge  on emerging cybersecurity challenges and opportunities.  The long-term strategic analyses will feed into the capacity-building and operational  activities outlined in the previous sections.  67 ENISA Ad-Hoc Working Group on Foresight on Emerging and Future Cybersecurity Challenges and ENISA  Ad-Hoc Working Group on Cyber Threat Landscapes.

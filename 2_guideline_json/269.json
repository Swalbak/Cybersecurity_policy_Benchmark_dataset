Addressing cyber risks in the  railway sector can raise entirely new challenges for railway companies who often lack the  internal expertise, organisational structure, processes or the resources to effectively assess and  mitigate them.  The nature of railway operations and the interconnectedness of railway undertakings,  infrastructure managers, and the supply chain requires all involved parties to achieve and  maintain a baseline level of cybersecurity. European RUs and IMs use a combination of good  practices, approaches, and standards to perform cyber risk management for their organisations,  as they need to assess cyber risks for all functions and for both OT and IT. This report gathers  insights on these current practices in a single document and can assist railway undertakings  and infrastructure managers in their efforts to apply them. It provides examples of reference  material, such as available taxonomies of assets and services, threat taxonomies, seven  comprehensive threats scenarios, derived from real incidents, and available cyber risk mitigation  measures, derived by guidelines and standards.  This report aims to be a reference point for current good practices for cyber risk management  approaches that are applicable to the railway sector. It offers a guide for railway undertakings  and infrastructure managers to select, combine or adjust cyber risk management methods to the  needs of their organisation. It builds upon the 2020 ENISA report on cybersecurity in the railway  sector (ENISA, 2020), which assessed the level of implementation of cybersecurity measures in  the railway sector.  This report provides actionable guidelines, lists common challenges associated with the  performance of the relevant activities, and outlines good practices that can be readily adopted  and tailored by individual organisations. Additionally, a list of useful reference material is  available, together with practical examples and applicable standards.

INTRODUCTION  Directive 2016/1148 (NIS Directive) is the first legislative document focusing on cybersecurity in the EU. It identifies  Operators of Essential Services (OES) in the railway sector as:  Infrastructure managers (IM), as defined in point (2) of Article 3 of Directive 2012/34/EU, include: “any person or  firm responsible in particular for establishing, managing and maintaining railway infrastructure, including traffic  management and control-command and signalling. The functions of the infrastructure manager on a network or part  of a network may be allocated to different bodies or firms”.  Railway undertakings (RU), as defined in point (1) of Article 3 of Directive 2012/34/EU, include: “any public or  private undertaking licensed according to this Directive, the principal business of which is to provide services for the  transport of goods and/or passengers by rail with a requirement that the undertaking ensures traction. This also  includes undertakings which provide traction only”. This also includes operators of service facilities as defined in point  (12) of Article 3 of Directive 2012/34/EU as “any public or private entity responsible for managing one or more service  facilities or supplying one or more services to railway undertakings”.  The NIS Directive requires IMs and RUs to conduct risk assessments that “cover all operations including the security  and resilience of network and information systems”. According to the NIS Directive, these risk assessments, along  with the implementation of appropriate mitigation measures, should promote “a culture of risk management” to be  developed through “appropriate regulatory requirements and voluntary industry practices”. This need for cyber risk  management in the European railway sector was also identified as a key priority by the participants of the ENISA-  ERA conference “Cybersecurity in Railways”, which took place online on 16-17 March 2021 and brought together  more than 600 experts from railway organisations, policy, industry, research, standardisation, and certification.  While some EU Member States (MS) have issued relevant national guidance to OESs on how to conduct cyber risk  assessments, most railway operators choose to adopt one of the different methodologies introduced by industry  standards. Indeed, there are currently varying approaches to tackle risk in the railway sector and for now, there is no  single approach that covers both information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) cyber risks. This  document offers a guide to these different approaches, enabling railway operators to select, combine or adjust cyber  risk management methods to the needs of their organisation. It builds upon the 2020 ENISA report on cybersecurity  in the railway sector (ENISA, 2020), which assessed the level of implementation of cybersecurity measures in the  railway sector.  1.1 OBJECTIVES, SCOPE AND AUDIENCE  This report aims at providing railway stakeholders with applicable methods and practical examples on how to assess  and mitigate cyber risks. These good practices are gathered based on feedback from railway stakeholders and  include tools, such as assets and services list, threat scenarios, mapping of security measures. These resources can  be used as a base for cyber risk management for railway companies. The study aims at being a reference point to  promote collaboration between railway stakeholders across the EU and raise awareness of relevant threats.  This report is concerned with the European railway sector, and it covers cyber risk management applicable to both  the IT and OT systems of railway organisations. Other railway stakeholders such as rolling stock manufacturers and  component vendors are not considered in the scope of this report.  The primary target audience of this study includes people responsible for cybersecurity (CISOs, CIOs, CTOs, etc.)  within RUs and IM networks.  This report aims to provide them with the means to understand their cybersecurity  ecosystem, assess the risks to their assets or services and manage them via appropriate cybersecurity measures. In  addition, the National Competent Authorities, who may wish to develop guidance for railway operators in conducting  cyber risk management, may consult this document to understand the current practices in the sector and potential  challenges.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  7  1.2 METHODOLOGY  The report was created with cooperation of European IMs and RUs in an iterative process with multiple rounds of  validation as follows:  Step 1 - Definition of the project scope and identification of experts. The first step consisted of defining the  scope of the project and selecting subject matter experts whose input and insights could be considered for the  development of the report. The experts chosen are mainly RU and IM stakeholders in charge of cybersecurity, as well  as members of national and European agencies.  Step 2 - Desk research. During this step, extensive desk research for relevant documents in the context of the  project was conducted. The identified sources served as a reference to develop good practices, a list of assets and  threats, threat scenarios, and list of measures.  Step 3 - Series of workshops with selected subject matter experts. Four workshops were conducted to discuss  and validate the key findings of the study, namely the list of assets, list of threats, threats scenarios, and list of  measures. Additionally, the workshops were used as an opportunity to collect feedback on the challenges and good  practices of risk management in the railway sector. The 20 experts originated from 10 European railway companies  from Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden. The European Rail  Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ER-ISAC) was also represented in the experts’ pool.  Step 4 - Analysis of collected material and report development. The input collected from desk research and the  stakeholder workshops were analysed. Based on this analysis, the first draft of this report was developed.  Step 5 - Review and validation. The report was then validated by 24 experts (primarily RUs and IMs) from Belgium,  France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden, the ER-ISAC and the  UNIFE cybersecurity working group. The experts reviewed the report and provided comments and suggestions for  improvement. These were the basis for the final version of this document.  1.3 STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  The report is organised in 6 chapters:   Chapter 2 describes cyber risk management concepts and the current approaches identified for the railway  sector. It can help railway stakeholders to choose a risk management methodology.   Chapter 3 contains a list of railway assets and services (definitions and taxonomy), along with guidelines on  how to identify those assets and services. Railway stakeholders can use this information to build their own  list of assets and services.   Chapter 4 focuses on cyber threats, with a list of threats, their definitions and a list of risk scenarios  applicable to the railway sector. Stakeholders can use those tools to identify the main risks to their assets  and evaluate what should be prioritised for protection. The list of threats would be useful to conduct risk  assessments, along with the abovementioned list of assets and services.   Chapter 5 examines current cybersecurity measures based on EU guidelines (NIS Directive) and  international standards. It can help stakeholders to define a risk management plan.   Chapter 6 offers some concluding remarks.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  8  2. CYBER RISK  MANAGEMENT  The purpose of this chapter is to outline the risk management approaches that were used in the study and are  applicable to the railway sector. Many definitions and concepts exist, thus making it difficult to choose one that is  most relevant to the individual’s case. To ensure a common risk management frame, this document proposes a set of  definitions and principles extracted from ISO 31000:2018 “Risk management – Principles and guidelines”, ISO-IEC  27005:2018 “Information security risk management” and the ISO-IEC 62443 series.  The information security risk management process is the coordination of activities to direct and control an  organisation with regard to risk. It consists of context establishment, risk assessment, risk treatment, risk acceptance,  risk communication and risk monitoring and review. The information security risk management process can be  iterative for risk assessment and/or risk treatment activities. An iterative approach to conducting risk assessment can  increase the depth and detail of the assessment at each iteration. It also provides a good balance between  minimising the time and effort spent in identifying controls, while ensuring that strong risks are appropriately  assessed.  As mentioned in the ISO 31000 principles chapter, risk management is not a stand-alone activity that is separate from  the main activities and processes of the organisation. Risk management is part of the responsibilities of management  and an integral part of all organisational processes, including strategic planning and all project and change  management processes.  For terms and definitions, please consult ISO 31000:2018 “Risk management – Principles and guidelines”, ISO-IEC  27005:2018 “Information security risk management.  2.1 RISKS MANAGEMENT STEPS  ISO 27005:2015 defines a risk management process which integrates all necessary key activities to deploy a risk  management methodology.  Figure 1: Risk management  The first step of launching a risk management process is establishing the context, both external and internal. It  involves setting the basic criteria necessary for information security risk management (approach, risk evaluation  criteria, impact criteria and risk acceptance criteria), defining the scope and boundaries (ensuring that all relevant  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  9  assets are taken into account in the risk assessment), and establishing an appropriate organisation to manage the  information security risk management.  The second step is launching a risk assessment, i.e., quantifying or qualitatively describing risks and enabling  managers to prioritise them according to their perceived seriousness or other established criteria. The risk  assessment consists of three distinct tasks:   Risk identification, to determine what could happen to cause a potential loss and to gain insight into how,  where, and why the loss could occur.   Risk analysis, to understand the nature of the risk and to determine the level of risk. A risk analysis  methodology may be qualitative, quantitative, or a combination of both depending on the circumstances.   Risk evaluation, to compare the level of risks against risk evaluation criteria and risk acceptance criteria.  The purpose is to produce a list of risks prioritised according to risk evaluation criteria in relation to the  incident scenarios that lead to those risks.  The third step is the risk treatment, which consists of defining a list of controls to reduce, retain, avoid, or share the  risks. Then, a risk treatment plan can be defined. The risk treatment plan description will be elaborated in chapter 5 of  this present document.  The fourth step is risk acceptance, i.e., the decision to accept the risks and responsibilities for the decision. Finally,  a list of accepted risks with justification for those that do not meet the organisation’s normal risk acceptance criteria is  established.  The fifth step is the risk communication. Information about risks should be exchanged and/or shared between the  decision-maker and other stakeholders.  The final step is risk monitoring and review. It consists of the monitoring and reviewing the risks and the various  factors (i.e., value of assets, impacts, threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood of occurrence) that help to identify any  changes in the context of the organisation at an early stage, and to maintain an overview of all risks.  2.2 RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACHES FOR THE RAILWAY SECTOR  Workshops with relevant European railway sector stakeholders were conducted to identify the most common risk  management methods currently used by RUs and IMs. During these workshops, stakeholders indicated their chosen  methods. They are complemented or combined with other approaches to reach the desired level of sophistication and  to cover both IT and OT requirements for risk management. Their approaches are also linked to the overall enterprise  risk method used by the organisation and have to offer adequate level of compliance with both EU and national  cybersecurity requirements. For RUs and IMs operating in multiple EU Member States (MS), national requirements  under the NIS Directive may not be fully harmonised, so these organisations face additional challenges in  compliance. For all EU RUs and IMs to meet the cybersecurity requirements of their national competent authorities,  support is needed from the railway industry. RUs and IMs rely on their suppliers, both for more accurate threat and  vulnerability analyses, but especially for implementing cybersecurity requirements.  Indeed, existing approaches are multiple and varying across the railway companies, but they may present different  scope and level of detail in terms of analysis. For the risk management of railway IT systems, the most cited  approaches were the requirements of NIS Directive at a national level, the ISO 2700x family of standards, and  the NIST cybersecurity framework. For OT systems, the frameworks cited were ISA/IEC 62443, CLC/TS 50701,  and the recommendations of the Shift2Rail project X2Rail-3, or the ones from the CYRail Project. Those standards  or approaches are often used in a complementary way to adequately address both IT and OT systems. While IT  systems are normally evaluated with broader and more generic methods (such as ISO 2700x or NIS Directive), OT  systems need specific methods and frameworks that have been designed for industrial train systems. For instance,  the ISA/IEC 62443 standards are the most cited frameworks used for specific OT assets and risk identification, while  many contributors to this report stated they intend to use the recently released CLC/TS50701 in the future.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  10  Stakeholders that participated in this study indicated that they use a combination of the abovementioned international  and European approaches to tackle risk management, which they then complement with national frameworks and  methodologies. Examples include the Dutch A&K analysis1, the German BSI Risk Management Standard 200-32 and  the French E-BIOS Risk Manager method3. Moreover, other stakeholders designed their own modified versions of  methodologies based on existing frameworks.  The difference between standards’ completeness can also be tackled by building a bridge between the high-level  company risk assessment, and the lower application, or asset risk, assessment level. The generic framework and  standards can be used at a high level and the more technical or precise ones can be used at the applications and  assets level. The risks and measures issued at the end of each process are consolidated in a global risk mapping  and risk treatment plan.  A multitude of different approaches and methods have been recommended by national and international authorities  regarding cyber risk management. This next section analyses a sample of European and international good practices.  ISO 27001, 27002 and 27005 standards. The ISO 2700x family are among the most used and cited standards for  information security. ISO 27001 is the standard dedicated to establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually  improving an information security management system within the context of the organisation. ISO 27001 and 27002  contain a list of requirements to consider when implementing a risk treatment plan and will be studied in more detail  in chapter 5 of the present document. ISO 27005 is focused on risk management. It is the one selected in the present  document as a reference for defining the risk management principles presented above. According to CLC/TS 50701  (see below), ISO27K series can be applied to the business part of railway infrastructure, which primarily includes IT  systems.  NIS Directive Cooperation Group guidelines. In 2018, the NIS cooperation group4 issued a “reference document”  which provides a summary of the Group’s main findings on cybersecurity measures for OESs (NIS Cooperation  Group, 2018). The reference document primarily covers the risk treatment phase of risk management. It does not  establish a new standard nor duplicate existing ones (e.g., ISO) but provides MS with a clear and structured picture of  their current and often common approaches to the security measures of OESs. Beyond OESs, this reference  document may be considered useful by other public or private actors looking to improve their cybersecurity. As it  focuses on security measures, it will be studied in more detail in chapter 5.  ISA/IEC 62443 standards. The ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards provides a framework to address and mitigate  security vulnerabilities in industrial automation and control systems (IACS). They described both technical and  process-related aspects of industrial cybersecurity and provide a risk management approach, especially for OT  systems, which can be applied to OT used in the railway sector. In particular, the ISA/IEC 62443-3-2, “Security Risk  Assessment, System Partitioning and Security Levels” standard defines a set of engineering measures to guide  organisations through the process of assessing the risk of a particular IACS and identifying and applying security  countermeasures to reduce that risk to tolerable levels. A key concept is the application of IACS security zones and  conduits, which were introduced in ISA/IEC 62443-1-1, Concepts and Models. The standard provides a basis for  1 The method Afhankelijkheids- en Kwetsbaarheidsanalyse (A&K analysis) was developed in draft form by the Dutch public company RCC. The Dutch  Ministry of Internal Affairs completed its development in 1996 and published a handbook describing the method. The method has not been updated  since that time. The A&K analysis is the unique and preferred method for risk analysis by Dutch government bodies since 1994. In addition to the  Dutch government, Dutch companies often use A&K analysis.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-ra- methods/m_dutch_ak_analysis.html  2 With the BSI Standard 200-3, the BSI provides an easy-to-apply and recognised procedure which allows organisations adequate and targeted control  of their information security risks. The procedure is based on the elementary threats described in the IT-Grundschutz Compendium on the basis of  which the IT-Grundschutz-modules were drawn up.  https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Grundschutz/International/bsi-standard- 2003_en_pdf.html;jsessionid=A26D9630FC3E530CDEECEACC00297837.internet461?nn=128620  3 EBIOS Risk Manager (EBIOS RM) is the method for assessing and treating digital risks, published by National Cybersecurity Agency of France  (ANSSI) with the support of Club EBIOS. It provides a toolbox that can be adapted, the use of which varies according to the objective of the project.  EBIOS Risk Manager is compatible with the reference standards in effect, in terms of risk management as well as in terms of cybersecurity.  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/guide/ebios-risk-manager-the-method/  4 The NIS Cooperation  Group is composed  of  representatives  of  Member  States,  the Commission, and ENISA, has been established under  the NIS Directive. It facilitates strategic cooperation  between  the  Member  States  regarding  the  security  of  network  and information systems.  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-cooperation-group  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-ra-methods/m_dutch_ak_analysis.html https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-ra-methods/m_dutch_ak_analysis.html https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Grundschutz/International/bsi-standard-2003_en_pdf.html;jsessionid=A26D9630FC3E530CDEECEACC00297837.internet461?nn=128620 https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Grundschutz/International/bsi-standard-2003_en_pdf.html;jsessionid=A26D9630FC3E530CDEECEACC00297837.internet461?nn=128620 https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/guide/ebios-risk-manager-the-method/ https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-cooperation-group  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  11  specifying security countermeasures by aligning the identified target security level with the required security level  capabilities set forth in ISA/IEC 62443‑3‑3, System Security Requirements and Security Levels.  CLC/TS 50701. Following this standard, the Technical Specification 50701 was issued (CLC/TS 50701, 2021). This  European Technical Specification applies ISA/IEC 62443 to the railway sector. It applies to the communications,  signalling, processing, rolling stock and fixed installations domains. It provides references to models and concepts  from which requirements and recommendations can be derived and which are suitable to ensure that the residual risk  from security threats is identified, supervised, and managed to an acceptable level by the railway system duty holder.  CLC/TS 50701 can be used to define a list of OT components for the railway sector, and to build a list of OT-specific  security measures.  Shift2Rail Risk Assessment Methods (projects X2Rail-1 and X2Rail-3). Shift2Rail proposes a risk assessment  based on IEC 62443-3-2 (X2Rail-1, 2019; X2Rail-3, 2020). It proposes a common railway framework, which includes:   Attacker landscape dedicated to railway   Threat landscape dedicated to railway based on (ISO 27005, ENISA’s 2016 Threat Taxonomy 2016 and  BSI: Threats Catalogue)   Impact matrix   Approach for high-level risk assessment and estimation of the security level targets based on the STRIDE  threat classification   Process for detailed risk assessment.  Based on this common approach, Shift2Rail performed a risk assessment of a generic railway signalling system  compliant with the IEC 62443 and proposed target security levels for the different identified zones. X2Rail-3 proposed  a Simplified Risk assessment approach in 2020 (X2Rail-3, 2020) which consists of the following workflow:  1. Description of the zone under assessment  2. Division of the assessment into six STRIDE threat domains5  3. Estimation of likelihood and impact  4. Risk computation  5. Security level mapping to risk level  6. Foundational Requirements6 security level mapping to six STRIDE threat domains security levels  CYRail recommendations on cybersecurity of rail signalling and communication systems. The EU-funded  project CYRail7 issued a guide published in September 2018 (Cyrail, 2018). This guide provides an analysis of  threats targeting railway infrastructures, in addition to the development of attack detection and alerting techniques,  mitigation plans and Protection Profiles for railway control and signalling applications to ensure security by design of  new rail infrastructures. It relies on the IEC62443 standard. The security assessment consists of the following 5  steps:   Identification of the system under consideration (SUC)   Performing a high-level cybersecurity risk assessment to identify the worst-case risks   Partition of the SUC into zones and conduits and definition of the vulnerabilities   Realisation of detailed risk assessment in each zone and conduit in 10 steps (identify threats, identify  vulnerabilities, determine consequence and impact, determine unmitigated likelihood, calculate unmitigated  5 The STRIDE model is a model of threats developed by Microsoft to identify computers security threats, as the first step in a proactive security  analysis process. The next steps in the process are identifying the vulnerabilities in the implementation and then taking measures to close security  gaps.  STRIDE model defines a threat as any potential occurrence, malicious or otherwise, that can have an undesirable effect on the system  resources. STRIDE stands for 6 main threats: Spoofing of user identity, Tampering with data, Repudiability, Information disclosure (privacy breach),  Denial of Service (DoS) and Elevation of privilege. Vulnerability is an unfortunate characteristic that makes it possible for a threat to occur. An attack is  an action taken by a malicious intruder to exploit certain vulnerabilities to enact the threat. It was created to be applied to a specific system or during  the development of a product; therefore, it is less relevant at a company level, as it does not encompass the whole risk management process.  Nevertheless, it can be used with a more global methodology when defining the threats.  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2006/november/uncover-security-design-flaws-using-the-stride-approach  6 According to IEC62443, security capabilities are organised according to seven Foundational requirements (FR1 Identification and Authentication  Control, FR2 – Use Control, FR3 - System Integrity, FR4 – Data Confidentiality, FR5 – Restricted Data Flow, FR6 – Timely Response to Events, and  FR7 – Resource Availability.  7 https://cyrail.eu/about-cyrail-project-1  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2006/november/uncover-security-design-flaws-using-the-stride-approach https://cyrail.eu/about-cyrail-project-1  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  12  cyber security risk, determine security level target, identify and evaluate existing countermeasures, revaluate  likelihood and impact, calculate residual risk, document and communicate results)   Documentation of the process  This guide is useful to conduct risk analysis within the railway sector, particularly on control and signalling  applications, using the IEC62443 standard.  EULYNX, RCA, and OCORA approach. EULYNX is a European initiative led by 13 IMs to standardise interfaces  and elements of signalling systems. EULYNX Reference Architecture defines the complete EULYNX system,  describing the overall architecture, cross-cutting architectural concepts, and all generic functions of the system.  Baseline Set 3 was completed in 20208.  RCA stands for Reference Control, Command & Signalling (CCS) Architecture. It is an initiative led by members of  the ERTMS Users Group (EUG) and EULYNX to define a harmonised architecture for the future railway CCS, with  the main goal of substantially increasing the performance/total cost of ownership (TCO) ratio of CCS. The RCA  Baseline Set 0 Release 1 was updated with the Cyber Security guidelines created by OCORA, RCA and EULYNX. It  defines a risk assessment process taking IEC 62443 and CLC/TS 50701 as security standards and gives an example  on how to apply it to trackside CCS.  The following process is defined:   Definition of system under consideration   Initial zoning concept based on risk assessment   Definition of attacker types   Evaluation of the attackers, strength, motivation   Supplementation of threats   Sorting of threats into foundational requirements   Definition of the initial security level per threat   Entering the foundational requirement value into the vector of the preliminary zone   Application of reduction factors to determine the final security level   Application of the measures according to IEC62443  The focus of RCA is on the architecture of the CCS trackside. There is a similar initiative, named OCORA, which  addresses the architecture of the CCS on-board side9. It is a joint initiative by 5 European railway companies10 which  has been set up to define the architecture and interfaces for the next generation of on-board European Train Control  System (ETCS) systems.  UIC Guidelines for Cyber-Security in Railways. In 2018, the UIC ARGUS WG decided to produce an enforced  document to provide specific guidance to the ‘Railway’ (UIC, 2018). This guidance document is designed to support  the rail industry in reducing its vulnerability to cyber-attacks and to ensure availability, integrity, confidentiality of  railway systems and data at all times. The document has a particular but not exclusive focus on signalling and  telecommunication within railway. The document is based on the ISO 27001 and 27002 standards and offers  guidance specific to railway. It also describes common risk management steps such as: establishment of the security  context, assets identification (primary and supporting), impact analysis (supported by operational impact scenarios),  threat identification, selection of applicable threat scenarios, estimation of risk level for each applicable threat  scenario based on the likelihood and the impact of those threat scenario, selection of risk treatment options, and  selection of a list of additional controls.  8 https://www.eulynx.eu/index.php/documents/published-documents/open-availability/baseline-set-3/257-20200623-eulynx-documentation-plan-eu-doc- 11-v3-4-0-a/file  9 https://github.com/OCORA-Public  10 Deutsche Bahn (DB), Société nationale des chemins de fer français (SNCF), Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS), Österreichische Bundesbahnen (ÖBB)  and Schweizerische Bundesbahnen (SBB  https://www.eulynx.eu/index.php/documents/published-documents/open-availability/baseline-set-3/257-20200623-eulynx-documentation-plan-eu-doc-11-v3-4-0-a/file https://www.eulynx.eu/index.php/documents/published-documents/open-availability/baseline-set-3/257-20200623-eulynx-documentation-plan-eu-doc-11-v3-4-0-a/file https://github.com/OCORA-Public  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  13  3. RAILWAY ASSETS  AND SERVICES  For RUs and IMs to manage cyber risks, it is crucial that they identify their railway assets and services that need to  be protected. The railway sector is composed of multiple stakeholders who are responsible for their own  infrastructure, assets and services, but they are strongly interconnected and interact with one another to deliver  services. These interactions complicate risk assessment, because interdependencies between external stakeholders  or suppliers must be considered in the analysis. The list resulting from this identification of assets and services should  contain services the stakeholders have to deliver, and assets, such as devices, physical infrastructure, people and  data needed to support these services.  In addition, stakeholders may develop indicators to assess cyber risk impact on the availability, integrity and  confidentiality of these assets and services (e.g., number of users affected, economic impact, environmental impact,  recovery time objectives, etc.).  Eight essential high-level railway services have been considered during the 2020 ENISA study (ENISA, 2020):   Operating traffic on the network   Ensuring the safety and security of passengers and/or goods   Maintaining railway infrastructure and/or trains   Managing invoicing and finance (billing)   Planning operations and booking resources   Information for passengers and customers about operations   Carrying goods and/or passengers   Selling and distributing tickets.  Railway stakeholders can use various taxonomies as the basis to identify their key cyber-related assets and services  and adapt it to their own operational environment. Based on the desk research and information collected during the  workshops, the key point is to maintain an asset inventory for cyber-related assets. Assets should be identified and  registered in the asset inventory based on the system they relate to, the service they support and the information they  handle. As mentioned, interdependencies between systems and third-party hardware and software, vendors, or other  stakeholders must be considered. They should be identified in the specifications of technical interface (and/or data  exchange) requirements. Finally, the department/division responsible for cybersecurity should be included in  procurement contract review and implementation to ensure cybersecurity is addressed.  The identification of all interdependencies of the systems can be a real challenge. This is the case for external  dependencies, but also for internal dependencies. Specifically, IT and OT interdependencies are complex because  their boundaries are increasingly blurring, and OT and IT have different levels of maturity in terms of cybersecurity.  Maintaining an exhaustive inventory is complex as systems are evolving fast, and the digitalisation of all processes is  adding more and more systems that must be considered. This is exacerbated by the fact that the people responsible  for the inventory often are unaware knowledge of all the assets and rely on systems engineers or security experts of  the asset owner to maintain the inventory. Third-party-managed systems are also complicated to integrate in internal  inventories due to this mix of responsibilities. To support this inventory, automated tools for asset management  (identification, logging and monitoring) can be deployed, but the deployment of such tools requires strong interactions  with systems that don’t always support such interactions. For asset identification, IT/OT asset discovery tools can be  deployed, but care needs to be taken during their configuration so as not to affect the performance of systems.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  14  3.1 TAXONOMY  To help RUs and IMs choose which assets and services to include in their risk assessment, a comprehensive list has  been compiled. It is based on the systems’ list described in the ENISA Report - Railway Cybersecurity of 202011.  It has been constructed from existing literature, validated during interviews with railway stakeholders in 2020, and  enriched based on the feedback received during the 2021 workshops. It gives a robust and high-level overview of  railway assets, with relevant categories.  Other, more detailed taxonomies exist in the sector and have been reviewed in order to complement and align  (especially for the names and associated descriptions) this list with approaches on asset taxonomies, such as X2Rail  Deliverables12, RCA-OCORA-Eulynx Security Guideline13 and TS50701. Indeed, RCA, OCORA, and Eulynx have  created comprehensive asset architecture models specific to OT systems (on-board and trackside systems). They  present assets at a more detailed level – up to the component level – and can be used for the risk assessment of a  particular system, where such detail is required.  This list has been broken down to 5 areas; the services that stakeholders provide, the devices (technological  systems) that support these services, the physical equipment used to provide these services, the people that  maintain or use them, and the data used.  Fourteen service categories, together with sub-categories, are defined and depicted in Figure 2. For each service  listed on (ENISA, 2020), assets have been identified. These are based on the list of systems by (ENISA, 2020), desk  research, CLC/TS50701 and complemented with additions such as supply chain or freight assets.  Supply chain  assets refer to the assets provided by suppliers; as this present list may not be exhaustive, suppliers’ threats can be  additionally covered by defining a list of suppliers and applying specific measures to them. Freight assets are  especially relevant as railways amount for a significant amount of EU freight transport. They can be targeted by  specific attacks that are more focused on financial gain rather than disruption or passenger safety.  In addition, each asset has been characterised according to the kind of resources the asset uses:   IT systems: refers to all components, devices and software used to store and process the information and  realise IT operations.   OT systems: refers to all components, devices and software used to conduct physical railway operations.   Network and communications systems: refers to all components and devices used to physically convey  information fluxes.   Supply chain: refers to the assets provided by suppliers.  Four device categories have been identified, namely:   Telecom   IT & OT infrastructure   Infrastructures and trackside    On-board   These categories illustrate the systems to which the assets belong to and it is used to define the operation where the  asset will be used: passenger comfort, signalling, corporate operations, etc. (see figure 3)  Moreover, physical equipment can be found either on infrastructure and trackside (buildings,  tracks, etc.), or on-board (trains, wagon, lighting, etc.) (see Figure 4)  Finally, the different categories of people that are using these systems (clients or employees)  and the different categories of data used by those systems are listed (see Figure 5).  These taxonomies can be used for developing an initial ontology-knowledge representation for the railway domain.  For detailed descriptions of these five areas of assets, please consult Annex A.  11 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/railway-cybersecurity  12 See X2R3-T8_3-D-SMD-004-06_-_Deliverable_D8.2-3c_Protection_profile___On-board_components and X2R3-T8_3-D-SMD-009-06_- _Deliverable_D8.2-3b_Protection_Profile_-_Trackside  13 See RCA Gamma published (eulynx.eu)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/railway-cybersecurity https://www.eulynx.eu/index.php/news/61-rca-gamma-published#:~:text=RCA%20starts%20with%20radio-based%20ETCS%20cab-signalling%20and%20EULYNX,such%20as%20ATO%2C%20moving%20block%2C%20train-borne%20localization%2C%20FRMCS.

CYBER-RELATED  THREATS  In the railway sector, compromised OT systems can affect passengers’ safety, cause a train accident, or interrupt  traffic. OT systems are usually more vulnerable than IT systems, in part due to a lack of cybersecurity awareness in  OT personnel, in part because they were not designed with cybersecurity in mind (long lifecycles of 30 years,  presence of legacy systems) and because they are less controlled and decentralised compared to IT systems. While  in the past they remained less exposed, often isolated from internet and other IT networks, they are now more and  more interconnected with classic IT systems, which makes them even more vulnerable and exposed to cyber threats.  RUs and IMs need to identify which cyber threats are applicable to their assets and services. One of the common  questions is whether threats, such as disasters, physical attacks, or outages, should be included or considered as not  being specific to the “cyber” ecosystem. Most stakeholders include them, as they can affect information security. If  they are not included, they should be considered in other risk management or business continuity management  processes of the company, and this must be agreed on when the threat taxonomy is being developed.  Another challenge faced by the railway sector is assessing the likelihood of a threat scenario. One would need to  consider the level of capability required for an attack, the level of exposure of the targeted asset, and the intent of an  attacker, all of which are information that RUs and IMs may have difficulty in assessing accurately.  Several methods are proposed by the different cyber risk management frameworks. For example, X2Rail-314  proposes to rely on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). They have selected four CVSS Exploitability  metrics in CVSS: Attack Vector (System Exposure), Attack Complexity, Privileges Required and User Interaction.  Levels for these metrics have been defined, mathematically calculating the resulting likelihood. Other methods are  less quantitative, but also simpler to apply, such as ISO27005, which combines the likelihood of occurrence of the  threat (low, medium, high), the ease of exposure (low, medium, high) and the value of the asset (from 0 to 4) to  calculate the likelihood of an incident scenario15. It is also very difficult to maintain this information because it changes  through time as the threat landscape evolves.  Finally, the railway sector faces challenges associated with supply chains. Security risks related to suppliers (e.g.,  remote access to the railway networks/systems) are less covered because of the heterogeneous and broad nature of  the supplier landscape, but also because stakeholders do not have much control over the cybersecurity level of their  suppliers and the cyber risks they may introduce. This topic can be reinforced by making an inventory of all the  suppliers, categorising them in term of criticality (e.g., do they have access to a critical system, is there a strong  interconnection between systems, do they manipulate sensitive data, etc.) and assessing the cybersecurity maturity  of the most critical suppliers as a starting point.  4.1 TAXONOMY  RUs and IMs should decide on a list of threats to be used to perform their cyber risk analysis. There are several  threat taxonomies available, without a consolidated version being available. For a detailed mapping of railway threat  taxonomies, one can consult “Appendix to D8.2 Security Assessment: A mapping of threat landscapes” (X2Rail-1,  2019). This document maps various approaches to the proposed threat landscape by X2Rail-1 WP 8, which is based  upon the ISO 27005 threat landscape with some improvements for railways. The ISO 27005:201116, ENISA Threat  Taxonomy17 and BSI Threats Catalogues are mapped to the threats considered under the X2Rail-1 WP 8 Threat  landscape.  14 See X2Rail-3 Deliverable D8.1 Guidelines for railway cybersecurity  15 See ISO 27005, annex E, E.2 Detailed information security risk assessment  16 See ISO 27005, annex E, E.2 Detailed information security risk assessment  17 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/threat-taxonomy/view  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/threat-taxonomy/view  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  19  Figure 6: Threat taxonomy  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  20  To assist in this process, this report provides a comprehensive and tailored list of threats based on the 2016 ENISA  Threat Taxonomy18, as this is a more extensive list. It can be used as the basis to identify threats that apply in the  context of the company and to assess railway cyber threats. It has been simplified to better apply to railways, and to  ensure stakeholders can effectively use it. The resulting list of categories was reviewed and validated with experts  during dedicated workshops. The main categories are as follows:   Disaster (natural, environmental)   Unintentional damage / loss of information or IT assets   Physical attack (deliberate / intentional)   Failures / Malfunction   Outages   Malicious activity / Abuse  Each threat belongs to a category and is applicable to one or more railway assets. This taxonomy has been  represented graphically in Figure 6 and the threats are described in more detail in Annex B.  For an updated view of the current threat landscape, i.e. the current top threats, readers can consult the latest ENISA  Threat landscape report19. For a more detailed analysis of adversary tactics, the MITRE ATT&CK® knowledge base20  and the Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC)21 can also be used.  4.2 CYBER RISK SCENARIOS  This section describes examples of cyber risk scenarios which can assist railway stakeholders when performing a risk  analysis. They show how the asset and threat taxonomies can be used together and were based on the known  incidents of the sector and the feedback received during the workshops. Each scenario is associated with a list of  security measures, detailed later in chapter 28, which will mitigate the risk of this scenario occurring, and are derived  from best practices. The following scenarios are described:   Scenario 1: Compromising a signalling system or automatic train control system, leading to a train accident   Scenario 2: Sabotage of the traffic supervising systems, leading to train traffic stop   Scenario 3: Ransomware attack, leading to a disruption of activity   Scenario 4: Theft of clients’ personal data from the booking management system   Scenario 5: Leak of sensitive data due to unsecure, exposed database   Scenario 6: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, blocking travellers from buying tickets   Scenario 7: Disastrous event destroying the datacentre facility, leading to disruption of IT services  18 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/threat-taxonomy/view  19 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends  20 https://attack.mitre.org/  21 https://capec.mitre.org/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/threat-taxonomy/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends https://attack.mitre.org/ https://capec.mitre.org/  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  21  4.2.1 Scenario 1 – Compromising a signalling system or automatic train control system,  leading to a train accident  Figure 7: Compromising a signalling system or automatic train control system, leading to a train accident  This scenario requires high motivation of the attacker and in-depth knowledge of railway systems and networks. It is  considered a low likelihood scenario. It has been included as the potential impact can be very high and this is one of  the primary concerns of railway stakeholders when considering cyber risks. A similar incident took place in the city of  Lodz, Poland in 2008 when an attacker managed to hack into a tram system.  Attack details   An attacker gathers information (type of requests, IP address, etc.),  o either trespassing on railway undertaking train facilities (e.g., depos, maintenance centre, etc.),  o or from a malicious employee,  o or using phishing to steal information from an employee;   An attacker builds a device or a software to command-and-control junctions and trains according to gathered  information;   An attacker uses of the device to control the junctions and the trains;   An attacker provides false information to the system, leading to a major disruption or even a train accident.

Such an incident has not yet occurred in the  railway sector. This scenario could also be applied to freight docking systems, and thus disturb or interrupt freight  activity.  Attack details   An attacker introduces an ICS malware, through phishing emails sent to employee or removable devices  used on OT systems;   The ICS malware propagates, takes over of the system, and gains remote access;   The malware allows the attackers to easily communicate with traffic supervising systems and remotely  manipulate the system’s memory to inject shellcodes, eventually injecting a payload that disrupts traffic  supervising systems;   The traffic supervising systems stop, preventing their supervision and leading to an urgent stop of train traffic.

In this  case, the attacker infiltrates the information system, exploits a vulnerability, and deploys a ransomware on a large  amount of assets. A similar incident happened in May 2017 when Germany’s Deutsche Bahn rail infrastructure was  infected with WannaCry ransomware22, leading to messages appearing on station information screens.  Attack details   An attacker infiltrates  the information system by phishing or stealing credentials;   They scan the network for vulnerabilities, to exploit them and gather information;   They discover vulnerabilities on systems (e.g. due to inadequate patch management);   They deploy a ransomware that encrypts the data on all vulnerable systems;   The infected systems and devices cannot be used anymore;   They demand a ransom in bitcoins in a limited amount of time in exchange for data to be decrypted.   They further extort employees and customers by threatening to expose personal or confidential data.

A similar incident happened in  November 2017 with Rail Europe North America (RENA) suffering due to a 3-month long data breach23 and in  January 2019 when China Railway’s official online booking platform suffered a massive data breach, with information  later being sold on the dark web24.  Attack details   Attackers identify and retrieve authentication data (credentials) to get access to useful systems:  o by gathering information on railway systems through social engineering;  o by identifying the targeted systems used for booking management and fetching the identity of the  people using them;  o once systems and their operators/users are identified, attackers launch phishing attacks to retrieve  credentials to access to those systems;   The attacker gets direct access, accesses the system using the administrator credentials;   They get unauthorised access to customer data and retrieve it;   They leak the data or sell them.

The attacker uses this third-party weakness to exfiltrate sensitive data. A similar incident happened in February 2020  with a database of C3UK25, which offered Wi-Fi services to passengers in train stations. The database contained 146  million records, including personal contact details and dates of birth, and was exposed online without a password26.  Attack details   A supplier providing services stores sensitive data (e.g., marketing company that manages a marketing  campaign, data from an open Wi-Fi service available at a train station) in an unprotected database, exposed  on internet, without password and without encrypting the information;   Hackers connect to the database and exfiltrate the information;   The database contains personal information, such as email addresses, date of birth, name, reason to travel  and travel arrangements;   Hackers use the information for extortion attacks targeting employees and customers.

The attacker can then use the botnet to flood  devices with requests and make them unavailable. Another possibility to consider for a DDoS scenario is a non-  targeted attack, where an Internet Service Provider (ISP) is targeted with this type of attack, thus affecting railway  services that use this ISP.  Attack details   An attacker has previously infected a number of computers, creating a botnet (a set of compromised  devices controlled by a hacker to perform their attacks);   The botnet is used to launch a DDoS attack on the railway networks: the networks and servers exposed  to the internet are flooded with requests and connection attempts and thus shut down, unable to sustain  the flow;   All services and actions that need the internet-exposed devices are now unavailable: ticket-vending  machines, sites or applications, and commercial websites. Passengers are unable to book tickets.

The event (natural  disaster, fire, etc.), affects the datacentre and destroys part of it, leading to a physical destruction of IT systems and  thus a disruption of activities related to these services. Depending on the redundancy strategy of the company (geo-  redundancy, cloud, external back-ups, etc.), the disruption can last more or less time. A similar incident happened in  March 2021 when OVH27 had a fire in one of its datacentres, making millions of websites unavailable for days28.  Attack details   A disastrous event affects the datacentres and destroys part of it; it can be either a natural disaster  (earthquake, flooding, storm, etc.) or a fire due to a physical malfunction;   The railway servers supporting the IT systems are physically destroyed;   The main IT systems are unavailable, leading to a disruption of all IT-supported services: corporate and  support, sales and customers relations, timetable construction systems, asset management;   The back-ups stored in the datacentres are physically destroyed as well; data are thus lost, prolonging the  disruption.

CYBERSECURITY  MEASURES  Once risks have been identified and prioritised according to risk evaluation criteria in relation to the incident scenarios  that lead to those risks, they should be treated via a risk treatment plan. Four options are usually proposed regarding  risk treatment29 : risk modification, risk retention, risk avoidance and risk sharing.   Risk modification is modifying the level of risk by introducing, removing, or altering controls so that the  residual risk can be reassessed as being acceptable.30   Risk retention is accepting the risk without further action, if the level of risk meets the risks acceptance  criteria.31   Risk avoidance is avoiding the activity or condition that increases the particular risk.32   Risk sharing is sharing the risk with another party that can most effectively manage the particular risk.33  As described in the ISO 27005 standard, these options must be selected based on the outcome of the risk  assessment, the expected cost for implementing these options and the expected benefits from these options. At the  end of the process, no risk exceeding the risk acceptance criteria should be left. In order to reduce the identified risks  to acceptable levels, appropriate security measures should be identified and prioritised. Security measures can be  defined internally, using best practices and building a remediation plan tailored to the information system. However, a  common practice is to use already-defined security measures published in security frameworks. These security  frameworks often contain a list of controls or security requirements.  NIS Directive cybersecurity measures. The NIS cooperation group issued a list of security measures directed to  OESs in a Reference document on security measures for Operators of Essential Services. The purpose of this list is  “to provide Member States with a clear and structured picture of Member States’ current and often common  approaches to the security measures of OES”.34  The document examines a high number of domains where  cybersecurity measures should be applied. For each domain, it gives a set of broad measures alongside their  definitions (Figure 14).  These domains and measures could be used as the first basis for the risk treatment plan and complemented with  measures from the CLC/TS 50701 regarding the OT cybersecurity and ISO/IEC 27002 security measures for IT  cybersecurity.  Indeed, during the workshops, it was discovered that RUs and IMs often choose a two-step approach, by selecting a  general framework for IT cyber risk treatment and complementing it with a more detailed, industry-driven one for the  OT cyber risk treatment. ISA/IEC 62443 and CLC/TS 50701 are among the main references used for OT  cybersecurity. For IT risk frameworks, NISD national security requirements, ISO27002 framework and the NIST  Cybersecurity framework are among the more commonly used. Other less common frameworks have also been  cited, such as the SANS Top 20 Critical Security Controls35, or the Forrester Information Security Model36.  29 See for instance ISO 27005, chapter 9 Information security risk treatment  30 See ISO 27005, chapter 9.2 Risk modification  31 See ISO 27005, chapter 9.3 Risk retention  32 See ISO 27005, chapter 9.5 Risk avoidance  33 See ISO 27005, chapter 9.5 Risk sharing  34 Reference document on security measures for Operators of Essential Services, p.5  35 A list of 20 actions for cyber defence, that are close to the NIST 23 categories, and published by the SANS Institute, an organisation that provides  information, resources, and training regarding cybersecurity.  36 A security model declined in 123 security components (controls) divided into 25 functions and 4 domains has been cited. It is published by the  market research company Forrester.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  29  Figure 14: Domains of security measures for OESs (NIS Cooperation Group, 2018)  The ISO/IEC 27002 standard and Annex A’ of ISO2001 describe requirements for information security management  and a set of security controls37. These controls are organised in 12 categories38:   Information security policies   Organisation of information security   Human resource security   Asset management   Access control   Cryptography   Operations security   Communications security   Supplier relationships   Information security incident management   Information security aspects of business continuity management   Compliance  Similar to the NIS Directive security measures, ISO 27002 could be used as a basis for the risk treatment plan, and  complemented with additional national security requirements, while OT systems could be complemented with  CLC/TS 50701. Some measures from the NIST framework could also be used as they can be described in more  detail.  The NIST Cybersecurity framework is accompanied by an exhaustive list of requirements. They are classified  according to five functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) and 23 categories. Each of these categories  contain a list of precise security requirements (over 900 in total). Those controls are also mapped against the ISA  62443 series and the ISO/IEC 27001:2013. The framework is quite detailed and focuses primarily on IT security. The  NIST cybersecurity framework can be used as is and complemented by CLC/TS 50701 for OT railway systems  requirements, or it can be used to complete another generic frameworks or standards, such as the ISO 27001 or the  NIS Directive security requirements.  CLC/TS 50701 is based on or derived from IEC 62443 series standards. The purpose of the TS “is that, when a  railway system is compliant to this TS, it can be demonstrated that this system is at the state of the art in terms of  cybersecurity, that it fulfils its targeted Security Level and that its security is maintained during its operation and  maintenance.” It is best suited for industrial systems and designed specifically for the railway sector, as it applies to  the Communications, Signalling and Processing domain, the Rolling Stock domain and to the Fixed Installations  domain. It contains a list of security requirements for the OT components and services of the railway sector and thus  37 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-ra- methods/m_iso27001.html  38 ISO/IEC 27001 Standard - Information technology - Security techniques - Information security management systems – Requirements, p9  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  30  should be completed with a more generic approach, such as the ISO 27001, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework or  the NIS Directive.  5.1 APPLYING CYBERSECURITY MEASURES  To help stakeholders implement the security measures, workshops were conducted with relevant experts and  institutions to discuss challenges, priorities, and best practices. The purpose was to gather concrete feedback on the  risk treatment plans.  Defining the list of measures that will be used was described as the top priority of the attendants of the workshops. To  do so, operators draw a list of cybersecurity measures from known references. Assets’ maturity is assessed against  those measures, and measures that are not met are included in the list of security measures that must be applied to  these assets. This list of security measures can also be used as a common basis for the manufacturers to implement  minimum cybersecurity requirements by design or for security requirements to be included in contract specifications.  To define the set of measures that will be used, organisations also assess the level of compliance with national  cybersecurity requirements (primarily according to the NIS Directive, but also against other requirements stemming  from laws on national security, transport security or critical infrastructure protection).  During the workshops, stakeholders highlighted the importance of awareness raising and training sessions  (especially against top threats, such as ransomware and phishing) or email security to prevent phishing. On the latter,  the protection of endpoints and network segregation is also a top priority to reduce the risk of propagation of such  attacks. As for OT security, the emphasis is placed mainly on network segregation and access control for critical  systems. Adaptation of legacy systems is also a concern and should be considered as a priority, but it is also a big  challenge, considering the complexity of updating systems with long lifecycles. Additionally, particular emphasis is  placed on incident response.  Finally, applied security measures are often challenged by external audits or penetration testing. Some organisations  use third parties to conduct such assessments. The systems tested can belong both on the IT and OT domains. In  addition to technical audits, governance audits can also be conducted, such as an ISO-compliance audit.  Furthermore, business continuity and recovery and incident response plans can also be tested with crisis exercises.  A challenge cited by multiple RUs and IMs is the management of relationships with third parties and ensuring that the  products and services supplied meet cybersecurity requirements. Often, compliance with NIS Directive security  requirements does not apply to third parties. To engage more with the industry and to encourage the implementation  of cybersecurity measures, one solution could be to design a baseline at EU level to make the manufacturers and  providers align their systems’ compliance. Common baseline requirements should be reflected in tenders to allow for  competing solutions achieving similar security capabilities across Europe. However, when considering minimum  baseline requirements, there are risks involved, such as the minimum baseline not changing while the threat  landscape changes, or that these minimum-security requirements do not meet the risks of the organisation. The use  of EU certification schemes for IT or OT cybersecurity (should these become available) could be also a way to assess  whether such requirements are met by the industry.  Another challenge that was identified is continuity, i.e., ensuring that the security level remains adequate and that the  risks are continuously monitored. To do so, regular reviews and compliance assessments are needed. Maintaining an  up-to-date threat landscape for the railway sector is equally important. An additional challenge is the separation  between IT and OT, as it is often difficult to differentiate what is strictly OT from what is IT. In this case, it is difficult to  know which controls to apply.  5.2 CYBERSECURITY MEASURES  To help stakeholders define cybersecurity measures, a list of controls from the NIS Directive has been mapped  against various references (ISO27001, NIST CSF and CLC/TS5070139). It is up to the stakeholders to choose  whether they will only select some measures from this list, use it as a basis for building their own list, or use it in  entirety. Stakeholders should also remember that they may have to comply with national guidelines and specific  39 The security measures of CLC/CS 50701 are matching the measures described in IEC 62443-3-3:2013.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  31  national sectorial regulations. They should also verify which references apply to them and, if needed, complete the  present list with the missing requirements.  The mapping was done in two phases: first, the references were reviewed and the most relevant measures were put  in front of the NIS Directive measures, keeping these measures as the starting point of the review. Then, the reverse  operation was carried out: the measures from the references that had been removed in the first phase were added to  the most relevant NIS Directive measures. This ensures that all NIS Directive measures have been covered; and that  all the other referenced measures are integrated into the mapping.  An example of a security measure is included below. It includes measures under the NIS Directive domain: Protection  and the category of “Identity and Access Management”. The two measures of this category “Authentication and  identification”, and “Access rights” are described according to the NIS Directive guidelines. They are then associated  with relevant measures that can be found in ISO/IEC 27002, the NIST cybersecurity framework and CLC/TS50701.  A detailed list of security measures can be found in Annex C.

CONCLUSIONS  European RUs and IMs use a combination of good practices, approaches, and standards to perform cyber risk  management for their organisations. This report gathers insights on these current practices in a single document and  can assist railway undertakings and infrastructure managers in their efforts to apply them. It provides examples of  reference material, such as available taxonomies of assets and threats, comprehensive threats scenarios, derived  from real incidents and cyber risk mitigation measures, derived by guidelines and standards.  The report also highlights the challenges faced when applying such approaches. Most importantly,  there is a lack of a single cyber risk management approach for railway organisations to cover  both IT and OT in a unified manner.  IT vs OT risk management approaches. The differentiation between IT and OT in the railway  sector is increasingly difficult and having discrete approaches and taxonomies for cyber risk  management makes the issue more challenging. In many cases, it can be a complex process to  identify which approach is better suited, whether a device can be considered IT or OT or which  security measures and which standard should be applied. Having a more structured and unified  approach with respect to cyber risk management would help the sector to harmonise, thus facilitating  risk discussions between the different  entities of the railway ecosystem. It can also enable more  collaboration with the supply industry of the sector.  More harmonization and alignment of good practices. Future work could include further alignment of the sector-  specific taxonomies and more guidance on the application of good practices. Wherever possible, further  standardisation could be pursued, as this is also a request stemming from the railway supply industry, which  advocates for more certification schemes at EU level. Significant sectoral challenges remain, including the cyber risk  management of supply chains. This could be remedied with a regulatory approach encompassing the entire railway  ecosystem under the same cyber risk management requirements. At present, key elements of the railway supply  chain, both IT and OT, do not fall under the same European regulatory framework.  Keeping railway systems and cyber risk assessments up-to-date. Another significant issue specific to the sector  is the plethora of legacy systems which add an additional degree of difficulty when managing cyber risk. At present, it  is not possible to provide relevant recommendations to address the cybersecurity of legacy systems in the railway  sector. It would be necessary to involve the railway industry in such an exercise. Additionally, even for newly  developed systems, there is the need to ensure that the results of risk assessments remain current, that risks are  continuously monitored, and that the security level remains adequate. Maintaining an up-to-date threat landscape for  the railway sector could be a step towards this direction.

Addressing cyber risks in the  railway sector can raise entirely new challenges for railway companies who often lack the  internal expertise, organisational structure, processes or the resources to effectively assess and  mitigate them.  The nature of railway operations and the interconnectedness of railway undertakings,  infrastructure managers, and the supply chain requires all involved parties to achieve and  maintain a baseline level of cybersecurity. European RUs and IMs use a combination of good  practices, approaches, and standards to perform cyber risk management for their organisations,  as they need to assess cyber risks for all functions and for both OT and IT. This report gathers  insights on these current practices in a single document and can assist railway undertakings  and infrastructure managers in their efforts to apply them. It provides examples of reference  material, such as available taxonomies of assets and services, threat taxonomies, seven  comprehensive threats scenarios, derived from real incidents, and available cyber risk mitigation  measures, derived by guidelines and standards.  This report aims to be a reference point for current good practices for cyber risk management  approaches that are applicable to the railway sector. It offers a guide for railway undertakings  and infrastructure managers to select, combine or adjust cyber risk management methods to the  needs of their organisation. It builds upon the 2020 ENISA report on cybersecurity in the railway  sector (ENISA, 2020), which assessed the level of implementation of cybersecurity measures in  the railway sector.  This report provides actionable guidelines, lists common challenges associated with the  performance of the relevant activities, and outlines good practices that can be readily adopted  and tailored by individual organisations. Additionally, a list of useful reference material is  available, together with practical examples and applicable standards.

INTRODUCTION  Directive 2016/1148 (NIS Directive) is the first legislative document focusing on cybersecurity in the EU. It identifies  Operators of Essential Services (OES) in the railway sector as:  Infrastructure managers (IM), as defined in point (2) of Article 3 of Directive 2012/34/EU, include: “any person or  firm responsible in particular for establishing, managing and maintaining railway infrastructure, including traffic  management and control-command and signalling. The functions of the infrastructure manager on a network or part  of a network may be allocated to different bodies or firms”.  Railway undertakings (RU), as defined in point (1) of Article 3 of Directive 2012/34/EU, include: “any public or  private undertaking licensed according to this Directive, the principal business of which is to provide services for the  transport of goods and/or passengers by rail with a requirement that the undertaking ensures traction. This also  includes undertakings which provide traction only”. This also includes operators of service facilities as defined in point  (12) of Article 3 of Directive 2012/34/EU as “any public or private entity responsible for managing one or more service  facilities or supplying one or more services to railway undertakings”.  The NIS Directive requires IMs and RUs to conduct risk assessments that “cover all operations including the security  and resilience of network and information systems”. According to the NIS Directive, these risk assessments, along  with the implementation of appropriate mitigation measures, should promote “a culture of risk management” to be  developed through “appropriate regulatory requirements and voluntary industry practices”. This need for cyber risk  management in the European railway sector was also identified as a key priority by the participants of the ENISA-  ERA conference “Cybersecurity in Railways”, which took place online on 16-17 March 2021 and brought together  more than 600 experts from railway organisations, policy, industry, research, standardisation, and certification.  While some EU Member States (MS) have issued relevant national guidance to OESs on how to conduct cyber risk  assessments, most railway operators choose to adopt one of the different methodologies introduced by industry  standards. Indeed, there are currently varying approaches to tackle risk in the railway sector and for now, there is no  single approach that covers both information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) cyber risks. This  document offers a guide to these different approaches, enabling railway operators to select, combine or adjust cyber  risk management methods to the needs of their organisation. It builds upon the 2020 ENISA report on cybersecurity  in the railway sector (ENISA, 2020), which assessed the level of implementation of cybersecurity measures in the  railway sector.  1.1 OBJECTIVES, SCOPE AND AUDIENCE  This report aims at providing railway stakeholders with applicable methods and practical examples on how to assess  and mitigate cyber risks. These good practices are gathered based on feedback from railway stakeholders and  include tools, such as assets and services list, threat scenarios, mapping of security measures. These resources can  be used as a base for cyber risk management for railway companies. The study aims at being a reference point to  promote collaboration between railway stakeholders across the EU and raise awareness of relevant threats.  This report is concerned with the European railway sector, and it covers cyber risk management applicable to both  the IT and OT systems of railway organisations. Other railway stakeholders such as rolling stock manufacturers and  component vendors are not considered in the scope of this report.  The primary target audience of this study includes people responsible for cybersecurity (CISOs, CIOs, CTOs, etc.)  within RUs and IM networks.  This report aims to provide them with the means to understand their cybersecurity  ecosystem, assess the risks to their assets or services and manage them via appropriate cybersecurity measures. In  addition, the National Competent Authorities, who may wish to develop guidance for railway operators in conducting  cyber risk management, may consult this document to understand the current practices in the sector and potential  challenges.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  7  1.2 METHODOLOGY  The report was created with cooperation of European IMs and RUs in an iterative process with multiple rounds of  validation as follows:  Step 1 - Definition of the project scope and identification of experts. The first step consisted of defining the  scope of the project and selecting subject matter experts whose input and insights could be considered for the  development of the report. The experts chosen are mainly RU and IM stakeholders in charge of cybersecurity, as well  as members of national and European agencies.  Step 2 - Desk research. During this step, extensive desk research for relevant documents in the context of the  project was conducted. The identified sources served as a reference to develop good practices, a list of assets and  threats, threat scenarios, and list of measures.  Step 3 - Series of workshops with selected subject matter experts. Four workshops were conducted to discuss  and validate the key findings of the study, namely the list of assets, list of threats, threats scenarios, and list of  measures. Additionally, the workshops were used as an opportunity to collect feedback on the challenges and good  practices of risk management in the railway sector. The 20 experts originated from 10 European railway companies  from Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden. The European Rail  Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ER-ISAC) was also represented in the experts’ pool.  Step 4 - Analysis of collected material and report development. The input collected from desk research and the  stakeholder workshops were analysed. Based on this analysis, the first draft of this report was developed.  Step 5 - Review and validation. The report was then validated by 24 experts (primarily RUs and IMs) from Belgium,  France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden, the ER-ISAC and the  UNIFE cybersecurity working group. The experts reviewed the report and provided comments and suggestions for  improvement. These were the basis for the final version of this document.  1.3 STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  The report is organised in 6 chapters:   Chapter 2 describes cyber risk management concepts and the current approaches identified for the railway  sector. It can help railway stakeholders to choose a risk management methodology.   Chapter 3 contains a list of railway assets and services (definitions and taxonomy), along with guidelines on  how to identify those assets and services. Railway stakeholders can use this information to build their own  list of assets and services.   Chapter 4 focuses on cyber threats, with a list of threats, their definitions and a list of risk scenarios  applicable to the railway sector. Stakeholders can use those tools to identify the main risks to their assets  and evaluate what should be prioritised for protection. The list of threats would be useful to conduct risk  assessments, along with the abovementioned list of assets and services.   Chapter 5 examines current cybersecurity measures based on EU guidelines (NIS Directive) and  international standards. It can help stakeholders to define a risk management plan.   Chapter 6 offers some concluding remarks.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  8  2. CYBER RISK  MANAGEMENT  The purpose of this chapter is to outline the risk management approaches that were used in the study and are  applicable to the railway sector. Many definitions and concepts exist, thus making it difficult to choose one that is  most relevant to the individual’s case. To ensure a common risk management frame, this document proposes a set of  definitions and principles extracted from ISO 31000:2018 “Risk management – Principles and guidelines”, ISO-IEC  27005:2018 “Information security risk management” and the ISO-IEC 62443 series.  The information security risk management process is the coordination of activities to direct and control an  organisation with regard to risk. It consists of context establishment, risk assessment, risk treatment, risk acceptance,  risk communication and risk monitoring and review. The information security risk management process can be  iterative for risk assessment and/or risk treatment activities. An iterative approach to conducting risk assessment can  increase the depth and detail of the assessment at each iteration. It also provides a good balance between  minimising the time and effort spent in identifying controls, while ensuring that strong risks are appropriately  assessed.  As mentioned in the ISO 31000 principles chapter, risk management is not a stand-alone activity that is separate from  the main activities and processes of the organisation. Risk management is part of the responsibilities of management  and an integral part of all organisational processes, including strategic planning and all project and change  management processes.  For terms and definitions, please consult ISO 31000:2018 “Risk management – Principles and guidelines”, ISO-IEC  27005:2018 “Information security risk management.  2.1 RISKS MANAGEMENT STEPS  ISO 27005:2015 defines a risk management process which integrates all necessary key activities to deploy a risk  management methodology.  Figure 1: Risk management  The first step of launching a risk management process is establishing the context, both external and internal. It  involves setting the basic criteria necessary for information security risk management (approach, risk evaluation  criteria, impact criteria and risk acceptance criteria), defining the scope and boundaries (ensuring that all relevant  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  9  assets are taken into account in the risk assessment), and establishing an appropriate organisation to manage the  information security risk management.  The second step is launching a risk assessment, i.e., quantifying or qualitatively describing risks and enabling  managers to prioritise them according to their perceived seriousness or other established criteria. The risk  assessment consists of three distinct tasks:   Risk identification, to determine what could happen to cause a potential loss and to gain insight into how,  where, and why the loss could occur.   Risk analysis, to understand the nature of the risk and to determine the level of risk. A risk analysis  methodology may be qualitative, quantitative, or a combination of both depending on the circumstances.   Risk evaluation, to compare the level of risks against risk evaluation criteria and risk acceptance criteria.  The purpose is to produce a list of risks prioritised according to risk evaluation criteria in relation to the  incident scenarios that lead to those risks.  The third step is the risk treatment, which consists of defining a list of controls to reduce, retain, avoid, or share the  risks. Then, a risk treatment plan can be defined. The risk treatment plan description will be elaborated in chapter 5 of  this present document.  The fourth step is risk acceptance, i.e., the decision to accept the risks and responsibilities for the decision. Finally,  a list of accepted risks with justification for those that do not meet the organisation’s normal risk acceptance criteria is  established.  The fifth step is the risk communication. Information about risks should be exchanged and/or shared between the  decision-maker and other stakeholders.  The final step is risk monitoring and review. It consists of the monitoring and reviewing the risks and the various  factors (i.e., value of assets, impacts, threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood of occurrence) that help to identify any  changes in the context of the organisation at an early stage, and to maintain an overview of all risks.  2.2 RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACHES FOR THE RAILWAY SECTOR  Workshops with relevant European railway sector stakeholders were conducted to identify the most common risk  management methods currently used by RUs and IMs. During these workshops, stakeholders indicated their chosen  methods. They are complemented or combined with other approaches to reach the desired level of sophistication and  to cover both IT and OT requirements for risk management. Their approaches are also linked to the overall enterprise  risk method used by the organisation and have to offer adequate level of compliance with both EU and national  cybersecurity requirements. For RUs and IMs operating in multiple EU Member States (MS), national requirements  under the NIS Directive may not be fully harmonised, so these organisations face additional challenges in  compliance. For all EU RUs and IMs to meet the cybersecurity requirements of their national competent authorities,  support is needed from the railway industry. RUs and IMs rely on their suppliers, both for more accurate threat and  vulnerability analyses, but especially for implementing cybersecurity requirements.  Indeed, existing approaches are multiple and varying across the railway companies, but they may present different  scope and level of detail in terms of analysis. For the risk management of railway IT systems, the most cited  approaches were the requirements of NIS Directive at a national level, the ISO 2700x family of standards, and  the NIST cybersecurity framework. For OT systems, the frameworks cited were ISA/IEC 62443, CLC/TS 50701,  and the recommendations of the Shift2Rail project X2Rail-3, or the ones from the CYRail Project. Those standards  or approaches are often used in a complementary way to adequately address both IT and OT systems. While IT  systems are normally evaluated with broader and more generic methods (such as ISO 2700x or NIS Directive), OT  systems need specific methods and frameworks that have been designed for industrial train systems. For instance,  the ISA/IEC 62443 standards are the most cited frameworks used for specific OT assets and risk identification, while  many contributors to this report stated they intend to use the recently released CLC/TS50701 in the future.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  10  Stakeholders that participated in this study indicated that they use a combination of the abovementioned international  and European approaches to tackle risk management, which they then complement with national frameworks and  methodologies. Examples include the Dutch A&K analysis1, the German BSI Risk Management Standard 200-32 and  the French E-BIOS Risk Manager method3. Moreover, other stakeholders designed their own modified versions of  methodologies based on existing frameworks.  The difference between standards’ completeness can also be tackled by building a bridge between the high-level  company risk assessment, and the lower application, or asset risk, assessment level. The generic framework and  standards can be used at a high level and the more technical or precise ones can be used at the applications and  assets level. The risks and measures issued at the end of each process are consolidated in a global risk mapping  and risk treatment plan.  A multitude of different approaches and methods have been recommended by national and international authorities  regarding cyber risk management. This next section analyses a sample of European and international good practices.  ISO 27001, 27002 and 27005 standards. The ISO 2700x family are among the most used and cited standards for  information security. ISO 27001 is the standard dedicated to establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually  improving an information security management system within the context of the organisation. ISO 27001 and 27002  contain a list of requirements to consider when implementing a risk treatment plan and will be studied in more detail  in chapter 5 of the present document. ISO 27005 is focused on risk management. It is the one selected in the present  document as a reference for defining the risk management principles presented above. According to CLC/TS 50701  (see below), ISO27K series can be applied to the business part of railway infrastructure, which primarily includes IT  systems.  NIS Directive Cooperation Group guidelines. In 2018, the NIS cooperation group4 issued a “reference document”  which provides a summary of the Group’s main findings on cybersecurity measures for OESs (NIS Cooperation  Group, 2018). The reference document primarily covers the risk treatment phase of risk management. It does not  establish a new standard nor duplicate existing ones (e.g., ISO) but provides MS with a clear and structured picture of  their current and often common approaches to the security measures of OESs. Beyond OESs, this reference  document may be considered useful by other public or private actors looking to improve their cybersecurity. As it  focuses on security measures, it will be studied in more detail in chapter 5.  ISA/IEC 62443 standards. The ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards provides a framework to address and mitigate  security vulnerabilities in industrial automation and control systems (IACS). They described both technical and  process-related aspects of industrial cybersecurity and provide a risk management approach, especially for OT  systems, which can be applied to OT used in the railway sector. In particular, the ISA/IEC 62443-3-2, “Security Risk  Assessment, System Partitioning and Security Levels” standard defines a set of engineering measures to guide  organisations through the process of assessing the risk of a particular IACS and identifying and applying security  countermeasures to reduce that risk to tolerable levels. A key concept is the application of IACS security zones and  conduits, which were introduced in ISA/IEC 62443-1-1, Concepts and Models. The standard provides a basis for  1 The method Afhankelijkheids- en Kwetsbaarheidsanalyse (A&K analysis) was developed in draft form by the Dutch public company RCC. The Dutch  Ministry of Internal Affairs completed its development in 1996 and published a handbook describing the method. The method has not been updated  since that time. The A&K analysis is the unique and preferred method for risk analysis by Dutch government bodies since 1994. In addition to the  Dutch government, Dutch companies often use A&K analysis.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-ra- methods/m_dutch_ak_analysis.html  2 With the BSI Standard 200-3, the BSI provides an easy-to-apply and recognised procedure which allows organisations adequate and targeted control  of their information security risks. The procedure is based on the elementary threats described in the IT-Grundschutz Compendium on the basis of  which the IT-Grundschutz-modules were drawn up.  https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Grundschutz/International/bsi-standard- 2003_en_pdf.html;jsessionid=A26D9630FC3E530CDEECEACC00297837.internet461?nn=128620  3 EBIOS Risk Manager (EBIOS RM) is the method for assessing and treating digital risks, published by National Cybersecurity Agency of France  (ANSSI) with the support of Club EBIOS. It provides a toolbox that can be adapted, the use of which varies according to the objective of the project.  EBIOS Risk Manager is compatible with the reference standards in effect, in terms of risk management as well as in terms of cybersecurity.  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/guide/ebios-risk-manager-the-method/  4 The NIS Cooperation  Group is composed  of  representatives  of  Member  States,  the Commission, and ENISA, has been established under  the NIS Directive.

CLC/TS 50701. Following this standard, the Technical Specification 50701 was issued (CLC/TS 50701, 2021). This  European Technical Specification applies ISA/IEC 62443 to the railway sector. It applies to the communications,  signalling, processing, rolling stock and fixed installations domains. It provides references to models and concepts  from which requirements and recommendations can be derived and which are suitable to ensure that the residual risk  from security threats is identified, supervised, and managed to an acceptable level by the railway system duty holder.  CLC/TS 50701 can be used to define a list of OT components for the railway sector, and to build a list of OT-specific  security measures.  Shift2Rail Risk Assessment Methods (projects X2Rail-1 and X2Rail-3). Shift2Rail proposes a risk assessment  based on IEC 62443-3-2 (X2Rail-1, 2019; X2Rail-3, 2020). It proposes a common railway framework, which includes:   Attacker landscape dedicated to railway   Threat landscape dedicated to railway based on (ISO 27005, ENISA’s 2016 Threat Taxonomy 2016 and  BSI: Threats Catalogue)   Impact matrix   Approach for high-level risk assessment and estimation of the security level targets based on the STRIDE  threat classification   Process for detailed risk assessment.  Based on this common approach, Shift2Rail performed a risk assessment of a generic railway signalling system  compliant with the IEC 62443 and proposed target security levels for the different identified zones. X2Rail-3 proposed  a Simplified Risk assessment approach in 2020 (X2Rail-3, 2020) which consists of the following workflow:  1. Description of the zone under assessment  2. Division of the assessment into six STRIDE threat domains5  3. Estimation of likelihood and impact  4. Risk computation  5. Security level mapping to risk level  6. Foundational Requirements6 security level mapping to six STRIDE threat domains security levels  CYRail recommendations on cybersecurity of rail signalling and communication systems. The EU-funded  project CYRail7 issued a guide published in September 2018 (Cyrail, 2018). This guide provides an analysis of  threats targeting railway infrastructures, in addition to the development of attack detection and alerting techniques,  mitigation plans and Protection Profiles for railway control and signalling applications to ensure security by design of  new rail infrastructures. It relies on the IEC62443 standard. The security assessment consists of the following 5  steps:   Identification of the system under consideration (SUC)   Performing a high-level cybersecurity risk assessment to identify the worst-case risks   Partition of the SUC into zones and conduits and definition of the vulnerabilities   Realisation of detailed risk assessment in each zone and conduit in 10 steps (identify threats, identify  vulnerabilities, determine consequence and impact, determine unmitigated likelihood, calculate unmitigated  5 The STRIDE model is a model of threats developed by Microsoft to identify computers security threats, as the first step in a proactive security  analysis process. The next steps in the process are identifying the vulnerabilities in the implementation and then taking measures to close security  gaps.  STRIDE model defines a threat as any potential occurrence, malicious or otherwise, that can have an undesirable effect on the system  resources. STRIDE stands for 6 main threats: Spoofing of user identity, Tampering with data, Repudiability, Information disclosure (privacy breach),  Denial of Service (DoS) and Elevation of privilege. Vulnerability is an unfortunate characteristic that makes it possible for a threat to occur. An attack is  an action taken by a malicious intruder to exploit certain vulnerabilities to enact the threat. It was created to be applied to a specific system or during  the development of a product; therefore, it is less relevant at a company level, as it does not encompass the whole risk management process.  Nevertheless, it can be used with a more global methodology when defining the threats.  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2006/november/uncover-security-design-flaws-using-the-stride-approach  6 According to IEC62443, security capabilities are organised according to seven Foundational requirements (FR1 Identification and Authentication  Control, FR2 – Use Control, FR3 - System Integrity, FR4 – Data Confidentiality, FR5 – Restricted Data Flow, FR6 – Timely Response to Events, and  FR7 – Resource Availability.  7 https://cyrail.eu/about-cyrail-project-1  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2006/november/uncover-security-design-flaws-using-the-stride-approach https://cyrail.eu/about-cyrail-project-1  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  12  cyber security risk, determine security level target, identify and evaluate existing countermeasures, revaluate  likelihood and impact, calculate residual risk, document and communicate results)   Documentation of the process  This guide is useful to conduct risk analysis within the railway sector, particularly on control and signalling  applications, using the IEC62443 standard.  EULYNX, RCA, and OCORA approach. EULYNX is a European initiative led by 13 IMs to standardise interfaces  and elements of signalling systems. EULYNX Reference Architecture defines the complete EULYNX system,  describing the overall architecture, cross-cutting architectural concepts, and all generic functions of the system.  Baseline Set 3 was completed in 20208.  RCA stands for Reference Control, Command & Signalling (CCS) Architecture. It is an initiative led by members of  the ERTMS Users Group (EUG) and EULYNX to define a harmonised architecture for the future railway CCS, with  the main goal of substantially increasing the performance/total cost of ownership (TCO) ratio of CCS. The RCA  Baseline Set 0 Release 1 was updated with the Cyber Security guidelines created by OCORA, RCA and EULYNX. It  defines a risk assessment process taking IEC 62443 and CLC/TS 50701 as security standards and gives an example  on how to apply it to trackside CCS.  The following process is defined:   Definition of system under consideration   Initial zoning concept based on risk assessment   Definition of attacker types   Evaluation of the attackers, strength, motivation   Supplementation of threats   Sorting of threats into foundational requirements   Definition of the initial security level per threat   Entering the foundational requirement value into the vector of the preliminary zone   Application of reduction factors to determine the final security level   Application of the measures according to IEC62443  The focus of RCA is on the architecture of the CCS trackside. There is a similar initiative, named OCORA, which  addresses the architecture of the CCS on-board side9. It is a joint initiative by 5 European railway companies10 which  has been set up to define the architecture and interfaces for the next generation of on-board European Train Control  System (ETCS) systems.  UIC Guidelines for Cyber-Security in Railways. In 2018, the UIC ARGUS WG decided to produce an enforced  document to provide specific guidance to the ‘Railway’ (UIC, 2018). This guidance document is designed to support  the rail industry in reducing its vulnerability to cyber-attacks and to ensure availability, integrity, confidentiality of  railway systems and data at all times. The document has a particular but not exclusive focus on signalling and  telecommunication within railway. The document is based on the ISO 27001 and 27002 standards and offers  guidance specific to railway. It also describes common risk management steps such as: establishment of the security  context, assets identification (primary and supporting), impact analysis (supported by operational impact scenarios),  threat identification, selection of applicable threat scenarios, estimation of risk level for each applicable threat  scenario based on the likelihood and the impact of those threat scenario, selection of risk treatment options, and  selection of a list of additional controls.  8 https://www.eulynx.eu/index.php/documents/published-documents/open-availability/baseline-set-3/257-20200623-eulynx-documentation-plan-eu-doc- 11-v3-4-0-a/file  9 https://github.com/OCORA-Public  10 Deutsche Bahn (DB), Société nationale des chemins de fer français (SNCF), Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS), Österreichische Bundesbahnen (ÖBB)  and Schweizerische Bundesbahnen (SBB  https://www.eulynx.eu/index.php/documents/published-documents/open-availability/baseline-set-3/257-20200623-eulynx-documentation-plan-eu-doc-11-v3-4-0-a/file https://www.eulynx.eu/index.php/documents/published-documents/open-availability/baseline-set-3/257-20200623-eulynx-documentation-plan-eu-doc-11-v3-4-0-a/file https://github.com/OCORA-Public  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  13  3. RAILWAY ASSETS  AND SERVICES  For RUs and IMs to manage cyber risks, it is crucial that they identify their railway assets and services that need to  be protected. The railway sector is composed of multiple stakeholders who are responsible for their own  infrastructure, assets and services, but they are strongly interconnected and interact with one another to deliver  services. These interactions complicate risk assessment, because interdependencies between external stakeholders  or suppliers must be considered in the analysis. The list resulting from this identification of assets and services should  contain services the stakeholders have to deliver, and assets, such as devices, physical infrastructure, people and  data needed to support these services.  In addition, stakeholders may develop indicators to assess cyber risk impact on the availability, integrity and  confidentiality of these assets and services (e.g., number of users affected, economic impact, environmental impact,  recovery time objectives, etc.).  Eight essential high-level railway services have been considered during the 2020 ENISA study (ENISA, 2020):   Operating traffic on the network   Ensuring the safety and security of passengers and/or goods   Maintaining railway infrastructure and/or trains   Managing invoicing and finance (billing)   Planning operations and booking resources   Information for passengers and customers about operations   Carrying goods and/or passengers   Selling and distributing tickets.  Railway stakeholders can use various taxonomies as the basis to identify their key cyber-related assets and services  and adapt it to their own operational environment. Based on the desk research and information collected during the  workshops, the key point is to maintain an asset inventory for cyber-related assets. Assets should be identified and  registered in the asset inventory based on the system they relate to, the service they support and the information they  handle. As mentioned, interdependencies between systems and third-party hardware and software, vendors, or other  stakeholders must be considered. They should be identified in the specifications of technical interface (and/or data  exchange) requirements. Finally, the department/division responsible for cybersecurity should be included in  procurement contract review and implementation to ensure cybersecurity is addressed.  The identification of all interdependencies of the systems can be a real challenge. This is the case for external  dependencies, but also for internal dependencies. Specifically, IT and OT interdependencies are complex because  their boundaries are increasingly blurring, and OT and IT have different levels of maturity in terms of cybersecurity.  Maintaining an exhaustive inventory is complex as systems are evolving fast, and the digitalisation of all processes is  adding more and more systems that must be considered. This is exacerbated by the fact that the people responsible  for the inventory often are unaware knowledge of all the assets and rely on systems engineers or security experts of  the asset owner to maintain the inventory. Third-party-managed systems are also complicated to integrate in internal  inventories due to this mix of responsibilities. To support this inventory, automated tools for asset management  (identification, logging and monitoring) can be deployed, but the deployment of such tools requires strong interactions  with systems that don’t always support such interactions. For asset identification, IT/OT asset discovery tools can be  deployed, but care needs to be taken during their configuration so as not to affect the performance of systems.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  14  3.1 TAXONOMY  To help RUs and IMs choose which assets and services to include in their risk assessment, a comprehensive list has  been compiled. It is based on the systems’ list described in the ENISA Report - Railway Cybersecurity of 202011.  It has been constructed from existing literature, validated during interviews with railway stakeholders in 2020, and  enriched based on the feedback received during the 2021 workshops. It gives a robust and high-level overview of  railway assets, with relevant categories.  Other, more detailed taxonomies exist in the sector and have been reviewed in order to complement and align  (especially for the names and associated descriptions) this list with approaches on asset taxonomies, such as X2Rail  Deliverables12, RCA-OCORA-Eulynx Security Guideline13 and TS50701. Indeed, RCA, OCORA, and Eulynx have  created comprehensive asset architecture models specific to OT systems (on-board and trackside systems). They  present assets at a more detailed level – up to the component level – and can be used for the risk assessment of a  particular system, where such detail is required.  This list has been broken down to 5 areas; the services that stakeholders provide, the devices (technological  systems) that support these services, the physical equipment used to provide these services, the people that  maintain or use them, and the data used.  Fourteen service categories, together with sub-categories, are defined and depicted in Figure 2. For each service  listed on (ENISA, 2020), assets have been identified. These are based on the list of systems by (ENISA, 2020), desk  research, CLC/TS50701 and complemented with additions such as supply chain or freight assets.  Supply chain  assets refer to the assets provided by suppliers; as this present list may not be exhaustive, suppliers’ threats can be  additionally covered by defining a list of suppliers and applying specific measures to them. Freight assets are  especially relevant as railways amount for a significant amount of EU freight transport. They can be targeted by  specific attacks that are more focused on financial gain rather than disruption or passenger safety.  In addition, each asset has been characterised according to the kind of resources the asset uses:   IT systems: refers to all components, devices and software used to store and process the information and  realise IT operations.   OT systems: refers to all components, devices and software used to conduct physical railway operations.   Network and communications systems: refers to all components and devices used to physically convey  information fluxes.   Supply chain: refers to the assets provided by suppliers.  Four device categories have been identified, namely:   Telecom   IT & OT infrastructure   Infrastructures and trackside    On-board   These categories illustrate the systems to which the assets belong to and it is used to define the operation where the  asset will be used: passenger comfort, signalling, corporate operations, etc. (see figure 3)  Moreover, physical equipment can be found either on infrastructure and trackside (buildings,  tracks, etc.), or on-board (trains, wagon, lighting, etc.) (see Figure 4)  Finally, the different categories of people that are using these systems (clients or employees)  and the different categories of data used by those systems are listed (see Figure 5).  These taxonomies can be used for developing an initial ontology-knowledge representation for the railway domain.  For detailed descriptions of these five areas of assets, please consult Annex A.  11 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/railway-cybersecurity  12 See X2R3-T8_3-D-SMD-004-06_-_Deliverable_D8.2-3c_Protection_profile___On-board_components and X2R3-T8_3-D-SMD-009-06_- _Deliverable_D8.2-3b_Protection_Profile_-_Trackside  13 See RCA Gamma published (eulynx.eu)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/railway-cybersecurity https://www.eulynx.eu/index.php/news/61-rca-gamma-published#:~:text=RCA%20starts%20with%20radio-based%20ETCS%20cab-signalling%20and%20EULYNX,such%20as%20ATO%2C%20moving%20block%2C%20train-borne%20localization%2C%20FRMCS.

OT systems are usually more vulnerable than IT systems, in part due to a lack of cybersecurity awareness in  OT personnel, in part because they were not designed with cybersecurity in mind (long lifecycles of 30 years,  presence of legacy systems) and because they are less controlled and decentralised compared to IT systems. While  in the past they remained less exposed, often isolated from internet and other IT networks, they are now more and  more interconnected with classic IT systems, which makes them even more vulnerable and exposed to cyber threats.  RUs and IMs need to identify which cyber threats are applicable to their assets and services. One of the common  questions is whether threats, such as disasters, physical attacks, or outages, should be included or considered as not  being specific to the “cyber” ecosystem. Most stakeholders include them, as they can affect information security. If  they are not included, they should be considered in other risk management or business continuity management  processes of the company, and this must be agreed on when the threat taxonomy is being developed.  Another challenge faced by the railway sector is assessing the likelihood of a threat scenario. One would need to  consider the level of capability required for an attack, the level of exposure of the targeted asset, and the intent of an  attacker, all of which are information that RUs and IMs may have difficulty in assessing accurately.  Several methods are proposed by the different cyber risk management frameworks. For example, X2Rail-314  proposes to rely on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). They have selected four CVSS Exploitability  metrics in CVSS: Attack Vector (System Exposure), Attack Complexity, Privileges Required and User Interaction.  Levels for these metrics have been defined, mathematically calculating the resulting likelihood. Other methods are  less quantitative, but also simpler to apply, such as ISO27005, which combines the likelihood of occurrence of the  threat (low, medium, high), the ease of exposure (low, medium, high) and the value of the asset (from 0 to 4) to  calculate the likelihood of an incident scenario15. It is also very difficult to maintain this information because it changes  through time as the threat landscape evolves.  Finally, the railway sector faces challenges associated with supply chains. Security risks related to suppliers (e.g.,  remote access to the railway networks/systems) are less covered because of the heterogeneous and broad nature of  the supplier landscape, but also because stakeholders do not have much control over the cybersecurity level of their  suppliers and the cyber risks they may introduce. This topic can be reinforced by making an inventory of all the  suppliers, categorising them in term of criticality (e.g., do they have access to a critical system, is there a strong  interconnection between systems, do they manipulate sensitive data, etc.) and assessing the cybersecurity maturity  of the most critical suppliers as a starting point.  4.1 TAXONOMY  RUs and IMs should decide on a list of threats to be used to perform their cyber risk analysis. There are several  threat taxonomies available, without a consolidated version being available. For a detailed mapping of railway threat  taxonomies, one can consult “Appendix to D8.2 Security Assessment: A mapping of threat landscapes” (X2Rail-1,  2019). This document maps various approaches to the proposed threat landscape by X2Rail-1 WP 8, which is based  upon the ISO 27005 threat landscape with some improvements for railways. The ISO 27005:201116, ENISA Threat  Taxonomy17 and BSI Threats Catalogues are mapped to the threats considered under the X2Rail-1 WP 8 Threat  landscape.  14 See X2Rail-3 Deliverable D8.1 Guidelines for railway cybersecurity  15 See ISO 27005, annex E, E.2 Detailed information security risk assessment  16 See ISO 27005, annex E, E.2 Detailed information security risk assessment  17 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/threat-taxonomy/view  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/threat-taxonomy/view  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  19  Figure 6: Threat taxonomy  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  20  To assist in this process, this report provides a comprehensive and tailored list of threats based on the 2016 ENISA  Threat Taxonomy18, as this is a more extensive list. It can be used as the basis to identify threats that apply in the  context of the company and to assess railway cyber threats. It has been simplified to better apply to railways, and to  ensure stakeholders can effectively use it. The resulting list of categories was reviewed and validated with experts  during dedicated workshops. The main categories are as follows:   Disaster (natural, environmental)   Unintentional damage / loss of information or IT assets   Physical attack (deliberate / intentional)   Failures / Malfunction   Outages   Malicious activity / Abuse  Each threat belongs to a category and is applicable to one or more railway assets. This taxonomy has been  represented graphically in Figure 6 and the threats are described in more detail in Annex B.  For an updated view of the current threat landscape, i.e. the current top threats, readers can consult the latest ENISA  Threat landscape report19. For a more detailed analysis of adversary tactics, the MITRE ATT&CK® knowledge base20  and the Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC)21 can also be used.  4.2 CYBER RISK SCENARIOS  This section describes examples of cyber risk scenarios which can assist railway stakeholders when performing a risk  analysis. They show how the asset and threat taxonomies can be used together and were based on the known  incidents of the sector and the feedback received during the workshops. Each scenario is associated with a list of  security measures, detailed later in chapter 28, which will mitigate the risk of this scenario occurring, and are derived  from best practices. The following scenarios are described:   Scenario 1: Compromising a signalling system or automatic train control system, leading to a train accident   Scenario 2: Sabotage of the traffic supervising systems, leading to train traffic stop   Scenario 3: Ransomware attack, leading to a disruption of activity   Scenario 4: Theft of clients’ personal data from the booking management system   Scenario 5: Leak of sensitive data due to unsecure, exposed database   Scenario 6: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, blocking travellers from buying tickets   Scenario 7: Disastrous event destroying the datacentre facility, leading to disruption of IT services  18 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/threat-taxonomy/view  19 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends  20 https://attack.mitre.org/  21 https://capec.mitre.org/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/enisa-threat-landscape/threat-taxonomy/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends https://attack.mitre.org/ https://capec.mitre.org/  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  21  4.2.1 Scenario 1 – Compromising a signalling system or automatic train control system,  leading to a train accident  Figure 7: Compromising a signalling system or automatic train control system, leading to a train accident  This scenario requires high motivation of the attacker and in-depth knowledge of railway systems and networks. It is  considered a low likelihood scenario. It has been included as the potential impact can be very high and this is one of  the primary concerns of railway stakeholders when considering cyber risks. A similar incident took place in the city of  Lodz, Poland in 2008 when an attacker managed to hack into a tram system.  Attack details   An attacker gathers information (type of requests, IP address, etc.),  o either trespassing on railway undertaking train facilities (e.g., depos, maintenance centre, etc.),  o or from a malicious employee,  o or using phishing to steal information from an employee;   An attacker builds a device or a software to command-and-control junctions and trains according to gathered  information;   An attacker uses of the device to control the junctions and the trains;   An attacker provides false information to the system, leading to a major disruption or even a train accident.

Such an incident has not yet occurred in the  railway sector. This scenario could also be applied to freight docking systems, and thus disturb or interrupt freight  activity.  Attack details   An attacker introduces an ICS malware, through phishing emails sent to employee or removable devices  used on OT systems;   The ICS malware propagates, takes over of the system, and gains remote access;   The malware allows the attackers to easily communicate with traffic supervising systems and remotely  manipulate the system’s memory to inject shellcodes, eventually injecting a payload that disrupts traffic  supervising systems;   The traffic supervising systems stop, preventing their supervision and leading to an urgent stop of train traffic.

In this  case, the attacker infiltrates the information system, exploits a vulnerability, and deploys a ransomware on a large  amount of assets. A similar incident happened in May 2017 when Germany’s Deutsche Bahn rail infrastructure was  infected with WannaCry ransomware22, leading to messages appearing on station information screens.  Attack details   An attacker infiltrates  the information system by phishing or stealing credentials;   They scan the network for vulnerabilities, to exploit them and gather information;   They discover vulnerabilities on systems (e.g. due to inadequate patch management);   They deploy a ransomware that encrypts the data on all vulnerable systems;   The infected systems and devices cannot be used anymore;   They demand a ransom in bitcoins in a limited amount of time in exchange for data to be decrypted.   They further extort employees and customers by threatening to expose personal or confidential data.

A similar incident happened in  November 2017 with Rail Europe North America (RENA) suffering due to a 3-month long data breach23 and in  January 2019 when China Railway’s official online booking platform suffered a massive data breach, with information  later being sold on the dark web24.  Attack details   Attackers identify and retrieve authentication data (credentials) to get access to useful systems:  o by gathering information on railway systems through social engineering;  o by identifying the targeted systems used for booking management and fetching the identity of the  people using them;  o once systems and their operators/users are identified, attackers launch phishing attacks to retrieve  credentials to access to those systems;   The attacker gets direct access, accesses the system using the administrator credentials;   They get unauthorised access to customer data and retrieve it;   They leak the data or sell them.

The attacker uses this third-party weakness to exfiltrate sensitive data. A similar incident happened in February 2020  with a database of C3UK25, which offered Wi-Fi services to passengers in train stations. The database contained 146  million records, including personal contact details and dates of birth, and was exposed online without a password26.  Attack details   A supplier providing services stores sensitive data (e.g., marketing company that manages a marketing  campaign, data from an open Wi-Fi service available at a train station) in an unprotected database, exposed  on internet, without password and without encrypting the information;   Hackers connect to the database and exfiltrate the information;   The database contains personal information, such as email addresses, date of birth, name, reason to travel  and travel arrangements;   Hackers use the information for extortion attacks targeting employees and customers.

The attacker can then use the botnet to flood  devices with requests and make them unavailable. Another possibility to consider for a DDoS scenario is a non-  targeted attack, where an Internet Service Provider (ISP) is targeted with this type of attack, thus affecting railway  services that use this ISP.  Attack details   An attacker has previously infected a number of computers, creating a botnet (a set of compromised  devices controlled by a hacker to perform their attacks);   The botnet is used to launch a DDoS attack on the railway networks: the networks and servers exposed  to the internet are flooded with requests and connection attempts and thus shut down, unable to sustain  the flow;   All services and actions that need the internet-exposed devices are now unavailable: ticket-vending  machines, sites or applications, and commercial websites. Passengers are unable to book tickets.

The event (natural  disaster, fire, etc.), affects the datacentre and destroys part of it, leading to a physical destruction of IT systems and  thus a disruption of activities related to these services. Depending on the redundancy strategy of the company (geo-  redundancy, cloud, external back-ups, etc.), the disruption can last more or less time. A similar incident happened in  March 2021 when OVH27 had a fire in one of its datacentres, making millions of websites unavailable for days28.  Attack details   A disastrous event affects the datacentres and destroys part of it; it can be either a natural disaster  (earthquake, flooding, storm, etc.) or a fire due to a physical malfunction;   The railway servers supporting the IT systems are physically destroyed;   The main IT systems are unavailable, leading to a disruption of all IT-supported services: corporate and  support, sales and customers relations, timetable construction systems, asset management;   The back-ups stored in the datacentres are physically destroyed as well; data are thus lost, prolonging the  disruption.

CYBERSECURITY  MEASURES  Once risks have been identified and prioritised according to risk evaluation criteria in relation to the incident scenarios  that lead to those risks, they should be treated via a risk treatment plan. Four options are usually proposed regarding  risk treatment29 : risk modification, risk retention, risk avoidance and risk sharing.   Risk modification is modifying the level of risk by introducing, removing, or altering controls so that the  residual risk can be reassessed as being acceptable.30   Risk retention is accepting the risk without further action, if the level of risk meets the risks acceptance  criteria.31   Risk avoidance is avoiding the activity or condition that increases the particular risk.32   Risk sharing is sharing the risk with another party that can most effectively manage the particular risk.33  As described in the ISO 27005 standard, these options must be selected based on the outcome of the risk  assessment, the expected cost for implementing these options and the expected benefits from these options. At the  end of the process, no risk exceeding the risk acceptance criteria should be left. In order to reduce the identified risks  to acceptable levels, appropriate security measures should be identified and prioritised. Security measures can be  defined internally, using best practices and building a remediation plan tailored to the information system. However, a  common practice is to use already-defined security measures published in security frameworks. These security  frameworks often contain a list of controls or security requirements.  NIS Directive cybersecurity measures. The NIS cooperation group issued a list of security measures directed to  OESs in a Reference document on security measures for Operators of Essential Services. The purpose of this list is  “to provide Member States with a clear and structured picture of Member States’ current and often common  approaches to the security measures of OES”.34  The document examines a high number of domains where  cybersecurity measures should be applied. For each domain, it gives a set of broad measures alongside their  definitions (Figure 14).  These domains and measures could be used as the first basis for the risk treatment plan and complemented with  measures from the CLC/TS 50701 regarding the OT cybersecurity and ISO/IEC 27002 security measures for IT  cybersecurity.  Indeed, during the workshops, it was discovered that RUs and IMs often choose a two-step approach, by selecting a  general framework for IT cyber risk treatment and complementing it with a more detailed, industry-driven one for the  OT cyber risk treatment. ISA/IEC 62443 and CLC/TS 50701 are among the main references used for OT  cybersecurity. For IT risk frameworks, NISD national security requirements, ISO27002 framework and the NIST  Cybersecurity framework are among the more commonly used. Other less common frameworks have also been  cited, such as the SANS Top 20 Critical Security Controls35, or the Forrester Information Security Model36.  29 See for instance ISO 27005, chapter 9 Information security risk treatment  30 See ISO 27005, chapter 9.2 Risk modification  31 See ISO 27005, chapter 9.3 Risk retention  32 See ISO 27005, chapter 9.5 Risk avoidance  33 See ISO 27005, chapter 9.5 Risk sharing  34 Reference document on security measures for Operators of Essential Services, p.5  35 A list of 20 actions for cyber defence, that are close to the NIST 23 categories, and published by the SANS Institute, an organisation that provides  information, resources, and training regarding cybersecurity.  36 A security model declined in 123 security components (controls) divided into 25 functions and 4 domains has been cited. It is published by the  market research company Forrester.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  29  Figure 14: Domains of security measures for OESs (NIS Cooperation Group, 2018)  The ISO/IEC 27002 standard and Annex A’ of ISO2001 describe requirements for information security management  and a set of security controls37. These controls are organised in 12 categories38:   Information security policies   Organisation of information security   Human resource security   Asset management   Access control   Cryptography   Operations security   Communications security   Supplier relationships   Information security incident management   Information security aspects of business continuity management   Compliance  Similar to the NIS Directive security measures, ISO 27002 could be used as a basis for the risk treatment plan, and  complemented with additional national security requirements, while OT systems could be complemented with  CLC/TS 50701. Some measures from the NIST framework could also be used as they can be described in more  detail.  The NIST Cybersecurity framework is accompanied by an exhaustive list of requirements. They are classified  according to five functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) and 23 categories. Each of these categories  contain a list of precise security requirements (over 900 in total). Those controls are also mapped against the ISA  62443 series and the ISO/IEC 27001:2013. The framework is quite detailed and focuses primarily on IT security. The  NIST cybersecurity framework can be used as is and complemented by CLC/TS 50701 for OT railway systems  requirements, or it can be used to complete another generic frameworks or standards, such as the ISO 27001 or the  NIS Directive security requirements.  CLC/TS 50701 is based on or derived from IEC 62443 series standards. The purpose of the TS “is that, when a  railway system is compliant to this TS, it can be demonstrated that this system is at the state of the art in terms of  cybersecurity, that it fulfils its targeted Security Level and that its security is maintained during its operation and  maintenance.” It is best suited for industrial systems and designed specifically for the railway sector, as it applies to  the Communications, Signalling and Processing domain, the Rolling Stock domain and to the Fixed Installations  domain. It contains a list of security requirements for the OT components and services of the railway sector and thus  37 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-ra- methods/m_iso27001.html  38 ISO/IEC 27001 Standard - Information technology - Security techniques - Information security management systems – Requirements, p9  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  30  should be completed with a more generic approach, such as the ISO 27001, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework or  the NIS Directive.  5.1 APPLYING CYBERSECURITY MEASURES  To help stakeholders implement the security measures, workshops were conducted with relevant experts and  institutions to discuss challenges, priorities, and best practices. The purpose was to gather concrete feedback on the  risk treatment plans.  Defining the list of measures that will be used was described as the top priority of the attendants of the workshops. To  do so, operators draw a list of cybersecurity measures from known references. Assets’ maturity is assessed against  those measures, and measures that are not met are included in the list of security measures that must be applied to  these assets. This list of security measures can also be used as a common basis for the manufacturers to implement  minimum cybersecurity requirements by design or for security requirements to be included in contract specifications.  To define the set of measures that will be used, organisations also assess the level of compliance with national  cybersecurity requirements (primarily according to the NIS Directive, but also against other requirements stemming  from laws on national security, transport security or critical infrastructure protection).  During the workshops, stakeholders highlighted the importance of awareness raising and training sessions  (especially against top threats, such as ransomware and phishing) or email security to prevent phishing. On the latter,  the protection of endpoints and network segregation is also a top priority to reduce the risk of propagation of such  attacks. As for OT security, the emphasis is placed mainly on network segregation and access control for critical  systems. Adaptation of legacy systems is also a concern and should be considered as a priority, but it is also a big  challenge, considering the complexity of updating systems with long lifecycles. Additionally, particular emphasis is  placed on incident response.  Finally, applied security measures are often challenged by external audits or penetration testing. Some organisations  use third parties to conduct such assessments. The systems tested can belong both on the IT and OT domains. In  addition to technical audits, governance audits can also be conducted, such as an ISO-compliance audit.  Furthermore, business continuity and recovery and incident response plans can also be tested with crisis exercises.  A challenge cited by multiple RUs and IMs is the management of relationships with third parties and ensuring that the  products and services supplied meet cybersecurity requirements. Often, compliance with NIS Directive security  requirements does not apply to third parties. To engage more with the industry and to encourage the implementation  of cybersecurity measures, one solution could be to design a baseline at EU level to make the manufacturers and  providers align their systems’ compliance. Common baseline requirements should be reflected in tenders to allow for  competing solutions achieving similar security capabilities across Europe. However, when considering minimum  baseline requirements, there are risks involved, such as the minimum baseline not changing while the threat  landscape changes, or that these minimum-security requirements do not meet the risks of the organisation. The use  of EU certification schemes for IT or OT cybersecurity (should these become available) could be also a way to assess  whether such requirements are met by the industry.  Another challenge that was identified is continuity, i.e., ensuring that the security level remains adequate and that the  risks are continuously monitored. To do so, regular reviews and compliance assessments are needed. Maintaining an  up-to-date threat landscape for the railway sector is equally important. An additional challenge is the separation  between IT and OT, as it is often difficult to differentiate what is strictly OT from what is IT. In this case, it is difficult to  know which controls to apply.  5.2 CYBERSECURITY MEASURES  To help stakeholders define cybersecurity measures, a list of controls from the NIS Directive has been mapped  against various references (ISO27001, NIST CSF and CLC/TS5070139). It is up to the stakeholders to choose  whether they will only select some measures from this list, use it as a basis for building their own list, or use it in  entirety. Stakeholders should also remember that they may have to comply with national guidelines and specific  39 The security measures of CLC/CS 50701 are matching the measures described in IEC 62443-3-3:2013.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  31  national sectorial regulations. They should also verify which references apply to them and, if needed, complete the  present list with the missing requirements.  The mapping was done in two phases: first, the references were reviewed and the most relevant measures were put  in front of the NIS Directive measures, keeping these measures as the starting point of the review. Then, the reverse  operation was carried out: the measures from the references that had been removed in the first phase were added to  the most relevant NIS Directive measures. This ensures that all NIS Directive measures have been covered; and that  all the other referenced measures are integrated into the mapping.  An example of a security measure is included below.

CONCLUSIONS  European RUs and IMs use a combination of good practices, approaches, and standards to perform cyber risk  management for their organisations. This report gathers insights on these current practices in a single document and  can assist railway undertakings and infrastructure managers in their efforts to apply them. It provides examples of  reference material, such as available taxonomies of assets and threats, comprehensive threats scenarios, derived  from real incidents and cyber risk mitigation measures, derived by guidelines and standards.  The report also highlights the challenges faced when applying such approaches. Most importantly,  there is a lack of a single cyber risk management approach for railway organisations to cover  both IT and OT in a unified manner.  IT vs OT risk management approaches. The differentiation between IT and OT in the railway  sector is increasingly difficult and having discrete approaches and taxonomies for cyber risk  management makes the issue more challenging. In many cases, it can be a complex process to  identify which approach is better suited, whether a device can be considered IT or OT or which  security measures and which standard should be applied. Having a more structured and unified  approach with respect to cyber risk management would help the sector to harmonise, thus facilitating  risk discussions between the different  entities of the railway ecosystem. It can also enable more  collaboration with the supply industry of the sector.  More harmonization and alignment of good practices. Future work could include further alignment of the sector-  specific taxonomies and more guidance on the application of good practices. Wherever possible, further  standardisation could be pursued, as this is also a request stemming from the railway supply industry, which  advocates for more certification schemes at EU level. Significant sectoral challenges remain, including the cyber risk  management of supply chains. This could be remedied with a regulatory approach encompassing the entire railway  ecosystem under the same cyber risk management requirements. At present, key elements of the railway supply  chain, both IT and OT, do not fall under the same European regulatory framework.  Keeping railway systems and cyber risk assessments up-to-date. Another significant issue specific to the sector  is the plethora of legacy systems which add an additional degree of difficulty when managing cyber risk. At present, it  is not possible to provide relevant recommendations to address the cybersecurity of legacy systems in the railway  sector. It would be necessary to involve the railway industry in such an exercise. Additionally, even for newly  developed systems, there is the need to ensure that the results of risk assessments remain current, that risks are  continuously monitored, and that the security level remains adequate. Maintaining an up-to-date threat landscape for  the railway sector could be a step towards this direction.  Railway  organisations  lack of a single  cyber risk  management  approach to  cover both IT  and OT in a  unified manner  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2021  34  7.

    "abstract": "This report aims to be a reference point for current good practices for cyber risk management approaches that are applicable to the railway sector. It offers a guide for railway undertakings and infrastructure managers to select, combine or adjust cyber risk management methods to the needs of their organisation. It builds upon the 2020 ENISA report on cybersecurity in the railway sector (ENISA, 2020), which assessed the level of implementation of cybersecurity measures in the railway sector. This report provides actionable guidelines, lists common challenges associated with the performance of the relevant activities, and outlines good practices that can be readily adopted and tailored by individual organisations. Additionally, a list of useful reference material is available, together with practical examples and applicable standards."

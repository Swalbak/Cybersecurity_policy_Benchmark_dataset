It also includes ‘human error’ that often  happens during the configuration and deployment of certain services and  systems, and may result in unintentional exposure of data. 1  In many cases, companies or organisations are not aware of a data  breach happening in their environment because of the sophistication of  the attack and sometimes the lack of visibility and classification in their  information system. 2 Based on research, it takes approximately 206 days  to identify a data breach in an organisation. 3 Thus, the time to contain,  remediate and recover the data means that it takes longer to return to  normal.  Despite all the risks involved, organisations keep even more data 4 using  cloud storage infrastructures and complex on-premises environments.  These environments are gradually more exposed to new and different  risks, proportional to the sensitiveness of the information stored. It  comes as no surprise that, the number of data breaches increased in  2019 and 2020. New findings also suggest that the impact is not felt  exclusively when a data breach is discovered - the financial impact can  remain for more than 2 years after the initial incident.  2  3  __Findings  54%_increase in the total number of breaches  by midyear 2019 compared with 2018.  71%_ of the data breaches were financially  motivated. Nearly 25% had long term strategic goals (nation  state/ espionage).  5  32%_of the data breaches involve phishing  activity according to IOCTA 2019.6 A report suggests that  phishing is at the top of the list of major contributors to data  breaches. The report also mentions that e-mail is the prime  delivery method of malware (94%) in a chain of events leading to  a data breach.  3  52%_of data breaches involved hacking.5 Other  tactics utilised are social attacks (33%), malware (28%) and  mistakes or errors (21%). Since 2016 hacking has been the main  cause of data breaches in healthcare. During 2019 nearly 59% of  the reported breaches were caused by hacking.  7  70%_of the data breaches expose e-mails.  Although username/e-mail and passwords (i.e credentials) are  easily changed in contrast with personal details (i.e. date of birth),  the focus is mostly on these in data breaches.  8  55%_of the responders to a Eurobarometer  survey responded that they are concern about their  data being accessed by criminals and fraudsters.  4  Timeline  620 million accounts stolen  from 16 hacked websites  now for sale on dark web,  seller boasts. 10  _ February  12,5M medical records of  pregnant woman of Indian  government (IN) healthcare  center, going back to 2014  were exposed to public. 11  _ March  MEGA cloud (NZ) suffered  a data breach exposing  770 million emails and 21  million passwords. 9  _ January  Mastercard (BE) suffered a  data breach affecting ca.  90K customers in Europe. 17  _ September  Major breach found in  biometrics system  used by banks, (UK)  police and defence  firms. 16  _ August  The account information of  over 7.5 million users from  Adobe (US) was exposed  due to an unprotected  online database. 18  _ October  250 million customer  service and support  records from  Microsoft (US), going  all the way back to  2005, were  breached. 21  _ January  2020  UniCredit (IT) victim of a  data breach leaking 3  million records. 19  _ November  The smart camera provider  Wyze (US) suffered two  breaches at the end of  December when databases  were left exposed for over  two weeks. 20  _ December  2019  5  Facebook (US) reported a  data breach exposing 540  million user records on  exposed servers. 12  _ April  First American Financial  Corp. (US) leaked hundreds  of millions of title  insurance records. 13  _ May  Personal information from  Capital One (US) credit card  customers breached. 15  _ July  100 million records  exposed by unauthorised  access to a data storage  from Evite customers. 14  _ June  An unprotected Google (US)  cloud server containing the  personal data of 200 million  US residents. 22  _ February  Biometric solutions  company Antheus  Tecnologia (BR)  suffered from a data  leak. 23  _ March  Hackers obtained the  login details from two  Marriott (US) employees  and broke into the  system in January 2020. 24  _ April  6  Trends  _The cost of a data breach for  organisations spreads over many years  Security researchers found that one third of the costs related to a data  breach are incurred more than 1 year after the incident. In more detail,  around 22% of these costs are incurred in the second year, while 11% of  the costs are accounted for more than 2 years after the initial incident.  These rates were higher for highly regulated organisations, such as those  in financial services and healthcare, in comparison with other sectors. 3  The adoption of cloud or multi-cloud environments is increasing rapidly  similar to the amount of data stored and processed in these  environments.  _Small mistakes could lead to big  breaches  Securing the cloud environment without losing all the flexibility it brings to  the infrastructure and resources can be problematic. A single  misconfiguration can result in exposing the entire sensitive database. A  security researcher believes that majority of data breaches in the cloud  are a result of misconfiguration and they are mostly unintentional. Netflix,  Ford and TD Bank are only few examples among many others. From a  different perspective, although data breaches resulting from malicious  attempts still cost more, breaches caused by system glitches or human  errors still represent a considerable cost on average US $3,24 million (ca.  €2,74 million). 3  7  _Data breaches cost more to small  business  The cost of data breaches to enterprises or large organisation with more  than 25.000 employees is US $204 (ca. €173) per employee. The total  amount estimation at  around US $5,11 million (ca. €4,33 million). In  contrast, for small companies (500-1.000 employees) the average cost is  around US $3.533 (ca. €3.000) per employee. This represents a total cost  of US $2,65 million (ca. €2,24 million) for small businesses. 3  Malicious/threat actors are known to be the ones pulling the string in  data breaches (bearing in mind that sometimes they may be the result of  a mistake). In that sense, external threat actors are the main cause of  data breaches, and this could include activities such as botnets   . In this  regard, financial gain has been repeatedly identified as the main  motivation behind data breaches facilitated by these groups of actors.  Espionage   also was one of the key motives behind data breaches but  not as high up the list as personal or financial gain. This trend was almost  consistent with the results observed in 2010-2011. 5  _ Financial gain is the prime motivation  etl-2020-botnet etl-2020-cyberespionage  Cryptography requirements play a vital role in the quantum-computing  era and highlight critical security issues. 72% of organisations believe that  quantum computing will affect their crypto related operations  strategically (in the next 5 years). According to the results of the survey,  92% of respondents are concerned about the exposure of sensitive data  by using this technology in the computing industry. The main strategies  respondents suggested for tackling such concerns were changing the  security architecture and deploying key managements infrastructures. 26  _ Quantum-computing and data security  concerns  8  Trends  _Healthcare - a consistent focus for  malicious actors  Healthcare continued to be one of the most attractive targets for  cybercriminals using ransomware   and phishing   techniques costing such  organisations millions of euros to contain and recover from the impact. In  2019, 400 healthcare companies reported a data breach in patient  records. This was a record for healthcare organisations. 7  _Multi-cloud - the new challenge for data  security  A survey conducted by a security researcher reported that 9 out of 10  companies are thinking of using or already using cloud environments.  Approximately 44% of their responders also believe that these  environments are challenging for implementing proper data security  measures. 25  etl-2020-ransomware etl2020-phishing  9  __Types of data exposed (%)  Type of data 2019 2018 2017  E-mail 70 44 32  Password 64 39 27  Name 23 37 41  Miscellaneous 18 19 15  Social security number 11 22 27  Credit card 11 16 19  Address 11 22 30  Account 10 7 4  Unknown 8 13 18  Date of birth 8 13 12  Medical 5 9 7  Financial 5 13 19  Source: Cyber Risk Analytics 8  10  Trends  According to a security report, a decrease in point of sale and card-  skimming breaches (where card is presented) was identified during 2019.  This represents a shift from traditional ATM skimming   and card  payments to web application in retail industry. Although the number of  incidents decreased in this area, is not an accurate to conclude that the  number of data breaches decrease rather but a shift in the vector. The  decrease though might be related to a wider implementation of chip and  pin enabled cards/terminals (also known as EMV). 6  _Continuous decrease in ‘card-present’  breaches  According to a security researcher, healthcare organisations should be  prepared for a 10%-15% increase in the number of data breaches, in which  their service providers will be the main target 7 . More generally, based on  the results from the first 6 months of 2019, it is expected that the number  of data breaches will increase at an alarming rate, despite the awareness  of senior leaders and the effort that many organisations are putting into to  secure their data. 8  _What to expect in the near future?  etl-2020-physical  11  _Data breaches by sector and organization size  Source: Verizon DBIR, 20195  Incidents Breaches Small Large Unknown  Accommodation 61 34 7 20  Administrative 17 6 6 5  Agriculture 2 2 0 0  Construction 11 7 3 1  Education 99 14 8 77  Entertainment 10 2 3 5  Finance 207 26 19 162  Healthcare 304 29 25 250  Information 155 20 18 117  Management 2 1 1 0  Manufacturing 87 10 22 55  Mining 15 2 5 8  Other services 54 6 5 43  Professional 157 34 10 113  Public 330 17 83 230  Real Estate 14 6 3 5  Retail 139 46 19 74  Trade 16 4 8 4  Transportation 36 3 9 24  Utilities 8 2 0 6  Unknown 289 0 109 180  Total 2.013 271 363 1,379  12  Attack vectors   E-MAIL/PHISHING. Impersonating a third-party supplier or a partner  using e-mail is an easy win for the malicious actors. This is known to be  the vector most often used by cybercriminals to target their victims and  the cause of most of data breaches (almost 40% of breaches in  healthcare ). 7,   CLOUD/WEB APPLICATIONS. This reflects web applications being used  as a vector for attempts by malicious actors to breach data or critical  operations. Stealing credentials to access web-based e-mail portals is a  prime example. Exploiting weaknesses in application servers to  inject/deliver information-stealing malware or formjacking attacks are  other examples in this vector.    INSIDER THREAT. This mainly refers to unauthorised or malicious  attempts to use resources. It should be noted that generally in analysis  and reporting misconfiguration or mistakes (human error) by internal  teams may also be referred to as ‘insiders’. Although most data  breaches are facilitated by external malicious actors, it is still the case  that insiders with or without privileged access are playing a key role in  data breaches. 5  Entities involved in a breach.

Provide  training and simulation scenarios for identifying social engineering  and phishing campaigns for staff. 7   Establish and maintain an incident response team and evaluate  incident response plans frequently. 3   Identify and classify sensitive/personal data and apply measures for  encrypting such data in transit and at rest. 3 In other words deploy  data loss prevention capabilities.   Increase investment in detection and alerting tools and in the ability  to contain and respond to a data breach.   Develop and maintain strong policies enforcing strong passwords  (password management) and the use of multi-factor authentication.   Consider using models that take the ‘least privilege’ approach to  provide security for both on- and off-premises resources (i.e. zero-  trust models).   Invest and create policies and plans for engaging with governance,  risk management and compliance teams. 26  15  “During the next  decade, cybersecurity  risks will become  harder to assess and  interpret due to the  growing complexity of  the threat landscape,  adversarial ecosystem  and expansion of the  attack surface.” in ETL 2020  References  1. “What is data breach?” Norton. https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-privacy-data-breaches- what-you-need-to-know.html  2. “What is data breach?” Malwarebytes.  https://www.malwarebytes.com/data-breach/  3. “Cost of Data Breach Report.” 2019.

Although username/e-mail and passwords (i.e credentials) are  easily changed in contrast with personal details (i.e. date of birth),  the focus is mostly on these in data breaches.  8  55%_of the responders to a Eurobarometer  survey responded that they are concern about their  data being accessed by criminals and fraudsters.  4  Timeline  620 million accounts stolen  from 16 hacked websites  now for sale on dark web,  seller boasts. 10  _ February  12,5M medical records of  pregnant woman of Indian  government (IN) healthcare  center, going back to 2014  were exposed to public. 11  _ March  MEGA cloud (NZ) suffered  a data breach exposing  770 million emails and 21  million passwords. 9  _ January  Mastercard (BE) suffered a  data breach affecting ca.  90K customers in Europe. 17  _ September  Major breach found in  biometrics system  used by banks, (UK)  police and defence  firms. 16  _ August  The account information of  over 7.5 million users from  Adobe (US) was exposed  due to an unprotected  online database. 18  _ October  250 million customer  service and support  records from  Microsoft (US), going  all the way back to  2005, were  breached. 21  _ January  2020  UniCredit (IT) victim of a  data breach leaking 3  million records. 19  _ November  The smart camera provider  Wyze (US) suffered two  breaches at the end of  December when databases  were left exposed for over  two weeks. 20  _ December  2019  5  Facebook (US) reported a  data breach exposing 540  million user records on  exposed servers. 12  _ April  First American Financial  Corp. (US) leaked hundreds  of millions of title  insurance records. 13  _ May  Personal information from  Capital One (US) credit card  customers breached. 15  _ July  100 million records  exposed by unauthorised  access to a data storage  from Evite customers. 14  _ June  An unprotected Google (US)  cloud server containing the  personal data of 200 million  US residents. 22  _ February  Biometric solutions  company Antheus  Tecnologia (BR)  suffered from a data  leak. 23  _ March  Hackers obtained the  login details from two  Marriott (US) employees  and broke into the  system in January 2020. 24  _ April  6  Trends  _The cost of a data breach for  organisations spreads over many years  Security researchers found that one third of the costs related to a data  breach are incurred more than 1 year after the incident. In more detail,  around 22% of these costs are incurred in the second year, while 11% of  the costs are accounted for more than 2 years after the initial incident.  These rates were higher for highly regulated organisations, such as those  in financial services and healthcare, in comparison with other sectors. 3  The adoption of cloud or multi-cloud environments is increasing rapidly  similar to the amount of data stored and processed in these  environments.  _Small mistakes could lead to big  breaches  Securing the cloud environment without losing all the flexibility it brings to  the infrastructure and resources can be problematic. A single  misconfiguration can result in exposing the entire sensitive database. A  security researcher believes that majority of data breaches in the cloud  are a result of misconfiguration and they are mostly unintentional. Netflix,  Ford and TD Bank are only few examples among many others. From a  different perspective, although data breaches resulting from malicious  attempts still cost more, breaches caused by system glitches or human  errors still represent a considerable cost on average US $3,24 million (ca.  €2,74 million). 3  7  _Data breaches cost more to small  business  The cost of data breaches to enterprises or large organisation with more  than 25.000 employees is US $204 (ca. €173) per employee. The total  amount estimation at  around US $5,11 million (ca. €4,33 million). In  contrast, for small companies (500-1.000 employees) the average cost is  around US $3.533 (ca. €3.000) per employee. This represents a total cost  of US $2,65 million (ca. €2,24 million) for small businesses. 3  Malicious/threat actors are known to be the ones pulling the string in  data breaches (bearing in mind that sometimes they may be the result of  a mistake). In that sense, external threat actors are the main cause of  data breaches, and this could include activities such as botnets   . In this  regard, financial gain has been repeatedly identified as the main  motivation behind data breaches facilitated by these groups of actors.  Espionage   also was one of the key motives behind data breaches but  not as high up the list as personal or financial gain. This trend was almost  consistent with the results observed in 2010-2011. 5  _ Financial gain is the prime motivation  etl-2020-botnet etl-2020-cyberespionage  Cryptography requirements play a vital role in the quantum-computing  era and highlight critical security issues. 72% of organisations believe that  quantum computing will affect their crypto related operations  strategically (in the next 5 years). According to the results of the survey,  92% of respondents are concerned about the exposure of sensitive data  by using this technology in the computing industry. The main strategies  respondents suggested for tackling such concerns were changing the  security architecture and deploying key managements infrastructures. 26  _ Quantum-computing and data security  concerns  8  Trends  _Healthcare - a consistent focus for  malicious actors  Healthcare continued to be one of the most attractive targets for  cybercriminals using ransomware   and phishing   techniques costing such  organisations millions of euros to contain and recover from the impact. In  2019, 400 healthcare companies reported a data breach in patient  records. This was a record for healthcare organisations. 7  _Multi-cloud - the new challenge for data  security  A survey conducted by a security researcher reported that 9 out of 10  companies are thinking of using or already using cloud environments.  Approximately 44% of their responders also believe that these  environments are challenging for implementing proper data security  measures. 25  etl-2020-ransomware etl2020-phishing  9  __Types of data exposed (%)  Type of data 2019 2018 2017  E-mail 70 44 32  Password 64 39 27  Name 23 37 41  Miscellaneous 18 19 15  Social security number 11 22 27  Credit card 11 16 19  Address 11 22 30  Account 10 7 4  Unknown 8 13 18  Date of birth 8 13 12  Medical 5 9 7  Financial 5 13 19  Source: Cyber Risk Analytics 8  10  Trends  According to a security report, a decrease in point of sale and card-  skimming breaches (where card is presented) was identified during 2019.  This represents a shift from traditional ATM skimming   and card  payments to web application in retail industry. Although the number of  incidents decreased in this area, is not an accurate to conclude that the  number of data breaches decrease rather but a shift in the vector. The  decrease though might be related to a wider implementation of chip and  pin enabled cards/terminals (also known as EMV). 6  _Continuous decrease in ‘card-present’  breaches  According to a security researcher, healthcare organisations should be  prepared for a 10%-15% increase in the number of data breaches, in which  their service providers will be the main target 7 . More generally, based on  the results from the first 6 months of 2019, it is expected that the number  of data breaches will increase at an alarming rate, despite the awareness  of senior leaders and the effort that many organisations are putting into to  secure their data. 8  _What to expect in the near future?  etl-2020-physical  11  _Data breaches by sector and organization size  Source: Verizon DBIR, 20195  Incidents Breaches Small Large Unknown  Accommodation 61 34 7 20  Administrative 17 6 6 5  Agriculture 2 2 0 0  Construction 11 7 3 1  Education 99 14 8 77  Entertainment 10 2 3 5  Finance 207 26 19 162  Healthcare 304 29 25 250  Information 155 20 18 117  Management 2 1 1 0  Manufacturing 87 10 22 55  Mining 15 2 5 8  Other services 54 6 5 43  Professional 157 34 10 113  Public 330 17 83 230  Real Estate 14 6 3 5  Retail 139 46 19 74  Trade 16 4 8 4  Transportation 36 3 9 24  Utilities 8 2 0 6  Unknown 289 0 109 180  Total 2.013 271 363 1,379  12  Attack vectors   E-MAIL/PHISHING. Impersonating a third-party supplier or a partner  using e-mail is an easy win for the malicious actors. This is known to be  the vector most often used by cybercriminals to target their victims and  the cause of most of data breaches (almost 40% of breaches in  healthcare ). 7,   CLOUD/WEB APPLICATIONS. This reflects web applications being used  as a vector for attempts by malicious actors to breach data or critical  operations. Stealing credentials to access web-based e-mail portals is a  prime example. Exploiting weaknesses in application servers to  inject/deliver information-stealing malware or formjacking attacks are  other examples in this vector.    INSIDER THREAT. This mainly refers to unauthorised or malicious  attempts to use resources. It should be noted that generally in analysis  and reporting misconfiguration or mistakes (human error) by internal  teams may also be referred to as ‘insiders’. Although most data  breaches are facilitated by external malicious actors, it is still the case  that insiders with or without privileged access are playing a key role in  data breaches. 5  Entities involved in a breach.

Provide  training and simulation scenarios for identifying social engineering  and phishing campaigns for staff. 7   Establish and maintain an incident response team and evaluate  incident response plans frequently. 3   Identify and classify sensitive/personal data and apply measures for  encrypting such data in transit and at rest. 3 In other words deploy  data loss prevention capabilities.   Increase investment in detection and alerting tools and in the ability  to contain and respond to a data breach.   Develop and maintain strong policies enforcing strong passwords  (password management) and the use of multi-factor authentication.   Consider using models that take the ‘least privilege’ approach to  provide security for both on- and off-premises resources (i.e. zero-  trust models).   Invest and create policies and plans for engaging with governance,  risk management and compliance teams. 26  15  “During the next  decade, cybersecurity  risks will become  harder to assess and  interpret due to the  growing complexity of  the threat landscape,  adversarial ecosystem  and expansion of the  attack surface.” in ETL 2020  References  1. “What is data breach?” Norton. https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-privacy-data-breaches- what-you-need-to-know.html  2. “What is data breach?” Malwarebytes.  https://www.malwarebytes.com/data-breach/  3. “Cost of Data Breach Report.” 2019.

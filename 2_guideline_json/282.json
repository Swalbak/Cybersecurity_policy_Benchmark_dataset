In order to thrive in business  during the pandemic many SMEs  had to take business continuity  measures, such as adopting to  cloud services, improving their  internet services, upgrading their  websites and enabling staff to  work remotely.  This leaflet provides SMEs with  practical 12 high level steps  on how to better secure their  systems and their business. It is  a companion publication to the  more detailed ENISA report  “Cybersecurity for SMES –  Challenges and  Recommendations”.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-report-cybersecurity-for-smes https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-report-cybersecurity-for-smes https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-report-cybersecurity-for-smes  1DEVELOP GOOD  CYBERSECURITY  CULTURE  ASSIGN MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY Good cybersecurity is a key element in the ongoing success of any SME.  Responsibility for this critical function should be assigned to someone  within the organization who should ensure appropriate resources such  as time from personnel, the purchasing of cybersecurity software,  services and hardware, training for staff, and the development  of effective policies are given to cybersecurity.  GAIN EMPLOYEE BUY-IN Gain employee buy-in through effective communication on  cybersecurity from management, by management openly supporting  cybersecurity initiatives, appropriate trainings delivered to employees,  and providing employees with clear and specific rules outlined in  cybersecurity policies.  2  PUBLISH CYBERSECURITY POLICIES Clear and specific rules should be outlined in cybersecurity  policies for employees on how they are expected to behave  when using the company’s ICT environment, equipment  and services. These policies should also highlight the  consequences an employee could face should they not  adhere to the policies. The policies need to be regularly  reviewed and updated.  REMEMBER DATA  PROTECTION Under the EU General Data Protection  Regulation1 any SMEs that process or  store personal data belonging to EU/EEA  residents need to ensure that appropriate  security controls are in place to protect that  data. This includes ensuring that any third  parties working on behalf of the SME have  appropriate security measures in place.  1 General Data Protection Regulation https:// ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en  CONDUCT CYBERSECURITY  AUDITS Regular audits should be carried out by  those with the appropriate knowledge,  skills and experience. Auditors should be  independent, be it an outside contractor  or internal to the SME and independent  of daily IT operations.  3  2 3 PROVIDE  APPROPRIATE  TRAINING  ENSURE  EFFECTIVE  THIRD PARTY  MANAGEMENTProvide regular cybersecurity awareness trainings for all  employees to ensure they can recognize and deal with the  various cybersecurity threats. These trainings should be  tailored for SME’s and focus on real-life situations.  Provide specialized cybersecurity training for those  responsible for managing cybersecurity within the  business to ensure they will have the skills and  competencies required to do their job.  Ensure that all vendors, particularly those with  access to sensitive data and/or systems, are  actively managed and meet agreed levels of  security. Contractual agreements should be  in place to regulate how vendors meet those  security requirements.  4  4 5 DEVELOP  AN INCIDENT  RESPONSE  PLAN  SECURE  ACCESS TO  SYSTEMS  Develop a formal incident response plan,  which contains clear guidelines, roles and  responsibilities documented to ensure  that all security incidents are responded  to in a timely, professional and appropriate  manner. To respond quickly to security  threats, investigate tools that could monitor  and create alerts when suspicious activity  or security breaches are occurring.  Encourage everyone to use a passphrase, a collection of at least  three random common words combined into a phrase that  provide a very good combination of memorability and security. If you opt for a typical password:    Make it long, with lower and upper case characters, possibly  also numbers and special characters.    Avoid obvious, such as “password”, sequences of letters  or numbers like “abc”, numbers like “123”.    Avoid using personal info that can be found online.  And whether you use passphrases or passwords    Do not reuse them elsewhere.   Do not share them with colleagues.   Enable Multi-Factor Authentication.   Use a dedicated password manager.  5  SECURE  DEVICES  Keeping the devices staff use, be  their desktop PCs, laptops, tablets,  or smartphones, secure is a key step  in a cybersecurity program.  KEEP SOFTWARE PATCHED  AND UP TO DATE Ideally using a centralized platform  to manage patching.  It is highly  recommended  for SMEs to:    Regularly update all of their software.   Turn on automatic updates  whenever possible.    Identify software and hardware that  requires manual updates.    Take into account mobile and IoT devices.  ANTI-VIRUS A centrally managed anti-virus solution  should be implemented on all types of  devices and kept up-to-date in order to  ensure its continuous effectiveness. Also,  do not install pirated software as it may  contain malware.  6 EMPLOY EMAIL AND WEB  PROTECTION TOOLS Employ solutions to block spam emails,  email-containing links to malicious  websites, emails containing malicious  attachments such as viruses, and  phishing emails.  ENCRYPTION  Protect data by encrypting it. SMEs  should ensure the data stored on  mobile devices such as laptops,  smartphones, and tables are  encrypted. For data transferred  over public networks, such as hotel  or airport WiFi networks, ensure  that data is encrypted, either by  employing a Virtual Private Network  (VPN) or accessing websites over  secure connections using SSL/TLS  protocol. Ensure their own websites  are employing suitable encryption  technology to protect client data as  it travels over the Internet.  6  EMPLOY FIREWALLS Firewalls manage the traffic that enters and leaves a network  and are a critical tool in protecting SMEs systems. Firewalls  should be deployed to protect all critical systems, in particular  a firewall should be employed to protect the SME’s network  from the Internet.  REVIEW REMOTE ACCESS SOLUTIONS SMEs should regularly review any remote access tools to ensure  they are secure, particularly:  Ensure all remote access software is patched and up date.  Restrict remote access from suspicious geographical  locations or certain IP addresses.  Restrict staff remote access only to the systems and  computers they need for their work.  Enforce strong passwords for remote access and where  possible enable multi-factor authentication.  Ensure monitoring and alerting is enabled to warn  of suspected attacks or unusual suspicious activity.  7SECURE  YOUR  NETWORK  IMPLEMENT MOBILE DEVICE  MANAGEMENT When facilitating staff to work remotely many SMEs  allow staff to use their own laptops, tablet and/ or smartphones. This introduces several security  concerns about sensitive business data stored  on those devices. One way to manage this risk is  to employ a Mobile Device Management  (MDM)  solution, allowing SMEs to:    Control what devices are allowed to access its  systems and services.    Ensure the device has up to date anti-virus  software installed.    Determine if the device is encrypted.   Confirm if the device has up to date software  patches installed.    Enforce the device is protected by a PIN  and/or a password.    Remotely wipe any SME data from the  device should the device owner report  it lost or stolen, or if the device owner’s  employment was to end with the SME.  7  Appropriate physical controls should be employed  wherever important information resides. A company  laptop or a smartphone, for instance, should not be  left unattended in the back seat of a car. Anytime a  user walks away from their computer they should  lock it. Otherwise, enable auto-lock function on any  device used for business purposes. Sensitive printed  documents should also not be left unattended and  when not in use, securely stored away.  8 9IMPROVE  PHYSICAL  SECURITY  SECURE  BACKUPS  To enable the recovery of key formation, backups  should be maintained as they are an effective way to  recover from disasters such as a ransomware attack.  The following backup rules should apply:    backup is regular and automated whenever possible,   backup is held separately from the SME’s  production environment,    backups are encrypted, especially if they are going  to be moved between locations,    the ability to regularly restore data from the backups  is tested. Ideally, a regular test of a full restore from  start to finish should be done.  8  ENGAGE WITH  THE CLOUD While offering many advantages, cloud based solutions do  present some unique risks, which SMEs should consider before  engaging with a cloud provider. ENISA have published a “Cloud  Security Guide for SMEs”2 which SMEs should refer to when  migrating to the cloud.  When selecting a cloud provider, SME should ensure it does  not breach any laws or regulations by storing data, especially  personal data, outside of the EU/EEA. For example, the EU GDPR  requires that personal data of residents within the EU/EEA is not  stored or transmitted outside of the EU/EEA unless under very  specific conditions.  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-security-guide-for-smes  10  9  11 12  SECURE  ONLINE  SITES  SEEK AND  SHARE  INFORMATION It is essential that SMEs ensure that their online websites  are configured and maintained in a secure manner  and that any personal data or financial details, such  as credit card data, is appropriately protected. This  will entail running regular security tests against the  websites to identify any potential security weaknesses  and conducting regular reviews to ensure the site is  maintained and updated properly.  An effective tool in the fight against cybercrime is the  sharing of information. The sharing of information in  relation to cybercrime is key to SMEs to better understand  the risks they face. Firms that hear about cybersecurity  challenges, and how those challenges were overcome,  from their peers will more likely take steps to secure their  systems than if they were to hear similar details from  industry reports or from cybersecurity surveys.  10  EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY  FOR CYBERSECURITY  ENISA European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  Athens Office Ethnikis Antistaseos 72 &  Agamemnonos 14,  Chalandri 15231, Attiki, Greece  enisa.europa.eu  Heraklion Office 95 Nikolaou Plastira 700 13 Vassilika Vouton,  Heraklion, Greece  ABOUT ENISA The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is the Union’s agency  dedicated to achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe.

The target of the survey is 51 TSPs corresponding to 20 EU Member States and its focus has been the  services whose provision will be regulated in the new Regulation:   Validation of electronic signatures (eValidation)   Long time preservation of electronic signatures   Electronic Time Stamp   Electronic documents admissibility (eDocument)   Electronic delivery services (eDelivery)  The survey has addressed several issues of the services that are been offered: security practices,  imlemented standards and risk analysis. Out of all the conclusions and recommendations, these ones  have been considered the most relevant2:   REC.1/R: Most of the TSPs participating in the survey have already adhered to national CSP  (Certificates Service Providers) certification schemas. It is recommended to extend these  schemas to other Trust services to have harmonized criteria of QoS (Quality of Service)  assessment and SLA (Service Level Agreement) guidelines.   REC.2/R: Promote Trusted Marks assessed against eIDAS requirements that would be  recognised across borders.   REC.3/R: Cross-border interoperability of credentials has to be promoted, mainly e-singature.   REC.7/P: Full adoption of e-signature format standards by TSPs should be reached in order to  be capable to validate any of them.   REC.6/R: Specific BCM (Business Continuity Management) standards should be adopted in the  provision of trusted services.   REC.8/P: The use of internationally trusted main time sources and the definition of best  practices to standardize the QoS through SLAs must be promoted.   REC.12/P: Focus on user training and consciousness of threats to prevent ‘Web site / service  impersonation’ threat has to be targetted.   Other recommendations intend to reduce the higher reported risks:  o REC.11/P Relay on qualifiedqualified certificate revocation information (mainly in  eValidation services)  o REC.10/P Use 2 hash algorithms to prevent Evolution of cryptography (mainly in Long  Time Preservation services)  o REC.6/R Prevent Unavailability of service through BCM (mainly in eValidation services)  1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0238:FIN:en:PDF  2 See full list in Section 6. The letter following the recommendation number indicates the category of  stakeholder with higher responsibility on its implementation: Trust Service Providers (P), the  Regulators/Supervisors (R) or the Customers of TSP (C).  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0238:FIN:en:PDF  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  v  o REC.4/P Promote end-to-end encryption to prevent Web site / service impersonation (in  several services)  The document is divided in 3 different sections: Services, Standards, and Risks.

Art. 15 of the proposed Regulation establishes certain provisions regarding the security  requirements applicable to trust service providers.  In order to facilitate the implementation of this provision, as well as to generally support trust  service providers (TSP) in the introduction of security best practices, the European Union Agency for  Network and Information Security (ENISA) is working in 2013 on a series of studies on the security  aspects of trust service providers issuing electronic certificates, as well as on the security and  interoperability aspects specific to the new trust services foreseen in the proposed Regulation.  The definition of “trust service” in the EU Regulation is quite wide, since it theorically covers all  combinations of the services applied over the objects shown in the Table 1 below.  Table 1: Trust services as defined in the EU Regulation  ENISA has conducted a survey about the security mechanisms used by TSPs in Europe, and their  interoperability. This survey was addressed to every current TSP that is offering, or intending to offer  in the future, any of the services identified in the proposed Regulation. In order to simplify the  combinations of services over objects, only those services most frequently referenced in  eGovernment applications have been included in the survey:   Electronic certificates, including e-Signature ones (summarized in other ENISA reports4)   Electronic time stamps (creation and handling)   Electronically signed documents storage or management (creation, handling or preservation)   Electronic delivery of eDocuments services (handling, preservation)   Validation of electronic signatures (documents, certificates, seals, websites)   Longtime preservation of electronic signatures (documents, time stamps)  3 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0238:FIN:en:PDF  4 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/trust-services  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0238:FIN:en:PDF  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  2  1.1 Background information  1.1.1 Motivation  In its Work Programme 2013 ENISA has divided its work into Work Packages; this project is related in  particular with its Work Package 1.2. The purpose of this work package is to identify the risks and  threats trust services European infrastructure is exposed to. Such risks/threats can emerge both  from the technologies and services themselves (like bad design, improper coding, etc.) and from  their improper usage. Besides the risks and threats, wherever possible the opportunities should also  be identified, as this is key to taking advantage of new models for security controls and new usages  of existing controls.  1.1.2 Legal and policy background  Herein follow some relevant legal initiatives relevant to this project:  - On 4 June 2012, the European Commission published a new draft EU regulation on  \"electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market\"5 that is meant to extend the existing e-Signatures Directive to include new services  such as e-time-stamping or e-seals that would guarantee the origin and the integrity of an  electronic document. The proposed Regulation will ensure people and businesses can use  their own national electronic identification schemes (e-IDs) to access public services in other  EU countries where e-IDs are available.  In order to analyse the impact of the  implementation of this new Regulation, the Commission made two studies:  o Study to support the implementation of a pan-European framework on electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market  (SMART 2012/0001)6.  o Impact assessment7 of the new regulation  - Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the accessibility of  public sector bodies' websites8  - European eGovernment Action Plan 2011-20159. The European Commission aims to support  the provision of a new generation of eGovernment services for businesses and citizens. The  Action Plan identifies four political priorities based on the Malmö Declaration10, agreed on  18 November 2009.  5 http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number10.11/ec-proposal-electronic-identity  http://eur- lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?checktexts=checkbox&checktexte=checkbox&val=679649%3Acs&pos=1&page=1&la ng=en&pgs=10&nbl=1&list=679649%3Acs%2C&hwords=&action=GO&visu=%23texte  6 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=8363  7  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/eu_legislation/regulation/index_en.htm  8 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=9125  9 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/european-egovernment-action-plan-2011-2015  10  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/ministerial-declaration-on-egovernment- malmo.pdf  http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number10.11/ec-proposal-electronic-identity http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?checktexts=checkbox&checktexte=checkbox&val=679649%3Acs&pos=1&page=1&lang=en&pgs=10&nbl=1&list=679649%3Acs%2C&hwords=&action=GO&visu=%23texte http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?checktexts=checkbox&checktexte=checkbox&val=679649%3Acs&pos=1&page=1&lang=en&pgs=10&nbl=1&list=679649%3Acs%2C&hwords=&action=GO&visu=%23texte http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?checktexts=checkbox&checktexte=checkbox&val=679649%3Acs&pos=1&page=1&lang=en&pgs=10&nbl=1&list=679649%3Acs%2C&hwords=&action=GO&visu=%23texte http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=8363 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/eu_legislation/regulation/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=9125 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/european-egovernment-action-plan-2011-2015 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/ministerial-declaration-on-egovernment-malmo.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/ministerial-declaration-on-egovernment-malmo.pdf  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  3  - Communication from the Commission to the EU Parliament, the Council, the EU Economic  and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions “Towards interoperability for  European public services”11  1.2 State of the art  The aim of this section is to summarise the information collected during the desktop research phase  of the project, showing the projects that provide or use trust services. In the context of the project it  has been used to select some stakeholders to contribute, validate and/or disseminate the results of  the analysis made of the status of the TSPs security in EU, and to identify some relevant regulatory  actions. It is provided just for information purpose.  1.2.1 Relevant activities in EU:  World e-ID Congress12 has become in eight years a key event gathering over 350 e-ID programs  managers, government officials and technology experts around world’s major e-ID projects, policies  trends and latest innovations.  The Commission launched a study on collaborative production in eGovernment (SMART  2010/0075)13. As part of this collaborative activities, the Commmission has developed Open e- Prior14, open source version of e-Prior software, for e-Procurement services in the Public sector,  freely available for the EU public administrations.  1.2.2 EU funded Large Scale Pilots  The Build/Connect/Grow15 EU magazine identifies the following Large Scale Pilots16:  - Secure Identity Across Borders Linked (STORK II17). STORK simplifies bureaucratic hurdles  and administrative delays to provide citizens and the business community with easy but  secure access to their benefits and administrative records no matter where they are in  Europe. Within this overarching framework, there are pilots dedicated to:  o Cross-border authentication for electronic services;  o Providing safer internet chat for children and adolescents;  o Facilitating mobility for university students seeking to study abroad within Europe;  o Developing cross-border mechanisms for secure online delivery of documents; and  o Assisting people formalize a cross-border change-of-address.  11 COM(2010) 744 final:  http://www.epractice.eu/files/Towards%20interoperability%20for%20European%20public%20services%20-  %20Commission%20Communication.pdf  12 http://www.worlde-idcongress.com/call-for-papers-2013  13 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=9141  14 http://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/openeprior/forum/all  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHGI7re4Q_k  http://www.peppol.eu/news/news_repository/open-e-prior-release  15 http://www.buildconnectgrow.net/en/build?load=build/infographics-build  16 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/egovernment  17 https://www.eid-stork.eu/  http://www.epractice.eu/files/Towards%20interoperability%20for%20European%20public%20services%20-%20Commission%20Communication.pdf http://www.epractice.eu/files/Towards%20interoperability%20for%20European%20public%20services%20-%20Commission%20Communication.pdf http://www.worlde-idcongress.com/call-for-papers-2013 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=9141 http://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/openeprior/forum/all http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHGI7re4Q_k http://www.peppol.eu/news/news_repository/open-e-prior-release http://www.buildconnectgrow.net/en/build?load=build/infographics-build http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/egovernment https://www.eid-stork.eu/  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  4  - SPOCS 18  (Simple Procedures Online for Cross-Border Services) has made significant  achievements, from establishing ‘Document Equivalence’ between national administrations  to enhancing ‘semantic interoperability’ (making different countries understand each other  and work together digitally). Furthermore, they highlighted areas requiring improvement,  notably in terms of abolishing legal barriers and addressing public misconceptions of the  security of electronic information transfers.  - Despite the completion of the Pan-European Public Procurement Online (PEPPOL19) project  in August 2012, a number of public and private members of the PEPPOL community  committed themselves to further drive adoption of standardised eProcurement solutions –  encompassing eAttestations, eCatalogues, eOrders, eInvoices and eSignature validation and  an open document exchange network – with the creation of OpenPEPPOL. OpenPEPPOL is a  non-profit international association of public and private PEPPOL community members.  - e-CODEX20 “e-Justice Communication via Online Data Exchange” Cooperating with other  LSPs in the fields of eDelivery, ePayments, eDocuments, eID and eSignatures, e-CODEX will  demonstrate how the building blocks for cross-border interoperability can be implemented  in numerous domains, including e-Justice. Two pilots are developed under this project:  o The European Arrest Warrant (EAW) requires a national executing judicial authority to  recognise requests for the surrender of a person made by the judicial authority of  another Member State (the issuing judicial authority) for the purposes of prosecution.  o Mutual Recognition of Financial Penalties.  Previously, many offences – ranging from  simple road traffic offences to organised crime – went unpunished due to their  transnational nature.  With this pilot, financial penalties imposed against an offender in  a foreign country can follow them to their home country, with their domestic  authorities being tasked to collect the penalty. The pilot is currently being developed for  three EU Member States – France, Germany and the Netherlands.  - Smart Open Services for European Patients (epSOS21) ensures those European travellers are  well cared for. It provides standards for the exchange of medical information, thereby  leading to informed health care and a safe continuity of treatment.  1.2.3 Other EU funded projects  EU security projects funded by the FP722 include the following, which are quite closely related to  trusted eIDAS and e-Government:  - ABC4Trust23 Attribute-based Credentials for Trust  - FutureID -- Shaping the Future of Electronic Identity  - Primelife24 Privacy and Identity Management in Europe for Life  - PICOS25 Privacy and identity management for community services  18 http://www.eu-spocs.eu/  19 http://www.peppol.eu/  20 http://www.e-codex.eu/  21  http://www.epsos.eu/  22 http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/security/projects_en.html#TSI  23 https://abc4trust.eu/  24 http://www.primelife.eu/  25 http://www.picos-project.eu/  http://www.eu-spocs.eu/ http://www.peppol.eu/ http://www.e-codex.eu/ http://www.epsos.eu/ http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/security/projects_en.html#TSI https://abc4trust.eu/ http://www.primelife.eu/ http://www.picos-project.eu/  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  5  - GINI-SA26 Global Identity Networking of Individuals - Support Action  - SWIFT27 Secure widespread identities for federated Telecommunications  - OPTET28 OPerational Trustworthiness Enabling Technologies  - TURBINE29 Trusted revocable biometric identities  - CUMULUS30 Certification infrastrUcture for MUlti-Layer cloUd Services  - BEST31  - SIGNEO32  - SABRINA33  From the previous Framework Programme we can mention the following initiatives:  - BRITE Business Register Interoperability Throughout Europe  - EEPOCH34 eEurope Smart Card Charter proof of concept and holistic solution  - PRIME Privacy and Identity Management for Europe  - FIDIS Future of Identity in the Information Society  Another interesting programme was the IDABC35 where two relevant studies were produced, one on  eID, and another (PEGS36) on e-Signature recognition in e-Government.  1.2.4 CIP PSP  There is an initiative to build a Thematic Network for European eID (SSEDIC37)  The objective of this network is to provide a platform for all the stakeholders of eID (electronic  identity) to work together and collaborate to prepare the agenda for a proposed Single European  Digital Identity Community as envisaged by the Digital Agenda (DAE) in its Key Action 16  They have launched a survey on the use of eID of different kind and also to retrieve the opinion of  the citizens about the use of eSignature and Privacy:  http://ivox.socratos.net/l.0/1d3aDfnkc4k6rSj7at4tmNXMVVy3uy  It’s also worth to mention the CIP project:  SEMIRAMIS38 Secure Management of Information across multiple Stakeholders  26  http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=ICT_UNIFIEDSRCH&ACTION=D&DOC=3598&CAT=PROJ&QUERY=01256 6805427:fddf:67bd9cf8&RCN=95534  27 http://www.ist-swift.org/content/view/23/32/  28 http://cordis.europa.eu/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=proj.document&PJ_RCN=13272191  29 http://www.turbine-project.eu/  30 http://cordis.europa.eu/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=proj.document&PJ_RCN=13156501  31 http://www.bestnw.eu/  32 http://www.bitoceans.com/  33 http://www.sabrina.uni-karlsruhe.de/  34  http://www.eepoch.netl  35 http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/6484.html  36 http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/6485.html  37 http://www.eid-ssedic.eu/  38 http://ec.europa.eu/information  society/apps/projects/facts heetlindex.cfm?project ref-250453  http://ivox.socratos.net/l.0/1d3aDfnkc4k6rSj7at4tmNXMVVy3uy http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=ICT_UNIFIEDSRCH&ACTION=D&DOC=3598&CAT=PROJ&QUERY=012566805427:fddf:67bd9cf8&RCN=95534 http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=ICT_UNIFIEDSRCH&ACTION=D&DOC=3598&CAT=PROJ&QUERY=012566805427:fddf:67bd9cf8&RCN=95534 http://www.ist-swift.org/content/view/23/32/ http://cordis.europa.eu/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=proj.document&PJ_RCN=13272191 http://www.turbine-project.eu/ http://cordis.europa.eu/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=proj.document&PJ_RCN=13156501 http://www.bestnw.eu/ http://www.bitoceans.com/ http://www.sabrina.uni-karlsruhe.de/ http://www.eepoch.netl/ http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/6484.html http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/6485.html http://www.eid-ssedic.eu/ http://ec.europa.eu/information  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  6  1.2.5 Relevant communities  There are several communities identified in the JOINUP39 portal funded by the Commission. Here are  some of the most relevant to this project:  - The National Interoperability Framework Observatory (NIFO40), one of the projects from the  EC's ISA program (Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations), is  intended to provide assistance  - This group is for developer and integrators who are integrating peppol41. The idea is to share  knowledge, exchange ideas and general discussion on E-invoice system.  - IDABC42  - Greek eGovernment Interoperability Framework, eGIF43  1.2.6 Activities outside the EU  NSTIC44: National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace. Five U.S. organizations will pilot  identity solutions that increase confidence in online transactions, prevent identity theft, and provide  individuals with more control over how they share their personal information:  - The Cross Sector Digital Identity Initiative (CSDII) lead by the American Association of Motor  Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) will implement a secure online identity ecosystem that will  lead to safer transactions by enhancing privacy and reducing the risk of fraud in online  commerce.  - The Criterion pilot will allow consumers to selectively share shopping and other preferences  and information to both reduce fraud and enhance the user experience.  - The Daon pilot will demonstrate how senior citizens and all consumers can benefit from a  digitally connected, consumer friendly Identity Ecosystem. The pilot will employ user- friendly identity solutions that leverage smart mobile devices.  - The Resilient pilot seeks to demonstrate that sensitive health and education transactions on  the Internet can earn patient and parent trust by using a Trust Network built around privacy- enhancing encryption technology to provide secure, multifactor, on-demand identity  proofing and authentication across multiple sectors.  - UCAID, known publicly as Internet2, intends to build a consistent and robust privacy  infrastructure through common attributes; user-effective privacy managers; anonymous  credentials; and Internet2's InCommon Identity Federation service; and to encourage the  use of multifactor authentication and other technologies.  NSTIC also Launched in August 2012, the Identity Ecosystem Steering Group (IDESG), which includes  volunteer companies, organizations and individuals dedicated to promoting the creation of  standards and policies that will accelerate the development and adoption of the Identity Ecosystem.  39 https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/all  40  https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/nifo/home  41 https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/pid/home  42 https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/idabc/home  43 https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/greek-egif/home  44 http://www.nist.gov/nstic/pilot-projects.html  http://www.nist.gov/nist-exit-script.cfm?url=http://www.idecosystem.org/ https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/all https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/nifo/home https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/pid/home https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/idabc/home https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/greek-egif/home http://www.nist.gov/nstic/pilot-projects.html  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  7  1.2.7 Non-EU projects  To finish, it is worth to mention some projects from outside EU that are relevant to eIDAS and TSP:  Non-profit-organizations/initiatives:  - Central Authentication Service Project  - Identity Commons  - Kantara Initiative  - Open Identity Exchange  - eID working group  - OpenID  Open Source projects/initiatives:  - OAuth  - OAuth 2.0  - OpenSocial  - Portable Contacts  - Information Cards  - The Pamela Project  - simpleSAMLphp  - Shibboleth  - OSIS  file:///C:/Users/medinma/Documents/13%20WPK1.2/eID%20&amp;%20Data%20Protection/DG%20Conn/eID%20schemes.doc%23_Non-profit-organizations/initiative file:///C:/Users/medinma/Documents/13%20WPK1.2/eID%20&amp;%20Data%20Protection/DG%20Conn/eID%20schemes.doc%23_Open_Source_Projects  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  8  2 Methodology  This report collects the results of the survey launched by ENISA about the current security practices  implemented by the newly regulated trust services in the EU, whilst other reports of ENISA45 have  analysed the results of the eSignature and e-Seal related services, including the certificates that  enable them and their application to e-Documents or Web-Sites.  This report describes the answers of the TSPs to that survey and the conclusions regarding the  different issues related to the new trust services they provide, the security and interoperability  mechanisms they implement, and the assessment of the different risks they face.  The survey was launched mainly to the relevant TSPs accredited in the Trust-Service Status List  (TSL46) published by the Supervising authorities, as well as some private contacts of the authors of  this report. Amongst those, relevant representatives of the most relevant ones from each MS were  contacted directly by the authors, in order to guarantee that they would contribute to the survey.  The survey obtained 67 answers, of which 51 were considered valid, since several answers were  merged as they referred to different services from the same TSP, and some others were from  providers outside the EU. Finally, only the replies which included complete and consistent  information were taken into consideration. The main background information about the participants  is:   The TSPs are from the following countries: Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia,  Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland,  Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and United Kingdom.   93% of the TSPs participating in the survey are also Qualified Certificate Service Providers  (CSP). This may be because most of the TSPs invited to participate in the survey were  contacted via TSL and the national supervising authorities, that in most of the cases reported  that only have official records of the qualified CSP. So, since invitations were made mainly  through national regulators of certification service providers and the trust services lists they  elaborate, and since till now only the CSP TSP are regulated, TSPs not providing CSP are not  in those TSL and the national regulators neither keep records of them, since their services  are not regulated.  2.1 Questionnaire  ASIC-S  Simple Associated Signature Container, published by ETSI as TS 102 918  BCM Business Continuity Management  CA Certification Authority  CAdES  CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures , published by ETSI as TS 101 733  CEN European Committee for Standardization  45 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/trust-services  46  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/eu-trusted-lists-certification-service-providers, standard format published by  ETSI as TS 102 231  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/eu-trusted-lists-certification-service-providers  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  9  CEN BII CEN Workshop on 'Business Interoperability Interfaces\"  CRL Certificate Revocation List, see “RFC 5280”  DG  Directorate General  DPA  Data Protection Authority  DSS  OASIS Digital Signature Services  EC European Commission  e-CODEX e-Justice Communication via Online Data Exchange  eID  Electronic Identification  eGov e-Government  eIDAS  electronic Identification and Authentication Service  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  epSOS Smart Open Services for European Patients  eSign electronic Signature  ETSI European Telecommunications Standards Institute  ETSI TS ETSI Technical Specification  EU  European Union  GDPR  General Data Protection Regulation  ICT Information and Communication Technologies  IEC International Electrotechnical Commission  IP Internet Protocol  ISO International Standards Organisation  IT Information Technology  LSP Large Scale Pilots  MS Member State  NCP National Contact Point  NIS Network and Information Security  NRA  National Regulator Authorities  OASIS Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards  OCSP Online Certificate Status Protocol, see “RFC 2560”  PAdES  PDF Advanced Electronic Signature, published by ETSI as TS 102 778  PEPPOL Pan-European Public Procurement Online  PKI Public Key Infrastructure  PoC Point of Contact  QoS Quality of Service  REC Recommendation  SAML Security Assertion Markup Language  SHA Secure Hash Algorithm.

Figure 1: Trust services provided  The results show that only 6% of TSPs participating in the survey are providing only other trust  services than electronic certificates. So the vast majority of TSPs are already complying with current  regulation, and the number of qualified TSPs in the market will not grow excessively with new  regulation.  3.1.2 Which Other trust services?  Figure 2 represents the percentage of implementation for the rest of trust services considered.  14% 6%  80%  Which of the trust services described in the proposed  trust services regulation do you provide or intend to  provide in the future?

The other services are between 60% and 70%.  3.1.3 Certificates scope  Figure 3 represents the span of supported certificates: ‘Only own CSP support’, ‘National CSPs  support’, ‘Partial international support’, ‘Total international support’.  Figure 3: Span of supported certificatescertificates  37% of the TSPs support certificates only from their own CSP, but it is maybe worst to notice that  57% only accept certificates issued in the same country. The conclusion is that the segmentation of  the EU market is very high, as shown in the graphic, and that cross-border interoperability has to be  promoted.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  Electronic time stamps e-Signed documents storage or management  e-Documents delivery services  e-Signed documents signature validation  Long-time preservation of e-Signed Documents  What kind of services do the TSPs provide?  37%  20%  20%  23%  What certificates do the TSPs support in the services  that they provide?

It shows that most of the TSP  participating in the survey provide services to several categories of customers.  Figure 4: type of target customers for trust services  Figure 5 and Figure 6 detail the results of the participants that have selected one of the following  categories of customers:   General Public   Specific Communities   Public Administrations versus Private Sector  1- Figure 5 shows the Results Focused on General Public:  Figure 5: Sectors where services are addressed: General Public view  Amongst those that indicated that they offer the service to General Publice, the provision for ‘Only  General Public’ is residual. Although 40% of TSPs don’t provide their services specifically to General  Public, the combination of ‘General Public and other types’ represents more than 50% of the results.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  General Public Public Administrations  Private sector Specific community  Which sectors are you addressing your services to?  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  Only General Public General Public and other types  Other type than General Public  Which sectors are you addressing your services to?

The bars in the Figure 6 also indicate the percentage of TSPs that are offering services to  ‘specific communities’ within the category. This happens in 3/4 of the TSP offering service  only to Private sector, 1/5 of the providers of only Public Administration and 3/8 of those  that provide service to both sectors:  Figure 6: Sectors where services are addressed: specific communities  3.1.5 Authentication mechanisms  Figure 7 shows the different authentication mechanisms used by TSPs to grant customers access to  their different services.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  Public Administration Private Sector Both Sectors  Which sectors are you addressing your services to?

Amongst those that answered ‘No need for credentials’, 5/6 stated that they also use ‘Electronic  certificates’ and ‘User/password’. There was only one TSP that only answered ‘No need of  credentials’ (and no other mechanism). This was a provider of Certificates and Time Stamp services,  where user authentication is not usually needed. The remaining TSPs use different authentications  mechanisms based on the criticality of the offered service.  In the option ‘Other mechanisms’, the providers answered the following mechanisms:   OTP based in EMV-CAP (1 answer)   PostIdent - German identification process (1 answer)   X-Road (1 answer)   IP address authentication or IP whitelisting (3 answers)   Federated identity (Shibboleth) (1 answer)   Moonshot (1 answer)  3.1.6 How is the service provided?

TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  16  Figure 8: Service provision platform of TSPs  The ‘Government web site’ is rarely used regardless of the type of service (less than 10%). ‘On-line  TSP web site’ is the most common answer for all services (between 70 and 80%), except for Time  Stamp, for which the preferred option is ‘Web service available for automatic processing’.  The graphic also indicates that there are TSPs that use several channels to provide the service.  For security reasons it is recommended to promote the use of web services, to force secure  communication channel with parameters agreed with the TSP in a way transparent to the user.  3.1.7 Storage of Documents  Graphics in Figure 9 indicate whether providers store the documents or not. This information is  compared between the eDocuments signature management and the eDelivering services.  Figure 9: Storage of documents practice.  The results show that most of eDocuments trust providers store the documents (76%), while for  eDelivery this percentage drops to 42%. This difference can be explained by the nature of the  services.  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  A client (desktop) application  A web site (on- line) service of  your own  An e-Government web site  A web service available for automatic processing  How are the services provided?

Figure 10: Information Systems Security management standards adopted/assessed  The results indicate that about 90% of the TSPs that answered this question follow the ‘ISO/IEC  27001’ standard. Only 5 TSPs don’t use it, either because they have local standards for that purpose  (as those developed by the German Federal Office for Information Security BSI) or because the TSPs  are neither a CSP nor a Qualified TSP, so they don’t need to comply with ISO/IEC 27001.  Few TSPs have adopted other relevant standards:   It’s remarkable that the de-facto market standard ‘ISO/IEC 38500 for IT Governance’ is not  implemented at all, probably because it’s not a security standard and it’s not required in the  certification schemas.   It’s also worth mentioning the low adoption of ISO/IEC 22301: Business Continuity Management.  Since one of the most relevant risks identified by the participants in the survey is the  unavailability of the service, and the most relevant incidents in the sector have been related  with service interruptions, specific standards to guarantee the continuity management should be  promoted.  TSPs that have indicated ‘Others standards’ have named the following (although not all of them are  specific to IS Security Management Standards):   ETSI TS 102 042 (1)   BSI Grundschutz (1)   Ministry of Defense Information Security  Policy (1)   ISO 20000 (2)   ETSI 101 456 (4)   Webtrust (3)   ISO/IEC 12207 (1)  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%  100%  ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security  Management)  ISO/IEC 22301 (Business Continuity Management)  ISO/IEC 38500 (IT Governance)  Others  Which general security management standards do you  follow?

Figure 11: Auditing policy  16% of the TSPs stated that they are audited ‘within the scope of a government audit scheme’,  similarly to those that acknowledged that they audited ‘within the scope of an independent /  industry led audit scheme’, with a 21% ratio. Moreover, 49% informed that they are audited ‘within  both scopes’.  96% of providers are regularly audited. Half of them are both audited ‘within the scope of an  independent / industry led audit scheme’ and ‘within the scope a government audit scheme’. Only  4% of the surveyed TSPs indicated that they are not audited. This can come as a result of not offering  qualified services.  Figure 12: Auditing frequency  16%  49%  21%  10% 4%  Is your organization regularly audited?

Only  3 TSPs answered that its frequency was higher than one year; 1 TSP informed of a biannual audit.  Annual audits should reach the 100%.  4.1.3 Documents  Figure 13 shows the answers about the existence of security, risk and continuity policies,  statements, and plans in the surveyed organizations.  Figure 13: Security policy Documents approved  Almost every TSP (96-98%) implements ‘Certification Practice Statement’ and ‘Information Security  Policy’ types. Regarding approved documents, all TSPs providing electronic certificates have the  ‘Certificate Practice Statement’ document implemented. However, the documentation regarding  continuity of services (‘Business Risk Assessment’, ‘Business Continuity Plans’, ‘Incident Response  Plans’) is not fully implemented (about 80%), although it should be.  In the case of ‘Certificate Practice Statement’, 3 TSPs inform that they offer different services than  electronic certificates, but there has been only 1 TSP stating that it doesn’t have a Certificate  Practice Statement, probably because a document describing the use of internal certificates exists.  It is interesting to notice that almost 20%-30% of TSPs do not have ‘Business Risk Assessments’ (BRA)  nor ‘Business Continuity Plans’ (BCP), neither ‘Incident Response Plan’ (IRP), which could be  explained through the consideration of BRA, BCP and IRP as a part of their Information Security  Policy.  Our recommendation regarding continuity of services is that all the documents related with it must  be implemented: ‘Business Risk Assessment’, ‘Business Continuity Plan’ and also ‘Incident Response  Plan’ and ‘CA Termination Plan’ (this last one if applicable).  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  Certification Practice  Statement  Information Security Policy  Job descriptions for Trusted  Roles  Inventory of Assets  Business Risk Assessment  Bussiness Continuity  Plan  Incident Response  Plan  CA Termination  Plan  What kind of approved documents do the TSPs have?

Figure 14: e-signature standards are supported  ‘XAdES‘ is the most supported standard in all services: between 80-90%.  All services have the same series of  standards supported with a similar ratio of coverage: ‘XAdES’  being the most supported one with 80-90% ratios, followed by ‘PKCS#7’, ‘PAdES’ and ‘CAdES’ with a  similar percentage, and finally ‘DSS’ with the least support with 25-30%.  Regardless of the standard, the eDocuments service shows the highest level of support, followed by  the eValidation and the eDelivery service. In order to improve interoperability, all TSPs should be  able to accpet any e-signature standard.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  CAdES XAdES (XML-DSig)  PAdES PKCS#7 DSS  What e-signature standards are supported?  eDocuments  eDelivery  eValidation  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  21  4.3 Electronic time stamp services  4.3.1 Main time source  Thechart in Figure 15 shows the main time source used by the TSP for delivering the service, with a  expected low rate for the Self-generated” time source.  Figure 15: Main time source used for Time Stamp Services  4.3.2 Time stamp format standards  As for the Time Stamp format standards supported by the TSP (See Figure 16) for delivering the  service, all of them support the ‘RFC3161 Time Stamp Protocol’, whilst only 25% of TSPs support the  ‘DSS XML Time Stamp profile’.

Figure 17: Certificate Validation standards supported  4.5 Long Time Preservation standards  Thegraphic in Figure 18 explains long term preservation standards. There is a dispersion of the  standards used:  80% of the TSPs use ‘AdES T’ standard which adds a time stamp, probably used for digital evidences  storage purposes.  75% of the TSPs use ‘AdES XL’ standard which adds CRLs and certificates, probably to allow future  validations.  65% of the TSPs use ‘AdES A’ standard which implies re-signing processes, probably for long time  preservation of e-documents purposes.  The least used standards are ‘AdES C’ (which adds references to certificates and/or CRLs) and ‘AdES  X’ (which adds time stamps to the references of ‘AdES C’). It is remarkable, as AdES C is the format  that adds the lightest information overhead. Nevertheless, with the risk ‘Relay on not-update  certificate revocation information’ for Long Time Preservation Services deemed as almost negligible,  it is just natural that AdES XL is the most widely used for this particular type of service.  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  OCSP CRL  What certificate validation standards are  supported?

TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  24  5 Risk Analysis  This section reflects the results about the type of risks that can compromise the services according  to the experience of the TSPs. The analysis has been made for the ‘type of risk’ point of view in  section 5.1; and looking inside ‘each service’ in section 5.2.  Table 2: Quantitative and qualitative risk values and parameters relative values. Shows on the  leftmost columns the average absolute Risk value and the typical deviation of the Risk calculated for  each of the responses. This absolute Risk value is the result of applying a weight to the qualitative  probability47 and impact48 values selected in the answers, and multiplying them. In a traditional  qualitative risk analysis, those values should be considered as euros of expected loss due to  probability of successful threat with the expected impact, but since each organisation should have  their own probability and most important impact estimations in their particular environment, the  numbers are provided just for comparing the results of one risk with others.  The Deviation has been calculated using the Standard Deviation of the values obtained. In the worst  cases the highest values of the deviation, compared with the risk, show that some answers indicated  relatively low risk and others very high risk. The conclusion of this large deviation of values is that  the environments set up to provide the services are very different, and for this reason the values of  the Risk for those vulnerabilities should be analysed with care. On the contrary, when the standard  deviation is low, we should feel confident that most of the participants agreed on the estimation of  that Risk.  To consolidate the responses given to each type of risk for each service, different calculations have  been made, but toto simplify the results, all the values have been translated / normalized to scales  from 0 to 100, being 100 the worst case49.  Four parameters have been analysed, the lowest values are marked in green, showing that they are  well protected, and the highest in Red, highlighting that they need improvement:  - Impact: It is calculated as the average of all individual impact responses and normalized to 0-  100.  - Probability: It is calculated as the average of all individual probability responses and normalized  to 0-100.  - Risk: It is calculated as the average of all the individual risks calculated from the values provided  by the participants in the survey and normalized to 0-100. Each individual risk value was  previously calculated as the product of the individual impact and the individual probability  - Standard Deviation: Statistical parameter alculated of the Risk values extracted from the  answers of each participant in the survey for every type of risk and service. In general, the  higher Standard deviations (highlighted in orange) corresponds to the higher risk, and those to  the higher probability values.  47  % ranging from very unlikely (1 every 30 years) to Frequent (3 times/year)  48 ranging from very low (2K€) to very high (300K€)  49  From the survey, all the risks have been in general been rated with Medium values (100% only means the  worst between all of them).

This risk is out of TSP’s control because it is difficult to anticipate the  evolution of the cryptographic algorithms.  o ‘The relay on not-updated certificate revocation information’ in eValidation  services. TSPs seem to have taken measures to minimize it because of the  simultaneous use of OCSP and CRLs, but they still don’t rely on the quality of the  information, probably because it is produced out of their control.  This same risk has a significantly lower rate in the rest of services as Long Time  Preservation or eDelivery, probably because these services are offered to customers  close to the service provider, using credentials issued by them.  o ‘Web site / web service impersonation’ (see section 5.1.1 below) for eDocument  related services has also a high risk value because the combination of high impact  and high probability.   Other cases may be highilighted due to large Impact values:  o The 4 cases with the highest impact (and also with the lowest probabilities values)  correspond with the type of risk ‘lose or compromise of service’s signature creation  data’ for the services eDocument, eDelivery, Time Stamping and Long Time  Preservation. The highest impact is the expected answer because of the sensitivity  of the data. The lowest probability shows that security measures have already been  implemented.  o The lowest values for Impact correspond to types of risk related to the ‘main time  source’ in Time Stamp and the type of risk of ‘unavailability of service’ in  eDocument and in eDelivery services.   Other cases may be highilighted due to large probability values:  o Two of the top 4 in highest probabilities are related to ‘unavailability of service’ in  eDocument services and in eValidation services. Business continuity management  has to be promoted for this kind of providers (even if a cloud service provider is  used).  o ‘Unavailability of service’ has a high probability and a low impact score in the 3  main services assessed. It is obvious that these services are more concerned with  confidentiality and integrity than with availability.   It is also worth to mention the cases with higher deviation values in the Time Stamp service:  in the risks ‘Compromise of the main time source’ and ‘Unavailability of the main time  source’ of the Time Stamp Services. This may be due to the lack of uniformity on the way  those services are provided, and then, the differences on the quality of the tools used and  the security mechanisms set in place, are the reasons of those deviations.  5.1 Overview of the risks  This section will analyse those risks that apply to 2 or more services in order to compare them.  A single graphic will be used to represent the values obtained for both Probability and Impact, taking  into account the deviation or dispersion of the answers (represented as the size of the bubbles: the  larger the dispersion, the bigger the bubble size, indicating that the range of values of risk resulting  from the answers is high). In the table below each graphic, the associated risk values are also shown  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  28  and highlighted in Red or Green if they are one of the highest or lowest risk values identified in  the general Table 2 above, and the higher deviations values are highlighted in Orange.  5.1.1 Web site / web service impersonation  Web site / web service impersonation  eDocument eDelivery  Risk Value 66 43  Impact Value 54 45  Probab. Value 64 35  Deviation value 79 82  Table 3: Web site / web service impersonation Risk  Table 3 shows that ‘Web site / web service impersonation’ in eDocument Services rated a little bit  higher in Probability and Impact than for eDelivery Services. The impact for eDocument service is  higher because in some implementations of that service, the impersonation may lead with a higher  probably to document content disclosure.  There is no correspondence with the fact of storing or not the managed eDocuments.

Value 100 64 80  Deviation Value 85 82 78  Table 4: Unavailability of service Risk  Table 4 shows that ‘Unavailability of the service’ is a risk with the high probability of occurrence (in  eDocument service) and low impact (especially in eDocument and eDelivery services).  The low impact perhaps is due to the fact that a denial of this kind of services doesn’t imply any  disclosure of documents; the relatively high probability may be a consequence of the limited  application of business continuity plans; and the high deviation may be a result of the different  types of implementations.  Risk value in eDelivery is significantly lower than risk value in eDocument and eValidation services.

The deviation value is relatively high for the e-Document related  services, compared with the others, but this is due to the different kind of services provided under  this category, and one of the reasons of recommending the definition of standard QoS profiles.

Globally considered, the risk values are not very high.

In the 2 extreme cases analyzed where they rated frequent or likely for this risk,  they didn’t rated so high for the rest of the risks. So these cases must be taken into account.  The TSPs seem to have been taken measures to minimize it: Almost all of them offer validation  services through CRLs and OCSP simultaneously. So this is not the cause of high rate.  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  34  5.2 Overview of the services  This section will analyse the type of risks identified in each Service.  A graphic will be used to represent the values obtained for both Probability and Impact, taking into  account the deviation or dispersion of the answers (represented as the size of the bubbles: the  larger the dispersion, the bigger the size). In the table below the associated risk values are also  shown and highlighted in Red or Green if they correspond to one of the highest or lowest risk  values identified previously.  5.2.1 Electronic Time Stamp services  Type of Risk  Risk  Value  Impact  Value  Probab.

Although the risks ‘Lose of accuracy of the main time source’ and ‘Unavailability of the main time  source” don’t show a great impact, they have been rated as the most likely ones for ‘time stamp  services’.

Nevertheless there is only one peak response for probability.  The highest risk responses are those of service providers that deliver the service only through a web,  or that haven’t audited it at all. In general the differences may be consequence of the different type  of implementations.  None of them are following ISO27001 as a security management standard.  ‘Lose or alteration of digital evidences’ and ‘Relay on not-updated certificate revocation information’  have two of the lowest risk values overall.

The high deviation of values for some Risks is due to the different types of implementation of the  service, since only some of them store the e-documents they deliver. It may also be a consequence  of the different kinds of customers, as this service is provided to users that don’t belong to the  organization of the service provider.

This is  mainly due to a very high probability value (97). This type of risk is only evaluated in this service, so  it cannot be compared with other services in the survey.  It is the risk out of control of any TSP, because it is complicated to anticipate what can happen in the  future with the algorithms that are been used today.  Table 13 also shows that ‘Lose or compromise of service's signature creation data’ has a high impact  value and a low probability value.  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  39  6 Conclusions and Recommendations  The following section shows all the relevant conclusions extracted from the survey and the  recommendations associated to them when apply. Recommendations have been numerated and  categorized by the addressee of the recommendation: the Trust Service Providers (P), the  Regulators/Supervisors/Standardising bodies (R) or the Customers of TSP (C).  6.1 Services scope  The vast majority of providers offer both ‘electronic certificates’ and ‘other trust services’, so they  are already using CPS Certification schemas, so it is  [REC.1.R] recommended extending CSP Certification schemas to other Trust services and to the  whole EU to have harmonised security audits51 criteria of QoS and SLA guidelines.  Many TSP complain about the administrative barriers to be recognised and operate in different  Member States, what in many cases deals not only in lack of interoperability, but also in difficulties  to reach a critical mass of customers to make the services sustainable, without having to invest too  much following regular audits on several national accreditation schemas. To overcome this problem  the EU eIDAS Regulation proposes that a mutual assistance system between supervisory bodies in  the Member States should be set up52, e.g. cross-border or mutual recognition of accreditation  schemas or independent auditing body. This could be facilitated through the following  recommendation:  [REC.2. P/R/C] It should be promoted the use of widely recognised Trust  Marks based on  conformity assessment of qualified TSPs against eIDAS requirements that would be recognised  across borders.  The scope of certificates supported by the TSPs in the trust services they provide is not very large (up  to 37% support only their own CSPs; and up to 43% do not support international CSPs). Since e- signature is one of the strongest authentication mechanisms, and the eID associated to that e- signature can be recognised cross border in EU, following the eIDAS regulation, its use to grant  access to TSPs has to be promoted. As the segmentation of the market is very high, to improve the  current situation, so  [REC.3. R/C] Supervisors should promote a wider use of e-Signature as authentication mechanism  to access TSPs, barriers for cross-border interoperability of e-Signature & eIDAS certificates have to  be removed.  About the sectors the services are addressed to, some conclusions can be drawn:   The provision for ‘only general public’ is residual. Almost all TSPs are providers of Public  Administrations, Private sector or both.   If we focus on Public vs. Private, most of them provide services to both sectors.   Less than 50% TSPs address their services to specific communities.  51 As stated in Art. 14.1 of eIDAS Regulation, making reference to Articles 15, 16 and 17.  52 As recommended in the whereas 34 of the new Regulation.  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  40  Regarding the authentication mechanisms to grant access to their services, although almost all of  them provide them with electronic certificates, there is a variety of mechanisms used. So the  strength of the authentication mechanisms used should be proportional to the criticality of the  accessed services.  The Trust Services are usually provided by an ‘on-line TSP web site’ (almost 80% of the TSPs),  followed by a ‘web services available for automatic processing’ (almost 60% of the TSPs), and ‘a  client application’ (roughly 40% of the TSPs). Although an on-line web site service is the most  preferred platform, it is worth to recommend the use of clients based on SAML web services end-to- end encrypted communication to handle the communication. This approach will allow also the use  of end to end encryption between client and server in a way transparent to the user, avoiding  changes on the configuration that may have a negative impact on the security of the data being  transferred.  [REC.4.P/R/C] Promote the implementation of client desktop applications to be executed in the  customer computer using web-service access to TSP with end-to-end encryption in the  communication between them.  Finally, for the ‘eDocuments’ supporting services, the percentage of providers storing documents is  higher (76%) than for the ‘eDelivering’ service (42%), due to the nature of the service. The storing or  not storing of documents impacts directly in their security, so the description of the service whould  include those kind of details, and the security measures in place to prevent the threats to which the  service is vulnerable, based on the way it’s provided. In order to facilitate the customers, e- government and others, to recognise some standard service quality and levels it’s recommended to:  [REC.5.P/R] Define adequate service profiles based on best practices that comply with users’  expected QoS and allow comparison.  6.2 Standards implemented  Nearly 90% of the participants indicated that they follow ISO/IEC 27001, but a very low percentage  has adopted others. It is worth mentioning the lack of implementation of IT Security Governance  standards and that only 12% of TSPs implemented the Bussiness Continuity Management (BCM)  standard ISO/IEC 22301, which has proven to be related with one of the most relevant risks of the  trust service providers.  In order to address risks related with the unavailability of the services specific BCM standards, as  ISO/IEC 22301 should be promoted, but keeping in mind the suitability of the use of non-specific  international standards as ETSI 101 456 or EN 319 411-2 which include BCM controls on their  requirements, so it could also be acceptable the use of TSP especific standards including BCM  controls.  [REC.6.P/R/C] The implementation of Bussiness Continuity Management standards applied to the  service as a whole should be promoted. TSP specific standards, including BCM controls could also  be acceptable.  The most supported e-signature standard is ‘XAdES’ (80-90%) and the least supported one is DSS  (25-30%). In the middle range are ‘PKCS#7’, ‘PAdES’ and ‘CAdES’ with similar high end percentages.  Although almost all the e-signature standards are highly supported, in order to be capable to  validate any of them,  [REC.7.P/C] full adoption of e-signature standards by TSPs should be reached, to achieve full  interoperability.  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  41  Regarding Time Stamp services, there is a low percentage of TSP that use of a ‘self-generated’ time  source, which could facilitate internal threats, being the international source the most adopted one.  Nevertheless, it is still worth to:  [REC.8.P/C] It’s recommended to promote the use of national or internationally trusted time  sources, taking such policy into consideration for the specification of a qualified service.  As for Validation services, almost all TSPs support the ‘OCSP’ and ‘CRL’ protocols.  Finally, regarding Long Time Preservation of e-Signatures standards, the dispersion of standards  used is high, which implies that  [REC.9.P/R/C] best practices must be defined to harmonise the quality and functionality of the  Long Time Preservation service (QoS & SLA).  6.3 Risk Analysis  We can summarise the Risk Analysis made in section 1 above, highlighting some issues and the  corresponding recommendations to minimise them:   There are three risks cases which show a higher overall value compared to the rest:  o ‘The evolution of cryptography’ which is specific for Long Time Preservation services.  This risk is out of TSP’s control because it is difficult to anticipate the evolution of  the cryptographic algorithms. To try to mitigate this risk  [REC.10.P/C] the use of two hash algorithms in Long Time Preservation services is  recommended to protect the integrity of the e-Signatures; breaking both  algorithms at the same time is less probable.  o ‘The relay on not-updated certificate revocation information’ in eValidation services.  TSPs seem to have taken measures to minimize it because of the simultaneous use  of OCSP and CRLs, but they still don’t rely on the quality of the information, probably  because it is produced out of their control. It is  [REC.11. P/C] recommended to guarantee the quality of the certificate revocation  service to allow the eValidation service trusts more on them.  This same risk has a significantly lower rate in the rest of services as Long Time  Preservation or eDelivery, probably because these services are offered to customers  close to the service provider, using credentials issued by them.  o ‘Web site / web service impersonation’ (see section 5.1.1 above) for eDocument  services has also a high risk value because the combination of high impact and high  probability. To mitigate this type of risk, it is proposed a combination of  recommendations:  [REC.12. P/C] There should be a focus on user training and consciousness of threats  to prevent web site / web service impersonation.  For example, using messages remembering users about security best practices in  storing credentials.  And one already mentioned:  [REC.4.P/R/C] Promote the implementation of client desktop applications to be  executed in the customer computer using web-service access to TSP with end to  end encryption in the communication between them..  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  42   About deviation values:   The large deviation of responses in the risks ‘Compromise of the main time source’ and  ‘Unavailability of the main time source’ of the Time Stamp Services. This may be due to  the lack of uniformity on the way those services are provided, and then, the differences  on the quality of the tools used and the security mechanisms set in place, are the  reasons of those deviations. Two already mentioned recommendations may solve this  problem:   [REC.8.P/C] it’s recommended to promote the use of national or international trusted  time sources, taking such policy into consideration for the specification of a qualified  service.  and   [REC.9.P/R/C] best practices must be defined to harmonise the quality and  functionality of the Long Time Preservation service (QoS & SLA).  6.4 Summary of Recommendations  This section summarizes the actors to which the recommendations are more relevant (X), the table  also indicates which of the actors will have more responsibility (R) on the adoption or imposition of  the recommendation: the Trust Service Providers (P), the Regulators (R) and the of TSP (C). In some  cases the Cusomer column has been marked with (V), meaning that the customer is encouraged just  to Validate that the TSP is providing the service following the recommendation.  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  43  RECOMMENDATION TSP  Reg/  Stndr Customer  [REC.1.R] It is recommended extending CSP Certification schemas to other  TSP services and to the whole EU to have harmonised security audits criteria  of QoS and SLA guidelines.

The target of the survey is 51 TSPs corresponding to 20 EU Member States and its focus has been the  services whose provision will be regulated in the new Regulation:   Validation of electronic signatures (eValidation)   Long time preservation of electronic signatures   Electronic Time Stamp   Electronic documents admissibility (eDocument)   Electronic delivery services (eDelivery)  The survey has addressed several issues of the services that are been offered: security practices,  imlemented standards and risk analysis. Out of all the conclusions and recommendations, these ones  have been considered the most relevant2:   REC.1/R: Most of the TSPs participating in the survey have already adhered to national CSP  (Certificates Service Providers) certification schemas. It is recommended to extend these  schemas to other Trust services to have harmonized criteria of QoS (Quality of Service)  assessment and SLA (Service Level Agreement) guidelines.   REC.2/R: Promote Trusted Marks assessed against eIDAS requirements that would be  recognised across borders.   REC.3/R: Cross-border interoperability of credentials has to be promoted, mainly e-singature.   REC.7/P: Full adoption of e-signature format standards by TSPs should be reached in order to  be capable to validate any of them.   REC.6/R: Specific BCM (Business Continuity Management) standards should be adopted in the  provision of trusted services.   REC.8/P: The use of internationally trusted main time sources and the definition of best  practices to standardize the QoS through SLAs must be promoted.   REC.12/P: Focus on user training and consciousness of threats to prevent ‘Web site / service  impersonation’ threat has to be targetted.   Other recommendations intend to reduce the higher reported risks:  o REC.11/P Relay on qualifiedqualified certificate revocation information (mainly in  eValidation services)  o REC.10/P Use 2 hash algorithms to prevent Evolution of cryptography (mainly in Long  Time Preservation services)  o REC.6/R Prevent Unavailability of service through BCM (mainly in eValidation services)  1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0238:FIN:en:PDF  2 See full list in Section 6.

Art. 15 of the proposed Regulation establishes certain provisions regarding the security  requirements applicable to trust service providers.  In order to facilitate the implementation of this provision, as well as to generally support trust  service providers (TSP) in the introduction of security best practices, the European Union Agency for  Network and Information Security (ENISA) is working in 2013 on a series of studies on the security  aspects of trust service providers issuing electronic certificates, as well as on the security and  interoperability aspects specific to the new trust services foreseen in the proposed Regulation.  The definition of “trust service” in the EU Regulation is quite wide, since it theorically covers all  combinations of the services applied over the objects shown in the Table 1 below.  Table 1: Trust services as defined in the EU Regulation  ENISA has conducted a survey about the security mechanisms used by TSPs in Europe, and their  interoperability. This survey was addressed to every current TSP that is offering, or intending to offer  in the future, any of the services identified in the proposed Regulation. In order to simplify the  combinations of services over objects, only those services most frequently referenced in  eGovernment applications have been included in the survey:   Electronic certificates, including e-Signature ones (summarized in other ENISA reports4)   Electronic time stamps (creation and handling)   Electronically signed documents storage or management (creation, handling or preservation)   Electronic delivery of eDocuments services (handling, preservation)   Validation of electronic signatures (documents, certificates, seals, websites)   Longtime preservation of electronic signatures (documents, time stamps)  3 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0238:FIN:en:PDF  4 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/trust-services  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0238:FIN:en:PDF  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  2  1.1 Background information  1.1.1 Motivation  In its Work Programme 2013 ENISA has divided its work into Work Packages; this project is related in  particular with its Work Package 1.2. The purpose of this work package is to identify the risks and  threats trust services European infrastructure is exposed to. Such risks/threats can emerge both  from the technologies and services themselves (like bad design, improper coding, etc.) and from  their improper usage. Besides the risks and threats, wherever possible the opportunities should also  be identified, as this is key to taking advantage of new models for security controls and new usages  of existing controls.  1.1.2 Legal and policy background  Herein follow some relevant legal initiatives relevant to this project:  - On 4 June 2012, the European Commission published a new draft EU regulation on  \"electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market\"5 that is meant to extend the existing e-Signatures Directive to include new services  such as e-time-stamping or e-seals that would guarantee the origin and the integrity of an  electronic document. The proposed Regulation will ensure people and businesses can use  their own national electronic identification schemes (e-IDs) to access public services in other  EU countries where e-IDs are available.  In order to analyse the impact of the  implementation of this new Regulation, the Commission made two studies:  o Study to support the implementation of a pan-European framework on electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market  (SMART 2012/0001)6.  o Impact assessment7 of the new regulation  - Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the accessibility of  public sector bodies' websites8  - European eGovernment Action Plan 2011-20159. The European Commission aims to support  the provision of a new generation of eGovernment services for businesses and citizens. The  Action Plan identifies four political priorities based on the Malmö Declaration10, agreed on  18 November 2009.  5 http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number10.11/ec-proposal-electronic-identity  http://eur- lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?checktexts=checkbox&checktexte=checkbox&val=679649%3Acs&pos=1&page=1&la ng=en&pgs=10&nbl=1&list=679649%3Acs%2C&hwords=&action=GO&visu=%23texte  6 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=8363  7  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/eu_legislation/regulation/index_en.htm  8 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=9125  9 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/european-egovernment-action-plan-2011-2015  10  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/ministerial-declaration-on-egovernment- malmo.pdf  http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number10.11/ec-proposal-electronic-identity http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?checktexts=checkbox&checktexte=checkbox&val=679649%3Acs&pos=1&page=1&lang=en&pgs=10&nbl=1&list=679649%3Acs%2C&hwords=&action=GO&visu=%23texte http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?checktexts=checkbox&checktexte=checkbox&val=679649%3Acs&pos=1&page=1&lang=en&pgs=10&nbl=1&list=679649%3Acs%2C&hwords=&action=GO&visu=%23texte http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?checktexts=checkbox&checktexte=checkbox&val=679649%3Acs&pos=1&page=1&lang=en&pgs=10&nbl=1&list=679649%3Acs%2C&hwords=&action=GO&visu=%23texte http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=8363 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/eu_legislation/regulation/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=9125 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/european-egovernment-action-plan-2011-2015 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/ministerial-declaration-on-egovernment-malmo.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/ministerial-declaration-on-egovernment-malmo.pdf  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  3  - Communication from the Commission to the EU Parliament, the Council, the EU Economic  and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions “Towards interoperability for  European public services”11  1.2 State of the art  The aim of this section is to summarise the information collected during the desktop research phase  of the project, showing the projects that provide or use trust services. In the context of the project it  has been used to select some stakeholders to contribute, validate and/or disseminate the results of  the analysis made of the status of the TSPs security in EU, and to identify some relevant regulatory  actions. It is provided just for information purpose.  1.2.1 Relevant activities in EU:  World e-ID Congress12 has become in eight years a key event gathering over 350 e-ID programs  managers, government officials and technology experts around world’s major e-ID projects, policies  trends and latest innovations.  The Commission launched a study on collaborative production in eGovernment (SMART  2010/0075)13. As part of this collaborative activities, the Commmission has developed Open e- Prior14, open source version of e-Prior software, for e-Procurement services in the Public sector,  freely available for the EU public administrations.  1.2.2 EU funded Large Scale Pilots  The Build/Connect/Grow15 EU magazine identifies the following Large Scale Pilots16:  - Secure Identity Across Borders Linked (STORK II17). STORK simplifies bureaucratic hurdles  and administrative delays to provide citizens and the business community with easy but  secure access to their benefits and administrative records no matter where they are in  Europe. Within this overarching framework, there are pilots dedicated to:  o Cross-border authentication for electronic services;  o Providing safer internet chat for children and adolescents;  o Facilitating mobility for university students seeking to study abroad within Europe;  o Developing cross-border mechanisms for secure online delivery of documents; and  o Assisting people formalize a cross-border change-of-address.  11 COM(2010) 744 final:  http://www.epractice.eu/files/Towards%20interoperability%20for%20European%20public%20services%20-  %20Commission%20Communication.pdf  12 http://www.worlde-idcongress.com/call-for-papers-2013  13 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=9141  14 http://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/openeprior/forum/all  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHGI7re4Q_k  http://www.peppol.eu/news/news_repository/open-e-prior-release  15 http://www.buildconnectgrow.net/en/build?load=build/infographics-build  16 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/egovernment  17 https://www.eid-stork.eu/  http://www.epractice.eu/files/Towards%20interoperability%20for%20European%20public%20services%20-%20Commission%20Communication.pdf http://www.epractice.eu/files/Towards%20interoperability%20for%20European%20public%20services%20-%20Commission%20Communication.pdf http://www.worlde-idcongress.com/call-for-papers-2013 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=9141 http://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/openeprior/forum/all http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHGI7re4Q_k http://www.peppol.eu/news/news_repository/open-e-prior-release http://www.buildconnectgrow.net/en/build?load=build/infographics-build http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/egovernment https://www.eid-stork.eu/  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  4  - SPOCS 18  (Simple Procedures Online for Cross-Border Services) has made significant  achievements, from establishing ‘Document Equivalence’ between national administrations  to enhancing ‘semantic interoperability’ (making different countries understand each other  and work together digitally). Furthermore, they highlighted areas requiring improvement,  notably in terms of abolishing legal barriers and addressing public misconceptions of the  security of electronic information transfers.  - Despite the completion of the Pan-European Public Procurement Online (PEPPOL19) project  in August 2012, a number of public and private members of the PEPPOL community  committed themselves to further drive adoption of standardised eProcurement solutions –  encompassing eAttestations, eCatalogues, eOrders, eInvoices and eSignature validation and  an open document exchange network – with the creation of OpenPEPPOL. OpenPEPPOL is a  non-profit international association of public and private PEPPOL community members.  - e-CODEX20 “e-Justice Communication via Online Data Exchange” Cooperating with other  LSPs in the fields of eDelivery, ePayments, eDocuments, eID and eSignatures, e-CODEX will  demonstrate how the building blocks for cross-border interoperability can be implemented  in numerous domains, including e-Justice. Two pilots are developed under this project:  o The European Arrest Warrant (EAW) requires a national executing judicial authority to  recognise requests for the surrender of a person made by the judicial authority of  another Member State (the issuing judicial authority) for the purposes of prosecution.  o Mutual Recognition of Financial Penalties.  Previously, many offences – ranging from  simple road traffic offences to organised crime – went unpunished due to their  transnational nature.  With this pilot, financial penalties imposed against an offender in  a foreign country can follow them to their home country, with their domestic  authorities being tasked to collect the penalty. The pilot is currently being developed for  three EU Member States – France, Germany and the Netherlands.  - Smart Open Services for European Patients (epSOS21) ensures those European travellers are  well cared for. It provides standards for the exchange of medical information, thereby  leading to informed health care and a safe continuity of treatment.  1.2.3 Other EU funded projects  EU security projects funded by the FP722 include the following, which are quite closely related to  trusted eIDAS and e-Government:  - ABC4Trust23 Attribute-based Credentials for Trust  - FutureID -- Shaping the Future of Electronic Identity  - Primelife24 Privacy and Identity Management in Europe for Life  - PICOS25 Privacy and identity management for community services  18 http://www.eu-spocs.eu/  19 http://www.peppol.eu/  20 http://www.e-codex.eu/  21  http://www.epsos.eu/  22 http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/security/projects_en.html#TSI  23 https://abc4trust.eu/  24 http://www.primelife.eu/  25 http://www.picos-project.eu/  http://www.eu-spocs.eu/ http://www.peppol.eu/ http://www.e-codex.eu/ http://www.epsos.eu/ http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/security/projects_en.html#TSI https://abc4trust.eu/ http://www.primelife.eu/ http://www.picos-project.eu/  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  5  - GINI-SA26 Global Identity Networking of Individuals - Support Action  - SWIFT27 Secure widespread identities for federated Telecommunications  - OPTET28 OPerational Trustworthiness Enabling Technologies  - TURBINE29 Trusted revocable biometric identities  - CUMULUS30 Certification infrastrUcture for MUlti-Layer cloUd Services  - BEST31  - SIGNEO32  - SABRINA33  From the previous Framework Programme we can mention the following initiatives:  - BRITE Business Register Interoperability Throughout Europe  - EEPOCH34 eEurope Smart Card Charter proof of concept and holistic solution  - PRIME Privacy and Identity Management for Europe  - FIDIS Future of Identity in the Information Society  Another interesting programme was the IDABC35 where two relevant studies were produced, one on  eID, and another (PEGS36) on e-Signature recognition in e-Government.  1.2.4 CIP PSP  There is an initiative to build a Thematic Network for European eID (SSEDIC37)  The objective of this network is to provide a platform for all the stakeholders of eID (electronic  identity) to work together and collaborate to prepare the agenda for a proposed Single European  Digital Identity Community as envisaged by the Digital Agenda (DAE) in its Key Action 16  They have launched a survey on the use of eID of different kind and also to retrieve the opinion of  the citizens about the use of eSignature and Privacy:  http://ivox.socratos.net/l.0/1d3aDfnkc4k6rSj7at4tmNXMVVy3uy  It’s also worth to mention the CIP project:  SEMIRAMIS38 Secure Management of Information across multiple Stakeholders  26  http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=ICT_UNIFIEDSRCH&ACTION=D&DOC=3598&CAT=PROJ&QUERY=01256 6805427:fddf:67bd9cf8&RCN=95534  27 http://www.ist-swift.org/content/view/23/32/  28 http://cordis.europa.eu/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=proj.document&PJ_RCN=13272191  29 http://www.turbine-project.eu/  30 http://cordis.europa.eu/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=proj.document&PJ_RCN=13156501  31 http://www.bestnw.eu/  32 http://www.bitoceans.com/  33 http://www.sabrina.uni-karlsruhe.de/  34  http://www.eepoch.netl  35 http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/6484.html  36 http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/6485.html  37 http://www.eid-ssedic.eu/  38 http://ec.europa.eu/information  society/apps/projects/facts heetlindex.cfm?project ref-250453  http://ivox.socratos.net/l.0/1d3aDfnkc4k6rSj7at4tmNXMVVy3uy http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=ICT_UNIFIEDSRCH&ACTION=D&DOC=3598&CAT=PROJ&QUERY=012566805427:fddf:67bd9cf8&RCN=95534 http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=ICT_UNIFIEDSRCH&ACTION=D&DOC=3598&CAT=PROJ&QUERY=012566805427:fddf:67bd9cf8&RCN=95534 http://www.ist-swift.org/content/view/23/32/ http://cordis.europa.eu/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=proj.document&PJ_RCN=13272191 http://www.turbine-project.eu/ http://cordis.europa.eu/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=proj.document&PJ_RCN=13156501 http://www.bestnw.eu/ http://www.bitoceans.com/ http://www.sabrina.uni-karlsruhe.de/ http://www.eepoch.netl/ http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/6484.html http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/6485.html http://www.eid-ssedic.eu/ http://ec.europa.eu/information  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  6  1.2.5 Relevant communities  There are several communities identified in the JOINUP39 portal funded by the Commission. Here are  some of the most relevant to this project:  - The National Interoperability Framework Observatory (NIFO40), one of the projects from the  EC's ISA program (Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations), is  intended to provide assistance  - This group is for developer and integrators who are integrating peppol41. The idea is to share  knowledge, exchange ideas and general discussion on E-invoice system.  - IDABC42  - Greek eGovernment Interoperability Framework, eGIF43  1.2.6 Activities outside the EU  NSTIC44: National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace. Five U.S. organizations will pilot  identity solutions that increase confidence in online transactions, prevent identity theft, and provide  individuals with more control over how they share their personal information:  - The Cross Sector Digital Identity Initiative (CSDII) lead by the American Association of Motor  Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) will implement a secure online identity ecosystem that will  lead to safer transactions by enhancing privacy and reducing the risk of fraud in online  commerce.  - The Criterion pilot will allow consumers to selectively share shopping and other preferences  and information to both reduce fraud and enhance the user experience.  - The Daon pilot will demonstrate how senior citizens and all consumers can benefit from a  digitally connected, consumer friendly Identity Ecosystem. The pilot will employ user- friendly identity solutions that leverage smart mobile devices.  - The Resilient pilot seeks to demonstrate that sensitive health and education transactions on  the Internet can earn patient and parent trust by using a Trust Network built around privacy- enhancing encryption technology to provide secure, multifactor, on-demand identity  proofing and authentication across multiple sectors.  - UCAID, known publicly as Internet2, intends to build a consistent and robust privacy  infrastructure through common attributes; user-effective privacy managers; anonymous  credentials; and Internet2's InCommon Identity Federation service; and to encourage the  use of multifactor authentication and other technologies.  NSTIC also Launched in August 2012, the Identity Ecosystem Steering Group (IDESG), which includes  volunteer companies, organizations and individuals dedicated to promoting the creation of  standards and policies that will accelerate the development and adoption of the Identity Ecosystem.  39 https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/all  40  https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/nifo/home  41 https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/pid/home  42 https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/idabc/home  43 https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/greek-egif/home  44 http://www.nist.gov/nstic/pilot-projects.html  http://www.nist.gov/nist-exit-script.cfm?url=http://www.idecosystem.org/ https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/all https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/nifo/home https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/pid/home https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/idabc/home https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/greek-egif/home http://www.nist.gov/nstic/pilot-projects.html  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  7  1.2.7 Non-EU projects  To finish, it is worth to mention some projects from outside EU that are relevant to eIDAS and TSP:  Non-profit-organizations/initiatives:  - Central Authentication Service Project  - Identity Commons  - Kantara Initiative  - Open Identity Exchange  - eID working group  - OpenID  Open Source projects/initiatives:  - OAuth  - OAuth 2.0  - OpenSocial  - Portable Contacts  - Information Cards  - The Pamela Project  - simpleSAMLphp  - Shibboleth  - OSIS  file:///C:/Users/medinma/Documents/13%20WPK1.2/eID%20&amp;%20Data%20Protection/DG%20Conn/eID%20schemes.doc%23_Non-profit-organizations/initiative file:///C:/Users/medinma/Documents/13%20WPK1.2/eID%20&amp;%20Data%20Protection/DG%20Conn/eID%20schemes.doc%23_Open_Source_Projects  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  8  2 Methodology  This report collects the results of the survey launched by ENISA about the current security practices  implemented by the newly regulated trust services in the EU, whilst other reports of ENISA45 have  analysed the results of the eSignature and e-Seal related services, including the certificates that  enable them and their application to e-Documents or Web-Sites.  This report describes the answers of the TSPs to that survey and the conclusions regarding the  different issues related to the new trust services they provide, the security and interoperability  mechanisms they implement, and the assessment of the different risks they face.  The survey was launched mainly to the relevant TSPs accredited in the Trust-Service Status List  (TSL46) published by the Supervising authorities, as well as some private contacts of the authors of  this report. Amongst those, relevant representatives of the most relevant ones from each MS were  contacted directly by the authors, in order to guarantee that they would contribute to the survey.  The survey obtained 67 answers, of which 51 were considered valid, since several answers were  merged as they referred to different services from the same TSP, and some others were from  providers outside the EU. Finally, only the replies which included complete and consistent  information were taken into consideration. The main background information about the participants  is:   The TSPs are from the following countries: Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia,  Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland,  Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and United Kingdom.   93% of the TSPs participating in the survey are also Qualified Certificate Service Providers  (CSP). This may be because most of the TSPs invited to participate in the survey were  contacted via TSL and the national supervising authorities, that in most of the cases reported  that only have official records of the qualified CSP. So, since invitations were made mainly  through national regulators of certification service providers and the trust services lists they  elaborate, and since till now only the CSP TSP are regulated, TSPs not providing CSP are not  in those TSL and the national regulators neither keep records of them, since their services  are not regulated.  2.1 Questionnaire  ASIC-S  Simple Associated Signature Container, published by ETSI as TS 102 918  BCM Business Continuity Management  CA Certification Authority  CAdES  CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures , published by ETSI as TS 101 733  CEN European Committee for Standardization  45 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/trust-services  46  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/eu-trusted-lists-certification-service-providers, standard format published by  ETSI as TS 102 231  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/eu-trusted-lists-certification-service-providers  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  9  CEN BII CEN Workshop on 'Business Interoperability Interfaces\"  CRL Certificate Revocation List, see “RFC 5280”  DG  Directorate General  DPA  Data Protection Authority  DSS  OASIS Digital Signature Services  EC European Commission  e-CODEX e-Justice Communication via Online Data Exchange  eID  Electronic Identification  eGov e-Government  eIDAS  electronic Identification and Authentication Service  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  epSOS Smart Open Services for European Patients  eSign electronic Signature  ETSI European Telecommunications Standards Institute  ETSI TS ETSI Technical Specification  EU  European Union  GDPR  General Data Protection Regulation  ICT Information and Communication Technologies  IEC International Electrotechnical Commission  IP Internet Protocol  ISO International Standards Organisation  IT Information Technology  LSP Large Scale Pilots  MS Member State  NCP National Contact Point  NIS Network and Information Security  NRA  National Regulator Authorities  OASIS Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards  OCSP Online Certificate Status Protocol, see “RFC 2560”  PAdES  PDF Advanced Electronic Signature, published by ETSI as TS 102 778  PEPPOL Pan-European Public Procurement Online  PKI Public Key Infrastructure  PoC Point of Contact  QoS Quality of Service  REC Recommendation  SAML Security Assertion Markup Language  SHA Secure Hash Algorithm.

Figure 1: Trust services provided  The results show that only 6% of TSPs participating in the survey are providing only other trust  services than electronic certificates. So the vast majority of TSPs are already complying with current  regulation, and the number of qualified TSPs in the market will not grow excessively with new  regulation.  3.1.2 Which Other trust services?  Figure 2 represents the percentage of implementation for the rest of trust services considered.  14% 6%  80%  Which of the trust services described in the proposed  trust services regulation do you provide or intend to  provide in the future?

The other services are between 60% and 70%.  3.1.3 Certificates scope  Figure 3 represents the span of supported certificates: ‘Only own CSP support’, ‘National CSPs  support’, ‘Partial international support’, ‘Total international support’.  Figure 3: Span of supported certificatescertificates  37% of the TSPs support certificates only from their own CSP, but it is maybe worst to notice that  57% only accept certificates issued in the same country. The conclusion is that the segmentation of  the EU market is very high, as shown in the graphic, and that cross-border interoperability has to be  promoted.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  Electronic time stamps e-Signed documents storage or management  e-Documents delivery services  e-Signed documents signature validation  Long-time preservation of e-Signed Documents  What kind of services do the TSPs provide?  37%  20%  20%  23%  What certificates do the TSPs support in the services  that they provide?

It shows that most of the TSP  participating in the survey provide services to several categories of customers.  Figure 4: type of target customers for trust services  Figure 5 and Figure 6 detail the results of the participants that have selected one of the following  categories of customers:   General Public   Specific Communities   Public Administrations versus Private Sector  1- Figure 5 shows the Results Focused on General Public:  Figure 5: Sectors where services are addressed: General Public view  Amongst those that indicated that they offer the service to General Publice, the provision for ‘Only  General Public’ is residual. Although 40% of TSPs don’t provide their services specifically to General  Public, the combination of ‘General Public and other types’ represents more than 50% of the results.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  General Public Public Administrations  Private sector Specific community  Which sectors are you addressing your services to?  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  Only General Public General Public and other types  Other type than General Public  Which sectors are you addressing your services to?

The bars in the Figure 6 also indicate the percentage of TSPs that are offering services to  ‘specific communities’ within the category. This happens in 3/4 of the TSP offering service  only to Private sector, 1/5 of the providers of only Public Administration and 3/8 of those  that provide service to both sectors:  Figure 6: Sectors where services are addressed: specific communities  3.1.5 Authentication mechanisms  Figure 7 shows the different authentication mechanisms used by TSPs to grant customers access to  their different services.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  Public Administration Private Sector Both Sectors  Which sectors are you addressing your services to?

Amongst those that answered ‘No need for credentials’, 5/6 stated that they also use ‘Electronic  certificates’ and ‘User/password’. There was only one TSP that only answered ‘No need of  credentials’ (and no other mechanism). This was a provider of Certificates and Time Stamp services,  where user authentication is not usually needed. The remaining TSPs use different authentications  mechanisms based on the criticality of the offered service.  In the option ‘Other mechanisms’, the providers answered the following mechanisms:   OTP based in EMV-CAP (1 answer)   PostIdent - German identification process (1 answer)   X-Road (1 answer)   IP address authentication or IP whitelisting (3 answers)   Federated identity (Shibboleth) (1 answer)   Moonshot (1 answer)  3.1.6 How is the service provided?

TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  16  Figure 8: Service provision platform of TSPs  The ‘Government web site’ is rarely used regardless of the type of service (less than 10%). ‘On-line  TSP web site’ is the most common answer for all services (between 70 and 80%), except for Time  Stamp, for which the preferred option is ‘Web service available for automatic processing’.  The graphic also indicates that there are TSPs that use several channels to provide the service.  For security reasons it is recommended to promote the use of web services, to force secure  communication channel with parameters agreed with the TSP in a way transparent to the user.  3.1.7 Storage of Documents  Graphics in Figure 9 indicate whether providers store the documents or not. This information is  compared between the eDocuments signature management and the eDelivering services.  Figure 9: Storage of documents practice.  The results show that most of eDocuments trust providers store the documents (76%), while for  eDelivery this percentage drops to 42%. This difference can be explained by the nature of the  services.  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  A client (desktop) application  A web site (on- line) service of  your own  An e-Government web site  A web service available for automatic processing  How are the services provided?

Figure 10: Information Systems Security management standards adopted/assessed  The results indicate that about 90% of the TSPs that answered this question follow the ‘ISO/IEC  27001’ standard. Only 5 TSPs don’t use it, either because they have local standards for that purpose  (as those developed by the German Federal Office for Information Security BSI) or because the TSPs  are neither a CSP nor a Qualified TSP, so they don’t need to comply with ISO/IEC 27001.  Few TSPs have adopted other relevant standards:   It’s remarkable that the de-facto market standard ‘ISO/IEC 38500 for IT Governance’ is not  implemented at all, probably because it’s not a security standard and it’s not required in the  certification schemas.   It’s also worth mentioning the low adoption of ISO/IEC 22301: Business Continuity Management.  Since one of the most relevant risks identified by the participants in the survey is the  unavailability of the service, and the most relevant incidents in the sector have been related  with service interruptions, specific standards to guarantee the continuity management should be  promoted.  TSPs that have indicated ‘Others standards’ have named the following (although not all of them are  specific to IS Security Management Standards):   ETSI TS 102 042 (1)   BSI Grundschutz (1)   Ministry of Defense Information Security  Policy (1)   ISO 20000 (2)   ETSI 101 456 (4)   Webtrust (3)   ISO/IEC 12207 (1)  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%  100%  ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security  Management)  ISO/IEC 22301 (Business Continuity Management)  ISO/IEC 38500 (IT Governance)  Others  Which general security management standards do you  follow?

Figure 11: Auditing policy  16% of the TSPs stated that they are audited ‘within the scope of a government audit scheme’,  similarly to those that acknowledged that they audited ‘within the scope of an independent /  industry led audit scheme’, with a 21% ratio. Moreover, 49% informed that they are audited ‘within  both scopes’.  96% of providers are regularly audited. Half of them are both audited ‘within the scope of an  independent / industry led audit scheme’ and ‘within the scope a government audit scheme’. Only  4% of the surveyed TSPs indicated that they are not audited. This can come as a result of not offering  qualified services.

Only  3 TSPs answered that its frequency was higher than one year; 1 TSP informed of a biannual audit.  Annual audits should reach the 100%.  4.1.3 Documents  Figure 13 shows the answers about the existence of security, risk and continuity policies,  statements, and plans in the surveyed organizations.  Figure 13: Security policy Documents approved  Almost every TSP (96-98%) implements ‘Certification Practice Statement’ and ‘Information Security  Policy’ types. Regarding approved documents, all TSPs providing electronic certificates have the  ‘Certificate Practice Statement’ document implemented. However, the documentation regarding  continuity of services (‘Business Risk Assessment’, ‘Business Continuity Plans’, ‘Incident Response  Plans’) is not fully implemented (about 80%), although it should be.  In the case of ‘Certificate Practice Statement’, 3 TSPs inform that they offer different services than  electronic certificates, but there has been only 1 TSP stating that it doesn’t have a Certificate  Practice Statement, probably because a document describing the use of internal certificates exists.  It is interesting to notice that almost 20%-30% of TSPs do not have ‘Business Risk Assessments’ (BRA)  nor ‘Business Continuity Plans’ (BCP), neither ‘Incident Response Plan’ (IRP), which could be  explained through the consideration of BRA, BCP and IRP as a part of their Information Security  Policy.  Our recommendation regarding continuity of services is that all the documents related with it must  be implemented: ‘Business Risk Assessment’, ‘Business Continuity Plan’ and also ‘Incident Response  Plan’ and ‘CA Termination Plan’ (this last one if applicable).  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  Certification Practice  Statement  Information Security Policy  Job descriptions for Trusted  Roles  Inventory of Assets  Business Risk Assessment  Bussiness Continuity  Plan  Incident Response  Plan  CA Termination  Plan  What kind of approved documents do the TSPs have?

Figure 14: e-signature standards are supported  ‘XAdES‘ is the most supported standard in all services: between 80-90%.  All services have the same series of  standards supported with a similar ratio of coverage: ‘XAdES’  being the most supported one with 80-90% ratios, followed by ‘PKCS#7’, ‘PAdES’ and ‘CAdES’ with a  similar percentage, and finally ‘DSS’ with the least support with 25-30%.  Regardless of the standard, the eDocuments service shows the highest level of support, followed by  the eValidation and the eDelivery service. In order to improve interoperability, all TSPs should be  able to accpet any e-signature standard.  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  CAdES XAdES (XML-DSig)  PAdES PKCS#7 DSS  What e-signature standards are supported?  eDocuments  eDelivery  eValidation  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  21  4.3 Electronic time stamp services  4.3.1 Main time source  Thechart in Figure 15 shows the main time source used by the TSP for delivering the service, with a  expected low rate for the Self-generated” time source.  Figure 15: Main time source used for Time Stamp Services  4.3.2 Time stamp format standards  As for the Time Stamp format standards supported by the TSP (See Figure 16) for delivering the  service, all of them support the ‘RFC3161 Time Stamp Protocol’, whilst only 25% of TSPs support the  ‘DSS XML Time Stamp profile’.

Figure 17: Certificate Validation standards supported  4.5 Long Time Preservation standards  Thegraphic in Figure 18 explains long term preservation standards. There is a dispersion of the  standards used:  80% of the TSPs use ‘AdES T’ standard which adds a time stamp, probably used for digital evidences  storage purposes.  75% of the TSPs use ‘AdES XL’ standard which adds CRLs and certificates, probably to allow future  validations.  65% of the TSPs use ‘AdES A’ standard which implies re-signing processes, probably for long time  preservation of e-documents purposes.  The least used standards are ‘AdES C’ (which adds references to certificates and/or CRLs) and ‘AdES  X’ (which adds time stamps to the references of ‘AdES C’). It is remarkable, as AdES C is the format  that adds the lightest information overhead. Nevertheless, with the risk ‘Relay on not-update  certificate revocation information’ for Long Time Preservation Services deemed as almost negligible,  it is just natural that AdES XL is the most widely used for this particular type of service.  0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  OCSP CRL  What certificate validation standards are  supported?

TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  24  5 Risk Analysis  This section reflects the results about the type of risks that can compromise the services according  to the experience of the TSPs. The analysis has been made for the ‘type of risk’ point of view in  section 5.1; and looking inside ‘each service’ in section 5.2.  Table 2: Quantitative and qualitative risk values and parameters relative values. Shows on the  leftmost columns the average absolute Risk value and the typical deviation of the Risk calculated for  each of the responses. This absolute Risk value is the result of applying a weight to the qualitative  probability47 and impact48 values selected in the answers, and multiplying them. In a traditional  qualitative risk analysis, those values should be considered as euros of expected loss due to  probability of successful threat with the expected impact, but since each organisation should have  their own probability and most important impact estimations in their particular environment, the  numbers are provided just for comparing the results of one risk with others.  The Deviation has been calculated using the Standard Deviation of the values obtained. In the worst  cases the highest values of the deviation, compared with the risk, show that some answers indicated  relatively low risk and others very high risk. The conclusion of this large deviation of values is that  the environments set up to provide the services are very different, and for this reason the values of  the Risk for those vulnerabilities should be analysed with care. On the contrary, when the standard  deviation is low, we should feel confident that most of the participants agreed on the estimation of  that Risk.  To consolidate the responses given to each type of risk for each service, different calculations have  been made, but toto simplify the results, all the values have been translated / normalized to scales  from 0 to 100, being 100 the worst case49.  Four parameters have been analysed, the lowest values are marked in green, showing that they are  well protected, and the highest in Red, highlighting that they need improvement:  - Impact: It is calculated as the average of all individual impact responses and normalized to 0-  100.  - Probability: It is calculated as the average of all individual probability responses and normalized  to 0-100.  - Risk: It is calculated as the average of all the individual risks calculated from the values provided  by the participants in the survey and normalized to 0-100. Each individual risk value was  previously calculated as the product of the individual impact and the individual probability  - Standard Deviation: Statistical parameter alculated of the Risk values extracted from the  answers of each participant in the survey for every type of risk and service. In general, the  higher Standard deviations (highlighted in orange) corresponds to the higher risk, and those to  the higher probability values.  47  % ranging from very unlikely (1 every 30 years) to Frequent (3 times/year)  48 ranging from very low (2K€) to very high (300K€)  49  From the survey, all the risks have been in general been rated with Medium values (100% only means the  worst between all of them). Normalization to 100 provides the spread of the results allowing an easier  comparison of results and the identification of areas of improvement. .

This risk is out of TSP’s control because it is difficult to anticipate the  evolution of the cryptographic algorithms.  o ‘The relay on not-updated certificate revocation information’ in eValidation  services. TSPs seem to have taken measures to minimize it because of the  simultaneous use of OCSP and CRLs, but they still don’t rely on the quality of the  information, probably because it is produced out of their control.  This same risk has a significantly lower rate in the rest of services as Long Time  Preservation or eDelivery, probably because these services are offered to customers  close to the service provider, using credentials issued by them.  o ‘Web site / web service impersonation’ (see section 5.1.1 below) for eDocument  related services has also a high risk value because the combination of high impact  and high probability.   Other cases may be highilighted due to large Impact values:  o The 4 cases with the highest impact (and also with the lowest probabilities values)  correspond with the type of risk ‘lose or compromise of service’s signature creation  data’ for the services eDocument, eDelivery, Time Stamping and Long Time  Preservation. The highest impact is the expected answer because of the sensitivity  of the data. The lowest probability shows that security measures have already been  implemented.  o The lowest values for Impact correspond to types of risk related to the ‘main time  source’ in Time Stamp and the type of risk of ‘unavailability of service’ in  eDocument and in eDelivery services.   Other cases may be highilighted due to large probability values:  o Two of the top 4 in highest probabilities are related to ‘unavailability of service’ in  eDocument services and in eValidation services. Business continuity management  has to be promoted for this kind of providers (even if a cloud service provider is  used).  o ‘Unavailability of service’ has a high probability and a low impact score in the 3  main services assessed. It is obvious that these services are more concerned with  confidentiality and integrity than with availability.   It is also worth to mention the cases with higher deviation values in the Time Stamp service:  in the risks ‘Compromise of the main time source’ and ‘Unavailability of the main time  source’ of the Time Stamp Services. This may be due to the lack of uniformity on the way  those services are provided, and then, the differences on the quality of the tools used and  the security mechanisms set in place, are the reasons of those deviations.  5.1 Overview of the risks  This section will analyse those risks that apply to 2 or more services in order to compare them.  A single graphic will be used to represent the values obtained for both Probability and Impact, taking  into account the deviation or dispersion of the answers (represented as the size of the bubbles: the  larger the dispersion, the bigger the bubble size, indicating that the range of values of risk resulting  from the answers is high). In the table below each graphic, the associated risk values are also shown  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  28  and highlighted in Red or Green if they are one of the highest or lowest risk values identified in  the general Table 2 above, and the higher deviations values are highlighted in Orange.  5.1.1 Web site / web service impersonation  Web site / web service impersonation  eDocument eDelivery  Risk Value 66 43  Impact Value 54 45  Probab. Value 64 35  Deviation value 79 82  Table 3: Web site / web service impersonation Risk  Table 3 shows that ‘Web site / web service impersonation’ in eDocument Services rated a little bit  higher in Probability and Impact than for eDelivery Services. The impact for eDocument service is  higher because in some implementations of that service, the impersonation may lead with a higher  probably to document content disclosure.  There is no correspondence with the fact of storing or not the managed eDocuments.

Value 100 64 80  Deviation Value 85 82 78  Table 4: Unavailability of service Risk  Table 4 shows that ‘Unavailability of the service’ is a risk with the high probability of occurrence (in  eDocument service) and low impact (especially in eDocument and eDelivery services).  The low impact perhaps is due to the fact that a denial of this kind of services doesn’t imply any  disclosure of documents; the relatively high probability may be a consequence of the limited  application of business continuity plans; and the high deviation may be a result of the different  types of implementations.  Risk value in eDelivery is significantly lower than risk value in eDocument and eValidation services.

The deviation value is relatively high for the e-Document related  services, compared with the others, but this is due to the different kind of services provided under  this category, and one of the reasons of recommending the definition of standard QoS profiles.

Globally considered, the risk values are not very high.

In the 2 extreme cases analyzed where they rated frequent or likely for this risk,  they didn’t rated so high for the rest of the risks. So these cases must be taken into account.  The TSPs seem to have been taken measures to minimize it: Almost all of them offer validation  services through CRLs and OCSP simultaneously. So this is not the cause of high rate.  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  34  5.2 Overview of the services  This section will analyse the type of risks identified in each Service.  A graphic will be used to represent the values obtained for both Probability and Impact, taking into  account the deviation or dispersion of the answers (represented as the size of the bubbles: the  larger the dispersion, the bigger the size). In the table below the associated risk values are also  shown and highlighted in Red or Green if they correspond to one of the highest or lowest risk  values identified previously.  5.2.1 Electronic Time Stamp services  Type of Risk  Risk  Value  Impact  Value  Probab.

Although the risks ‘Lose of accuracy of the main time source’ and ‘Unavailability of the main time  source” don’t show a great impact, they have been rated as the most likely ones for ‘time stamp  services’.

Nevertheless there is only one peak response for probability.  The highest risk responses are those of service providers that deliver the service only through a web,  or that haven’t audited it at all. In general the differences may be consequence of the different type  of implementations.  None of them are following ISO27001 as a security management standard.  ‘Lose or alteration of digital evidences’ and ‘Relay on not-updated certificate revocation information’  have two of the lowest risk values overall.

The high deviation of values for some Risks is due to the different types of implementation of the  service, since only some of them store the e-documents they deliver. It may also be a consequence  of the different kinds of customers, as this service is provided to users that don’t belong to the  organization of the service provider.

The dispersion of values given in the responses and  the high probability show that there are no consolidated implementation guidelines and that this  service needs guiding instructions and standardization work.

This is  mainly due to a very high probability value (97). This type of risk is only evaluated in this service, so  it cannot be compared with other services in the survey.  It is the risk out of control of any TSP, because it is complicated to anticipate what can happen in the  future with the algorithms that are been used today.  Table 13 also shows that ‘Lose or compromise of service's signature creation data’ has a high impact  value and a low probability value.  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  39  6 Conclusions and Recommendations  The following section shows all the relevant conclusions extracted from the survey and the  recommendations associated to them when apply. Recommendations have been numerated and  categorized by the addressee of the recommendation: the Trust Service Providers (P), the  Regulators/Supervisors/Standardising bodies (R) or the Customers of TSP (C).  6.1 Services scope  The vast majority of providers offer both ‘electronic certificates’ and ‘other trust services’, so they  are already using CPS Certification schemas, so it is  [REC.1.R] recommended extending CSP Certification schemas to other Trust services and to the  whole EU to have harmonised security audits51 criteria of QoS and SLA guidelines.  Many TSP complain about the administrative barriers to be recognised and operate in different  Member States, what in many cases deals not only in lack of interoperability, but also in difficulties  to reach a critical mass of customers to make the services sustainable, without having to invest too  much following regular audits on several national accreditation schemas. To overcome this problem  the EU eIDAS Regulation proposes that a mutual assistance system between supervisory bodies in  the Member States should be set up52, e.g. cross-border or mutual recognition of accreditation  schemas or independent auditing body. This could be facilitated through the following  recommendation:  [REC.2. P/R/C] It should be promoted the use of widely recognised Trust  Marks based on  conformity assessment of qualified TSPs against eIDAS requirements that would be recognised  across borders.  The scope of certificates supported by the TSPs in the trust services they provide is not very large (up  to 37% support only their own CSPs; and up to 43% do not support international CSPs). Since e- signature is one of the strongest authentication mechanisms, and the eID associated to that e- signature can be recognised cross border in EU, following the eIDAS regulation, its use to grant  access to TSPs has to be promoted. As the segmentation of the market is very high, to improve the  current situation, so  [REC.3. R/C] Supervisors should promote a wider use of e-Signature as authentication mechanism  to access TSPs, barriers for cross-border interoperability of e-Signature & eIDAS certificates have to  be removed.  About the sectors the services are addressed to, some conclusions can be drawn:   The provision for ‘only general public’ is residual. Almost all TSPs are providers of Public  Administrations, Private sector or both.   If we focus on Public vs. Private, most of them provide services to both sectors.   Less than 50% TSPs address their services to specific communities.  51 As stated in Art. 14.1 of eIDAS Regulation, making reference to Articles 15, 16 and 17.  52 As recommended in the whereas 34 of the new Regulation.  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  40  Regarding the authentication mechanisms to grant access to their services, although almost all of  them provide them with electronic certificates, there is a variety of mechanisms used. So the  strength of the authentication mechanisms used should be proportional to the criticality of the  accessed services.  The Trust Services are usually provided by an ‘on-line TSP web site’ (almost 80% of the TSPs),  followed by a ‘web services available for automatic processing’ (almost 60% of the TSPs), and ‘a  client application’ (roughly 40% of the TSPs). Although an on-line web site service is the most  preferred platform, it is worth to recommend the use of clients based on SAML web services end-to- end encrypted communication to handle the communication. This approach will allow also the use  of end to end encryption between client and server in a way transparent to the user, avoiding  changes on the configuration that may have a negative impact on the security of the data being  transferred.  [REC.4.P/R/C] Promote the implementation of client desktop applications to be executed in the  customer computer using web-service access to TSP with end-to-end encryption in the  communication between them.  Finally, for the ‘eDocuments’ supporting services, the percentage of providers storing documents is  higher (76%) than for the ‘eDelivering’ service (42%), due to the nature of the service. The storing or  not storing of documents impacts directly in their security, so the description of the service whould  include those kind of details, and the security measures in place to prevent the threats to which the  service is vulnerable, based on the way it’s provided. In order to facilitate the customers, e- government and others, to recognise some standard service quality and levels it’s recommended to:  [REC.5.P/R] Define adequate service profiles based on best practices that comply with users’  expected QoS and allow comparison.  6.2 Standards implemented  Nearly 90% of the participants indicated that they follow ISO/IEC 27001, but a very low percentage  has adopted others. It is worth mentioning the lack of implementation of IT Security Governance  standards and that only 12% of TSPs implemented the Bussiness Continuity Management (BCM)  standard ISO/IEC 22301, which has proven to be related with one of the most relevant risks of the  trust service providers.  In order to address risks related with the unavailability of the services specific BCM standards, as  ISO/IEC 22301 should be promoted, but keeping in mind the suitability of the use of non-specific  international standards as ETSI 101 456 or EN 319 411-2 which include BCM controls on their  requirements, so it could also be acceptable the use of TSP especific standards including BCM  controls.  [REC.6.P/R/C] The implementation of Bussiness Continuity Management standards applied to the  service as a whole should be promoted. TSP specific standards, including BCM controls could also  be acceptable.  The most supported e-signature standard is ‘XAdES’ (80-90%) and the least supported one is DSS  (25-30%). In the middle range are ‘PKCS#7’, ‘PAdES’ and ‘CAdES’ with similar high end percentages.  Although almost all the e-signature standards are highly supported, in order to be capable to  validate any of them,  [REC.7.P/C] full adoption of e-signature standards by TSPs should be reached, to achieve full  interoperability.  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  41  Regarding Time Stamp services, there is a low percentage of TSP that use of a ‘self-generated’ time  source, which could facilitate internal threats, being the international source the most adopted one.  Nevertheless, it is still worth to:  [REC.8.P/C] It’s recommended to promote the use of national or internationally trusted time  sources, taking such policy into consideration for the specification of a qualified service.  As for Validation services, almost all TSPs support the ‘OCSP’ and ‘CRL’ protocols.  Finally, regarding Long Time Preservation of e-Signatures standards, the dispersion of standards  used is high, which implies that  [REC.9.P/R/C] best practices must be defined to harmonise the quality and functionality of the  Long Time Preservation service (QoS & SLA).  6.3 Risk Analysis  We can summarise the Risk Analysis made in section 1 above, highlighting some issues and the  corresponding recommendations to minimise them:   There are three risks cases which show a higher overall value compared to the rest:  o ‘The evolution of cryptography’ which is specific for Long Time Preservation services.  This risk is out of TSP’s control because it is difficult to anticipate the evolution of  the cryptographic algorithms. To try to mitigate this risk  [REC.10.P/C] the use of two hash algorithms in Long Time Preservation services is  recommended to protect the integrity of the e-Signatures; breaking both  algorithms at the same time is less probable.  o ‘The relay on not-updated certificate revocation information’ in eValidation services.  TSPs seem to have taken measures to minimize it because of the simultaneous use  of OCSP and CRLs, but they still don’t rely on the quality of the information, probably  because it is produced out of their control. It is  [REC.11. P/C] recommended to guarantee the quality of the certificate revocation  service to allow the eValidation service trusts more on them.  This same risk has a significantly lower rate in the rest of services as Long Time  Preservation or eDelivery, probably because these services are offered to customers  close to the service provider, using credentials issued by them.  o ‘Web site / web service impersonation’ (see section 5.1.1 above) for eDocument  services has also a high risk value because the combination of high impact and high  probability. To mitigate this type of risk, it is proposed a combination of  recommendations:  [REC.12. P/C] There should be a focus on user training and consciousness of threats  to prevent web site / web service impersonation.  For example, using messages remembering users about security best practices in  storing credentials.  And one already mentioned:  [REC.4.P/R/C] Promote the implementation of client desktop applications to be  executed in the customer computer using web-service access to TSP with end to  end encryption in the communication between them..  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  42   About deviation values:   The large deviation of responses in the risks ‘Compromise of the main time source’ and  ‘Unavailability of the main time source’ of the Time Stamp Services. This may be due to  the lack of uniformity on the way those services are provided, and then, the differences  on the quality of the tools used and the security mechanisms set in place, are the  reasons of those deviations. Two already mentioned recommendations may solve this  problem:   [REC.8.P/C] it’s recommended to promote the use of national or international trusted  time sources, taking such policy into consideration for the specification of a qualified  service.  and   [REC.9.P/R/C] best practices must be defined to harmonise the quality and  functionality of the Long Time Preservation service (QoS & SLA).  6.4 Summary of Recommendations  This section summarizes the actors to which the recommendations are more relevant (X), the table  also indicates which of the actors will have more responsibility (R) on the adoption or imposition of  the recommendation: the Trust Service Providers (P), the Regulators (R) and the of TSP (C). In some  cases the Cusomer column has been marked with (V), meaning that the customer is encouraged just  to Validate that the TSP is providing the service following the recommendation.  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  TSP services, standards and risk analysis report  Report, December 2013  Page  43  RECOMMENDATION TSP  Reg/  Stndr Customer  [REC.1.R] It is recommended extending CSP Certification schemas to other  TSP services and to the whole EU to have harmonised security audits criteria  of QoS and SLA guidelines.  R  [REC.2. P/R/C] It should be promoted the and use of widely recognised Trust  Marksbased on conformity assessment of qualified TSPs against eIDAS  requirements that would be recognised across borders.  X R V  [REC.3.R/C] Supervisors should promote a wider use of e-Signature as  authentication mechanism to access TSPs, barriers for cross-border  interoperability of e-Signature & eIDAS certificates have to be removed.  R V  [REC.4.P/R/C] Promote the implementation of client desktop applications to  be executed in the customer computer with web-service access to TSP with  end to end encryption in the communication between them.  R X X  [REC.5.P/R] Define adequate service profiles based on best practices that  comply with users’ expected QoS.  X R V  [REC.6.P/R/C] BCM standards (ISO 22301) applied to the service as a whole  should be promoted. TSPspecific standards including BCM controls could  also be acceptable.  X R V  [REC.7.P/C] Full adoption of e-signature standards by TSPs should be  reached, to achieve full interoperability. R  X  [REC.8.P/C] Use of national or internationally trusted time sources, taking  such policy into consideration for the specification of a qualified service. R  V  [REC.9.P/R/C] best practices must be defined to harmonise the quality and  functionality of the Long Time Preservation service (QoS & SLA). X R V  [REC.10.P/C] Use of two hash algorithms in LTP services is recommended to  protect the integrity of the e-Signatures. R  V  [REC.11.P/C] To guarantee the quality of the certificate revocation service to  allow the eValidation service trusts more on them. R  V  [REC.12.P/C] There should be a focus on user training and consciousness of  threats to prevent web site / web service impersonation.

    "abstract": "ENISA has conducted a survey about the security mechanisms used by TSPs (Trust Service Providers) in Europe, and their interoperability, under the scope of the proposed new Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market, which will supersede the current Directive 1999/93/EC on a Community framework for electronic signatures. The survey has addressed several issues of the services that are been offered: security practices, imlemented standards and risk analysis. The document is divided in three different sections: Services, Standards, and Risks. Each section is structured in two parts: The first one shows the general results for all the services, and the second one the specific results for each of the offered services."

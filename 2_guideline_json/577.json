The task assigned to this Task Force was to reflect on the potential issues found when a large scale  incident (Cyber, Natural Disasters, etc.) affects the Critical Information Infrastructures in a region  across one or several borders.  While many aspects can be recovered from without the help of a neighbour country, some actually  require external assistance, and therefore cooperation terms can be prepared in advance to plan for  those conditions of intervention properly.  Also, the Task Force felt that systematic cooperation on incident preparedness would allow a much  faster recovery, particularly for ‘black swan’ events, i.e. events that have a low probability but  generate an extremely large impact.  Some agreements have been established, but they are mostly ad-hoc. The preparedness process  could benefit from a higher level of maturity of its cross-border dimension in Europe.  Compared to other continents, Europe still faces significant barriers:  - Cooperation between counterparts in neighbour countries is ad-hoc;  - National Regulations demonstrate several differences;  - Private Sector operates mostly in Silos;  - Mutual Aid Assistance could allow a much shorter Time to Recovery, and a more  mature approach to Incident recovery.  The Task Force reflected on three different scenarios and identified a number of gaps.  This Task Force was composed of Public and Private Sector Experts who all contributed their  observations in the course of 2013.  The major conclusions are the following:  - A ‘Incident Preparedness and Coordination Expert Group’ should pave the way to an  improved cooperation in the Telecom Sector;  - A RSS-syndication type of platform for sharing Incidents Preparedness procedures,  Early Warnings, and Contact details should be designed and used;  - The pan-European environment for Mutual Aid Assistance should be enhanced  significantly by removing any relevant regulatory barriers;  - Policies for cross-border traffic prioritisation should be developed and tested.

Goal  While most of these conclusions might be well known already, this position paper will at least help  to inventory them and further support the development of a course of action.  Scope of the Work  The Task Force observed initially that “Incident Management” is a broad concept that encompasses  a number of very different activities.  ITIL (v3) terminology defines an incident as an unplanned interruption to an IT Service or a reduction  in the Quality of an IT Service. Failure of a Configuration Item that has not yet impacted Service is  also an Incident.  ISO 20000 defines an incident (part 1, 2.7) as any event that is not part of the standard operation of  a service and which causes or may cause an interruption to, or a reduction in, the quality of that  service.  Detection  • Causes  • Actors  Response  • Actions  • Coordination  Recovery  • Measures  • Post Mortem  Transversal  •Data Exchange (CVRF)  •Communication  •Preparedness Procedures Sharing  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 2  Generally, the process of Incident  Management is composed of a number of  activities (see figure on the right).  It is generally reported that Incident  Management in the ITIL and ISO sense of  the term are well managed within each  Telecom Operators’ boundaries1, 2, 3, 4. The  issue specific to Europe is indeed cross-  border, cross-companies Incident  Management.  The figure on the right shows what the  Task Force considered, and the parallel can  be made to the ISO/IEC 27035-1 (which is  still a draft document, to date):  - Plan and prepare: establish an information security incident management policy, form  Incident Response Team etc.  - Detection and reporting: someone has to spot and report “events” that might be or turn  into incidents;  - Assessment and decision: someone must assess the situation to determine whether it is in  fact an incident;  - Responses: contain, eradicate, recover from and forensically analyse the incident, where  appropriate;  - Lessons learnt: make systematic improvements to the organisation’s management of  information security risks as a consequence of incidents experienced.  Taken individually, these steps make sense at an organisation level. However, when the dimension is  cross-organisations, cross borders, the need for a coordination mechanism arises and other  compensating controls also need to happen.  As devised in the initial Work Objectives document, the disastrous events, and many incidents are  global and cannot be addressed using a silo approach, and cooperation is more efficient when  1  https://www.ovh.com/fr/espace-  presse/cp1028.ovhcom_obtient_la_certification_isoiec_27001_pour_la_fourniture_et_lexploitation_dinfrastr  uctures_dediees_de_cloud_computing  2  http://news.o2.co.uk/?press-release=telefonica-uk-safe-as-houses-with-iso-27001-achievement  3  http://www.telecomitalia.com/tit/en/sustainability/our-approach/indexes-ratings/certifications.html  4  http://www.telekom.com/corporate-responsibility/data-protection/65336  Incident  detection and  recording  Classification  and initial  support  Investigation  and diagnosis  Resolution and  recovery  Incident  closure  Incident  ownership,  monitoring,  tracking and  communicatio n  Establish  incident  framework  management  Evaluation of  incident  framework  management  https://www.ovh.com/fr/espace-presse/cp1028.ovhcom_obtient_la_certification_isoiec_27001_pour_la_fourniture_et_lexploitation_dinfrastructures_dediees_de_cloud_computing https://www.ovh.com/fr/espace-presse/cp1028.ovhcom_obtient_la_certification_isoiec_27001_pour_la_fourniture_et_lexploitation_dinfrastructures_dediees_de_cloud_computing https://www.ovh.com/fr/espace-presse/cp1028.ovhcom_obtient_la_certification_isoiec_27001_pour_la_fourniture_et_lexploitation_dinfrastructures_dediees_de_cloud_computing http://news.o2.co.uk/?press-release=telefonica-uk-safe-as-houses-with-iso-27001-achievement http://www.telecomitalia.com/tit/en/sustainability/our-approach/indexes-ratings/certifications.html http://www.telekom.com/corporate-responsibility/data-protection/65336  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 3  properly planned. Responses also need to be coordinated and the most obvious cases have to be at  least foreseen.  In the essence of time and work efficiency, the Task Force has decided to demonstrate by example  the issues that must be resolved for quick recovery when the disaster or the incident is global.  The scope for each case Study was limited to “Black Swan” events, rare in likelihood but leading to a  disastrous impact.  Target audience  This document addresses concerns that should draw the attention of Telecom Operators, ISPs, IXPs,  Datacentre Operators, and most specifically their Decision Makers. CISOs, Business Continuity  Managers, Risk Managers are the primary Audience of this report; however the Senior Experts from  the Public Sector and Public Decision Makers also should be aware of the high-level  recommendations.  Structure of this document  Three case studies were assessed:  - Case Study 1: Natural Disaster involving 3 countries and 5 major Telecom Operators (CII  owners)  - Case Study 2: Loss of communication for Health and Finance sector  - Case Study 3: Technologic Implementation causing failure with Domino effect to competitors  The approach was to assess broadly the possible impact, and identify a number of specific measures  to support faster recovery.  The ITIL and ISO terminology definitions of Incident management were used as a foundation for the  overall discussions5.  The Task Force proposed to perform the analysis from an empirical viewpoint and therefore  requested ENISA to propose 3 Case Studies which could be used as the starting point for the  brainstorming sessions of the Task Force.  The process was to determine important lessons learnt by sharing Task Force members’ experiences.  These lessons learnt were then used to derive key measures.  5  http://www.iso27001security.com/html/27035.html  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 4  The Task Force considered this process as a progressive one, possibly involving several iterations to  reach a better level of detail with time and experience.  Although for the purpose of this report, the process only involved a single iteration, the iterative  process should be pursued and recommendations could be refined and adapted.  The Task Force used case studies to identify a number of possible black-swan events (which have low  probability, and high impact, e.g. 9/11 in the United States).  The initial scope covered the following topics:   Natural Disasters;   Global Power Outage;   Technological deployment cascaded failure,  and chain of events.  These case studies were not meant to be limitative,  and pave the way to draw conclusions in other areas.  The logic observed for large-scale incident response  might reasonably be similar in most situations, and  therefore, this report makes recommendations that  are generic enough to allow use in a variety of  circumstances.

Initial assessment shows that there are many casualties; First Emergency Responders (FERs) rely on  dogs to find them in the debris. Some CIIs sites are no longer accessible.  2.1.2 Impact Analysis  A natural disaster such as an earthquake or large forest fire may require that communications  continuity is ensured, or restored in the shortest delay.  All Natural Disasters will not present the same characteristics, but from a telecommunications point  of view, the depending actions should be very similar, provided that the road access is at least  cleared to the damaged area.  The Task Force perceived that communications between the Public and First Emergency Responders  (FER) are crucial, but there is also a need for the Public to be able to contact their relatives, or  coordinate their evacuation of the accident. Such communications traffic is unlikely however to be  routed properly if the Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs) are damaged or destroyed.  This raises immediately the question of a priority calling scheme to ensure that every call from the  accident zone is appropriately routed and reaches its destination. (see recommendation 201304).  A number of gaps were noted:  - For large events, no supra-National coordination mechanism exists; (see recommendation  TF-MASIM-201301)  - Procedures are not established a priori along with affected public emergency co-ordination  authorities to declare and manage the crisis; (see recommendation TF-MASIM-201301 and  02)  - Congestions will occur due to significant incoming traffic to the affected areas; (see  recommendation TF-MASIM-201304)  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 7  - Prioritisation of resumption of the communications of other critical infrastructures (power,  transportation, financial, etc.) (such a recommendation could arise from TF-MASIM-201301,  when the Expert group defines which Authority takes the lead and how it is determined);  - Critical nodes that may lack local generators need to be properly inventoried and this  information shared; (see recommendation TF-MASIM-201301 and 02)  - Key nodes and ISP providers have local generators, but their fuel stock capacity may not  allow the maintenance of generators running in the long term; (see recommendation TF-  MASIM-201301 and 02)  - Specific risk analysis is not extensively carried out over environmental conditions of the local  generators and oil tanks in those facilities having critical nodes of communications; (see  recommendation TF-MASIM-201301)  - Very careful assessment of the switching operations between power -> batteries ->  generators and vice-versa to avoid glitches that can harm the equipment and cause even  worse impact. (see recommendation TF-MASIM-201301)  2.1.3 Mitigations  The Task Force identified some possible solutions to these issues. The list of these mitigations is not  exhaustive, but provides already a number of key points to consider. Most of the recommendations  could arise from the procedures decided by the Expert Group recommended in TF-MASIM-201301.  Alternative communications for FERs must not depend on affected infrastructure. i.e.  Tetra/Tetrapol doesn’t rely on the same infrastructures as commercial services;  - Policies for cross-border traffic prioritization should be developed and tested; (see  recommendation TF-MASIM-201304)  - Emergency satellite communications terminals shared among several countries can be  moved quickly to the affected areas by FERs to support the resuming of basic services;  - Voice and data service need to be provided to the Public. They could be supported by mobile  modules (containers) that can be linked by means of satellite or radio;  - Ad-hoc networks which do not depend on fixed infrastructure should be deployed;  - Sharing of Materials (e.g. Mobile generators shared among several countries) can be moved  quickly to those affected nodes or switching offices that doesn’t have local generators;  - Management of Critical spare parts (for the power grid, some should be available for a  period of time that will be in accordance with the requirements of the logistics of the critical  nodes generators);  - Improve Public access to backup solutions (e.g. public charging batteries points for mobile  phones and computers scattered in the cities).  While most of these measures may exist at National level, there might be significant differences  from one Member State to another. The cross border dimension is rarely taken into account but  could help save lives: for example, the transport of emergency telecom equipment to an affected  region may be faster if this equipment is geographically closer but in a neighbour country.  Cooperation costs could be settled at a later stage.  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 8  2.2 Case Study 2: Loss of communication for dependent Critical Sectors, e.g.  Finance sector  2.2.1 Description  A major power outage happens in Germany impacting areas in France, Luxembourg, Belgium and  Netherlands:  - Telecom Operators located in these countries have lost connectivity  - Several major Internet nodes are impacted;  - The Finance sector is impacted with delays in the processing of hundreds of thousands  financial transactions;  - No victims directly due to power loss.  2.2.2 Impact Analysis  Cross border coordination in catastrophic situations at the pan-European level is missing and may  heavily impact Critical Finance Infrastructures through communication failures. Currently, the crisis  may see regulators acting more locally without collaborating in studying cross-border implications of  catastrophes. New players in financial markets bring also new risks.  These new players (e.g. cloud service providers) result in a significant value shift from traditional  banks to technological providers, so called “processors”, and a value share between banks and  intermediaries. Technological openness additionally entails more intense competition with the risk  that adequate security measures are neglected in order to benefit from easy and cheap alternatives.  A more diversified banking and financial ecosystem with more players becomes a more fragmented  systems with additional failures and incidents.  The needs may largely differ between banks and their customers, for instance, Banks are looking for  a seamless provision of liquidities, while Bank customers are looking for 100% available and  seamless end-to-end trade procedures as well as finality of transactions.  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 9  The transaction chain is executed via a number of “nodes”:  Each one of these nodes relies entirely on electricity to operate. LAN, WAN gateways rely on  electronic communications infrastructures, whether public or dedicated (privately leased).  Also, large customers were, at last, given access to interbank exchange systems like SWIFT, while  medium- or small-size companies rely now also on Internet-based e-banking services, via their bank  or via payment processors.  2.2.3 Possible Mitigations  In response to the on-going trends, several infrastructures were put in place or modernised already.  Also, Banks and their supply chain have established service contracts or service level agreements  (SLAs).  For Banks, Incident Preparedness in their ICT Supply Chain is mostly achieved through their  “Business Continuity Plans”.  For the European Central Bank (ECB) draft glossary, “Business Continuity” consists of “arrangements  aimed at ensuring that a system meets agreed service levels, even if one or more components of the  system fail or if it is affected by an abnormal event.”  In the financial sector, one of the leading authorities has been the Joint Forum, a group of IT Experts  from Central banks worldwide, who are focussing on prevention and protection issues in the banking  sector.

EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 10  Dealing with business continuity will lead to activities that can progress along the following steps:  Regarding Business Continuity, MiFID obliges banks and other investment institutions to establish,  implement and maintain a business continuity policy to ensure continuity of investment services in  the case of an interruption of its systems and procedures. The major milestone reached by MiFID is  the increasing importance of “a good practice” to a regulatory requirement that compliance  responsibilities fall on the Board.  In parallel with that regulatory framework, several business continuity related security criteria, good  practices and international standards have been issued (See the “Standards” section in the  “References” chapter).  Mostly, for the Finance Sector, the reliance on ICT means also that unless the ICT providers are  generally of poor reliability, their approach is currently to establish SLAs and no further compensate  for a loss of connectivity.  In most cases, the “Management of the Incident” implies here that a critical Sector depending on ICT  (and therefore on Energy) can only improve its preparedness to incidents, and consider appropriate  Business Continuity measures to keep Operations running in Autonomy where possible.  2.3 Case Study 3: Technologic Implementation causing failure with Domino  effect to competitors  2.3.1 Description  A major technological implementation fails and leads to a cascaded failure and later on, a large-scale  outage, which impacts several millions of Users. Mobile Communications are mostly impacted;  emergency services cannot be reached from GSM Networks.  There is no fallback scenario: no National Roaming is in place, Telecom operators have sometimes to  intervene on sites to re-establish operations.  2.3.2 Impact Analysis  As mobile telecommunication networks are extremely complex systems comprising of thousands of  service nodes of several different types, interfaced by diverse control protocols via hundreds of data  elements, it is difficult to predict all the cascading effects of a single node failure. This cascading  effect is made possible due to the relationships (also called dependencies) between the various  components within the mobile telecommunication network. Cascading attacks are so named  because local effects of corrupt data items propagates or cascades to data items on remote service  Outlining  the  business  continuity  strategy  Developing  the  business  continuity  plan  Managing  problems  when they  occur  Returning  to normal  operation  after a  problem  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 11  nodes through vehicles such as signalling messages, cached data items, and shared databases. When  the cascade attack is originated outside of the 3G networks, i.e. the Internet as a launching pad, we  refer it as a \"cross infrastructure cyber-attack\".  The impact of such attacks, among others, can lead to a Denial of Service or Interruption of the  Service. In the case of Denial of the Service, the issue causes an overload or a disruption in the  system such that network functions in an abnormal manner. The abnormal behaviour could be  legitimate subscribers not receiving some of the services, illegitimate subscribers receiving services  or even the entire network may be disabled as a result of the attack. In the Interruption scenario the  issue causes an interruption by destroying resources, for example, the adversary may delete  signalling messages, mislead or delete subscriber data in the entity such as a Home Location Register  (HLR)6.  2.3.3 Possible Mitigations  A vulnerability assessment toolkit should be used to be able to predict, not only all the diverse  cascading effects of corruption but also detect the vulnerabilities that may be exploited to launch  the attack.  Apply attack-graph technologies specifically designed to handle 3G semantics i.e. dependencies, and  infection propagation rules. An attack graph is a diagrammatic representation of an attack on a real  system. It shows the various ways an adversary may use to break-in to a system or cause corruption,  and the various ways in which the corruption may propagate to remote parts of the network. Attack  graphs are typically produced manually by “red teams”, and used by system administrators for  protection. Model checking is a major technique for automatic attack graph generation. Logic-  programming methods can be used for scalable network vulnerability analysis in terms of properties  such as survivability, reliability, etc.  Standard network equipment configurations must be maintained centrally and audited daily. When  needed, configuration updates go through a rigorous control change process, and then are  downloaded from the Network Operations Center (NOC) at the company’s headquarters. These  controls reduce the need for manual configuration of routers, switches, and other network  elements, and lower the associated risk of error.  Mutual Aid Assistance is also considered as mitigation for this case.  A possible response lies in a few pragmatic steps:  - The use of multivendor technologies as well as the design of a compartmented network,  either by regions or services, can help in quickly diagnosing, and avoiding the spread of the  problem.  6  http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:GSM_reseau.png  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Location_Register#Home_location_register_.28HLR.29  http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:GSM_reseau.png http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Location_Register#Home_location_register_.28HLR.29  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 12  - The application of specific Contingency Planning Procedures as part of Business Continuity  Plan.

These mechanisms proposed are  reported in the “recommendations” section,  could allow addressing a number of the issues  noted in the Case Studies.  The Task Force felt that a dedicated horizontal organisation was missing, and considering the extent  of the topics covered, its mission could last on the long term. Such a group does not need to be an  initiative driven by the Public Sector: it could instead be volunteered and committed by Telecom  Operators, organised in a Peer-to-Peer mode and self-committed to adopt relevant procedures and  standards. The engagement of Public Sector would allow the implementation or adaptation of  regulations where necessary. Furthermore, the  Public Sectors’ role would be to encourage the  participation in such a pan-European group, and  ensure that such information sharing cannot be  seen as “anti-monopoly” type of agreement  (which is usually forbidden and prosecuted).  All case studies and analyses converge to  concluding that there is a strong urge to  promote and facilitate pan-European  cooperation on ICT Security matters in all CIIP-  dependent sectors.  Those conclusions of the case studies intervene  at several different levels, but have a number of  common characteristics:   They require a top-down implementation;   They depend heavily on an Information Sharing platform;   There must be a commitment to implement measures in a coordinated way;   There must be a way to ensure the proper implementation of the measures.

The  recommendations typically address each of the  three domains identified in the initial scope  (Information Sharing, Mutual Aid, Technology  Convergence & Interoperability) and fit globally  within the Expert Group that is the first  recommendation of the Task Force, as a  horizontal condition.  This report therefore raises first a number of  important recommendations to consider as a  priority:  - Systematic and Compulsory Information  Sharing for Incident Preparedness needs  to be established, such as:   Incident Response Procedures vis-  à-vis the external world;   Key Emergency Contacts of ICT-  sector public and private actors  details shared among all key  actors and maintained up to date  at European level;   Roles and Responsibilities of all  actors (after being defined);  - Incident Information needs to be  collected and analysed to rationalise  prevention costs;  - For medium sized incidents, a lighter  process such as Mutual-Aid mechanism  could be promoted in a cross-border de-  regulated bubble (with finite timeframe of operation).  These recommendations are further developed below.

A top-down approach is recommended: Senior Executives and Public Decision makers should initiate  the commitment and define clear objectives.  The key objective is the pursuit of faster recovery and the avoidance of the Tail-Event Syndrome7 i.e.  which is only reacting after the incident happens, lacking preparedness, and not being able to  manage events timely.  The core mission of this Expert Group should be to address all Incident Preparedness Prerequisites  that need to be dealt with horizontally, with a cross-border dimension.  Initially, the following actions were considered and recommended by the Task Force:  - Engage and commit Key European ICT Stakeholders in discussions;  - Establish Operational Pan-European Incident Response Procedures;  - Implement an Information Sharing Platform for Incidents Early Warning;  - Establish and share centrally Procedures, and Key Responsible Contact Details;  - Plan the Exercising of these functions.  At a later stage, the Expert Group could deal with more complex issues, after issuing a detailed  roadmap. Some tasks are crucial in this approach, such as ensuring Actors’ self-commitment to  implement them, coordinating and harmonising National Contingency Plans, defining guidelines for  establishing Business Continuity Plans, harmonising Incident Detection measures, promoting the  establishment of Mutual Assistance agreements, etc.  Such an Expert Group membership should be composed of representatives of:  - European telecom operators;  - European NRAs;  - CERTs;  - European Commission.  7  MARIE Phase I report: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-  services/mutual-aid-assistance  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 16  3.2 EP3R-TF-MASIM 201302 – Implement a RSS-syndication type of platform  for sharing Incidents Preparedness procedures, Early Warnings, and  Contact details  The Task Force highlighted the need for a private initiative for Telecom Operators and CII  Stakeholders to implement a systematic sharing of information. Currently, Telecom Operators  generally consider the sharing of information as potentially damageable to competition, and in some  cases (e.g. for the set of prices), such an exchange could be considered illegal and a jeopardy of  competition rules.  The sharing of technical incidents data should however not be considered as hindering anti-  monopoly rules, on the contrary: such a sharing of information would benefit immediately the  Citizens since Incident Preparedness allows a much faster recovery.  The data that should be shared potentially relates to:  - Incident Preparedness Procedures;  - Cooperation Details (Mutual Aid Assistance Agreements);  - Emergency Response Procedures;  - Emergency Contact Details;  - Incident Early Warning.  This platform could implement the Functional, Management requirements and recommendations of  the EP3R Task Force on Trusted Information Sharing, and allow a closed community of Telecom  Operators’ representatives, Security Officers, Network Managers, IT Production Managers, Business  Continuity Coordinators and Managers to share IT Security and Risk Management relevant  information.  A syndication mechanism could also technically implement a distribution of information updates to  all members via a pseudo-push mechanism, and therefore spread changes easily to avoid obsolete  records stored at local sites. Such a centralised system could be of great value to Telecom Operators,  and was actually proposed by one major European Telecom Operator during the Task Forces  discussions.  3.3 EP3R-TF-MASIM 201303 - Establish a Favourable pan-European  environment for Mutual Aid Assistance  Mutual-Aid Assistance was perceived within the Task Force as a “Quick-Win”.  Such framework is easy to establish, could allow an initiation of regular contacts between ICT  Stakeholders and later develop cooperation on larger assignments.  The key recommendations from the Task Force are to:  - Promote the use of Mutual Aid Assistance (MAA) across Europe;  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 17  - Develop a MAA template / catalogue where possible topics are listed (and therefore not  forgotten);  - Ensure MAAs are endorsed, supported and promoted by Public Authorities and Regulators.  The MARIE Phase II report also lists a number of more specific requirements and recommended  approach8 that the Task Force endorses fully.  3.4 EP3R-TF-MASIM 201304 - Policies for cross-border traffic prioritisation  should be developed and tested  On the technological side, the Task Force noted that one of the most important technological issues  in Europe concerns the dismissal of Priority Calling Scheme when calls are routed cross border (and  in some cases between operators). The ENISA Report on National Roaming9 also recommends traffic  prioritisation at national level (and also favours Mutual Aid Agreements). This recommendation adds  the cross border dimension.  Compared to Foreign Continents/Countries 10 , a disaster involving several countries may be  extremely complex to resolve, and since such a scheme is not in place, the odds that important  communications reach the First Emergency Responders is decreased and possibly fully  compromised.  8https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/mutual-aid-assistance  9http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/national-roaming-for-resilience  10 http://transition.fcc.gov/pshs/techtopics/techtopics18.html  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/mutual-aid-assistance http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/national-roaming-for-resilience http://transition.fcc.gov/pshs/techtopics/techtopics18.html  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 18  4 Conclusion  Improving Incident preparedness at pan-European level implies that a global cross-border dialogue  emerges in Europe and that every key actor actually engages and commits to an implementation  roadmap.  The overall process could be driven top-down by the European Commission, but it is more likely that  a Peer-to-Peer approach based on Self Commitment works better: indeed, the incentives are mainly  financial, since they tend to reduce recovery time for ICT Operators.  The Expert Group should develop a portfolio of Strategic, Governance, and Technical tools which will  improve cross-border incident preparedness. Such platform for effective Information Sharing,  Mutual Aid Assistance, and allow proper Technological Interoperability.  Formalising such a partnership will however require solutions to a number of challenges and  barriers, for instance:  - Regulatory fragmentation preventing effecting cross-border information sharing on Security  and Resilience topics;  - Non-Disclosure Agreements, to ensure Security and Preparedness matters are never  considered a competitive advantage;  - Ensure Information Sharing cross border is not considered illegal or Competitive pre-  agreement (which is against anti-monopoly rules);  In some cases, the solutions recommended will also require operational capabilities, which should  be the responsibility of a neutral body or institution. The solutions should then be then envisaged in  a pragmatic way. Possibly, the European Commission may be the most appropriate Authority to  solve certain issues together with Member States, but the needs will lead to raising  recommendations where appropriate.

The task assigned to this Task Force was to reflect on the potential issues found when a large scale  incident (Cyber, Natural Disasters, etc.) affects the Critical Information Infrastructures in a region  across one or several borders.  While many aspects can be recovered from without the help of a neighbour country, some actually  require external assistance, and therefore cooperation terms can be prepared in advance to plan for  those conditions of intervention properly.  Also, the Task Force felt that systematic cooperation on incident preparedness would allow a much  faster recovery, particularly for ‘black swan’ events, i.e. events that have a low probability but  generate an extremely large impact.  Some agreements have been established, but they are mostly ad-hoc. The preparedness process  could benefit from a higher level of maturity of its cross-border dimension in Europe.  Compared to other continents, Europe still faces significant barriers:  - Cooperation between counterparts in neighbour countries is ad-hoc;  - National Regulations demonstrate several differences;  - Private Sector operates mostly in Silos;  - Mutual Aid Assistance could allow a much shorter Time to Recovery, and a more  mature approach to Incident recovery.  The Task Force reflected on three different scenarios and identified a number of gaps.  This Task Force was composed of Public and Private Sector Experts who all contributed their  observations in the course of 2013.  The major conclusions are the following:  - A ‘Incident Preparedness and Coordination Expert Group’ should pave the way to an  improved cooperation in the Telecom Sector;  - A RSS-syndication type of platform for sharing Incidents Preparedness procedures,  Early Warnings, and Contact details should be designed and used;  - The pan-European environment for Mutual Aid Assistance should be enhanced  significantly by removing any relevant regulatory barriers;  - Policies for cross-border traffic prioritisation should be developed and tested.

Goal  While most of these conclusions might be well known already, this position paper will at least help  to inventory them and further support the development of a course of action.  Scope of the Work  The Task Force observed initially that “Incident Management” is a broad concept that encompasses  a number of very different activities.  ITIL (v3) terminology defines an incident as an unplanned interruption to an IT Service or a reduction  in the Quality of an IT Service. Failure of a Configuration Item that has not yet impacted Service is  also an Incident.  ISO 20000 defines an incident (part 1, 2.7) as any event that is not part of the standard operation of  a service and which causes or may cause an interruption to, or a reduction in, the quality of that  service.  Detection  • Causes  • Actors  Response  • Actions  • Coordination  Recovery  • Measures  • Post Mortem  Transversal  •Data Exchange (CVRF)  •Communication  •Preparedness Procedures Sharing  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 2  Generally, the process of Incident  Management is composed of a number of  activities (see figure on the right).  It is generally reported that Incident  Management in the ITIL and ISO sense of  the term are well managed within each  Telecom Operators’ boundaries1, 2, 3, 4. The  issue specific to Europe is indeed cross-  border, cross-companies Incident  Management.  The figure on the right shows what the  Task Force considered, and the parallel can  be made to the ISO/IEC 27035-1 (which is  still a draft document, to date):  - Plan and prepare: establish an information security incident management policy, form  Incident Response Team etc.  - Detection and reporting: someone has to spot and report “events” that might be or turn  into incidents;  - Assessment and decision: someone must assess the situation to determine whether it is in  fact an incident;  - Responses: contain, eradicate, recover from and forensically analyse the incident, where  appropriate;  - Lessons learnt: make systematic improvements to the organisation’s management of  information security risks as a consequence of incidents experienced.  Taken individually, these steps make sense at an organisation level. However, when the dimension is  cross-organisations, cross borders, the need for a coordination mechanism arises and other  compensating controls also need to happen.  As devised in the initial Work Objectives document, the disastrous events, and many incidents are  global and cannot be addressed using a silo approach, and cooperation is more efficient when  1  https://www.ovh.com/fr/espace-  presse/cp1028.ovhcom_obtient_la_certification_isoiec_27001_pour_la_fourniture_et_lexploitation_dinfrastr  uctures_dediees_de_cloud_computing  2  http://news.o2.co.uk/?press-release=telefonica-uk-safe-as-houses-with-iso-27001-achievement  3  http://www.telecomitalia.com/tit/en/sustainability/our-approach/indexes-ratings/certifications.html  4  http://www.telekom.com/corporate-responsibility/data-protection/65336  Incident  detection and  recording  Classification  and initial  support  Investigation  and diagnosis  Resolution and  recovery  Incident  closure  Incident  ownership,  monitoring,  tracking and  communicatio n  Establish  incident  framework  management  Evaluation of  incident  framework  management  https://www.ovh.com/fr/espace-presse/cp1028.ovhcom_obtient_la_certification_isoiec_27001_pour_la_fourniture_et_lexploitation_dinfrastructures_dediees_de_cloud_computing https://www.ovh.com/fr/espace-presse/cp1028.ovhcom_obtient_la_certification_isoiec_27001_pour_la_fourniture_et_lexploitation_dinfrastructures_dediees_de_cloud_computing https://www.ovh.com/fr/espace-presse/cp1028.ovhcom_obtient_la_certification_isoiec_27001_pour_la_fourniture_et_lexploitation_dinfrastructures_dediees_de_cloud_computing http://news.o2.co.uk/?press-release=telefonica-uk-safe-as-houses-with-iso-27001-achievement http://www.telecomitalia.com/tit/en/sustainability/our-approach/indexes-ratings/certifications.html http://www.telekom.com/corporate-responsibility/data-protection/65336  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 3  properly planned. Responses also need to be coordinated and the most obvious cases have to be at  least foreseen.  In the essence of time and work efficiency, the Task Force has decided to demonstrate by example  the issues that must be resolved for quick recovery when the disaster or the incident is global.  The scope for each case Study was limited to “Black Swan” events, rare in likelihood but leading to a  disastrous impact.  Target audience  This document addresses concerns that should draw the attention of Telecom Operators, ISPs, IXPs,  Datacentre Operators, and most specifically their Decision Makers. CISOs, Business Continuity  Managers, Risk Managers are the primary Audience of this report; however the Senior Experts from  the Public Sector and Public Decision Makers also should be aware of the high-level  recommendations.  Structure of this document  Three case studies were assessed:  - Case Study 1: Natural Disaster involving 3 countries and 5 major Telecom Operators (CII  owners)  - Case Study 2: Loss of communication for Health and Finance sector  - Case Study 3: Technologic Implementation causing failure with Domino effect to competitors  The approach was to assess broadly the possible impact, and identify a number of specific measures  to support faster recovery.  The ITIL and ISO terminology definitions of Incident management were used as a foundation for the  overall discussions5.  The Task Force proposed to perform the analysis from an empirical viewpoint and therefore  requested ENISA to propose 3 Case Studies which could be used as the starting point for the  brainstorming sessions of the Task Force.  The process was to determine important lessons learnt by sharing Task Force members’ experiences.  These lessons learnt were then used to derive key measures.  5  http://www.iso27001security.com/html/27035.html  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 4  The Task Force considered this process as a progressive one, possibly involving several iterations to  reach a better level of detail with time and experience.  Although for the purpose of this report, the process only involved a single iteration, the iterative  process should be pursued and recommendations could be refined and adapted.  The Task Force used case studies to identify a number of possible black-swan events (which have low  probability, and high impact, e.g. 9/11 in the United States).  The initial scope covered the following topics:   Natural Disasters;   Global Power Outage;   Technological deployment cascaded failure,  and chain of events.  These case studies were not meant to be limitative,  and pave the way to draw conclusions in other areas.  The logic observed for large-scale incident response  might reasonably be similar in most situations, and  therefore, this report makes recommendations that  are generic enough to allow use in a variety of  circumstances.

Initial assessment shows that there are many casualties; First Emergency Responders (FERs) rely on  dogs to find them in the debris. Some CIIs sites are no longer accessible.  2.1.2 Impact Analysis  A natural disaster such as an earthquake or large forest fire may require that communications  continuity is ensured, or restored in the shortest delay.  All Natural Disasters will not present the same characteristics, but from a telecommunications point  of view, the depending actions should be very similar, provided that the road access is at least  cleared to the damaged area.  The Task Force perceived that communications between the Public and First Emergency Responders  (FER) are crucial, but there is also a need for the Public to be able to contact their relatives, or  coordinate their evacuation of the accident. Such communications traffic is unlikely however to be  routed properly if the Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs) are damaged or destroyed.  This raises immediately the question of a priority calling scheme to ensure that every call from the  accident zone is appropriately routed and reaches its destination. (see recommendation 201304).  A number of gaps were noted:  - For large events, no supra-National coordination mechanism exists; (see recommendation  TF-MASIM-201301)  - Procedures are not established a priori along with affected public emergency co-ordination  authorities to declare and manage the crisis; (see recommendation TF-MASIM-201301 and  02)  - Congestions will occur due to significant incoming traffic to the affected areas; (see  recommendation TF-MASIM-201304)  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 7  - Prioritisation of resumption of the communications of other critical infrastructures (power,  transportation, financial, etc.) (such a recommendation could arise from TF-MASIM-201301,  when the Expert group defines which Authority takes the lead and how it is determined);  - Critical nodes that may lack local generators need to be properly inventoried and this  information shared; (see recommendation TF-MASIM-201301 and 02)  - Key nodes and ISP providers have local generators, but their fuel stock capacity may not  allow the maintenance of generators running in the long term; (see recommendation TF-  MASIM-201301 and 02)  - Specific risk analysis is not extensively carried out over environmental conditions of the local  generators and oil tanks in those facilities having critical nodes of communications; (see  recommendation TF-MASIM-201301)  - Very careful assessment of the switching operations between power -> batteries ->  generators and vice-versa to avoid glitches that can harm the equipment and cause even  worse impact. (see recommendation TF-MASIM-201301)  2.1.3 Mitigations  The Task Force identified some possible solutions to these issues. The list of these mitigations is not  exhaustive, but provides already a number of key points to consider. Most of the recommendations  could arise from the procedures decided by the Expert Group recommended in TF-MASIM-201301.  Alternative communications for FERs must not depend on affected infrastructure. i.e.  Tetra/Tetrapol doesn’t rely on the same infrastructures as commercial services;  - Policies for cross-border traffic prioritization should be developed and tested; (see  recommendation TF-MASIM-201304)  - Emergency satellite communications terminals shared among several countries can be  moved quickly to the affected areas by FERs to support the resuming of basic services;  - Voice and data service need to be provided to the Public. They could be supported by mobile  modules (containers) that can be linked by means of satellite or radio;  - Ad-hoc networks which do not depend on fixed infrastructure should be deployed;  - Sharing of Materials (e.g. Mobile generators shared among several countries) can be moved  quickly to those affected nodes or switching offices that doesn’t have local generators;  - Management of Critical spare parts (for the power grid, some should be available for a  period of time that will be in accordance with the requirements of the logistics of the critical  nodes generators);  - Improve Public access to backup solutions (e.g. public charging batteries points for mobile  phones and computers scattered in the cities).  While most of these measures may exist at National level, there might be significant differences  from one Member State to another. The cross border dimension is rarely taken into account but  could help save lives: for example, the transport of emergency telecom equipment to an affected  region may be faster if this equipment is geographically closer but in a neighbour country.  Cooperation costs could be settled at a later stage.  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 8  2.2 Case Study 2: Loss of communication for dependent Critical Sectors, e.g.  Finance sector  2.2.1 Description  A major power outage happens in Germany impacting areas in France, Luxembourg, Belgium and  Netherlands:  - Telecom Operators located in these countries have lost connectivity  - Several major Internet nodes are impacted;  - The Finance sector is impacted with delays in the processing of hundreds of thousands  financial transactions;  - No victims directly due to power loss.  2.2.2 Impact Analysis  Cross border coordination in catastrophic situations at the pan-European level is missing and may  heavily impact Critical Finance Infrastructures through communication failures. Currently, the crisis  may see regulators acting more locally without collaborating in studying cross-border implications of  catastrophes. New players in financial markets bring also new risks.  These new players (e.g. cloud service providers) result in a significant value shift from traditional  banks to technological providers, so called “processors”, and a value share between banks and  intermediaries. Technological openness additionally entails more intense competition with the risk  that adequate security measures are neglected in order to benefit from easy and cheap alternatives.  A more diversified banking and financial ecosystem with more players becomes a more fragmented  systems with additional failures and incidents.  The needs may largely differ between banks and their customers, for instance, Banks are looking for  a seamless provision of liquidities, while Bank customers are looking for 100% available and  seamless end-to-end trade procedures as well as finality of transactions.  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 9  The transaction chain is executed via a number of “nodes”:  Each one of these nodes relies entirely on electricity to operate. LAN, WAN gateways rely on  electronic communications infrastructures, whether public or dedicated (privately leased).  Also, large customers were, at last, given access to interbank exchange systems like SWIFT, while  medium- or small-size companies rely now also on Internet-based e-banking services, via their bank  or via payment processors.  2.2.3 Possible Mitigations  In response to the on-going trends, several infrastructures were put in place or modernised already.  Also, Banks and their supply chain have established service contracts or service level agreements  (SLAs).  For Banks, Incident Preparedness in their ICT Supply Chain is mostly achieved through their  “Business Continuity Plans”.  For the European Central Bank (ECB) draft glossary, “Business Continuity” consists of “arrangements  aimed at ensuring that a system meets agreed service levels, even if one or more components of the  system fail or if it is affected by an abnormal event.”  In the financial sector, one of the leading authorities has been the Joint Forum, a group of IT Experts  from Central banks worldwide, who are focussing on prevention and protection issues in the banking  sector.

EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 10  Dealing with business continuity will lead to activities that can progress along the following steps:  Regarding Business Continuity, MiFID obliges banks and other investment institutions to establish,  implement and maintain a business continuity policy to ensure continuity of investment services in  the case of an interruption of its systems and procedures. The major milestone reached by MiFID is  the increasing importance of “a good practice” to a regulatory requirement that compliance  responsibilities fall on the Board.  In parallel with that regulatory framework, several business continuity related security criteria, good  practices and international standards have been issued (See the “Standards” section in the  “References” chapter).  Mostly, for the Finance Sector, the reliance on ICT means also that unless the ICT providers are  generally of poor reliability, their approach is currently to establish SLAs and no further compensate  for a loss of connectivity.  In most cases, the “Management of the Incident” implies here that a critical Sector depending on ICT  (and therefore on Energy) can only improve its preparedness to incidents, and consider appropriate  Business Continuity measures to keep Operations running in Autonomy where possible.  2.3 Case Study 3: Technologic Implementation causing failure with Domino  effect to competitors  2.3.1 Description  A major technological implementation fails and leads to a cascaded failure and later on, a large-scale  outage, which impacts several millions of Users. Mobile Communications are mostly impacted;  emergency services cannot be reached from GSM Networks.  There is no fallback scenario: no National Roaming is in place, Telecom operators have sometimes to  intervene on sites to re-establish operations.  2.3.2 Impact Analysis  As mobile telecommunication networks are extremely complex systems comprising of thousands of  service nodes of several different types, interfaced by diverse control protocols via hundreds of data  elements, it is difficult to predict all the cascading effects of a single node failure. This cascading  effect is made possible due to the relationships (also called dependencies) between the various  components within the mobile telecommunication network. Cascading attacks are so named  because local effects of corrupt data items propagates or cascades to data items on remote service  Outlining  the  business  continuity  strategy  Developing  the  business  continuity  plan  Managing  problems  when they  occur  Returning  to normal  operation  after a  problem  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 11  nodes through vehicles such as signalling messages, cached data items, and shared databases. When  the cascade attack is originated outside of the 3G networks, i.e. the Internet as a launching pad, we  refer it as a \"cross infrastructure cyber-attack\".  The impact of such attacks, among others, can lead to a Denial of Service or Interruption of the  Service. In the case of Denial of the Service, the issue causes an overload or a disruption in the  system such that network functions in an abnormal manner. The abnormal behaviour could be  legitimate subscribers not receiving some of the services, illegitimate subscribers receiving services  or even the entire network may be disabled as a result of the attack. In the Interruption scenario the  issue causes an interruption by destroying resources, for example, the adversary may delete  signalling messages, mislead or delete subscriber data in the entity such as a Home Location Register  (HLR)6.  2.3.3 Possible Mitigations  A vulnerability assessment toolkit should be used to be able to predict, not only all the diverse  cascading effects of corruption but also detect the vulnerabilities that may be exploited to launch  the attack.  Apply attack-graph technologies specifically designed to handle 3G semantics i.e. dependencies, and  infection propagation rules. An attack graph is a diagrammatic representation of an attack on a real  system. It shows the various ways an adversary may use to break-in to a system or cause corruption,  and the various ways in which the corruption may propagate to remote parts of the network. Attack  graphs are typically produced manually by “red teams”, and used by system administrators for  protection. Model checking is a major technique for automatic attack graph generation. Logic-  programming methods can be used for scalable network vulnerability analysis in terms of properties  such as survivability, reliability, etc.  Standard network equipment configurations must be maintained centrally and audited daily. When  needed, configuration updates go through a rigorous control change process, and then are  downloaded from the Network Operations Center (NOC) at the company’s headquarters. These  controls reduce the need for manual configuration of routers, switches, and other network  elements, and lower the associated risk of error.  Mutual Aid Assistance is also considered as mitigation for this case.  A possible response lies in a few pragmatic steps:  - The use of multivendor technologies as well as the design of a compartmented network,  either by regions or services, can help in quickly diagnosing, and avoiding the spread of the  problem.  6  http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:GSM_reseau.png  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Location_Register#Home_location_register_.28HLR.29  http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:GSM_reseau.png http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Location_Register#Home_location_register_.28HLR.29  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 12  - The application of specific Contingency Planning Procedures as part of Business Continuity  Plan.

These mechanisms proposed are  reported in the “recommendations” section,  could allow addressing a number of the issues  noted in the Case Studies.  The Task Force felt that a dedicated horizontal organisation was missing, and considering the extent  of the topics covered, its mission could last on the long term. Such a group does not need to be an  initiative driven by the Public Sector: it could instead be volunteered and committed by Telecom  Operators, organised in a Peer-to-Peer mode and self-committed to adopt relevant procedures and  standards. The engagement of Public Sector would allow the implementation or adaptation of  regulations where necessary. Furthermore, the  Public Sectors’ role would be to encourage the  participation in such a pan-European group, and  ensure that such information sharing cannot be  seen as “anti-monopoly” type of agreement  (which is usually forbidden and prosecuted).  All case studies and analyses converge to  concluding that there is a strong urge to  promote and facilitate pan-European  cooperation on ICT Security matters in all CIIP-  dependent sectors.  Those conclusions of the case studies intervene  at several different levels, but have a number of  common characteristics:   They require a top-down implementation;   They depend heavily on an Information Sharing platform;   There must be a commitment to implement measures in a coordinated way;   There must be a way to ensure the proper implementation of the measures.

The  recommendations typically address each of the  three domains identified in the initial scope  (Information Sharing, Mutual Aid, Technology  Convergence & Interoperability) and fit globally  within the Expert Group that is the first  recommendation of the Task Force, as a  horizontal condition.  This report therefore raises first a number of  important recommendations to consider as a  priority:  - Systematic and Compulsory Information  Sharing for Incident Preparedness needs  to be established, such as:   Incident Response Procedures vis-  à-vis the external world;   Key Emergency Contacts of ICT-  sector public and private actors  details shared among all key  actors and maintained up to date  at European level;   Roles and Responsibilities of all  actors (after being defined);  - Incident Information needs to be  collected and analysed to rationalise  prevention costs;  - For medium sized incidents, a lighter  process such as Mutual-Aid mechanism  could be promoted in a cross-border de-  regulated bubble (with finite timeframe of operation).  These recommendations are further developed below.

A top-down approach is recommended: Senior Executives and Public Decision makers should initiate  the commitment and define clear objectives.  The key objective is the pursuit of faster recovery and the avoidance of the Tail-Event Syndrome7 i.e.  which is only reacting after the incident happens, lacking preparedness, and not being able to  manage events timely.  The core mission of this Expert Group should be to address all Incident Preparedness Prerequisites  that need to be dealt with horizontally, with a cross-border dimension.  Initially, the following actions were considered and recommended by the Task Force:  - Engage and commit Key European ICT Stakeholders in discussions;  - Establish Operational Pan-European Incident Response Procedures;  - Implement an Information Sharing Platform for Incidents Early Warning;  - Establish and share centrally Procedures, and Key Responsible Contact Details;  - Plan the Exercising of these functions.  At a later stage, the Expert Group could deal with more complex issues, after issuing a detailed  roadmap. Some tasks are crucial in this approach, such as ensuring Actors’ self-commitment to  implement them, coordinating and harmonising National Contingency Plans, defining guidelines for  establishing Business Continuity Plans, harmonising Incident Detection measures, promoting the  establishment of Mutual Assistance agreements, etc.  Such an Expert Group membership should be composed of representatives of:  - European telecom operators;  - European NRAs;  - CERTs;  - European Commission.  7  MARIE Phase I report: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-  services/mutual-aid-assistance  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 16  3.2 EP3R-TF-MASIM 201302 – Implement a RSS-syndication type of platform  for sharing Incidents Preparedness procedures, Early Warnings, and  Contact details  The Task Force highlighted the need for a private initiative for Telecom Operators and CII  Stakeholders to implement a systematic sharing of information. Currently, Telecom Operators  generally consider the sharing of information as potentially damageable to competition, and in some  cases (e.g. for the set of prices), such an exchange could be considered illegal and a jeopardy of  competition rules.  The sharing of technical incidents data should however not be considered as hindering anti-  monopoly rules, on the contrary: such a sharing of information would benefit immediately the  Citizens since Incident Preparedness allows a much faster recovery.  The data that should be shared potentially relates to:  - Incident Preparedness Procedures;  - Cooperation Details (Mutual Aid Assistance Agreements);  - Emergency Response Procedures;  - Emergency Contact Details;  - Incident Early Warning.  This platform could implement the Functional, Management requirements and recommendations of  the EP3R Task Force on Trusted Information Sharing, and allow a closed community of Telecom  Operators’ representatives, Security Officers, Network Managers, IT Production Managers, Business  Continuity Coordinators and Managers to share IT Security and Risk Management relevant  information.  A syndication mechanism could also technically implement a distribution of information updates to  all members via a pseudo-push mechanism, and therefore spread changes easily to avoid obsolete  records stored at local sites. Such a centralised system could be of great value to Telecom Operators,  and was actually proposed by one major European Telecom Operator during the Task Forces  discussions.  3.3 EP3R-TF-MASIM 201303 - Establish a Favourable pan-European  environment for Mutual Aid Assistance  Mutual-Aid Assistance was perceived within the Task Force as a “Quick-Win”.  Such framework is easy to establish, could allow an initiation of regular contacts between ICT  Stakeholders and later develop cooperation on larger assignments.  The key recommendations from the Task Force are to:  - Promote the use of Mutual Aid Assistance (MAA) across Europe;  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 17  - Develop a MAA template / catalogue where possible topics are listed (and therefore not  forgotten);  - Ensure MAAs are endorsed, supported and promoted by Public Authorities and Regulators.  The MARIE Phase II report also lists a number of more specific requirements and recommended  approach8 that the Task Force endorses fully.  3.4 EP3R-TF-MASIM 201304 - Policies for cross-border traffic prioritisation  should be developed and tested  On the technological side, the Task Force noted that one of the most important technological issues  in Europe concerns the dismissal of Priority Calling Scheme when calls are routed cross border (and  in some cases between operators). The ENISA Report on National Roaming9 also recommends traffic  prioritisation at national level (and also favours Mutual Aid Agreements). This recommendation adds  the cross border dimension.  Compared to Foreign Continents/Countries 10 , a disaster involving several countries may be  extremely complex to resolve, and since such a scheme is not in place, the odds that important  communications reach the First Emergency Responders is decreased and possibly fully  compromised.  8https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/mutual-aid-assistance  9http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/national-roaming-for-resilience  10 http://transition.fcc.gov/pshs/techtopics/techtopics18.html  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/mutual-aid-assistance http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/national-roaming-for-resilience http://transition.fcc.gov/pshs/techtopics/techtopics18.html  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Position Paper of the EP3R Task Forces on Incident Management and Mutual Aid  Strategies (TF-MASIM)  FINAL, 1.0, December 2013  Page 18  4 Conclusion  Improving Incident preparedness at pan-European level implies that a global cross-border dialogue  emerges in Europe and that every key actor actually engages and commits to an implementation  roadmap.  The overall process could be driven top-down by the European Commission, but it is more likely that  a Peer-to-Peer approach based on Self Commitment works better: indeed, the incentives are mainly  financial, since they tend to reduce recovery time for ICT Operators.  The Expert Group should develop a portfolio of Strategic, Governance, and Technical tools which will  improve cross-border incident preparedness. Such platform for effective Information Sharing,  Mutual Aid Assistance, and allow proper Technological Interoperability.  Formalising such a partnership will however require solutions to a number of challenges and  barriers, for instance:  - Regulatory fragmentation preventing effecting cross-border information sharing on Security  and Resilience topics;  - Non-Disclosure Agreements, to ensure Security and Preparedness matters are never  considered a competitive advantage;  - Ensure Information Sharing cross border is not considered illegal or Competitive pre-  agreement (which is against anti-monopoly rules);  In some cases, the solutions recommended will also require operational capabilities, which should  be the responsibility of a neutral body or institution. The solutions should then be then envisaged in  a pragmatic way. Possibly, the European Commission may be the most appropriate Authority to  solve certain issues together with Member States, but the needs will lead to raising  recommendations where appropriate.
